# WMT21 News Systems and Evaluations

This repository contains all primary submissions for the WMT21 news task, and the human evaluations.
The submissions are in the following directories

* `xml` : One xml file for each language pair, containing source, reference(s) and hypotheses
* `txt-ts` : Sources, references and hypotheses in text files, including test suites
* `txt` : Same, but without test suites

Tools for extracting the raw text from the XML can be found [here](https://github.com/wmt-conference/wmt-format-tools).

The human evaluations are in the `humaneval` directory.
