Why I left PDP.
Former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, has given some of the reasons why he left PDP for APC.
For those who may have forgotten, the former Speaker of House of Representative, Yakubu Dogara left PDP for APC this month.
Dogara stated that once he helped the PDP gain the Bauchi governor's seat at the 2019 general elections, he has been subjected to humiliations, causing him to leave the party for APC.
He primarily objects to the PDP's governing methods in Bauchi.
"Everybody knows I actively participated in the elections to help the former minister of Abuja, Bala Mohammed, defeat the incumbent governor, Mohammed Abubakar."
"But now, Bala's regime is toying with and insulting me."
I find it is better to leave the PDP to their own devices and go back to here I came from, than to stay on and suffer insult.
Dorara has submitted his letter of resignation from PDP to the party leader of his ward, Bogoro C in Bauchi.
Before resigning, he had not spared Bala and other party politicians his criticism and suggestions for improving their governing methods.
It is better to go and leave them alone.

Fire erupts at a Kano filling station.
The fire erupted at around 10 at night, which, despite all the efforts of Kano fire department, security personnel and townspeople, burned for nearly two hours.
When Freedom Radio reached the scene, it met with chaos. Varying security forces were swarming the area since the filling station is located next to a major motor park, tashar Kuka, where people are transported from Kano to other states and even to neighboring countries.
Also close by is the Kofar Ruwa market, which has become very popular in Northern Nigeria.
Freedom Radio spoke with eye witnesses who said that the inferno caused people to run for their lives.
A Kofar Ruwa park conductor described how they pitched in to help the Road Safety Officers in rescuing some passengers that panicked when they saw the fire.
Kano Fire Service spokesman Sa'idu Muhammad Ibrahim said they have confirmed the incident and are currently in the process of investigating and compiling their report to discover the cause of the fire and the resulting losses suffered.
There were also reports of attempted looting by thugs discovered trying to get into the market via Kofar Ruwa. Police and Road Safety officers did their best to chase them off and protect people's property.
We learned this while speaking with Kano Police Command DSP spokesmanm Abdullahi Haruna Kiyawa, who confirmed the incident.

CORONA MEDICATION: We have yet to conclude testing the effectiveness of a medication formulated in Nigeria.
While European nations are testing the effectiveness of their Corona rememdies, Nigerian scientists will not be left behind as they proceed with testing the effectiveness of their own medications.
The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration (NAFDAC) has announced that it is testing the effectiveness of 40 Corona medications which traditional doctors have recommended to them.
Mojisola Adeyeye, Agency director, disclosed this on Tuesday in Abuja.
Mojisola said that the medications are being thoroughly tested to ensure they are a remedy and do not harm the people.
Since the discovery of Corona, herbal doctors and others not to be left behind, immediately began research to formulate a medication to cure the virus.
Many of them gave NAFDAC samples of their medication to test its effectiveness and efficiency.
NAFDAC also published some rules and conditions to follow when formulating the medication.
The medications' efficacy will be tested on animals first.
Mojisola warned herbal doctors to never apply the medication without the Agency's consent.
Last May, NAFDAC warned that people claiming they have discovered the traditional Corona virus remedy will only be found on social media and in newspapers.
Adeyeye clarified that only one person has approached the agency to test the efficiency of a traditional medication he had formulated, declaring it will cure the Corona virus.
And that one person did not directly claim that he had discovered the cure for the virus.
He said he had discovered a remedy for symptoms that people believed were indications that they have the disease.
Since then, others have begun to pressure the agency to test their own recipes.

Nigeria will open International Airports on Saturday.
Nigerian agencies announced that airports will be open to domestic and foreign air travel next Saturday for the first time since closing down five months ago.
In order to stop the spread of the Corona pandemic, the government had ceased domestic and foreign air travel on March 23rd.
The government said that the first four aircrafts entering from other countries will land in the nation's capital, Abuja.
After that, they will land in Lagos, but it is still not clear from which country these plane will come.
In the words of Hadi Sirika, minister of air transportation, our reasoning for reopening airports is that we observed no difficulties when restoring domestic air travel on July 8th.
Siraki added that they will take all necessary precautions to ensure that air travel is restored successfully.

APC accuses Niger governor of attempting to cause confusion in the party - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
In an APC announcement this Tuesday, the governor of Niger, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, is accused of attempting to throw the party into chaos.
A statement, signed by party leader Muhammad Jibrin Imam and party secretary Barrister Muhammed Liman, distinctly quoted the (mere) sum of 512 million naira that has been generated during/for the six-year period of the party's regime.
The statement went on to say that the meeting the governor called for and led last Sunday referred to the caucus and is triggering a crisis within the party, about which they had written to the party's national secretary, as well as reporting on other events in the state.
Engineer Imam said, "We have come to understand that the Niger governor is trying to disunite party members by organising a meeting for the caucus. This is unconstitutional. All allegations against the party leadership must be written to the zonal party secretary and an investigation initiated".
He also said that during/for the six-year term, the party has a mere 512-million naira budget.
The governor responded by saying he understood his position to be part of the National Caretaker Committee, established on July 25, 2020 and led by the president to tackle grudges and withdraw court cases between party members.
He said available funds go to pay secretariat workers and related activities, to primary elections and to support party members, i.e. donating to those sick and ineligible for government aid. "No party funds were spent unconstitutionally and we challenge anyone to provide evidence on fund mismanagement."
"As I have already explained, the previous local government primary elections are the most important elections in this country. We pooled resources with both the former and the present commissioners in all twenty-five local government areas in the state. The money was divided among the commissioners to win their polling units."
"Therefore, claiming party funds are being spent unconstitutionally is a fallacy. This is simple disloyalty and an attempt to blackmail an individual with the intent of prosecuting him." He also said that no auditing committee has been formed to investigate party funds, and if there is who formed it?
"Accusers claiming fund were mismanaged are referring to the funds provided by the party's National Secretary. Since this fund does not exist, I am challenging anyone to bring his witnesses and prove the accusation in any manner whatsoever."
Imam said that we will stand strong to protect our APC party against any person or organization attempting to destroy it. He added that any criticism of the party or any of its state-level officials should be submitted to the zonal committee in writing, as stated in the party constitution, section 21 (B) (bi), (d), page 82.
Therefore, the party caucus does not have the power to overshadow the committee, as their decision will not yield any results.
Thus, being the most qualified and trusted leaders in the state, they comply with sub-section 21, paragraph six, page 87 of the party's constitution. Anything contrary to this does not apply.
Convicting the Caretaker Committee of disuniting the party is a fallacy.
He said that Alhaji Abubakar Magaji, General Muhammed Garba and Hon agreed with them and said as much in their unfruitful session yesterday, Monday. Ahmed Dogonkoli, Alhaji Ibrahim Balarabe and all the commissioners, are not members of the state's party executive committee.
As to the executive committee of the party's caucus, party leader Engineer Mohammed Imam is the only person who will lead. It is not the governor's place to lead state party leaders.
The statement added that Governor Abubakar Sani must remember to fulfil the promises he made to the people of during election; to work together with elder party statesmen to the benefit of all and to share political offices throughout all zones. And here lies the core issue between the party and the Governor.
The statement commended federal legislatures who refused to attend the gathering, as well as drew attention towards reconciliation of all grudges between party members. This is no surprise for politicians who know their responsibilities and refuse to accept lies as party laws.
Therefore, there the National Caretaker Committee must draw Governor Abubakar Sani Bello's attention to doing the right thing and cease his attempts to destroy the politics of the state.

How chemicals food preservatives are affecting the health of people in Nigeria.
Technological professionals have warned people to stay away from eating foods preserved with chemicals as such foods cause harm to a person's health.
The professionals issued out the warning after a study they conducted on the importance of food eaten in this country.
Study results reveal there are foods which are preserved by adding chemicals.
The study also shows that the chemicals are mostly used on beans, cassava flour and dried fish which are then sold to people.
The chemicals are used to make the food attractive, so if someone sees it he will be eager to buy and eat it.
Eating chemically preserved foods promotes cancer, kidney disease, heart disease and so on.
The people of this nation are called upon to be careful to avoid consuming these food s so as to protect their health and wellbeing.
This brings to mind Grace Olasumbo, a professional, well-educated nutritionist who warned Nigerians to avoid consuming fruits grown with calcium carbide.
Olasumbo explained that calcium carbide is used by many businessmen who deal in fresh fruits commercially.
Studies show that commercial farmers' greed and impatience are the primary motivators for the use of chemicals, since chemicals ripen the fruits overnight.
Olasumbo explained that one of the things commercial food dealers fail to understand is that using chemicals to ripen fruits is seriously detrimental to consumers' health,
and causes a great many diseases such as cholera, eye problems, stomach ulcers and many forms of cancer including cancer of the throat, mouth, liver and intenstines.

African Development Bank director has been cleared of all charges - Freedom Radio Nigeria.
An independent panel, led by former Prime Minister of Ireland Mary Robinson, has cleared the African Development Bank AfDB director Akinwumi Adesina of all charges.
The Committee said that Mr. Akinwumi Adesina has been found not guilty of allegations accusing him of bribery.
AFP news reported how at the beginning of this year a fifteen-page report was submitted, accusing the sixty-year- old Mr. Adesina of exercising favoritism, accumulating personal wealth and poor leadership.
An independent panel comprising Robinson, Chief Judge of Gambia Hassan Jallow and the World Bank Organization Deputy Governor Leonard McCarthy, the latter being also responsible for quality control, cleared the former Nigerian Minister of Agriculture of all charges.
Prior to this, America insisted the allegations against Adesina must be investigated even after the AfDB Conduct Authority had cleared his name. The issue made it necessary install an independent panel to investigate embezzlement charges.

COVID-19 prevents Trump's Campaign rally in Florida.
Yesterday, Thursday, American President Donald Trump announced the cancellation of an important Republican Party gathering set to take place at Jacksonville in Florida, where he will be given the ticket to run for re-election over the coming months. The cancellation was a result of increasing Corona virus infections.
However, the important gathering will now take place in North Carolina.
Trump stated in Jacksonville that a big gathering of this nature should not take place at such a critical time.
President Trump transferred a section of the GOP gathering to Florida last month after a disagreement with Democrat leaders in North Carolina about staging the gathering indoors with supporters not obliged to wearing face masks.
Some few representatives of the Republican Party will attend in the city of Charlotte, North Carolina, so that Trump can be legally elected on August 24th to run the Republican ticket for president.
Trump said that he will deliver his acceptance speech in a different way.
For months, Trump hasn't shown much concern about the pandemic's havoc, having recently said that 99 percent of those infected with the virus in America were spread all over the country, so it couldn't cause any damage.

On the occasion of this year's small Sallah celebration, the President practiced tthe Idi prayer together with his family at home instead of going to the Mosque as he usually does each year.

China has achieved its goal of feeding its people- Leadership Hausa Newspaper.
Food is the fundamental need of all living organism, no one can survive without food.
Which is why the Chinese government is increasing its efforts to ensure that all Chinese citizens are provided with food.
Ovep the last 71 years, since the establishment of China as we kniq it today, the country has surprised the world, making so much progress when it comes to food production considering the enormity of its population which has exceeds approximately 1.4 billion.
China's efforts have helped immensely, taking on the lion's share towards ending hunger in the world, according to the Chinese minister of food storage, Zhang Wufeng, who expressed earlier that every day from 1949 to date, the Chinese government has been making the issue of ending hunger in the country their top priority.
But recently, some people and media of the western world have expressed a"fear": Can China still provide its people's needs by itself while COVID-19 is ravaging the whole world?
We are forever grateful to them for truly caring for Chinese citizens in this world.
Under the leadership of communist China, the country has reaped the reward of its efforts to achieve food sufficiency.
Providing enough food for Chinese citizens is one of the biggest issues on the JKS ruling party agenda.
Last weekend, Xi Jinping, Chinese president and JSK secretary, gave an important order to stop food wastage, reminding the people that, as they well know, single piece of food is a product of suffering.
Even though the effects of COVID-19 have ravaged the world this year, alos impacting the Chinese economy, China can still produce enough food for it's citizens.
The state-controlled farming statistics China recently published regarding the first-quarter rice harvest of 2020, report 27.29 million tons, and increase of 1.08 million tons or 3.9% compared the first quarter of 2019.
For his part, Ke Binsheng, former Chinese Farmer's Party chairman, says China has mad major progress in feeding the nation compared to the times prior to the internal farming reform and opening the doors to foreign countries.
Huang Jikun, director of the Center for Agricultural Policy Studies of China of the Peking party, explained in an interview with the "The China Science Daily" reporter, that the greatest challenge that China will face over the next two or three years is whether China can reduce/increase the quantity of rice and wheat that it has stored.
The quantity of grain allocated to each citizen has been increased from 400 kilos annually to 474, which should be produced by every person in the world every year.
But now, China has been importing millions of tons of farm produce solely for feeding their animals.
Therefore, those who are showing concern can quiet their minds, let them bathe and go to sleep, that is, pay attention to the affairs of their own country.
The Chinese people can feed themselves with the food they produce.

Qualification should come first, let's do away with the rotation system in 2023.
Mamman Daura, brother and someone very close to the President Muhammadu Buhari, announced that the Rotational Governing System practiced in Nigeria has become obsolete.
Mamman Daura said now that Nigeria is fully grown, it should do away with the rotational system of leadership and concentrate in electing the most qualified person in 2023.
BBC Hausa broadcast the conversation it had with Mamman Daura in which he explained this.
The system of rotation for electing Nigerian leaders, begun in 1999, has not yielded anything good.
Instead, Daura said, attention should be focused on electing the most qualified person. It is not necessary to follow the rotation system.
But the Igbo ethnic group responded to Daura's words.
They said that he and his brother President Muhammadu Buhari that are enjoying governance as a result of the rotation system and now he is promoting it be abolished in 2023.
Buhari himself was elected, that does not make him better than all other Nigerians.
The same is true of the country's chief security officers who have been in office for many years without being changed. It is not as if they work better than Nigerians.
Such was the Igbo response.
A hurricane blew through Nigeria's political leadership on Wednesday when an organization protecting the interest of the Igbos, Ndigbo, criticized Mamman Daura for provoking a speech against the Igbo ethnic group made by the presidency.
In one of the conversations with Daura, who is a relative to President Muhammadu Buhari, said that a zoning provision will be made for the 2023 presidential election.
Before his words couldt finish circulating on social media, the Ndigbo immediately issued an announcement attacking Mamman Daura, whom they called one who does not wish them well.
In one of the Ndigbo announcements on Wednesday, an Igbos association in the South-Southeast said the Igbo ethnic group will be allowed to nominate a presidential candidate in the 2023 elections.
Spokesperson for the Igbo association, Emeka Attamah, said that the words of Mamman Daura are grinning/making a joke of giving the 2023 Nigerian presidency to Igbos.
If not greed, what stopped Mamma Daura from talking about the quarter system in 2019?
They put their heads together and sent Jonathan away, and now Daura is grinning at the South about who will lead Nigeria in the 2023 elections.
After he had taken what he wanted from the hand of his relative, who is the current president, he brings out with another issue as if we are not aware of the quarter system due in 2023.
In his position as an elderly man, he should embrace the truth and uphold it diligently.
Not come out with an unreasonable speech on the nation's Presidency of 2023. This is an act of selfishness.

Voice of America (VOA) Invites to Discussion on Rape.
Recent reports of sexual exploitation, rape and abuse of women and children on a daily basis in Northern Nigeria reveal how children's rights, in particular, are abused.
People from various walks of life attended the gathering on July 23rd to discuss increasing counts of rape and child abuse and how to tackle the problem.
Two major causes, according to attendees, are children being forced to vend (on the streets) and parents' negligent attitude toward their children.
One mother, Hajjiya Sha'ibu, wife of Plateau State's former Governor and Niger during the late Sani Abacha's regime, explained that poverty forces most parents to send their children selling wares on the streets.
Hajjiya Maryam Mammam Nasir, leader of one agency fighting to address the problem, said, "We must first educate mothers on the dangers vending poses to their children's lives. Because only when the child is seen to be unprotected can he or she be harmed.
We will begin by calling on clergymen to preach strongly to parents and relations against raping their children and youth.
Honourable Shehu Mohammed, parliamentary representative of Maiyama, Koko and Basse of Kebbi States, expressed the lack of (governmental) action, speaking out for a national law prosecuting anyone caught in the act of rape.
Finally, Hajiya Madina Dauda and Nasir El-hikaya who lead the gathering expressed their gratitude on behalf of VOA to those who accepted the invitation and attended the meeting.

But the problem is seeing how some young people, instead of utilizing this opportunity and benefiting from the development, are following some spoiled users from the southern part of the country that are well known in the world for duping people, inside and outside this country, or writing obscenities, abusing judges and predecessors.
This displays a lack of civility and reflects the development in the lives of Nigerian young adults.
The coming of the Arewa Media Writers' organization in this country is a big blessing, giving northern youth a clear focus, good instruction and cleaning up what our youth does on social media as they write meaningful things and promote the aims of the northern people.
It is necessary to support this organization so it can achieve its positive aims, bringing benefits not only to the Northern community, but also to Nigeria at large.
I invite our youth, most especially those that are using social media, to come. Let's put our heads together so as to protect the interests and rights of the North, creating a system that will bring positive changes for everyone.
As did our deceased northern leaders like Sardauna of Sokoto, Sir Ahmadu Bello, first Premier of the North and their like who desired to provide for the people of the north.
It was written that the late Malam Aminu Kano, leader of the fight against oppression and poverty, once said that Nigeria is one country, but everyone knows his father's house!
We say this because although it is necessary to strive for national development and improvement in governance at all levels, we also call for unity among northerners, without religious or tribal discrimination, so we can develop the area.
If we observe how the North was before, it is not like that now.
Now it is necessary to make use of the wisdom God has given us, giving us a voice and advice in order to find an acceptable way to revive the industries of the North.
We in the North should provide ways for generating our own income and implement our budget without waiting for the federal government to give us funds.
In addition, if we really want the North to progress, we have to give necessary importance to education, agriculture, tourism, health, science and technology.
Our own contribution does not always have to be money, there are different ways of contributing.
We believe this is how the North will fulfil the dreams of our predecessors!
We are proud of the North.
A key is reflecting on how Bible writers were guided to write the Scriptures .

Clearly , your choice to praise Jehovah makes his heart rejoice .

The Government sets aside 126 billion naira to renovate Nigerian hospitals
The Federal Government has reserved 126 billion naira from the industry revival program to repair Nigeria's hospitals.
Hospitals that will undergo repairs encompass the FMC hospital, laboratories for testing diseases, accident and emergency departments, infectious disease departments and the teaching hospitals throughout the 36 federal states.
Some years back, many healthcare professionals called upon various government sectors to unite in setting apart enough resources to improve Nigeria's healthcare facilities.
The professionals united to make an organized call for solutions to providing good healthcare accessible to all people, as it is in Abuja.
In a statement made by Sadiq Umar, APC member running for Senator in Kwara North, he said the Nigerian government should take national healthcare seriously and make efforts to improve it.
He said disregarding this issue has made the healthcare sector rife with problems due to lack of funds, prolonging its dependency on foreign aid.
Umar said that with all the foreign support the Nigerian government receives, they have done very little to improve healthcare which has caused some aid organizations to withdraw their support.
They spent much of their own lives ​ — as well as the lives of thousands of workers ​ — in an attempt to conquer death .
They said , " Certainly they are both magicians who want to drive you out of your land by their magic , and destroy your best traditions .

God thus cites for the people their examples .
Those who have gone before you also belied ( their Messengers ) then how was My disapproval !
To back up your children , take the initiative to speak with their teachers about these matters if necessary .
He knows what is before them and what is behind them and to Allah are all affairs turned back .
How can we display the spirit of self - sacrifice , and why should we do so ?
And those who cry not unto any other god along with Allah , nor take the life which Allah hath forbidden save in ( course of ) justice , nor commit adultery - and whoso doeth this shall pay the penalty ;
And surely they do know that he who trafficketh therein will have no ( happy ) portion in the Hereafter ; and surely evil is the price for which they sell their souls , if they but knew .
Their only words were : ' Lord , forgive us our sins and that we exceeded in our affair , make us firm of foot and give us victory over the unbelievers '
My parents were hardworking , honest people with a love for others .
What encouragement can we draw from Isaiah 40 : 29 , but what serious mistake could we make ?
However , you need not feel this way , for no one is in a better position to instruct your children than you are .
You approach men lustfully instead of women . Truly , you are a nation who exceed ( in sin ) '
In addition , the Scriptures tell us that “ righteousness and judgment are the established place of [ God’s ] throne . ”
Yet , scholars agree that Cyrus II conquered Babylon in 539 B.C.E . , a pivotal date .
So consider the end of the evildoers .

More people will die of starvation in Africa than those killed by the Corona virus - IFAD.
The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) has declared that at least 23 million more people will die of starvation in African countries west of the Sahara in the year 2020.
IFAD president Gilbert Houngbo made this statement before the World Economic Forum.
The forum this year has addressed the struggle for food in Africa during the Corona pandemic.
Houngbo said in the face of food scarcity, it is predicted that in 2020 the number of Africans who will die of starvation will by far surpass those killed by the Corona virus.
IFAD is a center which specializes in helping people living viallges to improve their farming methods, to increase food production for their children and create incomes through farming.
Houngbo said the Corona virus has made more than evident the enormous gap between food production, distribution and manufacturing.
Many farmers complained that the transportation lockdown makes it impossible to get fertilizer.
People also couldn't go to the farms to buy produce and farmers can't sell their produce when the markets are closed, which led to farmers considering selling their famrs.
One report stated that in 2019, 135 million people in 36 countries suffered hunger in the world, 73 million of them are Africans.
5 million people suffered hunger in Northern Nigeria in 2019.

NNPC generated 378.42 million dollars in June.
The Nigerian NNPC announced 378.42 million dollars in returns on crude oil and natural gas exports this June compared to 133.16 million dollars in May.
The Nigerian oil company said the hike was due to a tax increase to compensate Corona losses when transportation was at a standstill and global oil prices dropped dramatically.
This was explained in a statement signed by the company's Chief Director of Human Relations, Doctor Kennie Obeteru, adding that, between June 2019 and June 2020 NNPC earned approximately 4.6 billion dollars on crude oil and natural gas.
The company also announced earnings of approximately 378.42 million dollars from crude oil and gas exports in June 2020. This compared to 133.16 million dollars in May 2020.
As the company had reported some time back, 230.65 million dollars was earned with crude oil, while 75.97 million dollars and 71.80 million dollars on gas.
The monthly finance report for June 2020 is the 59th report issued by the company.
The report revealed that a great deal of money had been earned from crude oil and natural gas between June 2019 and June 2020, totaling 4.6 billion dollars.
The report also shows that the NNPC shared 1.34 billion in liters of oil in June 2020, successfully distributing petrol and gas throughout the entire nation.
The report said that only 950.67 liters of oil was sold in May, 2020, due to transportation restrictions imposed in this country, which has crippled business activities.
According to the report, in June 2020 over 1.3 million liters of oil and 5.10 million liters of gas were sold, allowing 1.65 million liters of kerosene to be distributed throughout the country.
All in all, between June 2019 and June 2020 over 19.104 billion liters of oil and over 18.9 or 99.36 percent of gas was sold.
The report states the total sum of money earned with oil in June 2020 is 134.22 billion naira compared to 92.58 billion naira in May 2020. Annual earnings between June 2019 and June 2020 totaled 2.267 trillion naira, or 99.12 percent of intake.
At the time of this report, 33 oil pipelines, or 11 percent, were identified as destroyed which is less than in May 2020, when 37 were recorded.
The NNPC financial report for June 2020 said is the company is cooperating with both indigenous people and stakeholders to tackle the destruction of pipelines throughout the country.

DEATH TOLL: 415 people were killed in Nigeria in July.
415 people were killed in different attacks across Nigeria in July, as published by an organization named Nigeria Mourn.
Nigeria Mourn gathers information and reports monthly on the number of violent deaths in Nigeria. The figures for July, however, have been collected from only 21 of the 36 states, including Abuja.
The organization investigates reports aired on serious news channels and also gathers information from affected families, relatives or close friends of murder victims whose deaths were not given newspaper space or air time.
Recent Nigeria Mourn publications reveal that massacres took place in Borno, Kaduna and Katsina in July.
The number of people killed in July in each of the 21 states is as follows:
Kaduna - 139, Barno - 113, Katsina - 80, Kogi - 17, Nasarawa - 13, Taraba - 10, Benuwai - 9, Ebonyi - 8, Zamfara - 7, Filato - 5, Edo - 2, Akwa Ibom - 2, Lagos - 2, Oyo -1, Ogun - 1, Bayelsa - 1, Delta -1, Kebbi - 1.
The report says 185 people were killed by gun men and attackers,
while Boko Haram killed 123 people.
Herders who carry big weapons killed 67 people and 26 people were killed as a result of tribal crisis.
Six people were killed in the Tinkiya crisis and another six were massacred by security before they could be taken to court.
And there were two people who were killed as a result of secret cult crises.
283 civilians and 132 security personnel lost their lives.
Earlier Nigeria Mourn reports show that 731 people were killed in June and 356 people were killed in May.
With so many people being massacred, Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue urged the federal government to give Nigerian citizens license to carry guns.
Senator Kabiru Marafa also pled this cause in 2018, during his term as senator of Zamfara.
Not ony Buhari is responsible for providing security in Nigeria - Nanono - Freedom Radio Nigeria.
Federal Minister of Agriculture, Alhaji Sabo Muhammed Nanono, challenged the state and local governments on the issue of Nigerian security.
In an interview with the Hausa Section of Radio France International, the minister spoke on how poor security has affected the Agricultural sector.
He said, "The fact is, our nation's security does not depend solely on the federal government. We have state and local governments as well as our grassroots leadership, our ward directors and community leaders, how did they allow the security issue to become as it is? But everyone just blames the federal government."
Yes, the federal government is responsible for protecting the lives of its citizens. But those leaders at the grassroots level should have brought their security problems to the table right at the start.
Alhaji Sabo Nanono added that the federal government is doing its best to boost agriculture and provide food for the nation.
For God to intervene in such ways , it would mean that he knows about bad things before they happen .

President Trump has signed a law reducing medication costs.
While struggling for re-election and facing sharp criticism on how he is handling the COVID-19 pandemic in the country, American President Donald Trump signed four federal laws on Friday, July 24th to reduce the costs of what Americans spend on medications prescribed by doctors.
In the past, Trumped had promised to make many changes in the law, but it wasn't until he signed on Friday that the law was actually passed.
One of the laws will lower the cost of importing prescription medications from countries such as Canada, while another law, according to Trump, will require pharmaceutical companies to reduce their prices.
Another law requires reducing the price of insulin injections, while the fourth law, which may not go into effect if an agreement is reached with the companies producing the medication, it will allow Medicare patients to buy the drugs at the same rate paid by other countries, Trump said.

The Kano state elders have reported Ganduje to Buhari - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
A local group of diligent Kano Human Right Activists has reported Abdullahi Ganduje to the Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari when the governor of the state attempted to borrow from a Chinese bank in order to construct a railway.
The group of more than 15 communities gathered under the umbrella of Kano Forum declared that the intended use of the money Ganduje wants to borrow to construct the first segment of the Kano city is not a priority when the state is facing so many other challenges.
The group accused Governor Ganduje of trying to borrow 684 million euros, which is about three hundred billion naira, a loan they said that the government will not be able to pay back in the next 50 years.
The leader of the organization, Alhaji Bashir Othman Tofa, said it is impossible for Kano to incur any more debts beyond the ones already on its shoulders.

Capital punishment for rape in Nigeria is the only way out - Maigidage.
A respected fellow among the people in Kaduna State, Alhaji Aliyu Maigidaje has declared that capital punishment for a person arrested in the act of rape in this country, most especially in northern Nigeria, is the only way out.
Alhaji Aliyu Maigidaje announced this in his conversation today in Kaduna, where he added that once the authorities agree to act on investigations, capital punishment is the only way out.
He allowed that although capital punishment will certainly reduce the incidences of rape, the most effective rape-prevention measure would be for us to change our ways.
Alhaji Aliyu Maigidaje said that we, as the Muslim race, should fear God and the Prophet and amend our ways, because no one knows the time he will die.
He said that it is a disgrace for a young man or an old man to say that he has a small, three-month-old girl, or a three-year-old girl, and has raped her.
For God's sake, he said, we cannot keep heaping insults on our nation's leaders or Emirs when it's obvious that there is no way a nation can progress if these bad habits are the order of the day.
He went on to say that is why we are in difficulty and suffering in this country. Because the nation refuses to progress, even the Emirs, the Governors and the President don't know how to solve the situation.
Whenever they succeed in managing one problem, another one will surface. It is now compulsory for us to amend our ways so God will give us a solution to the issue of rape.
Alhaji Aliyu Maigidaje pronounced that even if they are raping in the name of ritual, they should leave everything to God because he is the solution to all human grief and poverty.
In his words, in any situation one finds himself, God knows about it and there is nothing you can do about it. Just pray to God that he may protect you and always hold it in your heart that you will die, and that you are responsible for your children, if someone rapes the one you gave birth to.
He related how the Policemen are also doing their legal best by sending those accused of rape to the court and the judges are also doing their best. Rape is something that has become a disaster, in the Northern region and in the country at large.
He called on parents that they should monitor their children closely and cited an example of vending, something mothers always demand their female children to do, which only aggravates the problem.
Some parents don't watch their children, whether they went to school or not, whether they are back from school on time or not, the fault is the parents' negligent attitudes towards their children and they should know that God gave them children and on the day of judgement he will ask them what kind of upbringing they gave their children.

Rice farmers in Benue hope to harvest early this year - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
Rice farmers in Benue are hoping for a bumper crop only two months after planting.
Some of them who were interviewed in Makurdi have expressed their hopes that the harvest can take place any time between the months of October and November.
One peasant farmer in the town of Mbatiab-Gboko, Titus Atondo, said he planted his rice on a piece of land of approximately two hectares in the month of July.
Atondo said he got the CP and the OC rice seeds from a local market and he is using the chemical Dazzle to clear land and spray fertilizer.
According to Titus Atondo, there are many challenges to farming rice in villages like his because they depend mainly on hard labor since customers are not allowed access to the farms.
Titus Atondo has also added that he is hiring people to do the labor on the farms right from sowing to harvest, adding that he is tired of this and it is a burden.
Atondo said with all the money spent on his farm, including the money spent on sowing, clearing land and the labors of fertilizing, there is hope his harvest will cost N2020,000.
Titus Atondo also added that he is expecting to harvest at least 50 bags from the two fields which may be sold at 29,000 naira for each 100kg bag.
From his standpoint, one big rice farmer, Bitalis Tarnongu, has planted 274 hectares of his farm between June and July, costing 14, 500 naira per hectare with land leasing costs of 25,000 per hectare.
He planted seed 44 (supi) and Faro 61 (OC), some seeds he got from the Council Meeting of Farm Planning of Nigeria (tsaba) and others from the Olam Nigerian Company.
He added that the cultivation process is currently only one aspect farming, as he farms on different levels. Other apsects include rearing and slaughtering at the grassroot level.
Tarnongu also stated that the challenges thus far include financial ones since the price of buying the appropriate animals is costly and labor costs have also increased.
He said it is hoped that harvesting can commence in the months of October and November.
He also remarked that, at the end of the day, the total cost of nonfood items will be at least 246,000 naira per hectar, while he hopes to produce three tons of honey, which is equivalent to 360,000 naira at 120 naira for each kilogram.
Tarnongu does not use chemicals on his rice farms. Instead, he advises to cultivate the habit of farming with traditional methods, where we take plants that kill insects seriously, instead of using chemical pesticides and fertilizers.
He told us that the Benue chapter president of the National Farmers' Association of Nigeria (AFAN), Comrade Aondongu Saaku, has expressed hope that this year's rainy season will be very good for rice farming.
According Comrade Aodongu Saaku, AFAN president, Benue branch, he ordered additional rice farmers to join rice farmers at the end of this year. Since the Corona pandemic kept so many people from going to their offices, he transferred their labor to their farms.
He said this year he will harvest from 20 of the 100 farms producing in 2019, an estimated harvest of one million tons.
According to him, these are the present farmers' statistics of different groups and if research is done, the number of rice farmers in the state will be ascertained.
Benue AFAN president Comrade Aondongu Saaku said, while he farms three hectares of rice, he has observed that some farmers have planted theirs in June while others cultivating the short-grainsvariety do this at the time of harvest which is expected to be at the end of November or the beginning of December.
The AFAN leader also added that rice farmers are using commodoties/natural products to kill matured grasses, sparing chemicals and insecticides.
He expressed the problems regarding animals that is threatening rice farming, but added that farmers are making fences of woven cloth as well as clearing land surrounding the fields to tackle the problem.

When he was commenting in the gathering, the State Commissioner of Environment Dr Kabiru Ibrahim Getso commented at the meeting that after supplying government ministries, nongovernmental organizations and the markets, they have currently distributed more than seventy thousand masks tp protect the nose, mouth and head.

Workshop held for planning Niger elections.
One important issue discussed at the CNDP is upholding women's rights to participate in the upcoming elections and respecting the quota of women voters set forth in the constitution. Women can contribute much to process of governance, as Dr Idrissa, speaker for the combined MRN regime parties currently in power in Niger, expressed.
The plan to include women in political processes was also welcomed by the conservatives, nicknamed "we don't care," suggesting they begin with distributing party voter cards, Malam Hambali Dodo, joint party leader, explained.
Reviewing how elections are conducted under the current Niger regime, participants were concerned about possible rigging and concluded that distributing voter cards is one way to avoid this.

Nigerian students in Cyprus object to Abike Dabire's statement that students are being massacred in the country.
Nigerian students studying in Cyprus (TRCN) are protesting against the Director of Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NiDCOM), who is warning parents to stop sending their children to Northern Cyprus as they are being massacred.
On Monday, Abike Dabiri-Erewa warned that hundreds of Nigerians in Northern Cyprus are being killed, albeit without a thorough investigation by the Cyprian government.
Dabiri made this announcement after receiving the news that a student named Ibrahim Khaleel had been killed.
The Nigerian student was killed, but there is currently further information on the case.
The murder of Ibrahim Khaleel has become a lesson to parents to stop sending their children to other countries as they are being killed everywhere, most especially in Northern Cyprus.
The problem is that no one the whole world believes that a country called Northern Cyprus exists.
The United Nations does not recognize the country's existence.
But thousands of Nigerians are living in the country and studying and hundreds of thems are being murdered there.
Dabiri said that Nigeria will publish the names of hundreds of Nigerians that were massacred in North Cyprus.
In response to her statement, a Nigerian student studying in the country said that the peace prevailing in Northern Cyprus is far better than that in Nigeria.
The leader of the National Association of Nigerian Students in Diaspora (NANS), Evidence Akhayere, said that even though Nigerians studying in diaspora are facing challenges, those studying in Northern Cyprus are not confronted with any problems, dangers or stigmatization.
That is what Evidence told PREMIUM TIMES in a short interview.
They said that it is not true that hundreds of Nigerians died in Cyprus.
They said that rumors of 100 murdered students is a lie.
The few that died was result of terminal sickness, they were not massacred.

According to ECOWAS, hope is not lost on reaching a goal even though they showed they are not pleased with the objectives of IBK to resign from power.
Now all eyes are watching to see how it will go.
What counsel does Paul give husbands , and why ?
In some cases , this was permitted in the first - century congregation , for the apostle Paul wrote to his coworker Timothy : “ Let a widow be put on the list who has become not less than sixty years old , a wife of one husband , having a witness borne to her for fine works , if she reared children , if she entertained strangers , if she washed the feet of holy ones , if she relieved those in tribulation , if she diligently followed every good work . ” ​ — 1 Timothy 5 : 9 , 10 .
Today , we have ample reasons for putting trust in Jehovah’s reminders , contained in his infallible Word , the Bible .
Where there is a conflict between God’s law and man’s law , however , they must obey God as ruler .
Although we had to leave after spending a few weeks in a certain place , we often asked the most interested people to continue studying with the others until we returned .
Many mothers suffer mild bouts of depression in the weeks following childbirth .
Have you ever wondered what it must have been like for those first - century disciples who directly heard Jesus teach ?
The government views such customary marriage as valid , legal , and binding .
As for those who accuse their own wives but have no witness except themselves , the evidence of one of them is that he shall swear four times by Allah and declare that he is true ( in his charge ) .
Cursed be the makers of the pit ,
Did you notice what moved God to feel regret , or change his mind ?
And when ye call to prayer they take it for a jest and sport .
And He drove down those of the followers of the Book who backed them from their fortresses and He cast awe into their hearts ; some you killed and you took captive another part .
They said , " ( Moses ) , as long as they are in the land , we shall never go there .
Had religious leaders told their followers the truth, they would not be experiencing conflict.
Kaduna House of Assembly speaker, Yusuf Zailani told religious leaders to tell their followers the truth no matter how bitter it may be instead of promoting hatred in places of worship.
Zailani made this statement when speaking at the Kaduna government house when the state government was host to Christian Association of Nigeria leaders visiting Kaduna last week.
Zailani added, "People don't want to speak the truth. If you go to some places of worship, you will hear their leaders inspiring their followers to hate their neighbours who practice another religion".
This is the cause of conflict among the people.
Finally, he said peace will never be restored unless we put our minds together and religious leaders educate their followers on Allah's or God's message as it is written in our Holy Books.
Aoong the same strain, Central Kaduna's senator, Uba Sani, who also attended the gathering, begged those that are not inhabitants of Kaduna to always measure their words before they speak.
This conflict has been going on for more than 40 years.
For the first time, we have a governor who is a warrior prepared to stand his ground and bring the conflict to an end.
But the way some people are bending the news of what is really happening causes many people to hear just one side of the story, without knowing the other sides.
And those making contributions “ came , everyone whose heart impelled him . ”

Thousands of N-Power youths are cheating the project.
The minister of humanitarian affairs, disaster management and social development, Sadiyya Farouk, said investigations revealed that many people receiving a monthly allowance from the N-Power project are also working and drawing an additional income.
In the report that she issued on Thursday, she said apparently some people have not been paid but the problem does not lie with her office as she had sent the names of more than 500,000 recipients for verification to be paid their previous allowances.
She said the names are being verified to eliminate those who are cheating the agency by receiving benefits while they working at the same time.
The project is intended for the unemployed, but some thousands among those receiving allowances have also been working elsewhere while collecting the N-Power allowance.
Now screening has begun to identify and fish out the cheaters from those that deserve the benefits.
She pleaded with those who have yet to receive their allowances to please exercise patience, they will be notified very soon.
N-Power beneficiaries demonstrate against Abuja Minister Sadiyya Farouk's termination of the program.
On Friday, hundreds of young people attended the huge protest gathering in Abuja to express their anger at the government for excluding them from the N-Power support project.
The young people paraded to the National Legislative House to express their objection to the upcoming project remination.
One Kano youth attending the gathering spoke to a PREMIUM TIMES HAUSA reporter, explaining that they are calling on the government to delay the decision it has taken and first pay those who have not received their allowances for the last three months.
They demanded a continuation of financial support, considering that they had been benefiting from government support for so long.
After discussing with the legislators willing to listen to them, they moved on to the Federal Secretariat, in the hopes of confronting the minister of national humanitarian affairs, Sadiya Farouk.
A popular human rights activist, Comrade Mustapha Soron Dinki, who walked from Kano to Abuja with the young people said that this protest is organized to remind the Minister that many of those benefiting from the project had not been paid any allowances before they were stopped.
The young people have been assembled at the legislative house since morning.
We hope that the government will hear the cry of our youth and find a solution that will help them to continue living their lives as before.
Many young people were holding up signs asking the government to have pity on them.

"Black is King" receives both praise and criticism.
The song entitled "Black is King" that appears in a film and sung by singer Beyonce is receiving praise and criticism from all over the world due to how it depicts African culture.
Many people in South Africa, where the 85-minute film was produced, say this is beyond film.
Black is King, is a film full of songs by that great American singer and songwriter Beyonce, who led the film's production, editing and final editing.
This film broke records, as did her other song titles, "The Lion King" and "Gift."
The film was made last year in America, Southwest Africa and in Europe, starring many African singers.
The film opened in July, receiving commendation from listeners, but there are also those who criticize it.
Some people are saying Beyonce, who was born in Houston, Texas in the United States of America, has borrowed many things from Africa illegally, especially the statues relating to Africa in the film, which have no factual origin on the African continent.
But South Africa has praised those who were involved in the making the film.
Sibusiso Mathebula, a student is studying cinema, said he was honored to be involved in making the film.
He said the film is perfect.
The film touches on so many aspects of black history that are not taught at school.
He said when he saw the film, he began to he saw things in a new way, like the clothes she wore and the entire activity of the film, which has revealed so many things beyond what we think is happening.
Kgosi Motosoane, a lover of Beyonce songs, said Africans in diaspora - which includes black Americans - have the right to use what others think are traditional African items.
He said he loves the film.
Kgosi said black women should be made leaders of the community on a national level.
Therefore, their appearance among great people like this is encouraging.
Another film student, Mathebula, studying film production said the film that Beyonce produced has motivated him to start his own film to depict more information about Africa.
Africans supporting Beyonce all agree on one thing: If the black man is king, then Beyonce is queen.

At a time when farmers are close to enjoying the fruits of their labor in Nigeria, farmers in Sokoto have begun complaining about birds destroying their crops, endangering the anticipated harvest.
The plague of red-headed birds in Sokoto has made them lose hope completely, considering all signs pointed to a bumper crop this year, 2020.
Some of the farmers in the community embraced one traditional method of persuing the birds by force as a youth named Faruk of the Dange Shuni community explained.
Sambo Abubakar, one of the farmers in the community, said that the birds are destroying all plants that have started to mature.
The leader of the Nigerian Famers Association, Kano state branch, Murtala Gagado Minanata, said two thirds of Sokoto state is currently facing this problem.
He said that they are now waiting for reports from other communities to compile an accurate report which will enable the federal and state ministries to decide on the proper course of action for helping the farmers.
An officer of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture in charge of insect and bird pesticides, Ya'u Makeri Kagara, said pesticides for killing birds was distributed among Sokoto communities less than a month ago.
He added that the birds come from the Republic Niger and Benin, and an international agreement must be reached and countries unite to solve the problem.
In June, the federal government launched the distribution of pesticides for killing birds in 12 Nigerian states bordering other counties from where the birds usually enter Nigeria.
This recurring problem is a setback for an agricultural development that governments boast they are giving special consideration.

Hopefully, support will reach one trillion dollars to reduce the economic havoc the corona virus pandemic is wreaking in the country.
The proposal comes few days before the end of the term for issuing the first financial support to millions of Americans that lost their jobs as a result of COVID-19.
Yesterday, Sunday, after spending days discussing with republicans in the senate, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and Finance Secretary Steven said the aid package will expand support to those that lost their jobs.
This time, though, they said Americans will receive 70 percent of their income insteadf of the 100 percent they were given before.
The first aid package term will conclude on Friday, with part of the money going to those who lost their jobs in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, whereby citizens were given 600 each week in addition to support provided by the individual states.
Republicans criticize the package, claiming some people are receiving more money than they earned while employed, if state support is added to the federal aid.
But the Democrats see this differently, challenging the republicans to observe the swift spread of the corona virus pandemic and increasing numbers of infected people. Many workers fear they will not have job to which they can return.

The reason why I left PDP and went back to APC.
The former Speaker of the Nigerian House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, has throw more light on the reasons that caused him to move from PDP back to APC again after the Acting Chairman of the party, Mai Mala Buni, announced his return to their party.
In a letter which he wrote to PDP in his ward Bogoro, Dogara said that the division in leadership in Bauchi state under the Government of Bala Muhammed, whom he helped to win, is the reason why he left the party.
Dogara said that whenever he criticized how the government is being run, they accused him of insubordination. But he stood his ground and left the party.
The former speaker of the house said that if he were to simply fold his hands in his lap and say nothing about how things are scattering in Bauchi under the leadership of Bala Muhammed, that would make him a traitor, although Governor Isa Yuguda, Mohammed Abubakar and everybody else heard his voice expressing his views whenever he saw something going wrong.

The federal government has launched a farming project to provide food and employment (AFGP), a branch of the Wealth Creation Project.
The project intends to reduce the difficulties faced by farmers as a result of the Corona virus.
Minister of Agriculture, Sabo Nanono, made this announcement at the project launch in Katsina,

The project has the potential to end existential hardships due to the Corona pandemic in the country and throughout the world at large.
The project will teach farmers how to boost their crops, processing it and transporting it in Nigeria.

He said these more than 1,100,000 small-scale farmers are farmers grouped under 6 umbrella companies which comprise of AFEX, BabanGona, Value Seeds, Universal, Thrive Agric and Oxfam.
In a very short while we will explain the second, B group who will benefit from this farming project.
Nanono mentioned how President Muhammadu Buhari formed a committee to revive the industries from the funds he got after the Corona virus erupted.
He said that the AFJP Project is among the ways of expanding the country's industries, elevating agriculture from subsistence farming to commercial farming.
He also said that the project included a government project of distributing 100,000 metric tones of food items to those suffering hunger and food scarcity due to the corona pandemic.
He said this mighty project could provide employment for 5 to 10 million young people in one year and
about 10 million metric tons of food for at least 2.4 million farmers, i.e. from 20,000 to 100,000 in each state.

There is need for people to be aware of 2019 constitution provisions - KCSF Agency.
The Kano Civil Society Forum (KCSF) is an independent non-profit civilian organization in Kano. In cooperation with the European Union, Britain Culture Promotion Organization of British Council and the Rule of Law Anti-Corruption (ROLAC), KCSF has introduced agents of enlightenment on the 2019 rules governing crime.
A gathering was prepared for 150 civil organizations in Kano as well as members of the press and took place at the Aminu Kano Center of Democratic Research at Mumbayya House, where participants viewed the new laws and their inlfuence on the people.
The keynote speaker, Dr. Musa Idris, a legal specialist and professor of law at Bayero University Kano, criticized some laws that should be more severely punished/ are too severly punished.
He also called for an examination of old fashioned laws, modernizing them where necessary.
For his part, KCSF chairman Ibrahim Wayya said that ignorance of the law plays a major role in depriving people of their rights; that it is important that people know what the laws/what their rights are.
Some of those attending the gathering, organized for the third time in Kano's three senatorial districts, explained their views of the constitution and voiced their suggestions.
Our representative, Aminu Halilu Tudunwada, who also attended the enlightenment gathering, wrote that the shortcomings of some laws were discussed, particularly those creating problems for the masses.
For those laws that are not self-evident, there are over 400 sub laws giving in-depth enlightenment.

Heated discussions surround the new law requiring places of worship to be registered.
An organization committed to increasing the legal protection for internationally recognized economic, social and cultural rights, SERAP, has demanded President Muhammadu Buhari, Nigerian Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami and the Executive Director of Cooperate Affairs Commission to drop the issue of registering places of worship.
According to SERAP, this is an infringement on human rights as documented in the Nigerian constitution.
Prior to human rights organizations protesting the government's playn, various religious leaders had brought their plight to the Buhari government, requesting the law be re-submitted to legislators for further examination and approval to ensure the law does not clash with freedom of religion as stated in the constitution.
Pastor Yohanna Buro, Christian leader in Kaduna, said to a Voice of America reporter that the law is baseless. The government is only trying to stop religious gatherings or place an embargo on it.
The only purpose is the means to monitor anyone defying the law by enacting a new one.
In his view, Dr. Bashir Yankuzo, clergyman for the University of Technology Minna, said its not an offense for the government to monitor companies and organizations to ensure the country's security, but this does not give them license to abuse the rights of a person or group.
As for now, we are waiting to see if the government will comply with the plight of the people.

How the University of Technology of Akure (FUTA) attempts to discredit the PREMIUM TIMES on the internet.
The University of Technology Akure (FUTA) condones the infiltration of an internet store to bring a popular online Nigerian newspaper, PREMIUM TIMES, to its knees.
Hackers implemented all their strategies to infiltrate the PREMIUM TIMES site, but had no success.
Infiltration attempts began on February 28th. The hacker kept his work materials on the University premises and used university data for the hacking attempt.
If his attempts to infiltrate the PREMIUM TIMES site with his computer fail, then he will attempt to infiltrate again with his GSMArena.
He spent five days trying to break in into the PREMIUM TIMES store site, but he didn't succeed, despite all the different modern sophisticated tech instruments he used.
The hacker's attempts did not succeed. What the University did not know was that the PREMIUM TIMES online newspaper had calculated with such an attempt and had installed the program with failsafe security. No one could break down its doors.
And PREMIUM also has some able-bodied professional security, War Emir of PREMIUM TIMES and the Chief Security PREMIUM TIMES internet cell, guarding its modern, comprehensive internet store.
These security measures are top-of-line professionals for stopping any thugs, gunmen or any other troublemakers aiming to disturb the peace. They will only hurt themselves if they attempt to infiltrate the PREMIUM TIMES data base.
The kind of weapons internet hackers used to attack the PREMIUM TIMES site:
At about 8 in the morning, at the entrance of the main PREMIUM TIMES data base, the hacker was prepared to strike using suicide to in order to break in and destroy the data base completely.
When he didn't succeed throughout the night, early the following morning at 6:15 he tried to strike again. This time around he used "WPScan", the software that is used to determine the strength and the weakness of the security of the big websites such as that of PREMIUM TIMES.
After 90 minutes, he then tried to break in with "custom script", a modern technology.
The next morning, he tried all technological methods known to him to infiltrate and shut down the PREMIUM TIMES website completely.
How a farmer handled The Destructive Monkey:
This hacker does not know that PREMIUM TIMES has taken all necessary precautions against the small rats and the big monkeys who infiltrate people's websites with the sole intention of creating malfunctions or even erase the site completely.
It is this lack of knowledge that makes him use all the tools available to him, even the old ones. Still, he was unable to damage PREMIUM TIMES or affect it in any way.
On this day he suffered for nothing because he followed the wrong procedure, attacking with DDOS through the NTP, which is the old method in use when Kano was just a village.
It was on the 3rd of March that he tried all the remaining methods he could imagine, but all to no avail.
This attempt to infiltrate the PREMIUM TIMES database came a few days after PREMIUM TIMES published the heavy disagreement between President Buhari's security adviser, Babagana Monguno and the former presidential Chief of Stafft, the late Abba Kyari.
Some people at the Federal University in Akure revealed to PREMIUM TIMES that the University had hired strong internet hackers to attack and destroy, or at least spoil completely, the PREMIUM TIMES database.
But when the PREMIUM TIMES contacted FUTA, it denied all attempts of trying to hack into the PREMIUM TIMES database.
FUTA suggested it could have been an unruly university student working on his own without the Federal University of Technology Adamawa's knowledge or permission.

Since the Kano government has reduced this year's budget allocation to approximately 70 billion naira due to the Corona pandemic's impact on the state's economy, the state assembly has passed a new bill on how to monitor state finance transactions.
In response, the Good Governance Group remarked that making laws is an easy thing, but putting them to good use is the true challenge.
Providing new order to managing state finances on a democratic basis is one of the reasons the law in Kano has been in use for years, even at the federal level and also in some states.
The majority leader of the Kano state house of assembly, Honorable Kabiru Hassan Dashi, told Voice of America that the law will give state ministries rules on how to spend their money, with the agreement that the government will lay open its books.
Now that the Good Governance Group has welcomed this law, it will be duly followed.
Comrade Abdulrazak Alkali, director of the Organization for Community Civic Engagement, headquartered in Kano, said he hopes that government officials and the state government will implement the law the way it's intended to be.
Commissioner of Kano finance and economy, Alhaji Shehu Na'Allah, ensured him that they are prepared to adhere to the law accordingly.
Kano governor, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje signed the new law at the end of last week, and it is believed to be effective immediately.

INEC is prepared for Edo Elections - Professor Yakubu.
The Chairman of the National Electoral Commission (INEC), Professor Mahmood Yakubu, has announced that the commission is well prepared to conduct the Gubernatorial elections in Edo, where people will cast their votes on September 19th.
Yakubu made this encouraging statement on Thursday while discussing with the security committee election matters in Benin, Edo's state capital.
The Professor mentioned that INEC has so far succeeded in planning 10 of 14 elections, which is proof of the commission's commitment and willingness to correctly carry out elections.
Yakubu added that the purpose of his visit is to see how far preparations have advanced for this particular election.
Of course, we receive the progress reports,
but we still decided to come ourselves and see with our own eyes.
Since February 6, 2020 the commission has been developing a series of programs for how the Edo and Ondo elections will be held.
That means we have allowed a seven to eight-month timeframe to prepare the elections perfectly.
And today am happy to say we have completed 10 out of 14 programs that INEC intends to execute.
And no one has had any issues with any of them, so no election dates will have to be changed.
The last thing to do is submit all registered voters to the 14 political parties who will be competing in the race, Yakubu says.
He said the remaining INEC activities include publishing the election announcements next Tuesday, introducing the names of agents of all competing political parties, all on the same day,
and stopping all campaigning 24 hours prior to the election.
That means that campaigns will be stopped at 12 midnight on the Thursday before election day, which is a Saturday.
Therefore we can only say that we are ready and fully prepared, now all we have to do is wait for election day,
Yakubu said.
Still, he predicted that the Edo state gubernatorial election will be the first to be conducted by INEC during the Corona pandemic.
And as such, he said the commission has developed rules on how the election will be conducted under these circumstances.
We tested the methods and rules at the by-election we conducted in Nasarawa,
and are prepared to repeat the arrangement during Edo's elections.
Initially, the INEC member in Edo, Johnson Alalibo, stated that Edo had 2,210,534 registered voters,
1,159,325 million men and 1,051,209 million women.

Atyap, Hausa and Fulami tribes have agreed among themselves, establishing a peace deal.
The Atyap, Fulani and Hausa tribes living in the Zangon Kataf district of Kaduna have successfully gathered and created a peace deal to bring long-lasting peace to their community.
Those that attended the gathering have shown interest and willingness to live in peace and forgive one another, condemning the killings and destruction of wealth that took place in their community.
They expressed their willingness to help security personnel with personal information which will lead to the arrest of thugs hiding in their community.
The gathering commended the government's efforts, posting security personnel in their community. They also commended the mature behavior of various youth organizations as they embrace one another and distance themselves from anything that will bring destruction to the community in an effort to ensure the peace deal is upheld among them.
The meeting, which was chaired by Emir of Agwatyap, Dominic Gambo Yahaya, has brought together three ethnic groups to talk about the restoration of peace.
The meeting took place at the Maryamu and Yakubu Event Center which is in the Wakili neighbourhood.
Also in attendance were ABM Stephen Shekari (rtd) and Doctor Salim Umar, who represented the Atyap Emirate Council and desired to reach an agreement among the people that would stop the bloodshed and destruction of property that has been prevalent among them.
All three Atyap, Fulani and Hausa leaders, as well as His Royal Highness the Emir of Agwatyap signed the agreement at the end of the meeting.
The peace deal comprises 14 groundrules and Atyap tribespeople made clear that no one should take the law into his or her own hands but refer all problems to security personnel.
The meeting also confirmed Nigerians' constitutional right that allows each and every citizen, which includes the Atyap people, to live in peace in any part of the country without fear or intimidation.
The meeting also called on the authorities to try and speed up procedures so that all displaced persons of their kingdom can return to their homes.
The gathering also recommended establishing a committee to maintain peace which will be comprised of representatives of the Hausa, Fulani and Atyap tribes and their young people. The committe will organize large gatherings from time to time to discuss security-related issues, ensuring a lasting peaceful coexistence in their community.
The peace talk gathering came some hours after the Kaduna government had relaxed the state of emergency imposed on the Zangon Kataf and Kaura districts in Kaduna which was initiated to stop the prevailing crisis among the three tribes.

And when We bestow Our Grace on man ( the disbeliever ) , he turns away and becomes arrogant , far away from the Right Path . And when evil touches him he is in great despair .
And He sent down with them the Scripture , with the truth , to judge between people regarding their differences . But none differed over it except those who were given it — after the proofs had come to them — out of mutual envy between them .
However , during those moments , I thought of Peter’s words to Jesus : “ Lord , whom shall we go away to ?
Both then and now an added blessing is that the bonds of love are strengthened , and we are firmly resolved to serve Jehovah together loyally .
Indeed those who are overwhelmed due to the fear of their Lord –
Say : Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel-for he brings down the ( revelation ) to thy heart by Allah 's will , a confirmation of what went before , and guidance and glad tidings for those who believe , -
Why did Jehovah not choose that course of action ?
We shall return it to its former state .
They return 40 days later .

Ganduje reinstates district leaders sacked by Emir Ado and Sanusi, making them Kingmakers in Kano.
Governor Abdullahi Ganduje wants the Kano State House of Assembly to amend the state constitution of 2019, confirming the re-installment of two senior Kingmakers in Kano that Emir Ado Bayaro and Emir Sanusi had dismissed. The law amendment must be formulated to empower the two judges to install kings in Kano.
The Kano State House of Assembly speaker, Abdullahi Gafasa, laid Ganduje's demand before the Assembly which is expected to convene and discuss the matter before the end of July.
The Judges reinstalled into the Emirate Council of Kano are Aminu Babba Dan'agundi, who was the sarkin Dawaki mai tuta, and the Ciroma of Kano, Sanusi Ado-Bayero.
The duo was dismissed by Emir Ado and Emir Muhammadu Sanusi, both being accused of betrayal.
Babba Dan'agundi challenged his removal from the court,
but the Supreme Court has confirmed his removal after 17 years of serving the court as judge.
Ganduje wants to put him back on the throne again, and the law should be amended to place Babba Dan'agundi among the kingmakers on the Kano Emirate Council.
Ado Bayero sacked Dan'agundi in 2003 when he was accused of betrayal and political involvement.
A committee was set to investigate his case, but when he was invited before the committee he refused to come.
After that, he challenged his removal before the Kano State High court and then before the Supreme Court.
Before he went to the Supreme Court, the federal high court had already pointed out that Aminu Babba should be returned to his position.
But the Kano Emirate Council, under the leadership of Muhammadu Sanusi II, appealed and the Supreme Court confirm his dismissal from the Eastern Judges, and from Sarkin dawaki mai tuta, on the 5th of June.
The removal of Sanusi Bayero, Ciroma of Kano, ensued when he refused to submit to the leadership of Emir of Kano Muhammadu Sanusi, who was crowned in June 2014.
Later, Sanusi Bayero was appointed Minister of International Port Authority under Jonathan's regime.
He has been crowned Wamban Kano, under the present Emir of Kano.

NAPTIP has arrested a number of human traffickers, saving 71 people in Kano.
The NAPTIP (National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking) Kano Branch has arrested three traffickers, thus releasing 71 Kano residents from their persons from their clutches.
Shehu Umar, NAPTIP Kano director, announced this on Friday in an interview with the Nigeria News Agency.
He related that NAPTIP had received indications of human trafficking activities in the state which led them to launch an unexpected taskforce, culminating in several arrests.
The hunt for the traffickers lasted from July 15th to 19th, when the agency succeeded in arresting them.
Of the three people arrested, two are Cameroonians and one Nigerian, their ages ranging from 21 to 36 years.
The arrests were made as the traffickers were en route to Algeria, Morocco and Libya.
Among the 71 victims 14 men and 4 women, 18 in total, hail from Cameroon.
The remaining 53 victims are Nigerian of which 11 men and 8 women, 19 in all, are Kano residents.
Umar reported that the 18 Cameroonians will be transferred to Cameroon authorities for further investigation.
He further said that the Agency has received 34 persons that the NIS agency from Katsina State has rescued.
The perpetrators were arrested without their full travelling documents. All signs indicated that they were trying to leave the country.

Commitment and Search for Economic Freedom is a Mindset - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
In northwestern China, the Longyuan village lies in the Hongsipu district of Wuzhong, Nigxia, a state of the independent Hui tribe,
lives one committed woman named Li Yaomei or Sadiya (her Islamic name) who surmounted life's struggles as she successfully fought her way out of poverty.
Her story tells us that the determination to gain self reliance is a matter of holding onto the right mindset.
In the beginning, Li Yaomei or Sadiya never enjoyed the privilege of formal schooling. She could not even read or write.
But God has given her many gifts, talents, courage and wisdom, making her an example of how to triumph in the war against poverty.
About 20 years ago, Madam Li Yaomei suffered from stomach cancer, which was operated on three times.
After she recovered, she had a terrible accident, leaving her with a metal implant she carries in her leg to this day.
These challenges left her in critical condition. Although her health had improved, medical bills forced her to take out a loan of 3 thousand yuan, equivalent to 16 million naira.
Surprisingly, these difficulties Malama Sadiya faced inspired her rise to the challenge and discover how to improve her life,
encouraged by the grants she received from the Chinese government.
She began a broom-making business, creating different models with varying grasses.
With ter enormous effort and dedication, her business flourished and expanded to the point where several ministries are now ordering her brooms.
So she put her mind to inventing machines to increase her work's efficiency.
For example, it takes her about 15 minutes to make a big broom by hand, but with the machine can she make 5 in the same time.
Furthermore, she has acquired other machines to clean the grasses before she assembles them into brooms.
And then she invented an additional machine to clean animal feed which she is now successfully marketing.
Seeing the challenges that Mrs Sadiya has faced, the efforts she has made to improve her life and business, leaves no doubt that if you seek, you will find.
The task of fighting poverty and improving life's conditions does not rest solely on the shoulders of the government.
If the government provides the support but the people are not willing or lack the determination to improve their lives by creating employment for themselves in the situation they are in, we will remain on the train of underdevelopment without ever reaching our destination.
Mrs Sadiya's story shows that creating a business or employment that generates an income does not need a huge amount of money or require relocating to the city or even another country.
This Chinese woman took stock of her situation and made use of the available resources in her vicinity to improve her life.
Furthermore, Mrs. Sadiya acheived all of this by simple determination and commitment without depending on her husband, who had run off and left her.
She teaches us that the commitment and courage to fend for yourself comes from the heart.
And it shows the power that women have in changing their lives and standing on their own two feet without seeking help from anyone.
This is also a lesson that also teaches us to stand on your own two feet, no matter what you do, because it does not pay to depend on someone.
Mrs. Sadiya is certainly courageous, highly intelligent and very clever. She has become an example and role model for others.
Now, in March of this year, she has fully paid off all of her debts and is no longer receiving government support.

Fear of American politicians jeopardizing efforts to stop COVID-19 - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
In the previous days, Chief Director of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanon Ghebreyesus, expressed his concern about the steps some countries are taking to stockpile the COVID-19 vaccine, which is hoped to be discovered soon. He explained that it is absolutely necessary to avoid favoritism for one country over another when distributing the vaccine.
The vaccine must be distributed in a just manner to the world at large, to the benefit of different countries.
It is evident that some American politicians are using their power in the sole interest of their country, when it comes to sharing the COVID-19 vaccine. In doing this, they are crippling the solidarity existing among countries in view of the pandemic.
As of now, the confirmed cases of all people infected with COVID-19 around the globe is more than 23 million.
Up to 800 thousand people lost their lives as a result of the virus.
In this difficult situation, much focus is given to the impact of the vaccine on the virus. Joyfully, good progress has been recently recorded in researching the studies of the vaccine in some countries which may show a way out, with the faith of all humanity around the world.
But the sad thing here is that American politicians are so ambitious about stockpiling the vaccine.
Even "Science" magazine said that the American government has already signed a 6-billion-dollar agreement to buy the COVID-19 vaccine from many companies producing drugs.
Even though the American government's intention is easily understood, Americans lead in the number of people spreading the virus. Still, other developing countries are also in serious need of the vaccine, admitting that they are backward in terms of health care facilities.
"Ecologist" magazine has also warned that if America succeeds in its attempt to stockpile all the available vaccines, the volume of vaccines provided to developing countries will dwindle alarmingly.
Chief Director of the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention in Africa Mr. John Nkengasong, also expressed his worries on this issue.
As commentators have explained, even if the vaccine is successfully discovered, it will not be possible to eradicate the virus completely until distribution is well organized, which is something that is very important to many countries.
He also said that nations must encourage unity among themselves.
Chief Director Tedros of WHO, also said that if we want this pandemic to end, we must control all the sectors of the world to avoid some parts of the word, or a few countries, to achieve their goal of reviving from the pandemic for themselves alone.

Senior officials in Buhari's regime sent to court after accompanying Abba Kyari's body to the cemetery.
A human rights activist for Nigerians has lodged a complaint against all senior officials of President Muhammadu Bahari's regime who accompanied Abba Kyari's body to the cemetery.
Kyari, former Chief of Staff, was buried in Gudu cemetery in Abuja, on April 18th, following a fatal Corona virus infection.
Akinyade, who lodged the complaint, took the case to Kado Magistrate Court in Abuja, where he demanded the officials be prosecuted for breaking lockdown laws the government had installed at the time.
He said the officials displayed a lack of solidarity with Nigerians who were arrested and prosecuted for breaking lockdown laws. All of them broke the law, but none of them were prosecuted.
He said if Buhari's government is justified in breaking Corona laws, he can see no reason why the poor should be arrested.
And those close to the government also broke the law but they were left untouched.
Among those that Tope filed complaints against are the Federal Secretary, Boss Mustapha, Minister of Air Transportation, Hadi Sirika, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, Minister of Humanitarian Aid, Sadiya Umar.

Nigeria will collect 200 million dollars of Malabu laundered money.
The Nigerian government is trying to confiscate 200 million dollars of Swiss and Dutch money being laundered through the Malabu oil well.
Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami announced this as another triumph in President Muhammadu Buhari's battle against bribery and corruption. Thus far, Nigeria has succeeded in confiscating 62 billion dollars from the hands of oil companies.
Malami also said that under this government, Nigeria has confiscated 311 million dollars from the American government, recovered 6 million dollars from New Jersey of the money embezzled by Abachi and confiscated another 300 thousand from the Republic of Ireland.
The Minister of Justice said that Nigeria has succeeded in confiscating 685 million naira in a year with the help of whistleblowers, while the government has also confiscated 500 million naira from oil ships and tanks that are used to steal the country's oil.
The Minister said that his ministry has helped establish how to collect wire house tax and has increased intake from 22 billion naira to 66 billion naira over the last 6 months.

President Buhari responds to PDP's demand that he reliquish his office.
The Presidenct declared the speech and values upheld by the People's Democratic Party (PDP), the Nigerian president's strongest oppositional party, against the law,
Garba Shehu, the president's chief advisor announced last night.
Shehu's statement was in response to the PDP National Chairman's demand that President Buhari step down.
Shehu remarked that at a time when the whole world is trying to unite and rise to the COVID-19 challenge, the Nigerian opposition party, PDP, has started campaigning for election.
The PDP is calling for President Muhammadu Buhari to resign his office because, due to the current situation, he has given many government agencies the right to investigate, including the Economic and Financial Crime Commission, EFCC. This tactic, however, according to Buhari, is against the Nigerian constitution.
According to PDP chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, they would obviously prefer the President cease his investigations, but he should also not disclose findings.
The lion should not be woken from its sleep, as one of their leaders stated.
PDP cannot frighten the government into silence about the ugly criticism against MDAs and their leaders, refusing to speak out would be a historic betrayal of the people.

Mali's opposition leader, Imam Mahmoud Dicko and other opposition representatives as well as representatives of peoples' organizations were all in attendance.

Keita agreed with ECOWAS leaders's view that an agreement must be reached to protect the peace and dignity of his country.
He added that disregarding the possibility of Mali's political crises escalating could affect the security of West Africa, most especially of neighbouring countries.

In the words of Justice Ummaru Abdullah, Katsina Government arbitration is only gunmen playing with public funds, again - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
We have to go back to the truth before we will live in peace in Nigeria.
Former Chief Justice of the Federal High Court, Justice Umaru Abdullahi (Walin Hausa) declared that Katsina government's conciliation with the bandits is a very big mistake and waste of public funds.
It has yielded nothing and shows no signs of ending the killings doen by bandits wreaking havoc in Katsina.
The Justice Umaru Abdullahi explained this during a press conference at his residence in Katsina. Today's Leadership was among the journalists present.
The press conference took place after laying the cornerstone for the construction of apartments for women and children that will provide twenty five houses, being built in the main hospital in Katsina City by an influential businessman who is also mediating the occasion.
The former chief Justice of the Federal High Court, added that the conciliation with the gunmen, was not done correctly.
Because, he said, how can a thug bring a gun and will be given two hundred and fifty thousand naira? He will simply go back to the bush and buy himself a brand new AK 47 gun.
The Walin Hausa also stated that no war anywhere in the world has brought about prosperity. The peace deal between Katsina and the thugs should improve the lives of herdsmen.
In the old days, we had the ministry taking care of cattle raising in the northern zone and the government at all levels always budgeted annually on the farmers alone. But without the herdsmen, we must have faithfulness and restructuring, only will long-lasting peace be restored.
But this war that is going on will never yield anything productive because all parties are citizens of this country. Conciliation is the only solution.
If done with good intention, peace will be restored.
We are not the only ones affected by this thing.
How will our children and grand children survive in the future, this is the main problem.
There has never been a war started with gun and ended with gun in the history of the world, conciliation must come to the table.
Security professionals believe there is no need to negotiate with terrorists, this is not good advice. Even in America they say they will not sit at the table with a terrorist, but their terrorists are not Americans, they are citizens of a different country.
In our own case, these terrorists are our fellow countrymen and we will say we will not negotiate with them.

Mr. Gideon Negedu, FEPSAN chief secretary explained the efforts FEPSAN is making to manage the activities of the thugs who are contaminating fertilizers in this country.
In his own words, FEPSAN chief secretary Mr. Gideon Negedu said the new law governing money for modern fertilizers will go far in solving the problems.
As of today, FEPSAN chief secretary Mr. Gideon Negedu explained that this will give the ministry of agriculture and rural development the opportunity to enforce the law when punishing anyone arrested for contaminating modern fertilizer.
Mr. Gideon Negedu, chief secretary of FEPSAN has also given out two new emergency numbers for people to call to expose those doing such inacceptable things: 08175077773 and 08175777724.
FEPSAN chief secretary Mr Gideon Negedu also said we are now planning to widen our roads as well as to discuss with the farmers associations how they can be a part of observing those that have a hand in this and report such cases immediately.
He also added that the organization has done much to solve the problem of fertilizer scarcity and it the only reason we work so much.
FEPSAN chief secretary Mr. Gideon Negedu said we have worked on constituting the fertilizer law.
He also said that, FEPSAN, under the leadership of Mr. Thomas, has worked hard to make the resolution become law.
The chief secretary of FEPSAN organization, Mr. Gideon Negedu, said that there are still many things that they can do.
A law proposal was enacted.
He said that all FEPSAN members are aware of the controversy surrounding the modern fertilizer, but it's not only that. Every FEPSAN member is cautioned to ensure he takes care of the valuable materials entrusted to him as damage to the fertilizer is punishable by law.
Chief secretary of FEPSAN organization, Mr Gideon Negedu, announced that, "We have worked on that and we are still working on it so as to make sure that the Ministry of Agriculture, which is leading us, are the ones to enforce the law".
Mr Gideon Negedu, chief secretary of the FEPSAN organization said, "We are working together with them to make sure that there is a fertilizer of good quality.".
Chief secretary of the FEPSAN organization, Mr Gideon Negedu, said that FEPSAN has its own observation committee that will investigate from time to time, but the current view is that we can now get all these things from the Ministry of Agriculture or the Department of Vaginal/Vegetable Engineering to enforce this law directly.

The President of South Africa denies accusations regarding contracts.
The President of South Africa openly addressed the rampant corruption in the country's ruling ANC party.
In one of the letters he wrote yesterday, Sunday August 23rd, and sent to all ANC members, Cyril Ramaphosa started by criticizing how contracts to help the country combat the Corona pandemic were awarded.
What brought on this criticism is that there are independent companies and other people, government officials among them, that exploit hospital facilities, the well being of the people and the industries to enrich themselves, he stated.
The deceit to millions of South Africans impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic is unforgivable. They are facing huger and unemployment everyday.
Ramaphosa he also wrote that several millions of the country's funds intended for improving the transportation sector and providing basic amenities to the poor has been identified. Putting things in a better light, the ANC is helping black farmers emerge as they are developing the country on the whole, not the wicked ones who stole from them and put the money in their own pockets.

In addition, the former chairman of the House of Representatives on the NDDC, Nicholas Mutu, has collected up to 74 contracts, the largest amount, as Akpabio wrote in some of his statements to the committee investigating the NDDC embezzlement case.
So far, other House of Representatives members have also been identified, including senators from Ondo and Edo who have collected NDDC contracts.
The statements Akpabio published reveal that the contracts were issued in 2018, but the amount spent in fulfilling the contracts was not stated.
This came after the Speaker of the Nigerian House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, attempted to sue Akpabio in court on the allegation of blackmailing the members of the House of Representatives.

MDD advised Buhari to handle insecurity politically.
The United Nations demanded President Muhammadu Buhari to use discussion and politics to managing the issue of insecurity that is causing havoc in the country.
Thus spoke Chief Ambassador of the Nigerian Assembly Edward Kallon when leading a delegation to the Presidency, where he said Nigerian problems of insecurity disrupting the country are multifarious and difficult to solve.
Kallon said that while soldiers are fighting, it is also very important to support their efforts in restoring peace with political discussions.
The Ambassador defined three problems facing Nigeria: citizenship, economic security and the leadership conflicts.
Kallon said the Assembly is spending at least one and a half billion dollars annually in Nigerian support, most especially for communities suffering from the Boko Haram crisis.
The officer commended President Buhari for his effort in fighting bribery and corruption, for confiscating peoples' wealth and the restructuring governance. But he also demanded the President to reach out to rural settlements in the communities.

How I escaped police custody - Shodipe the infamous murderer.
The famous, murderous thug, Sunday Shodipe, talks about how he seized his chance to esape from the Mokola Police station in Ibadan, Oyo on Tuesday. Police are still searching for the killer.
Shodipe, accused of murder, said the chief of command, recently transfered to the sector, ordered one of the other officers, a man named Funsho, to allow the accused to bathe.
The prisoner said he was warned by the officer not to attempt escaping while bathing, adding he wasn't thinking of escape at the time.
Shodipe explained that he only thought of escape when he observed Funsho talking to another officer and not paying attention to him. He seized the opportunity and escaped.
He said the new female DPO had demanded Funsho to allow him to bathe.
He warned me not to attempt escaping while bathing.
I escaped when I observed he was having a conversation with another man.
I stood on the tap and climbed over the fence.
People seated in the area saw I was escaping but didn't say anything.
Sahara Reporters gathered that a youth from Akure, Ondo, who does not want his name disclosed, offered to help the police when he saw the notice of whom they were searching and the reward offered to anyone disclosing his whereabouts.
The young man said he had walked to Ibadan with three of his friends with the intention of hunting the accused for three days.
When they reached the state, they stopped at a hotel, where they slept before they started searching for the criminal.
Apparently, the three young people tracked Shodipe to the place in the city where he bought Indian hemp, but decided not to arrest him because there was a crowd around the place.
He was later arrested by city residents when he was alone in his hideout.
The accused has killed at least eight people, all of them women, in Akinyele District in Oyo.

Yobe has spent more than 78.8 million naira in reviving the Leather Company - Leadership Hausa Newspaper.
The Yobe state government was commended by the Mai Mala Buni government for reviving the state-owned leather company and woven sacks (Yobe Polythene Bag and Woben Sacks Company), after remaining inoperative for over 10 years.
This announcement came from the company's general manager, Engineer Sha'aibu Adamu Gadaka, during an interview with our team in his office in Damaturu, the state capital, at the beginning of the week.
He said the company had been closed for over 10 years, but Governor Buni came in with the intention of reviving it, ordering a payment of 78.8 million naira to restructure some sections of the company with an additional 48 million naira to cover operational costs, giving the company an opportunity to get back on its feet.
Eng. Gadaka went further, explaining that the funds allow them to buy some of the material needed to kick off the company, comprising a new 500 KBA generator, a 500 KBA transformer, a new engine for cutting woven sack, a modern engine for sawing the sacks and other necessary materials.
"So far, the major objective behind Governor Buni's attempt to revive this company is to create employment for youths, to reduce the rate of idleness and to create another means of income for Yobe state,"
Gadaka said.
On the other hand, he said the company has the advantage of buyers. Similar to the way the Governor revived the flour and animal feed industry (Yobe Flour and Feed Mill) in Potiskum, attracting other businessmen to buy the company's products.
He said the government's efforts to restructure the modern fertilizer industry is really very interesting, it's also another way of buying the products which the industry produces.
On the other hand, he said, "There are some problems which we are facing, due to the company being under lock for more than 10 years. When we started up some of the machines, we realized some parts needed to be replaced so we can carry out our work without fear of damage."
We will try and gather the other materials that we need before our work becomes so voluminous.
In addition, said Gadaka, "On the other side, we are pleading to the Yobe state government to give us more materials for the work. We need a lorry for carrying goods and vehicles to make our work easier, especially for conveying our workers to and from the office so as to avoid tardiness when we start working full gear".
He told us that they have already sent 25 young people for various training such as how to work the machines and other devices, material maintenance as well as learning how to relate to people when transacting business with them.
In conclusion, he said the industry has now commenced woven sack production in a variety of models, inlcuding large ones of 100kg, 50kg and 25kg volume. They are giving much consideration to the types of bags businessmen demand. The company is ready to meet their needs.

Between April and June 2,732 reported murders in Nigeria
An estimated 2,732 people were killed in Nigeria within two months only between April and June.
An SBM intelligence report in Lagos gathered the information from reports provided by different newspapers throughout the country.
The report collected the numbers from newspaper reports of massacres, Boko Haram killings, killings by kidnappers, herdsmen attacks and ethnic and tribal- related killings.
This comprehensive statistical report was a cooperative effort between SBM intelligence and an organization named "Enough is Enough".
In April, SBM published statistics of the massacre of about 1,000 people, a number gleaned from newspaper reports from January to March 2020.
SBM said the report correlates precisely with Security Studies, the organization in charge of observing both inland and foreign security.
The report also lists the names of the (supporting) organizations.
Massacres occurring without anyone knowing or seeing anything have increased because people are not cooperating with government and security personnel efforts to end the killings.
The report also pinpoints how the Covid lockdown has made life very difficult, with an estimated 43% unemployment among young people.

The report also reveals that 845 thugs and 502 gunmen were killed.
941 people were killed in Borno, 143 in Yobe, 113 in Taraba, 444 in Zamfara, 207 in Katsina, 99 in Sokoto and 179 people in Kaduna.
