Don't demonize the people of Khabarovsk
In an exclusive interview, the acting head of Khabarovsk Krai told Komsomolskaya Pravda about his trip around the region.
In an interview with Komsomolskaya Pravda columnist Alexander Gamov, Khabarovsk Krai acting governor Mikhail Degtyarev called for an end to the demonization of Khabarovsk residents on the backdrop of protests in support of the arrested ex-head of the region Sergey Furgal.
"I want to appeal to all political commentators, political analysts, and participants in all kinds of talk shows.
"Don't demonize the people of Khabarovsk Krai.
"Hard-working, wonderful people live here," Mikhail Degtyarev said.
Degtyarev reminded the interviewer that he is a member of the LDPR and a fellow party member with Furgal, saying that he wishes him success, and that the party and Vladimir Zhirinovsky personally will support him in court.
The full interview text is published on the KP.ru website.
Earlier KP.ru reported that Mikhail Degtyarev had spoken in favor of an open court for Sergey Furgal and said he considered it fair to conduct the hearing in Khabarovsk.
An alarm was raised in two Mexican states due to Hurricane Hanna
Mexico's National Civil Protection System declared an orange (high) level alert in two eastern states, Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon, due to the approaching hurricane Hanna, TASS reported.
The hurricane will bring heavy downpours to Mexico, in several regions 150 to 250 liters of rain per square meter is forecast.
Authorities have set up approximately 800 shelters for the population.
Humanitarian aid will be provided by 10,000 people, including rescuers, the national guard, and the military.
At present, the hurricane has made landfall in the American state of Texas with wind speeds of 150 km/h.
The arrival of Hanna in Mexico is expected on Sunday morning.
Semilarski vs. the Prosecutor's Office: The cassation of Tartu's ex-deputy mayor will be examined on August 4th
This means that a decision on it will, most likely, be made in the beginning of September.
The first two court instances declined to examine Semilarski's case, but in the beginning of April the Federal Court took up his cassation appeal.
On December 12, 2019, the Tartu administrative court returned the appeal to the appellant, as the decision was not within the purvey of the administrative court.
In its decision, the court indicated that the appeal contained demands for the compensation of damages incurred during the course of the criminal proceedings.
"The prosecutor and the circuit court should handle these issues," press secretary of Tartu courts Anett Kreitsmann earlier explained to ERR's correspondent.
According to Kreitsmann, Valvo Semilarski contested the decision in the district court which, on February 5th, did not alter the decision of the first-instance court.
Now the Federal Court will have to voice its opinion.
According to Semilarski's defense attorney, sworn attorney Oliver Nääs, for about two years his client was groundlessly under suspicion of taking bribes.
Now he demands that the prosecutor reverse the false assertions that were directed at him and compensate him for moral damages.
The reason for the court appeal was statements made by the prosecutor in the special cases of the Lyuna district prosecutor Margus Gross, which were made by him on October 2017, when Semilarski was arrested along with the other Taru deputy mayor at the time, Artjom Suvorov, under suspicion of committing several crimes .
"We'd like to remind you that, when I was arrested, the Security Police and the prosecutor quickly organized a press conference and informed the entire Republic of Estonia that administrators of Tartu, one of the most influential organs of local governance, were corrupt.
Those public suspicions that were left hanging in the air dogged me for about two years.
And now, when these assertions and suspicions turned out to be false, the prosecutor doesn't want to say anything about it," Semilarski commented in the beginning of August 2019.
According to Oliver Nääs, at the press conference the prosecutor stepped beyond the legal bounds within which the prosecutor should act.
"The assertion regarding bribes and corruption turned out to be false, but that's not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has stressed more than once in its decisions regarding Russia, and also Lithuania, that during the stage of investigation government representatives should be careful in choosing their words, so that suspects are not presented as criminals until a judgement is made.
The prosecutor is also obliged to this by presumed innocence, which, unfortunately, was not observed in the case against Valvo Semilarski," Nääs said.
"Semilarski's presentation to the public as a serious violator of the law and bribe taker under circumstances when the facts laying at the base of the suspicion of bribe-taking were still being determined, is unacceptable, contradicts the presumption of innocence, and is unfair to the appellant," the attorney added.
rus.err.ee wrote that Tartu ex-deputy mayor Valvo Semilarski will not be brought to court on accusations of bribery—the criminal case made against him in June was partially closed.
Meanwhile, the former government official is being tried for accusations of intentional violation of anticorruption laws when conducting deals of an especially large size.
According to the letter of accusation, during the period of 2015–2017 on more than thirteen occasions the Tartu ex-deputy mayor participated in city administration meetings regarding the carrying-out of decisions relating to companies doing business in Tartu, the owners and managers of which Semilarski corresponded with personally during hours outside of work.
According to Gross, Semilarski had personal interests involved in all these cases, and for this reason should have avoided participating in the decision-making process.
Earlier, rus.err.ee wrote that the prosecutor put forward suspicions of Semilarski in the taking of bribes and the violation of anti-corruption laws when conducting deals of an especially large size.
This occurred in October 2016, when he was arrested with the other deputy mayor, Artjom Suvorov (Center Party).
At that time, the prosecutor and the Security Police announced that there was compelling evidence against both deputy mayors.
Following this, both government officials resigned.
Suvorov's case was later brought before the court, which fully exculpated the politician.
Judicial inquiry into Valvo Semilarski's case is ongoing.
Ex-soloist of the group Hands Up visited Tver Region
The ex-soloist of the group Hands Up, now a solo artist, businessman, and actor, Sergey Zhukov, posted a photo from Kalyzazin, Tver Region on his official Instagram account.
The photo was published yesterday, Saturday July 25.
"I raise my hands up for the new 'Kroshka' and send you greetings from the intoxicatingly fresh air!
Write in the comments, what's the weather like in your city?
We have no rain today, but it hasn't risen above +20 yet...", Zhukov writes on his social networks.
The singer is probably on vacation in the beautiful Tver Region city with his family.
Residents of the region have already thanked the performer for his visit and also expressed hope for a meeting and personal communication.
The new "Kroshka" talked about in the post is probably a new version of an old song that Zhukov has now recorded with the blogger and musician David Manukyan (DAVA M).
Meanwhile, the majority of fans are still IN FAVOR of the old version: "Sergey, the old version of the song is obviously 1,000,000 times better!
Support me, loyal Hands Up fans", "We don't need a 'new kroshka'".
Most of them directly write that they prefer the original, which was a hit in its time.
The Defense Ministry announced the successful completion of Tsirkon hypersonic missile testing
The Russian Defense Ministry announced the successful completion of testing of the Tsirkon hypersonic missile.
On Navy Day, the defense department stated that the test launch carried out from the frigate Admiral Gorshkov of the Soviet Fleet confirmed the unique tactical and technical characteristics of this missile in terms of range and firing accuracy, as well as its hypersonic flight speed.
According to the Defense Ministry, the tests of the hypersonic missile are going to plan.
Earlier in May, the deputy defense minister, Alexei Krivoruchko, announced that the ship system with the new Tsirkon hypersonic missile would enter into service in 2021-2022.
You all know the truth of what I'm going to say.
I think the intuition that inequality is divisive and socially corrosive has been around since before the French Revolution.
What's changed is we now can look at the evidence, we can compare societies, more and less equal societies, and see what inequality does.
I'm going to take you through that data and then explain why the links I'm going to be showing you exist.
But first, see what a miserable lot we are.
(Laughter) I want to start though with a paradox.
This shows you life expectancy against gross national income -- how rich countries are on average.
And you see the countries on the right, like Norway and the USA, are twice as rich as Israel, Greece, Portugal on the left.
And it makes no difference to their life expectancy at all.
There's no suggestion of a relationship there.
But if we look within our societies, there are extraordinary social gradients in health running right across society.
This, again, is life expectancy.
These are small areas of England and Wales -- the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.
A lot of difference between the poor and the rest of us.
Even the people just below the top have less good health than the people at the top.
So income means something very important within our societies, and nothing between them.
The explanation of that paradox is that, within our societies, we're looking at relative income or social position, social status -- where we are in relation to each other and the size of the gaps between us.
And as soon as you've got that idea, you should immediately wonder: what happens if we widen the differences, or compress them, make the income differences bigger or smaller?
And that's what I'm going to show you.
I'm not using any hypothetical data.
I'm taking data from the U.N. -- it's the same as the World Bank has -- on the scale of income differences in these rich developed market democracies.
The measure we've used, because it's easy to understand and you can download it, is how much richer the top 20 percent than the bottom 20 percent in each country.
And you see in the more equal countries on the left -- Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden -- the top 20 percent are about three and a half, four times as rich as the bottom 20 percent.
But on the more unequal end -- U.K., Portugal, USA, Singapore -- the differences are twice as big.
On that measure, we are twice as unequal as some of the other successful market democracies.
Now I'm going to show you what that does to our societies.
We collected data on problems with social gradients, the kind of problems that are more common at the bottom of the social ladder.
Internationally comparable data on life expectancy, on kids' maths and literacy scores, on infant mortality rates, homicide rates, proportion of the population in prison, teenage birthrates, levels of trust, obesity, mental illness -- which in standard diagnostic classification includes drug and alcohol addiction -- and social mobility.
We put them all in one index.
They're all weighted equally.
Where a country is is a sort of average score on these things.
And there, you see it in relation to the measure of inequality I've just shown you, which I shall use over and over again in the data.
The more unequal countries are doing worse on all these kinds of social problems.
It's an extraordinarily close correlation.
But if you look at that same index of health and social problems in relation to GNP per capita, gross national income, there's nothing there, no correlation anymore.
We were a little bit worried that people might think we'd been choosing problems to suit our argument and just manufactured this evidence, so we also did a paper in the British Medical Journal on the UNICEF index of child well-being.
It has 40 different components put together by other people.
It contains whether kids can talk to their parents, whether they have books at home, what immunization rates are like, whether there's bullying at school.
Everything goes into it.
Here it is in relation to that same measure of inequality.
Kids do worse in the more unequal societies.
Highly significant relationship.
But once again, if you look at that measure of child well-being, in relation to national income per person, there's no relationship, no suggestion of a relationship.
What all the data I've shown you so far says is the same thing.
The average well-being of our societies is not dependent any longer on national income and economic growth.
That's very important in poorer countries, but not in the rich developed world.
But the differences between us and where we are in relation to each other now matter very much.
I'm going to show you some of the separate bits of our index.
Here, for instance, is trust.
It's simply the proportion of the population who agree most people can be trusted.
It comes from the World Values Survey.
You see, at the more unequal end, it's about 15 percent of the population who feel they can trust others.
But in the more equal societies, it rises to 60 or 65 percent.
And if you look at measures of involvement in community life or social capital, very similar relationships closely related to inequality.
I may say, we did all this work twice.
We did it first on these rich, developed countries, and then as a separate test bed, we repeated it all on the 50 American states -- asking just the same question: do the more unequal states do worse on all these kinds of measures?
So here is trust from a general social survey of the federal government related to inequality.
Very similar scatter over a similar range of levels of trust.
Same thing is going on.
Basically we found that almost anything that's related to trust internationally is related to trust amongst the 50 states in that separate test bed.
We're not just talking about a fluke.
This is mental illness.
WHO put together figures using the same diagnostic interviews on random samples of the population to allow us to compare rates of mental illness in each society.
This is the percent of the population with any mental illness in the preceding year.
And it goes from about eight percent up to three times that -- whole societies with three times the level of mental illness of others.
And again, closely related to inequality.
This is violence.
These red dots are American states, and the blue triangles are Canadian provinces.
But look at the scale of the differences.
It goes from 15 homicides per million up to 150.
This is the proportion of the population in prison.
There's a about a tenfold difference there, log scale up the side.
But it goes from about 40 to 400 people in prison.
That relationship is not mainly driven by more crime.
In some places, that's part of it.
But most of it is about more punitive sentencing, harsher sentencing.
And the more unequal societies are more likely also to retain the death penalty.
Here we have children dropping out of high school.
Again, quite big differences.
Extraordinarily damaging, if you're talking about using the talents of the population.
This is social mobility.
It's actually a measure of mobility based on income.
Basically, it's asking: do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons, or is there no relationship between the two?
And at the more unequal end, fathers' income is much more important -- in the U.K., USA.
And in Scandinavian countries, fathers' income is much less important.
There's more social mobility.
And as we like to say -- and I know there are a lot of Americans in the audience here -- if Americans want to live the American dream, they should go to Denmark.
(Laughter) (Applause) I've shown you just a few things in italics here.
I could have shown a number of other problems.
They're all problems that tend to be more common at the bottom of the social gradient.
But there are endless problems with social gradients that are worse in more unequal countries -- not just a little bit worse, but anything from twice as common to 10 times as common.
Think of the expense, the human cost of that.
I want to go back though to this graph that I showed you earlier where we put it all together to make two points.
One is that, in graph after graph, we find the countries that do worse, whatever the outcome, seem to be the more unequal ones, and the ones that do well seem to be the Nordic countries and Japan.
So what we're looking at is general social disfunction related to inequality.
It's not just one or two things that go wrong, it's most things.
The other really important point I want to make on this graph is that, if you look at the bottom, Sweden and Japan, they're very different countries in all sorts of ways.
The position of women, how closely they keep to the nuclear family, are on opposite ends of the poles in terms of the rich developed world.
But another really important difference is how they get their greater equality.
Sweden has huge differences in earnings, and it narrows the gap through taxation, general welfare state, generous benefits and so on.
Japan is rather different though.
It starts off with much smaller differences in earnings before tax.
It has lower taxes.
It has a smaller welfare state.
And in our analysis of the American states, we find rather the same contrast.
There are some states that do well through redistribution, some states that do well because they have smaller income differences before tax.
So we conclude that it doesn't much matter how you get your greater equality, as long as you get there somehow.
I am not talking about perfect equality, I'm talking about what exists in rich developed market democracies.
Another really surprising part of this picture is that it's not just the poor who are affected by inequality.
There seems to be some truth in John Donne's "No man is an island."
And in a number of studies, it's possible to compare how people do in more and less equal countries at each level in the social hierarchy.
This is just one example.
It's infant mortality.
Some Swedes very kindly classified a lot of their infant deaths according to the British register of general socioeconomic classification.
And so it's anachronistically a classification by fathers' occupations, so single parents go on their own.
But then where it says "low social class," that's unskilled manual occupations.
It goes through towards the skilled manual occupations in the middle, then the junior non-manual, going up high to the professional occupations -- doctors, lawyers, directors of larger companies.
You see there that Sweden does better than Britain all the way across the social hierarchy.
The biggest differences are at the bottom of society.
But even at the top, there seems to be a small benefit to being in a more equal society.
We show that on about five different sets of data covering educational outcomes and health in the United States and internationally.
And that seems to be the general picture -- that greater equality makes most difference at the bottom, but has some benefits even at the top.
But I should say a few words about what's going on.
I think I'm looking and talking about the psychosocial effects of inequality.
More to do with feelings of superiority and inferiority, of being valued and devalued, respected and disrespected.
And of course, those feelings of the status competition that comes out of that drives the consumerism in our society.
It also leads to status insecurity.
We worry more about how we're judged and seen by others, whether we're regarded as attractive, clever, all that kind of thing.
The social-evaluative judgments increase, the fear of those social-evaluative judgments.
Interestingly, some parallel work going on in social psychology: some people reviewed 208 different studies in which volunteers had been invited into a psychological laboratory and had their stress hormones, their responses to doing stressful tasks, measured.
And in the review, what they were interested in seeing is what kind of stresses most reliably raise levels of cortisol, the central stress hormone.
And the conclusion was it was tasks that included social-evaluative threat -- threats to self-esteem or social status in which others can negatively judge your performance.
Those kind of stresses have a very particular effect on the physiology of stress.
Now we have been criticized.
Of course, there are people who dislike this stuff and people who find it very surprising.
I should tell you though that when people criticize us for picking and choosing data, we never pick and choose data.
We have an absolute rule that if our data source has data for one of the countries we're looking at, it goes into the analysis.
Our data source decides whether it's reliable data, we don't.
Otherwise that would introduce bias.
What about other countries?
There are 200 studies of health in relation to income and equality in the academic peer-reviewed journals.
This isn't confined to these countries here, hiding a very simple demonstration.
The same countries, the same measure of inequality, one problem after another.
Why don't we control for other factors?
Well we've shown you that GNP per capita doesn't make any difference.
And of course, others using more sophisticated methods in the literature have controlled for poverty and education and so on.
What about causality?
Correlation in itself doesn't prove causality.
We spend a good bit of time.
And indeed, people know the causal links quite well in some of these outcomes.
The big change in our understanding of drivers of chronic health in the rich developed world is how important chronic stress from social sources is affecting the immune system, the cardiovascular system.
Or for instance, the reason why violence becomes more common in more unequal societies is because people are sensitive to being looked down on.
I should say that to deal with this, we've got to deal with the post-tax things and the pre-tax things.
We've got to constrain income, the bonus culture incomes at the top.
I think we must make our bosses accountable to their employees in any way we can.
I think the take-home message though is that we can improve the real quality of human life by reducing the differences in incomes between us.
Suddenly we have a handle on the psychosocial well-being of whole societies, and that's exciting.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Clubs vying for Locomotiv star Miranchuk have come to light, as has his salary in Italy.
According to Sport-Express, Serie A teams Milan, Lazio, Fiorentina, and Atalanta are currently vying for Lokomotiv defensive midfielder Aleksei Miranchuk.
The 24-year-old footballer would like to receive a four-year contract with a salary of no less than 2 million euros a year plus bonuses.
Any club that makes such an offer will receive priority.
Lokomotiv is dead set on selling its main star and earning money off the deal.
Otherwise, the club can expect significant expenditures on extending its contract with the half back.
We would like to note that Milan is counting on including left back Diego Laxalt in the deal.
In the 2019–20 season, Miranchuk played 32 matches for the "railroaders," scoring 16 goals and making 5 assists.
With Lokomotiv, the half back became Russian Champion (2017–18), and won the national Cup three times (2014–15, 2016–17, 2018–19) and the Russian Super Cup once (2019).
The US called on Qatar and its neighbors to stop their feud
It is essential to restore trust and unity between Qatar and other states, US Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook believes.
He stated that the conflict between the emirate and other countries in the region has already gone on too long, and will damage regional interests of stability, prosperity, and security.
So far the US has unsuccessfully tried to be a mediator in settling the conflict, which Washington sees as a "threat to efforts to contain Iran."
Three years ago the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Bahrain broke off diplomatic relations with Qatar.
They set up a transit blockade, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorism.
Doha responded by claiming that its neighbors are simply envious of Qatar's economic success—according to the IMF, for several years Qatar has been leading by a wide margin in per-capita GDP.
The emirate comes in third in natural gas reserves, is the sixth largest exporter of natural gas, and is the largest exporter of petroleum and petroleum products.

Or 400 hours of community service, or up to 1 year of incarceration.
Russia's "Proton" is ready to conquer space
The Proton-M rocket is ready for launch, in the course of which it will bring two Express-series telecom satellites into orbit.
This decision was made by a government commission.
As early as on July 26th, the spacecraft will be brought out onto the launch pad of the Baikonur Cosmodrome.
The actual launching of the rocket is planned for July 30th.
The initial launch date was shifted after a number of defects were detected in components of the launch vehicle.
As REGNUM reports, according to Roscosmos the defective parts were produced at the Ust-Katav factory in Chelyabinsk in 2015–2016.
Remenyako won the second round in the SMP-class GT4 RUSSIA.
Evgeny Kulikov was unable to make it to the start, as his Porsche Cayman was damaged in the first race.
Because of this, Aleksei Bashmakov found himself on the reverse pole — given, by the second lap the Mercedes drivers had already torn ahead of him.
Denis Remenko blasted forward once again, while Aleksandr Vaintrub was forced to fend off the attacks of Aleksandr Maslennikov in his KTM, who tore upwards from last place to third.
Despite the close battle in the first part of the race, Vaintrub turned up the heat near the middle of the event, producing the best lap time of the race. And, although he was unable to overtake Remenko, who was incredibly consistent, he nonetheless secured silver for himself.
The group of Caymans fell behind the leaders, but had a neck-and-neck competition amongst themselves.
The best Porsche driver was Aleksei Bashmakov, who came in fourth on the roster, though Andrei Fedotov and Konstantin Zakharevsky were behind him by mere moments.
And at the intermediate finish in the middle of the race, Fedotov and Zakharevsky were separated by all of 0.001 seconds.
Two more highways included in the list of federal roads
The government of the Russian Federation has included two more highways in the list of federal roads.
According to the Cabinet of Ministers, one of these roads, the Cheshkino-Totma-Kotlas-Kuratovo, more than 663 kilometers long, connects the Vologda and Arkhangelsk Regions with the Komi Republic.
The other highway, more than 388 kilometers long, leads from Barnaul through Pavlovsk to the border with the Republic of Kazakhstan.
You can drive along this road from the capital of the Altai Territory to the Kulunda checkpoint.
Receiving this new status will allow these highways to be brought up to the normative state with financing from the Federal Road Fund.
Major repairs and reconstruction will be carried out on individual sections, and the quality of the pavement will be improved.
Tatarstan allows open-air film showings
The Cabinet of Ministers of Tatarsan published a resolution according to which starting July 27, film showings can be held in open areas in the republic - in parks, squares, and on embankments, writes Tatar-inform.
The document also states that for citizens over 65, the mandatory self-isolation regime is extended until August 9.
They can leave their homes to go to the store, take out the trash, or walk the dog.
It's not planned to open movie theaters on the premises until the third stage of lifting restrictions, the agency reminds.
Washington is happy to be playing matches in the playoffs
"We've missed them,"
Aleskandr Ovechkin, a Russian player for the Washington Capitals, said regarding the club's preparations for the new upcoming NHL season.
The 34-year-old Caps offensive noted his teammates' readiness for the matches.
"Psychologically, all the guys are ready.
We're happy to be going off to Toronto; after all, we haven't had a game in a while and we miss playing hockey in the playoffs," the Russian version of the site NHL.com cites Ovechkin as saying.
"Right now we're all fresh; we don't have any injuries or scrapes.
Even so, Ovechkin admitted that he and his teammates will have to recall some of their tactical combinations: "We don't have much time to get a power play and to remember what we worked on in March—how to move the puck in those types of situations.
But we still have time. I'm sure that in Toronto we'll also dedicate part of our training to that.
Power plays and shorthand plays are important in the playoffs.
And I'm confident in our specialty team."
Remember that Washington Capitals' restart is scheduled for August 3, when the Capitals play against Tampa Bay Lightning.
Following that, the Caps' hockey players will also play against the Philadelphia Flyers (August 6) and the Boston Bruins (August 9).
A Russian refused to pay for parking and beat up a parking lot employee
In Vladivostok a man refused to pay for parking and hit a parking lot employee, the police are conducting a check.
The vl.ru portal reported this, citing the UMVD Russia press service for the city.
The incident occurred on Friday, July 24, at a parking lot near a shopping center.
An automobile driver refused to pay for parking a car, as a result of which a conflict arose with an employee of the parking lot.
The verbal disagreement grew into a fistfight.
The man hit the employee in the face, and the latter fell down unconscious.
He was hospitalized.
The publication's source said that the victim suffered head trauma of medium severity and was taken to the neurosurgery department.
At present the police are establishing all the circumstances of the incident.
Earlier, a Russian was accused of beating an invalid, who later died in hospital.
According to the investigation, the victim was visiting an acquaintance – a 45-year-old local resident.
The men drank alcohol together, after which a conflict occurred between the buddies.
The host hit the guest, the latter went home.
Two days later the man began to feel unwell and was hospitalized.
He died from his injuries.
Recently, we've seen the effects of cyber attacks on the business world.
Data breaches at companies like JP Morgan, Yahoo, Home Depot and Target have caused losses of hundreds of millions and in some cases, billions of dollars.
It wouldn't take many large attacks to ravage the world economy.
And the public sector has not been immune, either.
In 2012 to 2014, there was a significant data breach at the US Office of Personnel Management.
Security clearance and fingerprint data was compromised, affecting 22 million employees.
And you may have heard of the attempt by state-sponsored hackers to use stolen data to influence election outcomes in a number of countries.
Two recent examples are the compromise of a large amount of data from the Bundestag, the national Parliament of Germany, and the theft of emails from the US Democratic National Committee.
The cyber threat is now affecting our democratic processes.
And it's likely to get worse.
As computer technology is becoming more powerful, the systems we use to protect our data are becoming more vulnerable.
Adding to the concern is a new type of computing technology, called quantum computing, which leverages microscopic properties of nature to deliver unimaginable increases in computational power.
It's so powerful that it will crack many of the encryption systems that we use today.
So is the situation hopeless?
Should we start packing our digital survival gear and prepare for an upcoming data apocalypse?
I would say, not yet.
Quantum computing is still in the labs, and it will take a few years until it's put to practical applications.
More important, there have been major breakthroughs in the field of encryption.
For me, this is a particularly exciting time in the history of secure communications.
About 15 years ago, when I learned of our new-found ability to create quantum effects that don't exist in nature, I was excited.
The idea of applying the fundamental laws of physics to make encryption stronger really intrigued me.
Today, a select groups of companies and labs around the world, including mine, are maturing this technology for practical applications.
That's right.
We are now preparing to fight quantum with quantum.
So how does this all work?
Well, first, let's take a quick tour of the world of encryption.
For that, you'll need a briefcase, some important documents that you want to send your friend, James Bond, and a lock to keep it all safe.
Because the documents are top secret, we're going to use an advanced briefcase.
It has a special combination lock which, when closed, converts all the text in the documents to random numbers.
So you put your documents inside, close the lock -- at which point in time the documents get converted to random numbers -- and you send the briefcase to James.
While it's on its way, you call him to give him the code.
When he gets the briefcase, he enters the code, the documents get unscrambled, and voilà, you've just sent an encoded message to James Bond.
(Laughter) A fun example, but it does illustrate three things important for encryption.
The code -- we call this an encryption key.
You can think of it as a password.
The call to James to give him the code for the combination lock.
We call this key exchange.
This is how you ensure you get the encryption key securely to the right place.
And the lock, which encodes and decodes the document.
We call this an encryption algorithm.
Using the key, it encodes the text in the documents to random numbers.
A good algorithm will encode in such a way that without the key it's very difficult to unscramble.
What makes encryption so important is that if someone were to capture the briefcase and cut it open without the encryption key and the encryption algorithm, they wouldn't be able to read the documents.
They would look like nothing more than a bunch of random numbers.
Most security systems rely on a secure method for key exchange to communicate the encryption key to the right place.
However, rapid increases in computational power are putting at risk a number of the key exchange methods we have today.
Consider one of the very widely used systems today -- RSA.
When it was invented, in 1977, it was estimated that it would take 40 quadrillion years to break a 426-bit RSA key.
In 1994, just 17 years later, the code was broken.
As computers have become more and more powerful, we've had to use larger and larger codes.
Today we routinely use 2048 or 4096 bits.
As you can see, code makers and breakers are engaged in an ongoing battle to outwit each other.
And when quantum computers arrive in the next 10 to 15 years, they will even more rapidly crack the complex mathematics that underlies many of our encryption systems today.
Indeed, the quantum computer is likely to turn our present security castle into a mere house of cards.
We have to find a way to defend our castle.
There's been a growing body of research in recent years looking at using quantum effects to make encryption stronger.
And there have been some exciting breakthroughs.
Remember those three things important for encryption -- high-quality keys, secure key exchange and a strong algorithm?
Well, advances in science and engineering are putting two of those three elements at risk.
First of all, those keys.
Random numbers are the foundational building blocks of encryption keys.
But today, they're not truly random.
Currently, we construct encryption keys from sequences of random numbers generated from software, so-called pseudo-random numbers.
Numbers generated by a program or a mathematical recipe will have some, perhaps subtle, pattern to them.
The less random the numbers are, or in scientific terms, the less entropy they contain, the easier they are to predict.
Recently, several casinos have been victims of a creative attack.
The output of slot machines was recorded over a period of time and then analyzed.
This allowed the cyber criminals to reverse engineer the pseudo-random number generator behind the spinning wheels.
And allowed them, with high accuracy, to predict the spins of the wheels, enabling them to make big financial gains.
Similar risks apply to encryption keys.
So having a true random number generator is essential for secure encryption.
For years, researchers have been looking at building true random number generators.
But most designs to date are either not random enough, fast enough or aren't easily repeatable.
But the quantum world is truly random.
So it makes sense to take advantage of this intrinsic randomness.
Devices that can measure quantum effects can produce an endless stream of random numbers at high speed.
Foiling all those would-be casino criminals.
A select group of universities and companies around the world are focused on building true random number generators.
At my company, our quantum random number generator started life on a two meter by one meter optic table.
We were then able to reduce it to a server-size box.
Today, it's miniaturized into a PCI card that plugs into a standard computer.
This is the world's fastest true random number generator.
It measures quantum effects to produce a billion random numbers per second.
And it's in use today to improve security at cloud providers, banks and government agencies around the world.
(Applause) But even with a true random number generator, we've still got the second big cyber threat: the problem of secure key exchange.
Current key exchange techniques will not stand up to a quantum computer.
The quantum solution to this problem is called quantum key distribution or QKD, which leverages a fundamental, counterintuitive characteristic of quantum mechanics.
The very act of looking at a quantum particle changes it.
Let me give you an example of how this works.
Consider again exchanging the code for the lock with James Bond.
Except this time, instead of a call to give James the code, we're going to use quantum effects on a laser to carry the code and send it over standard optic fiber to James.
We assume that Dr. No is trying to hack the exchange.
Luckily, Dr. No's attempt to intercept the quantum keys while in transit will leave fingerprints that James and you can detect.
This allows those intercepted keys to be discarded.
The keys which are then retained can be used to provide very strong data protection.
And because the security is based on the fundamental laws of physics, a quantum computer, or indeed any future supercomputer will not be able to break it.
My team and I are collaborating with leading universities and the defense sector to mature this exciting technology into the next generation of security products.
The internet of things is heralding a hyperconnected era with 25 to 30 billion connected devices forecast by 2020.
For the correct functioning of our society in an IoT world, trust in the systems that support these connected devices is vital.
We're betting that quantum technologies will be essential in providing this trust, enabling us to fully benefit from the amazing innovations that are going to so enrich our lives.
Thank you.
(Applause)
A video of how a cat helped a wounded dog cross the road
A video of two cats that helped a wounded dog cross a road in Krasnodar Krai has become popular on the internet.
The touching episode was caught on a driver's dashboard camera.
The events took place while it was dark, the man noticed some movement on the road and reduced speed.
"Look, a whole delegation is making its way," said the driver at first.
Then he noticed that the dog was moving with great difficulty.
The group successfully made it to the side of the road and then headed toward a forest.
"People could learn something from animals," wrote people in the comments.
A parade to mark Navy Day took place in Saint Petersburg and at all the large naval bases, including Syria's Tartus.
219 different ships and 15,000 personnel took part in them.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, who observed the main parade in Petersburg, spoke of how in 2020 the navy received 40 ships of various classes as well as new weapons – including hypersonic strike systems and unmanned underwater vehicles.
A parade took place for the first time in 2020 in Kaspiysk, where the Kaspiysk Fleet was relocated from Astrakhan.
Besides Petersburg, parades took place in Baltiysk, Kaspiysk, Severomorsk, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, and Vladivostok, as well as the annexed Sevastopol and the roadstead of Syria's Tartus.
4000 members of the armed forces and 46 ships took part in the main parade in the waters of the Neva and the Gulf of Finland, including atomic and diesel submarines, as well as naval helicopters and airplanes.
Prior to the parade, Putin together with the defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, and the commander-in-chief of the navy, Admiral Nikolai Evmenov, and the commander of the Western Military District, Colonel-General Zhuravlev, made the rounds of several ships located on the Kronstadt roadstead in the Gulf of Finland, greeting their staff.
The centerpiece of the parade was a copy of the first Russian battleship Poltava, recreated from archival drawings.
Emperor Peter the Great took part in its design.
In his speech, Putin noted that this year marked the 200th anniversary of the discovery of the Antarctic as a result of the expedition of Russian sailors Thaddeus Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev.
During the parade, snipers were seen providing security on the roof of the Senate and Synod building.
More than 46 warships, over 1500 military members, and the large warship Kaliningrad, which conducted an amphibious landing, took part in the parade in Baltiysk, where the Baltic Fleet is based.
In annexed Sevastopol, 30 ships took part in the parade, which was dedicated to the history of the Black Sea Fleet, and included the emergence of a group of scuba divers from the water.
The new strategic atomic submarine Prince Vladimir, which was accepted into the Northern Fleet in June, took part in the parade in Severomorsk.
The celebrations in Vladivostok finished with fireworks.
The Russian Navy will receive 40 ships this year
The Russian Navy will be boosted by 40 ships and vessels this year, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced.
"Our navy's technology is constantly improving.
This year 40 ships and vessels of various classes will be deployed," he said while participating in the main parade in honor of the navy in St. Petersburg.
Putin also noted that several days ago six new blue-water vessels were laid down in three dockyards in Russia.
Earlier it was reported that the parade in honor of Navy Day had commenced.
Four-year-old child injured in car accident near Volgograd
On Saturday, July 25, at 11:28 AM, a car accident occurred on a dirt road five kilometers from the village of Medvedev.

The President of the Russian Federation expressed gratitude to the head of the technical department of the Northern Fleet, Rear Admiral Sergey Grishko.
How the Central Bank’s decision to cut the key rate will affect the economy
The Bank of Russia is expected to cut the key rate again.
It dropped another 0.25 percentage points to 4.25% per annum – officially another historical low.
Judging by the return of the short-term rate cuts, the tone of the Central Bank’s statements, and the updated forecasts for the Russian economy, the regulator has a more optimistic view of the economic outlook than before.
This means the current cycle of the easing monetary-credit policy could soon come to an end.
“We have continued the easing monetary-credit policy, mainly considering that the dangers of the fluctuation of inflation down from 4% in 2021 have persisted”, said the head of the Bank of Russia Elvira Nabiullina.
They are connected to a significant decline in economic activity and a drop in domestic and foreign demand.
Economic recovery, according to Nabiullina, will take more than a year and a half.
At the same time, she noted that after lifting the pandemic restrictions, economic processes have revived: energy consumption and consumer and investment demand were restored, the construction and production of consumer goods were expanded, and the annual rate of decline in the turnover of transport and industrial production slowed.
According to the Central Bank’s updated forecast, the economy will decline by 4.5-5.5% in 2020 (4.6% was previously expected), and the economic recovery growth in 2021 will be 3.5-4.5%, in 2022 – 2.5-3.5%.
Additionally, the Bank of Russia revised its forecast for the annual price of oil to $38 and $40 per barrel of Urals in 2020 and 2021 respectively.
The Central Bank earlier expected $27 and $35 dollars per barrel.
Finally, the Bank of Russia forecasts 2020 inflation at 3.7-4.2% against the previously expected 3.8-4.8%.
The Bank of Russia’s view of the economic situation is becoming more optimistic, bringing us to the end of the easing cycle, believe Sophia Donets and Andrey Melaschenko, Renaissance Capital economists for Russia and the CIS.
Thus, the Bank of Russia has been consistently cutting the key rate for more than a year; it has already fallen 3.5 percentage points since the beginning of last summer.
And at the last meeting in June, the Central Bank lowered it immediately by one percentage point due to low inflation rates connected with suppressed demand and the need to stimulate the economy, which had stalled due to the pandemic and related restrictions.
The possibility of further adjustment to the monetary-credit policy remains (at the next session on September 18 and until the end of the year), but the limit is already near, agrees the lead RosBank analyst Evgeny Koshelev.
The aggregate of pro-inflationary risks also points to a coming pause in percentage policy easing – broken supply chains, possible cost increases due to epidemic prevention measures, and a quicker (than expected) recovery in demand, he says.
To top it off, the subsequent actions of the Bank of Russia will require more attention to inflationary processes during harvest season, and also external volatility, which has grown against the background of geopolitical conflicts, indicates Koshelev.
One way or another, the reduction of the key rate will lead to further reduction in rates for the most reliable borrowers, and also, possibly, for mortgages, says the senior economist for Otkritie Bank’s analytical department Maxim Petronevich.
The rate correction will be less pronounced than the reduction of the key rate, he specifies.
Rates on private loans could fall another 0.3-0.5 percentage points during the second half of the year, and mortgage rates could end the year in the range of 6.2-7%, BCS Premier economist Anton Poktaovich doesn’t rule out.
In his opinion, average deposit rates will also fall – they could fall to 4.2-4.5% (they’re now barely 4.5%) in the coming months.
Further, they could even fall to 4% if the Central Bank reduces the key rate in the fall, Pokatovich believes.
The Center Party promises to pay all its debts by the end of the year
General Secretary of the Center Party Mihhail Korb spoke about this in an interview with ERR.
According to him, the total sum of payments that the party must make comprises around 300,000 euros.
"According to current financial projections, the Center Party will settle accounts on its current debts and obligations by the end of this year," said Korb.
Earlier, news emerged that the prime minister's party had returned 110,100 euros to the government which had been determined to be a prohibited donation.
In Harju Country, a passenger car collided with a recreational vehicle: there were four casualties
According to police data, the accident occurred at 13:50 in the village of Soodla, where a Mercedes-Benz driven by a 31-year-old woman collided with a Fiat-brand RV driven by a 48-year-old man.
The incident resulted in casualties which included the drivers of both vehicles, as well as the passengers of the recreational vehicle: a 10-year-old boy and a 48-year-old woman who was hospitalized.
The rest of those who were injured received first aid on site and did not require hospitalization.
The precise circumstances of the incident are still being determined.
Ukrainian military members to monitor the ceasefire in Donbass
Ukrainian military personnel began preparations for a ceasefire along the demarcation line in Donbass, responsibility for fulfilling the agreement will be entrusted to military members with peacekeeping mission experience, Joint Forces Staff announced on Facebook.
"A unit from the Joint Forces Staff began preparations for a full and comprehensive ceasefire along the demarcation line that came into force on July 27, 2020," said the announcement.
Beginning at 00:01 on July 27, at every Ukrainian position, additional monitoring of the ceasefire will be conducted by specially seconded Ukrainian military personnel, the majority of whom have combat experience and have been directly involved in field-specific issues while participating in peacekeeping missions under the auspices of the UN.
This step will let "the staff of the Joint Forces unit focus on combat missions and prevent possible provocations," the announcement said.
At Wednesday's Donbass contact group meeting, a set of additional measures for monitoring the ceasefire was agreed upon, which, among other things, included a ban on sabotage-reconnaissance groups and a ban on live fire, including sniper fire.

Psychologist reports: "Emelianenko still can't forget his break up with the woman he loves."
Psychologist Veronika Stepanova, who has over 1 million subscribers on YouTube, spoke about MMA wrestler Alexander Emelianenko, who is her sister's ex-husband.
"Olya met Sasha and they fell madly in love," Stepanova said in a video on her YouTube channel.
"It was all picture-perfect — they immediately had a kid and everything was wonderful and amazing.
At some point, Sasha got fed up with all of that and wanted to let loose a little.
And while some other woman might not have a problem with that (oh so what, he went off to have some fun and dance a little), that's not the case for Olya.
She won't stand for such things.
And that whole story of his about going off to have some fun ended with my sister immediately marrying another man and having a child with him right away.
When Sasha came to about what had happened, he couldn't believe it.
He tried to come crawling back on his knees and give her diamonds.
His overwhelming pride wouldn't give him peace.
He wanted to return everything to how it was, but he didn't know how.
Their relationship is friendly and they have a child together, but to this day he can't get his head on straight.
His destructive behavior is a cry of desperation — an attempt to either attract her attention or die trying."
Carolina prospect leaves to play in Sweden
In the coming season, Carolina prospect Jack Drury will be playing in the Swedish championship, reports The Hockey News journalist Ryan Kennedy on Twitter.

Albert Prosa has signed a contract with Tallinn's Legion
Prosa's last club was Tartu's Tammeka, which he joined during the previous season.
"Due to an injury I've been out of football for over a year.
I had an operation on April 30th.
But now everything is all right; I'm ready to play again.
Though I'm currently far from being in the best shape.
When will I make my debut for Legion?
It's definitely possible that on July 29th I'll play for some amount of time at the Estonian Cup, and then on August 1st I'll be on the roster for the championship match against Paide.
It all depends on my trainer's decision; he'll decide whether I'm ready or not.
Personally, I think I still need to put on quite a bit more," Albert Prosa said in his Sunday interview with ERR.
In the current Estonian football championship, Legion holds ninth place in the tournament ranking after 14 tours, in which it scored 10 points.
"Currently, if you look at the rankings, competing for the high spots is out of the question. But Legion is an ambitious team and we have a pretty good make-up.
I think that next year our results will be better.
But for this year, our job is to hold our spot in the upper league and to play more confidently," Prosa added.
"I'm not setting any kind of personal goals for myself.
It's not easy to come back to football after such a long break.
My main job right now is to help the team stay in the upper league and climb as high in the rankings as possible," the forward said.
Prosa previously played for the capital city's teams Flora and Infonet, for Finland's RoPS and TPS, and for Malta's Valletta.
Prosa played 7 matches for the Estonian national team.

The Main Naval Parade was celebrated with new boats and film techniques
A novel film technique was used at the Main Naval Parade in Saint Petersburg: a camera was passed under one of the boats, showing it "from the inside out."
It was from this perspective that the journey of the newest small-missile series ship Sovetsk along the Admiralty Embankment was filmed.
The Main Naval Parade was broadcast on the TV channel Russia-1 and on the site Russia.tv.
Earlier, on June 24, at the parade in honor of the 75th anniversary of the Great Victory, the camera "passed through" the barrel of a tank into the armored vehicle when cutting from one shot to another, and during the flight of fighter aircraft flown by the aerobatic teams Russian Knights and Swifts, the camera "flew out" of a plane's engine exit.
The Main Naval Parade, comprising 46 combat ships, motorboats, and submarines; 41 maritime aviation planes and helicopters; and over 4 thousand soldiers, took place in the Kronstadt water zone.
In particular, the large submarine chaser Vice-Admiral Kulakov, the corvette Stoiky, the large landing ships Minsk and Patriot, the nuclear-powered cruise missile submarine Orel, the submarine Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, the patrol ship Vasily Bykov, the antisubmarine corvettes Kazanets and Urenga, the small-size rocket ships Liven and Passat, and the missile boat Chuvashiya took part.
In the Kronstadt harbor in the Finnish Gulf, the large landing ship Pyotr Morgunov, built at the Baltic shipyard Yantar to the Nevsky Design Bureau's Project 11711, could first be seen.
The lead ship of the class, the Ivan Gren, is already serving in the Northern Fleet, TASS reports.
Among the other newcomers to have recently joined the navy's armaments was the Admiral Flota Kastanov, the first frigate of the class, built at the Northern Wharf shipyard to Project 22350.
Yet another navy newcomer was the diesel–electric submarine Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, built to Project 636.3 by the Rubin Central Design Bureau for Maritime Facilities on the Admiralty Wharfs.
It was added to Russia's Pacific Fleet in December 2019.
The other newest ships added recently to the Russian Navy are the Project 22800 small missile ships Sovetsk and Mytishchi, developed by the Almaz Central Maritime Design Bureau.
The Project 21631 Buyan-M small missile ships Veliky Ustyug and Serpukhov also participated in the parade on the Neva.
The largest participants were the nuclear-powered cruise missile submarine Orel and the large submarine chaser Vice-Admiral Kulakov—they could be seen in the Finnish Gulf.
In acknowledgement of the large contribution made by the Russian Navy to studies of the World Ocean, the two newest surveying motorboats, Georgy Zima and Mikhail Kazansky, paraded down the Neva with the combat ships. And the oceanographic research vessel Admiral Vladimirsky, which in June completed a circumnavigatory research expedition with the Russian Geographic Society to the shores of Antarctica in honor of the 200-year anniversary of its discovery by the Russian mariners Fabian Bellingschausen and Mikhail Lazarev, appeared in the waters near Kronstadt.
And by the Palace Bridge, the first, 16th-century Russian ship of the line Poltava, reconstructed on a historic wharf, could be seen.
This 54-gun sailing-ship was launched in 1712, partook in the war with the Swedish, and in 1717 carried out a landing on the island of Gotland.
In 1725 this ship was retired from the ranks of the Baltic Fleet and, after its reconstruction, was launched in Saint Petersburg on May 27, 2018.
Passage to Kronstadt was restricted this year during the parade due to preventative measures taken against the spread of COVID-19, RIA Novosti reports.
One person has been killed during protests in the US
On Sunday, Aktuaalne kaamera reported that protests have been held in Seattle, Portland, Louisville, and Denver.
In Austin, which is in the state of Texas, one person died during a protest.
The protester was shot with a rifle while sitting in their car.
A suspect for the crime has already been arrested.
Confrontations between demonstrators and law enforcement have occurred in other cities.
The protestors caused civil unrest and the police had to use tear gas and stun grenades.
Survey: Ruling Lithuanian Farmers and "Greens" Union topped party ratings again
The Lithuanian Farmers and "Greens" Union, which heads the ruling Seimas coalition, topped the party ratings.
This was shown by a survey conducted by the sociological research company Vilmorus, commissioned by the newspaper Lietuvos rytas.
After their victory in the 2016 parliamentary elections, the "Farmers" dropped from first place and the main critic of Russia in Lithuania, the opposition Union of the Fatherland - Christian Democrats (Conservatives) was in the lead for a long time.
Nevertheless, assessing the parties' electoral chances, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda recently said that after the parliamentary elections this year, the Farmers and "Greens" Union will probably be able to form a coalition again.
This statement caused outrage among the conservatives.
The latest survey showed that if parliamentary elections were held today, 17.6 percent of voters would vote for the Farmers, and 17.2 percent for the Conservatives.
According to Vilmorus director Vladas Gaidys, the difference is within the margin of error, but still, the ruling party no longer lags behind the Conservatives.
According to Gaidys, the "Farmers'" sociological success was thanks to the news that their electoral roll will be headed by Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis.
This politician was also the first on the "Farmers'" roll in the 2016 elections.
In third place is the Social Democratic Party, which 7.1 percent of respondents are ready to vote for.
It unexpectedly lost 2 percent in a month.
Fourth is the Labor Party, led by Russian-born businessman Viktor Uspasskikh (6.2 percent).
Judging by the survey, the other political organizations won't be able to pass the 5-percent electoral barrier yet.
Putin spoke of the Russian fleet's unique advantages
Russian President Vladimir Putin announced at the Main Naval Parade in St. Petersburg that unique advantages and increased combat capabilities would be provided to the Russian fleet by the integration of state-of-the-art digital technology.
According to the head of state, Russian hypersonic missile strike systems and unmanned underwater vehicles are unique.
Furthermore, the Russian leader drew attention to the Russian Federation's most effective means of defense.
According to the Russian leader, the Russian Navy's technology is constantly improving, and that this year 40 ships and vessels of various classes will be deployed.
Emphasis will be placed on providing unique hypersonic missile strike systems.
The president added that the Navy was armed with the latest ships equipped with high-accuracy weapons, strategic submarine cruisers, and multipurpose submarines, as well as unique specialized equipment.
Putin also stressed that navy sailors complete the most difficult tasks with dignity, serving the Fatherland faultlessly.
EMERCOM issues storm warning to Moscow region residents
A storm with wind gusts up to 15 m/s is expected in the Moscow region. The EMERCOM regional directorate issued this warning on Sunday, July 26.
Residents are advised to remove household items from yards and prune dry trees that could damage housing.
Cars should be parked in garages or far from trees and loosely fastened structures.
To avoid lightning strikes, do not use a stove or electrical appliances, do not shelter outdoors under trees (especially solitary ones), and do not go swimming.
Those who are in vehicles are advised to close the windows and remain inside.
EMERCOM also warned outer Moscow residents of a storm on July 24.
Extra requirements for public procurement applications will be excluded by law
Legislation could establish comprehensive requirements for applications to participate in procurements.
At a plenary meeting in its fall session, the State Duma plans to examine a bill in its second reading that establishes requirements for the contents and registration of an application to participate in a procurement in which only small and mid-sized businesses may participate.
The government is introducing amendments to the law "On the procurement of goods, works, and services by certain types of legal entities".
The bill was developed pursuant to the roadmap for the implementation of the Strategy for the Development of Small and Mid-sized Business in the Russian Federation until 2030, approved by the government.
It anticipates the preparation of a draft law on a comprehensive list of documents that ordering parties have the right to require as part of an application from small and mid-sized business participants in a procurement.
And also - a list of requirements for the specified documents.
To date, the law "On the procurement of goods, works, and services by certain types of legal entities" partially regulates the procurement activities of specific types of legal entities.
Requirements for content, form, design, and structure of applications to participate in a procurement are independently established by ordering parties in the procurement documentation.
"As a result, ordering parties establish excessive requirements for the contents and registration of an application, requiring records, certificates, and abstracts that might only be received from the authorized bodies after the deadline set by the ordering party for submitting the application, which makes it impossible to participate in such a procurement and reduces the number of participants in the procurement", reads the explanatory note to the bill.
The new bill provides for the establishment of a comprehensive list of documents that ordering parties have the right to demand as part of the application for procurement from small and mid-sized business participants.
"The adoption of the document will do away with orderign parties' arbitrary requirements for the composition and content of applications from small and mid-sized business participants", the explanatory note says.
As an artist, connection is very important to me.
Through my work I'm trying to articulate that humans are not separate from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I first went to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, where I saw my first icebergs.
I was in awe.
My heart beat fast, my head was dizzy, trying to comprehend what it was that stood in front of me.
The icebergs around me were almost 200 feet out of the water, and I could only help but wonder that this was one snowflake on top of another snowflake, year after year.
Icebergs are born when they calve off of glaciers or break off of ice shelves.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a distinct way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some refuse to give up and hold on to the bitter end, while others can't take it anymore and crumble in a fit of dramatic passion.
It's easy to think, when you look at an iceberg, that they're isolated, that they're separate and alone, much like we as humans sometimes view ourselves.
But the reality is far from it.
As an iceberg melts, I am breathing in its ancient atmosphere.
As the iceberg melts, it is releasing mineral-rich fresh water that nourishes many forms of life.
I approach photographing these icebergs as if I'm making portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these individual moments they exist in that way and will never exist that way again.
It is not a death when they melt; it is not an end, but a continuation of their path through the cycle of life.
Some of the ice in the icebergs that I photograph is very young -- a couple thousand years old.
And some of the ice is over 100,000 years old.
The last pictures I'd like to show you are of an iceberg that I photographed in Qeqetarsuaq, Greenland.
It's a very rare occasion that you get to actually witness an iceberg rolling.
So here it is.
You can see on the left side a small boat.
That's about a 15-foot boat.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and where it is at the waterline.
You can see here, it begins to roll, and the boat has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there.
This is an average-size Greenlandic iceberg.
It's about 120 feet above the water, or 40 meters.
And this video is real time.
(Music) And just like that, the iceberg shows you a different side of its personality.
Thank you.
(Applause)
One winter morning, a couple of years ago, I was driving to work in Johannesburg, South Africa, and noticed a haze hanging over the city.
I make that drive on most days, so it was unusual that I hadn't noticed this before.
Johannesburg is known for its distinctive skyline, which I could barely see that morning.
It didn't take long for me to realize that I was looking at an enormous cloud of air pollution.
The contrast between the scenic environment I knew and this smog-covered skyline stirred up something within me.
I was appalled by the possibility of this city of bright and vivid sunsets being overrun by a dull haze.
At that moment, I felt an urge to do something about it, but I didn't know what.
All I knew was I couldn't just stand idly by.
The main challenge was, I didn't know much about environmental science air-quality management or atmospheric chemistry.
I am a computer engineer, and I was pretty sure I couldn't code my way out of this air pollution problem.
(Laughter) Who was I to do anything about this issue?
I was but a citizen.
In the following years, I learned a very important lesson, a lesson we all need to take to heart if we are to work towards a better future.
Even if you're not an expert in a particular domain, your outside expertise may hold the key to solving big problems within that domain.
Sometimes the unique perspective you have can result in unconventional thinking that can move the needle, but you need to be bold enough to try.
That's the only way you'll ever know.
What I knew back then was that if I was even going to try to make a difference, I had to get smart about air pollution first, and so I became a student again.
I did a bit of basic research and soon learned that air pollution is the world's biggest environmental health risk.
Data from the World Health Organization shows that almost 14 percent of all deaths worldwide in 2012 were attributable to household and ambient air pollution, with most occurring in low- and middle-income countries.
Ambient air pollution alone causes more deaths each year than malaria and HIV/AIDS.
In Africa, premature deaths from unsafe sanitation or childhood malnutrition pale in comparison to deaths due to air pollution, and it comes at a huge economic cost: over 400 billion US dollars as of 2013, according to a study by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.
Now, in my work, I explore new frontiers for artificial intelligence, where the symbiotic relationship between man and machine can find a beneficial footing and help us to make better decisions.
As I thought about the air pollution problem, it became clear that we needed to find a way to make better decisions about how we manage air pollution, and given the scale of the problem, it was necessary to do it in a collaborative way.
So I decided I'd better get to know some people working within the field.
I started to speak to officials from the City of Johannesburg and other surrounding cities, and I engaged the local scientific community, and I also made a few cold calls.
The process of engagement I embarked upon helped me to develop a deeper understanding of the problem.
It also helped me to avoid the trap people in my profession sometimes fall into when trying to innovate, where we are quick to apply a technology before we've firmly grasped the problem at hand.
I began to develop an idea about what I could do to improve the situation.
I started by simply asking myself how I could bring together in some meaningful way my skills in software engineering and artificial intelligence and the expertise of the people I'd reached out to.
I wanted to create an online air-quality management platform that would uncover trends in pollution and project into the future to determine what outcomes can be expected.
I was determined to see my idea translate into a practical solution, but I faced uncertainty and had no guarantee of success.
What I had was a very particular set of engineering skills, skills I'd acquired over my career (Laughter) that were new to people who had been working on the air pollution problem for so many years.
What I have come to realize is that sometimes just one fresh perspective, one new skill set, can make the conditions right for something remarkable to happen.
Our willpower and imagination are a guiding light, enabling us to chart new paths and navigate through obstacles.
Armed with a firmer understanding of the air pollution problem, and having managed to source over a decade's worth of data on air pollutant levels and the meteorological conditions for in and around Johannesburg, my colleagues from South Africa and China and myself created an air-quality decision support system that lives in the cloud.
This software system analyzes historical and real-time data to uncover the spatial-temporal trends in pollution.
We then used new machine learning technology to predict future levels of pollution for several different pollutants days in advance.
This means that citizens can make better decisions about their daily movements and about where to settle their families.
We can predict adverse pollution events ahead of time, identify heavy polluters, and they can be ordered by the relevant authorities to scale back their operations.
Through assisted scenario planning, city planners can also make better decisions about how to extend infrastructure, such as human settlements or industrial zones.
We completed a pilot of our technology that was run over a period of 120 days, covering all of South Africa.
Our results were confirmed when we demonstrated a tight correlation between the forecasting data and the data we were getting on the ground.
Through our leadership, we have brought cutting-edge, world-leading assets that can perform air-quality forecasting at an unprecedented resolution and accuracy, benefiting the city that I drove into one winter morning not very long ago, and thought to myself, "Something is wrong here. I wonder what can be done?"
So here is the point: What if I'd not investigated the problem of air pollution further?
What if I'd not shown some concern for the state of the environment and just hoped that someone, somewhere, was taking care of the matter?
What I have learned is that, when embarking on a challenging endeavor that advances a cause that we firmly believe in, it is important to focus on the possibility of success and consider the consequence of not acting.
We should not get distracted by resistance and opposition, but this should motivate us further.
So wherever you are in the world, the next time you find that there's some natural curiosity you have that is being piqued, and it's about something you care about, and you have some crazy or bold ideas, and perhaps it's outside the realm of your expertise, ask yourself this: Why not?
Why not just go ahead and tackle the problem as best as you can, in your own way?
You may be pleasantly surprised.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Republicans propose providing another $1 tln to support the US economy
The Republicans are proposing spending another $1 tln to support the economy of the United States of America, Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin confirmed on Fox News on Sunday, July 26.
"The $1 tln package contains the highest-priority and most urgent things," noted the head of the American finance ministry.
The support package includes new direct payments to Americans.
The proposal must be passed by Congress and signed by US President Donald Trump.
Democratic Party representatives believe that the proposed funds are insufficient.
About $3 tln was disbursed in support of the US economy in the spring.
On April 14 Trump signed a bill on financial support for the American economy to combat the coronavirus and its consequences, amounting to almost half a million dollars.
According to analysts, the GDP of the USA fell by 25% year-on-year in Q2 2020; this is the greatest drop in the country's history.
Microsoft forcibly updates old versions of Windows 10
Microsoft has confirmed it is moving on to the next stage of rolling out the May 2020 Update for the Windows 10 operating system, the BetaNews portal reports July 25.
Packet not needed: FAS doubted the legality of Microsoft's antivirus proposal
State structures may be breaking the law by receiving remote work software from the American corporation
The company is expanding the number of users with the new version of the operating system.
For this purpose, it decided to automatically update computers with old versions of the system.
It is expected that an algorithm specially developed by the company will detect devices with old versions of the program platform that will soon no longer be supported, and automatically install the Windows 10 May 2020 Update on them.
In the near future, this concerns computers with Windows 10 (1809) and Windows 10 (1903), support for which ends on November 10 and December 8 respectively, the publication notes.
On July 21 it was reported that after updating the Windows 10 operating system, users experienced internet connection problems – there was no network access.
The complications were not associated with the network connection itself, but with the connection status.
Doctor Myasnikov named the important indications of a person's health
An oversized waistline is one of the most important criteria in the "deadly quartet"
Doctor and TV host Alexandr Myasnikov told of the key indicators for determining a person's health.
His so-called "deadly quartet" includes four criteria – high blood pressure, cholesterol, sugar and waist size, the doctor said on air on the Rossiya 1 TV channel.
Myasnikov called on everyone to pay attention to these factors.
Moreover, he said that watching your waistline is even more important than your weight.
For men, this parameter should not exceed 102 centimeters, and for women – 88 centimeters.
Exceeding these norms may be a sign that your health is in danger.
In the first place this concerns the heart's condition – a waistline greater than the norm is a risk factor for developing a stroke, heart attack, and also cancer and diabetes.
To recap, earlier Myasnikov told why it's okay to eat a piece of candy before bed.
The doctor explained that sugar in itself is not a health hazard, and dessert becomes harmful only when such food is eaten in large quantities, but a piece of candy before bed, according to him, is not the worst snack.
Touring and Super-Production winners declared at Igora Drive
At the Igora Drive motorsports complex, where the main stage of the Russian Circuit Racing Series is being held, the Touring and Super-Production competitions have concluded.
Channel 5 reported this on Sunday, July 26.
In Touring, the leaders were Kirill Ladygin, Dmitry Bragin, Aleksey Dudukalo, Pavel Kalmanovich, and Ivan Lukashevich.
In Super-Production, Andrey Petukhov, Vladislav Nezvankin, Nikolay Vikhansky, Vadim Antipov, and Dmitry Lebedev won.
Rustam Fatkhutdinov was best in the SMP RCRS Trophy, and the runners-up were Lev Tolkachev and Pavel Yashin.
The documentary film John Lewis: Good Trouble went into online distribution.
The biopic, which was intended as a sort of visual congratulations to Congressman John Lewis, who celebrated his 80th birthday at the beginning of this year, ended up an extended epitaph.
On July 17, the celebrated human rights advocate and politician passed away after a long battle with pancreatic cancer.
In recent and upcoming days in the US numerous memorial events are being held in his memory.
Secretary of the Treasury Stephen Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows put forward the idea of passing a bill focused on several issues, including federal unemployment payments, which expire on Friday.
It has been proposed to address other issues later.
The company Moderna, Inc. announced on Sunday that it received an additional $472 million from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority for the development of its vaccine against the novel coronavirus.
The US-based company, which manufactures medicines, explained that the additional financing was called in to assist the company's work in the final stages of clinical trials.
Without any warning, Great Britain has excluded Spain from the list of countries that are safe for travel, and introduced a two-week quarantine for anyone arriving into the country from Spain.
Foreign Secretary of Great Britain Dominic Raab did not apologize for the last-minute decision, explaining by referencing the recent sudden spike in COVID-19 cases in Spain.
Protests
Protests have been held in a number of US cities with the aim of drawing attention to the problem of racial injustice.
In Seattle police used stun grenades and tear gas and arrested 45 people, after the demonstrations in support of the protests in Portland turned violent.
The police stated that over 20 police officers were injured.
In Austin, in the state of Texas, a person died on Saturday when someone shot at participants in a march of the Black Lives Matter movement.
The media reported that the person may have approached a car with a rifle when they were shot.
US experts named Pompeo the worst secretary of state in the country's history
International affairs experts Aaron David Miller and Richard Sokolsky named Mike Pompeo the worst secretary of state in the history of the United States.
CNN published their opinions on July 23.
"In just two short years Mike Pompeo – with an eye on the presidential post in 2024 and the support of President Donald Trump - has become not only the worst secretary of state in US history but also the most partisan," the text says.
The experts accused Pompeo of having "politicized the office of secretary of state and debased the institution he runs", for the sake of promoting his personal political program and protecting Trump "from accountability and the rule of law".
In particular, they say the secretary of state covers up the "Trump blackmail of Ukraine" and is willing to throw State Department officials under a bus for their cooperation with Congress in the matter.
Besides that, they recalled that Pompeo was extremely friendly with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammed bin Salman, who was partially responsible for the murder of The Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.
Trump announced the decision to appoint Mike Pompeo as head of the State Department on March 13, 2018 after the dismissal of the former secretary of state Rex Tillerson.
Previously Pompeo headed the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
Foreign-made car drove into a store in Tikhoretsk
Today, July 26, a Land Cruiser SUV sped into the sales floor of a chain supermarket on Menshikov Street in Tikhoretsk.
The incident was recorded by surveillance cameras.
A boy who was in the store at that time was injured as a result of the accident.
The child was hospitalized with injuries and lacerations.
Showcases and counters were destroyed on the floor of the shopping facility.
Eyewitnesses say the driver of the foreign-made car was intoxicated.
Do you know how many species of flowering plants there are?
There are a quarter of a million -- at least those are the ones we know about -- a quarter of a million species of flowering plants.
And flowers are a real bugger.
They're really difficult for plants to produce.
They take an enormous amount of energy and a lot of resources.
Why would they go to that bother?
And the answer of course, like so many things in the world, is sex.
I know what's on your mind when you're looking at these pictures.
And the reason that sexual reproduction is so important -- there are lots of other things that plants can do to reproduce.
You can take cuttings; they can sort of have sex with themselves; they can pollinate themselves.
But they really need to spread their genes to mix with other genes so that they can adapt to environmental niches.
Evolution works that way.
Now the way that plants transmit that information is through pollen.
Some of you may have seen some of these pictures before.
As I say, every home should have a scanning electron microscope to be able to see these.
And there is as many different kinds of pollen as there are flowering plants.
And that's actually rather useful for forensics and so on.
Most pollen that causes hay fever for us is from plants that use the wind to disseminate the pollen, and that's a very inefficient process, which is why it gets up our noses so much.
Because you have to chuck out masses and masses of it, hoping that your sex cells, your male sex cells, which are held within the pollen, will somehow reach another flower just by chance.
So all the grasses, which means all of the cereal crops, and most of the trees have wind-borne pollen.
But most species actually use insects to do their bidding, and that's more intelligent in a way, because the pollen, they don't need so much of it.
The insects and other species can take the pollen, transfer it directly to where it's required.
So we're aware, obviously, of the relationship between insects and plants.
There's a symbiotic relationship there, whether it's flies or birds or bees, they're getting something in return, and that something in return is generally nectar.
Sometimes that symbiosis has led to wonderful adaptations -- the hummingbird hawk-moth is beautiful in its adaptation.
The plant gets something, and the hawk-moth spreads the pollen somewhere else.
Plants have evolved to create little landing strips here and there for bees that might have lost their way.
There are markings on many plants that look like other insects.
These are the anthers of a lily, cleverly done so that when the unsuspecting insect lands on it, the anther flips up and whops it on the back with a great load of pollen that it then goes to another plant with.
And there's an orchid that might look to you as if it's got jaws, and in a way, it has; it forces the insect to crawl out, getting covered in pollen that it takes somewhere else.
Orchids: there are 20,000, at least, species of orchids -- amazingly, amazingly diverse.
And they get up to all sorts of tricks.
They have to try and attract pollinators to do their bidding.
This orchid, known as Darwin's orchid, because it's one that he studied and made a wonderful prediction when he saw it -- you can see that there's a very long nectar tube that descends down from the orchid.
And basically what the insect has to do -- we're in the middle of the flower -- it has to stick its little proboscis right into the middle of that and all the way down that nectar tube to get to the nectar.
And Darwin said, looking at this flower, "I guess something has coevolved with this."
And sure enough, there's the insect.
And I mean, normally it kind of rolls it away, but in its erect form, that's what it looks like.
Now you can imagine that if nectar is such a valuable thing and expensive for the plant to produce and it attracts lots of pollinators, then, just as in human sex, people might start to deceive.
They might say, "I've got a bit of nectar. Do you want to come and get it?"
Now this is a plant.
This is a plant here that insects in South Africa just love, and they've evolved with a long proboscis to get the nectar at the bottom.
And this is the mimic.
So this is a plant that is mimicking the first plant.
And here is the long-probosced fly that has not gotten any nectar from the mimic, because the mimic doesn't give it any nectar. It thought it would get some.
So not only has the fly not got the nectar from the mimic plant, it's also -- if you look very closely just at the head end, you can see that it's got a bit of pollen that it would be transmitting to another plant, if only some botanist hadn't come along and stuck it to a blue piece of card.
(Laughter) Now deceit carries on through the plant kingdom.
This flower with its black dots: they might look like black dots to us, but if I tell you, to a male insect of the right species, that looks like two females who are really, really hot to trot.
(Laughter) And when the insect gets there and lands on it, dousing itself in pollen, of course, that it's going to take to another plant, if you look at the every-home-should-have-one scanning electron microscope picture, you can see that there are actually some patterning there, which is three-dimensional.
So it probably even feels good for the insect, as well as looking good.
And these electron microscope pictures -- here's one of an orchid mimicking an insect -- you can see that different parts of the structure have different colors and different textures to our eye, have very, very different textures to what an insect might perceive.
And this one is evolved to mimic a glossy metallic surface you see on some beetles.
And under the scanning electron microscope, you can see the surface there -- really quite different from the other surfaces we looked at.
Sometimes the whole plant mimics an insect, even to us.
I mean, I think that looks like some sort of flying animal or beast.
It's a wonderful, amazing thing.
This one's clever. It's called obsidian.
I think of it as insidium sometimes.
To the right species of bee, this looks like another very aggressive bee, and it goes and bonks it on the head lots and lots of times to try and drive it away, and, of course, covers itself with pollen.
The other thing it does is that this plant mimics another orchid that has a wonderful store of food for insects.
And this one doesn't have anything for them.
So it's deceiving on two levels -- fabulous.
(Laughter) Here we see ylang ylang, the component of many perfumes.
I actually smelt someone with some on earlier.
And the flowers don't really have to be that gaudy.
They're sending out a fantastic array of scent to any insect that'll have it.
This one doesn't smell so good.
This is a flower that really, really smells pretty nasty and is designed, again, evolved, to look like carrion.
So flies love this.
They fly in and they pollinate.
This, which is helicodiceros, is also known as dead horse arum.
I don't know what a dead horse actually smells like, but this one probably smells pretty much like it.
It's really horrible.
And blowflies just can't help themselves.
They fly into this thing, and they fly all the way down it.
They lay their eggs in it, thinking it's a nice bit of carrion, and not realizing that there's no food for the eggs, that the eggs are going to die, but the plant, meanwhile, has benefited, because the bristles release and the flies disappear to pollinate the next flower -- fantastic.
Here's arum, arum maculatum, "lords and ladies," or "cuckoo-pint" in this country.
I photographed this thing last week in Dorset.
This thing heats up by about 15 degrees above ambient temperature -- amazing.
And if you look down into it, there's this sort of dam past the spadix, flies get attracted by the heat -- which is boiling off volatile chemicals, little midges -- and they get trapped underneath in this container.
They drink this fabulous nectar and then they're all a bit sticky.
At night they get covered in pollen, which showers down over them, and then the bristles that we saw above, they sort of wilt and allow all these midges out, covered in pollen -- fabulous thing.
Now if you think that's fabulous, this is one of my great favorites.
This is the philodendron selloum.
For anyone here from Brazil, you'll know about this plant.
This is the most amazing thing.
That sort of phallic bit there is about a foot long.
And it does something that no other plant that I know of does, and that is that when it flowers -- that's the spadix in the middle there -- for a period of about two days, it metabolizes in a way which is rather similar to mammals.
So instead of having starch, which is the food of plants, it takes something rather similar to brown fat and burns it at such a rate that it's burning fat, metabolizing, about the rate of a small cat.
And that's twice the energy output, weight for weight, than a hummingbird -- absolutely astonishing.
This thing does something else which is unusual.
Not only will it raise itself to 115 Fahrenheit, 43 or 44 degrees Centigrade, for two days, but it keeps constant temperature.
There's a thermoregulation mechanism in there that keeps constant temperature.
Now why does it do this, I hear you ask.
Now wouldn't you know it, there's some beetles that just love to make love at that temperature.
And they get inside, and they get it all on.
(Laughter) And the plant showers them with pollen, and off they go and pollinate.
And what a wonderful thing it is.
Now most pollinators that we think about are insects, but actually in the tropics, many birds and butterflies pollinate.
And many of the tropical flowers are red, and that's because butterflies and birds see similarly to us, we think, and can see the color red very well.
But if you look at the spectrum, birds and us, we see red, green and blue and see that spectrum.
Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet, and they see various shades of ultraviolet.
So there's something that goes on off the end there.
And wouldn't it be great if we could somehow see what that is, I hear you ask.
Well yes we can.
So what is an insect seeing?
Last week I took these pictures of rock rose, helianthemum, in Dorset.
These are little yellow flowers like we all see, little yellow flowers all over the place.
And this is what it looks like with visible light.
This is what it looks like if you take out the red.
Most bees don't perceive red.
And then I put some ultraviolet filters on my camera and took a very, very long exposure with the particular frequencies of ultraviolet light and this is what I got.
And that's a real fantastic bull's eye.
Now we don't know exactly what a bee sees, any more than you know what I'm seeing when I call this red.
We can't know what's going on in -- let alone an insect's -- another human being's mind.
But the contrast will look something like that, so standing out a lot from the background.
Here's another little flower -- different range of ultraviolet frequencies, different filters to match the pollinators.
And that's the sort of thing that it would be seeing.
Just in case you think that all yellow flowers have this property -- no flower was damaged in the process of this shot; it was just attached to the tripod, not killed -- then under ultraviolet light, look at that.
And that could be the basis of a sunscreen because sunscreens work by absorbing ultraviolet light.
So maybe the chemical in that would be useful.
Finally, there's one of evening primrose that Bjorn Rorslett from Norway sent me -- fantastic hidden pattern.
And I love the idea of something hidden.
I think there's something poetic here, that these pictures taken with ultraviolet filter, the main use of that filter is for astronomers to take pictures of Venus -- actually the clouds of Venus.
That's the main use of that filter.
Venus, of course, is the god of love and fertility, which is the flower story.
And just as flowers spend a lot of effort trying to get pollinators to do their bidding, they've also somehow managed to persuade us to plant great fields full of them and give them to each other at times of birth and death, and particularly at marriage, which, when you think of it, is the moment that encapsulates the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another.
Thank you very much.

In China the Yangtze River had its third flood rise this year
After heavy downpours in the upper waters of the Yangtze River, the longest water artery in China, flood rises occurred for the third time this year.
The flooding was caused by increased water levels in the rivers feeding into its upper waters, which led to a rapid increase in the amount of water entering the reservoir of the Chinese Three Gorges Dam (Sanxia).
At 14:00 on July 26, an inflow of 50,000 cubic m/s into the reservoir was recorded, which, according to predictions, will reach its peak on the evening of July 27 with 60,000 cubic m/s, the Yangtze River Water Resources Committee of China's Ministry of Water Resources reports.
Today the committee released warnings about flood conditions in one of the regions of the Yangtze's upper waters and about the overflowing of the Sanxia reservoir.
I work on helping computers communicate about the world around us.
There are a lot of ways to do this, and I like to focus on helping computers to talk about what they see and understand.
Given a scene like this, a modern computer-vision algorithm can tell you that there's a woman and there's a dog.
It can tell you that the woman is smiling.
It might even be able to tell you that the dog is incredibly cute.
I work on this problem thinking about how humans understand and process the world.
The thoughts, memories and stories that a scene like this might evoke for humans.
All the interconnections of related situations.
Maybe you've seen a dog like this one before, or you've spent time running on a beach like this one, and that further evokes thoughts and memories of a past vacation, past times to the beach, times spent running around with other dogs.
One of my guiding principles is that by helping computers to understand what it's like to have these experiences, to understand what we share and believe and feel, then we're in a great position to start evolving computer technology in a way that's complementary with our own experiences.
So, digging more deeply into this, a few years ago I began working on helping computers to generate human-like stories from sequences of images.
So, one day, I was working with my computer to ask it what it thought about a trip to Australia.
It took a look at the pictures, and it saw a koala.
It didn't know what the koala was, but it said it thought it was an interesting-looking creature.
Then I shared with it a sequence of images about a house burning down.
It took a look at the images and it said, "This is an amazing view! This is spectacular!"
It sent chills down my spine.
It saw a horrible, life-changing and life-destroying event and thought it was something positive.
I realized that it recognized the contrast, the reds, the yellows, and thought it was something worth remarking on positively.
And part of why it was doing this was because most of the images I had given it were positive images.
That's because people tend to share positive images when they talk about their experiences.
When was the last time you saw a selfie at a funeral?
I realized that, as I worked on improving AI task by task, dataset by dataset, that I was creating massive gaps, holes and blind spots in what it could understand.
And while doing so, I was encoding all kinds of biases.
Biases that reflect a limited viewpoint, limited to a single dataset -- biases that can reflect human biases found in the data, such as prejudice and stereotyping.
I thought back to the evolution of the technology that brought me to where I was that day -- how the first color images were calibrated against a white woman's skin, meaning that color photography was biased against black faces.
And that same bias, that same blind spot continued well into the '90s.
And the same blind spot continues even today in how well we can recognize different people's faces in facial recognition technology.
I though about the state of the art in research today, where we tend to limit our thinking to one dataset and one problem.
And that in doing so, we were creating more blind spots and biases that the AI could further amplify.
I realized then that we had to think deeply about how the technology we work on today looks in five years, in 10 years.
Humans evolve slowly, with time to correct for issues in the interaction of humans and their environment.
In contrast, artificial intelligence is evolving at an incredibly fast rate.
And that means that it really matters that we think about this carefully right now -- that we reflect on our own blind spots, our own biases, and think about how that's informing the technology we're creating and discuss what the technology of today will mean for tomorrow.
CEOs and scientists have weighed in on what they think the artificial intelligence technology of the future will be.
Stephen Hawking warns that "Artificial intelligence could end mankind."
Elon Musk warns that it's an existential risk and one of the greatest risks that we face as a civilization.
Bill Gates has made the point, "I don't understand why people aren't more concerned."
But these views -- they're part of the story.
The math, the models, the basic building blocks of artificial intelligence are something that we call access and all work with.
We have open-source tools for machine learning and intelligence that we can contribute to.
And beyond that, we can share our experience.
We can share our experiences with technology and how it concerns us and how it excites us.
We can discuss what we love.
We can communicate with foresight about the aspects of technology that could be more beneficial or could be more problematic over time.
If we all focus on opening up the discussion on AI with foresight towards the future, this will help create a general conversation and awareness about what AI is now, what it can become and all the things that we need to do in order to enable that outcome that best suits us.
We already see and know this in the technology that we use today.
We use smart phones and digital assistants and Roombas.
Are they evil?
Maybe sometimes.
Are they beneficial?
Yes, they're that, too.
And they're not all the same.
And there you already see a light shining on what the future holds.
The future continues on from what we build and create right now.
We set into motion that domino effect that carves out AI's evolutionary path.
In our time right now, we shape the AI of tomorrow.
Technology that immerses us in augmented realities bringing to life past worlds.
Technology that helps people to share their experiences when they have difficulty communicating.
Technology built on understanding the streaming visual worlds used as technology for self-driving cars.
Technology built on understanding images and generating language, evolving into technology that helps people who are visually impaired be better able to access the visual world.
And we also see how technology can lead to problems.
We have technology today that analyzes physical characteristics we're born with -- such as the color of our skin or the look of our face -- in order to determine whether or not we might be criminals or terrorists.
We have technology that crunches through our data, even data relating to our gender or our race, in order to determine whether or not we might get a loan.
All that we see now is a snapshot in the evolution of artificial intelligence.
Because where we are right now, is within a moment of that evolution.
That means that what we do now will affect what happens down the line and in the future.
If we want AI to evolve in a way that helps humans, then we need to define the goals and strategies that enable that path now.
What I'd like to see is something that fits well with humans, with our culture and with the environment.
Technology that aids and assists those of us with neurological conditions or other disabilities in order to make life equally challenging for everyone.
Technology that works regardless of your demographics or the color of your skin.
And so today, what I focus on is the technology for tomorrow and for 10 years from now.
AI can turn out in many different ways.
But in this case, it isn't a self-driving car without any destination.
This is the car that we are driving.
We choose when to speed up and when to slow down.
We choose if we need to make a turn.
We choose what the AI of the future will be.
There's a vast playing field of all the things that artificial intelligence can become.
It will become many things.
And it's up to us now, in order to figure out what we need to put in place to make sure the outcomes of artificial intelligence are the ones that will be better for all of us.
Thank you.

Head of Dagestan Vladimir Vasiliev met with current UFC lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov, reports the site of the head of the republic.
The reason for the meeting was sports venues, the construction of which greatly interested the campion's late father, celebrated Russian trainer Abdulmanap Nurmagomedov.
In particular, the objects in question are a sports venue in the settlement of Dubki in the Kazbekovsky Region and a Center for Athletic Training in the selo of Sildi in the Tsumadinsky Region.
Vladimir Vasilev noted upfront that the construction of these two athletic structures are now also a tribute to the memory of the great trainer.
The father of a small child that was abducted in Salsk disclosed details of the incident
The father of a newborn, who was abducted from a maternity hospital in Salsk in the Rostov Region, disclosed details of the incident.
Alexander Rusikov told the 360 television station that the abductor entered his wife's ward when she was getting ready to go to the lavatory.
The mother of the abducted child cannot believe that a person with evil intentions could be found in a maternity hospital.
The woman was literally a few meters from the ward when she heard a scream from a fellow patient in her ward.
The infant was already gone from the ward.
According to Rusikov, the incident took place between three and four in the morning.
He also added that his wife's ward was located between two nursing posts but no nurses were present when the incident took place.
The abducted child's father also said that the hospital staff provided no comments or apologies.
The newborn boy was taken from the maternity hospital in Salsk on Saturday, he was found later that same day in the Republic of Kalmykia.
A 40-year-old suspect has been apprehended by police.
The child has already been returned to his mother.
Medical personnel ran checks on the infant to confirm that he was healthy and hadn't suffered.

Expert assessed role of vitamins in developing the immune system
Andrey Tyazhelnikov, the Moscow Department of Health’s main freelance specialist in primary health care for adults, assessed the role of vitamins in the development of the immune system.
“It’s impossible to create a stable immune system in a very short time with extra doses of some kind of medicine, vitamins, or food”, he said in his conversation with the Moscow Speaks radio station.
According to him, there are specific rules.
For example, it’s better to spend more time outdoors in the summer, including in the sunshine.
Tyazhelnikov also noted that, if possible, you should consume more seasonally-fresh vegetables and fruits in the summer.
“In general, this strengthens the immune system, giving a certain amount of vitamins and a certain amount of health”, he added.
Tyazhelnikov earlier named several differences between the flu and the coronavirus.
In Russia, 5765 COVID cases have been registered in the past 24 hours

The number of COVID-19 cases worldwide has exceeded 16 million, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
The US accounts for over 4.1 million of them, and Brazil for over 2.3 million.
Russia is in fourth place globally by total number of cases; India holds third place (1.3 million cases).
In total across the globe over 644,000 people have died from coronavirus and over 9.2 million have recovered.
Regional head Igor Kobzev met with mayors of Ust-Orda Buryat Okrug
The main trends of development of remote agricultural territories were discussed during the working meeting that took place at the administration of the Irkutsk Region today, July 24,
During his working trips to the districts of the Ust-Orda Buryat Okrug, the regional head gave a variety of instructions.
Today, the mayors reported on their implementation.
First of all, construction on the Sports House in Ust-Orda was resumed.
The President of the Russian Federation gave the order for this site fourteen years ago.
But only now was the situation able to get going from a dead stop.
866 million rubles will be spent on the construction.
Construction will be completed in 2022.
And a school in the village of Bayanday should begin operating this year.
At the moment, the finishing on the premises has been completed.
Among the remaining works is the landscaping of the territory.
In general, the program of construction of pre-school and secondary education facilities is of special significance for the region.
Especially for your district.
The demographic situation here is the best in the region.
"And we are obligated to create all conditions for the education and leisure of children of all ages", said the acting Governor of the Irkutsk district, Igor Kobzev.
At the meeting, the regional head instructed all the mayors to actively take part in the work on the development of general community plans.
This is one of the main conditions for the comprehensive development of the okrug.
All communities must have established borders and a general plan.
"This is necessary for the development of the territory, for the construction of socially significant sites, as well as infrastructure and cultural heritage sites", the regional head emphasized.
During the conversation, the problematic issue of the 30% reduction in receiving milk from cooperatives was also raised.
This occurred because of the redistribution of milk purchases by the processing plant in favor of peasant farms.
Because of this, the share of products received from cooperatives has decreased.
The regional head instructed the acting Minister of Agriculture to go to the site, study the structure of milk sales, analyze the experience of other territories, and identify possible solutions to the problem.
Kuzminov won the second round of the second stage of the SMP RCRS at Igora Drive.
The second round of the SMP RCRS was held at Igora Drive.
Pavel Kuzminov secured his second consecutive victory.
He began in fifth place, but was already leading by the end of the first lap.
Aleksandr Dudarev, who came in second, rose from sixth place.
Sergei Tikhomirov lost his position, fended off attacks from Aleksandr Chernyak and, at first, solidified his hold on third place, but then received a drive-through penalty and, after a pass through the pit lane, was knocked out of the competition for the podium.
Ivan Pugachev came in third after rising five places.
Moscow regional authorities talk about fate of closed landfills
Landfills of solid household waste continue to be closed in the Moscow Region.
The authorities promise to close the final ones this year.
Some of the 39 existing landfills in the region are being upgraded to modern waste processing plants.
But it isn’t possible for every site – many of them now have a packed residential developments.
After a landfill is closed, reclamation begins – the site is filled in with soil, and degassing and infiltration removal systems are installed.
This allows the chemical processes inside the landfill to stop so it doesn’t ignite, emit a foul odor, or poison the soil and groundwater.
And then the former landfill remains a towering, useless heap amidst the surrounding residential development.
Why not make something useful out of it?
For example, in Ruza, where the reclamation of the Annino landfill was finished literally just a few days ago, the authorities are considering the possibility of making a ski slope out of the heap.
This landfill, which operated from 1976 to 2016, expanded so much that it went beyond the confines of the land allotted for it.
Thus, during reclamation, they had to buy out the neighboring plots, de facto already filled to the brim with garbage long ago.
“Some time will pass, the landfill will ‘settle down’, it’ll gain strength, and we’ll think about what we can do to make it useful.
A ski resort really stands out”, Nikolay Parfenov, the head of the Ruza District, told journalists.
Two landfills will become sites for producing renewable energy sources
The Torbeevo landfill in Lyubertsy and the Timokhovo landfill in the Bogorodsk District will become sites for producing renewable energy sources from landfill and biological gases.
By the end of the year, a gas-piston power plant will be launched on the territory of Torbeevo, capable of generating up to 8 million kilowatt-hours of electricity a year and about 0.95 gigacalories of thermal energy, which will provide for the site’s own needs – heat supply to the administrative and industrial facilities.
Timokhovo will produce 72.5 million kilowatt-hours and continue to operate as a waste processing plant.
And at the Kuchino landfill in Balashikha, which was closed after residents complained about it on Direct Line with the president of the country, a museum could be opened.
“There was an idea of building a museum of landfill reclamation in the Moscow Region”, said Dmitry Kurakin, the Deputy Chairman of the administration – regional Minister of Ecology and Nature Management.
Israel reported drone crash in southern Lebanon
An Israeli military drone fell in the south of Lebanon.
The armed forces said it crashed "during operational activity".
The reasons for the craft's crash were not given.
"Some time ago during operational activity at the border with Lebanon an Israeli military drone fell in Lebanese territory.
"There is no risk of an information leak," says an Israeli army statement in Twitter.
To recap, this week the Israeli army decided to strengthen its military units on the border with Lebanon, fearing retaliation from the Lebanese Hezbollah movement for the killing of one of its fighters in Syria.
Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah promised not to leave the death of any of its "brothers" unanswered.
Read more about the situation in the Kommersant report "Israel awaits revenge from Hezbollah".
Furgal's replacement met protesters for the first time
Acting Khabarovsk Krai Governor Mikhail Degtyaryov for the first time since his appointment met participants of protests in support of the arrested former governor of the region, Sergei Furgal.
The meeting was broadcast on his Instagram feed.
"Moscow hears you all, that's why it has sent you an acting governor, so the region doesn't slide downhill without leadership... I will repeat one more time: he is 'a' – my comrade, 'b' – my fellow party member, 'c' – I am very concerned about his fate, the party is providing him with assistance, food, Zhirinovsky is knocking on all doors," said the acting governor.
According to Degtyaryov, Khabarovsk Krai cannot remain without leadership at present, which is why President Vladimir Putin issued the decree naming him head of the region, so that the "wonderful building [the territory's government] could function, everything could work, the budget could be spent on social needs."
The acting governor explained that he had not met with the protesters earlier, because he cannot converse with thousands of protesters.
That is why he is broadcasting on social networks and reads all the comments addressed to him.
Two consecutive protests took place in Khabarovsk on July 25.
Protests in support of the former governor have been taking place since July 11.
On the eve of the latest protest, Mikhail Degtyaryov announced that he was leaving the city on the day of the protest.
His motorcade was blocked by protestors who called for him to speak out on the fate of the arrested former governor Furgal.
Degtyaryov refused to meet with the protest participants earlier.
"There is actually something for the leader to do other than meet and talk with those who are shouting from under the window," said the acting governor.
Today I'd like to show you the future of the way we make things.
I believe that soon our buildings and machines will be self-assembling, replicating and repairing themselves.
So I'm going to show you what I believe is the current state of manufacturing, and then compare that to some natural systems.
So in the current state of manufacturing, we have skyscrapers -- two and a half years [of assembly time], 500,000 to a million parts, fairly complex, new, exciting technologies in steel, concrete, glass.
We have exciting machines that can take us into space -- five years [of assembly time], 2.5 million parts.
But on the other side, if you look at the natural systems, we have proteins that have two million types, can fold in 10,000 nanoseconds, or DNA with three billion base pairs we can replicate in roughly an hour.
So there's all of this complexity in our natural systems, but they're extremely efficient, far more efficient than anything we can build, far more complex than anything we can build.
They're far more efficient in terms of energy.
They hardly ever make mistakes.
And they can repair themselves for longevity.
So there's something super interesting about natural systems.
And if we can translate that into our built environment, then there's some exciting potential for the way that we build things.
And I think the key to that is self-assembly.
So if we want to utilize self-assembly in our physical environment, I think there's four key factors.
The first is that we need to decode all of the complexity of what we want to build -- so our buildings and machines.
And we need to decode that into simple sequences -- basically the DNA of how our buildings work.
Then we need programmable parts that can take that sequence and use that to fold up, or reconfigure.
We need some energy that's going to allow that to activate, allow our parts to be able to fold up from the program.
And we need some type of error correction redundancy to guarantee that we have successfully built what we want.
So I'm going to show you a number of projects that my colleagues and I at MIT are working on to achieve this self-assembling future.
The first two are the MacroBot and DeciBot.
So these projects are large-scale reconfigurable robots -- 8 ft., 12 ft. long proteins.
They're embedded with mechanical electrical devices, sensors.
You decode what you want to fold up into, into a sequence of angles -- so negative 120, negative 120, 0, 0, 120, negative 120 -- something like that; so a sequence of angles, or turns, and you send that sequence through the string.
Each unit takes its message -- so negative 120 -- it rotates to that, checks if it got there and then passes it to its neighbor.
So these are the brilliant scientists, engineers, designers that worked on this project.
And I think it really brings to light: Is this really scalable?
I mean, thousands of dollars, lots of man hours made to make this eight-foot robot.
Can we really scale this up? Can we really embed robotics into every part?
The next one questions that and looks at passive nature, or passively trying to have reconfiguration programmability.
But it goes a step further, and it tries to have actual computation.
It basically embeds the most fundamental building block of computing, the digital logic gate, directly into your parts.
So this is a NAND gate.
You have one tetrahedron which is the gate that's going to do your computing, and you have two input tetrahedrons.
One of them is the input from the user, as you're building your bricks.
The other one is from the previous brick that was placed.
And then it gives you an output in 3D space.
So what this means is that the user can start plugging in what they want the bricks to do.
It computes on what it was doing before and what you said you wanted it to do.
And now it starts moving in three-dimensional space -- so up or down.
So on the left-hand side, [1,1] input equals 0 output, which goes down.
On the right-hand side, [0,0] input is a 1 output, which goes up.
And so what that really means is that our structures now contain the blueprints of what we want to build.
So they have all of the information embedded in them of what was constructed.
So that means that we can have some form of self-replication.
In this case I call it self-guided replication, because your structure contains the exact blueprints.
If you have errors, you can replace a part.
All the local information is embedded to tell you how to fix it.
So you could have something that climbs along and reads it and can output at one to one.
It's directly embedded; there's no external instructions.
So the last project I'll show is called Biased Chains, and it's probably the most exciting example that we have right now of passive self-assembly systems.
So it takes the reconfigurability and programmability and makes it a completely passive system.
So basically you have a chain of elements.
Each element is completely identical, and they're biased.
So each chain, or each element, wants to turn right or left.
So as you assemble the chain, you're basically programming it.
You're telling each unit if it should turn right or left.
So when you shake the chain, it then folds up into any configuration that you've programmed in -- so in this case, a spiral, or in this case, two cubes next to each other.
So you can basically program any three-dimensional shape -- or one-dimensional, two-dimensional -- up into this chain completely passively.
So what does this tell us about the future?
I think that it's telling us that there's new possibilities for self-assembly, replication, repair in our physical structures, our buildings, machines.
There's new programmability in these parts.
And from that you have new possibilities for computing.
We'll have spatial computing.
Imagine if our buildings, our bridges, machines, all of our bricks could actually compute.
That's amazing parallel and distributed computing power, new design possibilities.
So it's exciting potential for this.
So I think these projects I've showed here are just a tiny step towards this future, if we implement these new technologies for a new self-assembling world.
Thank you.

which linked the Vatican with Nazi Germany.
This week marks another anniversary: 87 years since the settlement of the contract between the Vatican and Nazi Germany.
This document, which was signed several months after Hitler came to power, was the basis on which the Holy See and the fascists built their relations.
One of the people who readied the contract was Cardinal Pacelli, who became Pope Pius XII six years prior to the beginning of World War II.
In Sochi, the bed of a dump truck fell on the driver's cabin of a truck, killing the driver.

In the recording, the raised bed of the dump truck can be seen crashing downwards, directly onto the cabin of the truck, while conducting unloading operations.
According to the Russian Ministry for Emergency Situations, the 59-year-old man behind the wheel died on the spot from his injuries.
The assistance of rescuers was needed to recover the body of the victim.
Attractive, tall minarets only made Hagia Sophia more beautiful
Again about Hagia Sophia - I came across a text from Fr. Vladimir Zelensky that supposedly needs to be protested.
First, the entrance is now free - hooray!
I haven't been to Istanbul, but a free entrance to the House of God is better than for a fee.
Second, the Muslims conquered this land just as fairly as the Orthodox conquered the Vola-Oka interfluve, the Muslim Caucasus (and set up a church in Grozny), and planted apple trees on Mars.
Godspeed!
The Jews conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans conquered America.
Are we going to give everything back to everyone?
Don't you think there will be pagans who will demand the return of their temple where the Tithes Church is?
Third, the Muslims have improved this building and invested in it.
That is, it is theirs, just as the factories and estates that the Leninists took for their own from the bourgeoisie belong to the Leninists - to Putin and other nomenclature.
They improved everything - from the Kremlin to the Angara, so it's all theirs by right of the progressors.
The attractive, tall minarets beautified Hagia Sophia very, very much.
There was a stupid inkwell, and it became a stupid inkwell with beautiful minarets.
Fourth, there are no "Islamic" or "Orthodox" civilizations.
There are believers, there are hypocrites, and there are sanctimonious people who combine faith and hypocrisy.
The believer doesn't think in terms of civilization.
This is the thinking of the official of the British Foreign Ministry Toynbee, but a believer is ashamed to think this way.
For a believer, everywhere is a place of prayer.
And always.
The only place a believer doesn't pray is somewhere he's asked to leave - he goes somewhere else and prays there.
He is a believer, not a fighter.
We're koloboks, not gloomy stones.

The atmospheric pressure will be on the rise throughout the day.
A camera "passed under a ship" during the Navy Day parade telecast
On Victory Day a camera also flew through the barrel of a tank
The parade to mark Navy Day takes place today, July 26, in Saint Petersburg.
During filming, one of the cameras shooting the vessels "passed under a ship".
New filming technology gave viewers the chance to see the underwater part of the parade.
The passage of the new-series small missile ship Sovetsk was shown from the same angle.
It passed along the Admiralty Embankment.
To recap, at the June 24 parade to mark the 75th anniversary of Victory, a camera passed through the barrel into the turret of one of the tanks and showed what equipment is inside the grand military machine.
A record amount of military hardware took part in that jubilee Victory parade – 234 military vehicles.
Stunning novelties were shown as they entered the country's main square for the first time, such as the modernized T-90M and T-80BVM main battle tanks.
Also on Red Square for the first time on June 24 were updated BMP-2 infantry fighting vehicles with the Berezhok turret.
Almost half of Britons believe the Kremlin interfered in the Brexit referendum
Almost half of Britons – 49% – believe that Russia tried to influence the course of the 2016 referendum on Great Britain's exit from the European Union.
The Guardian reports this with reference to the results of a survey conducted by the company Opinium.
It is reported that 23% of those surveyed hold the opposite opinion on this question.
47% of respondents also believe that the Kremlin also interfered in Great Britain's general elections in 2019.
July ends with heat, August starts off cool
Moscow and the region experienced July's coldest night on the weekend.
Of course, there was no icy apocalypse to freeze body and soul.
But for the peak of summer it was chilly.
Before describing the weather in Moscow from July 27–August 2, it is worth noting that on the night leading into Saturday, July 25, the air cooled to +8.8 degrees in the capital.
In Kolomna, a new temperature record was even set: +7 degrees (the previous minimum for July 25 had held its position since 1964, more than a half-century).
The outer-Moscow apex of cold was Cherusti – there the thermometer showed +3.9 degrees.
However, it will be quite comfortable in the daytime on Saturday and Sunday.
But it will still be 2–3 degrees cooler than the climatic norm.
During the week, not just warmth but real heat will return to Moscow.
On Monday, July 27, the Russian Hydrometeorological Center forecasts +26 degrees, on Tuesday and Wednesday +28 to +29, and +26 on Thursday, July 30.
There will be brief showers every day, with storms mid-week.
The last day of July and the first days of August (that is, next weekend) will be cool, no more than +19 to +24 degrees.
There will be no avoiding rain.
Immigrant from Rwanda admitted he set fire to the cathedral in Nantes
An immigrant from Rwanda, who was working in the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul in the French city Nantes on a volunteer basis, admitted to arson a week after the fire.
The France-3 TV channel reported this on Sunday.
According to its information, the man, who had already been arrested on July 19, the day after the fire, was detained again the day before.
On Saturday evening he appeared before the investigating judge.
After being charged with deliberate damage to property the man admitted that he set fires in three places – under the main organ, under the small organ and near the electrical panel.
He now faces up to 10 years' imprisonment and a 150,000-euro fine.
The 39-year-old Rwandan immigrant's motives have not been reported.
It is only known that he was voluntarily helping in the cathedral and on the day of the fire he was supposed to close its doors.
But according to surveillance camera footage, he left the religious establishment 15 minutes after the calls were received about the fire in the building.
The fire in the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul occurred on July 18.
More than 200 firefighters spent several hours fighting for the Gothic architectural landmark.
Nonetheless, they were unable to save the stained glass windows from Louis XII's times and a unique organ of the Baroque era.
The situation was only brought under control three hours after the fire started.
Nobody was hurt as a result of the incident.
The latest fire is not the first during the cathedral's existence.
In 1972 a fire destroyed its roof.
Liquidating the consequences of that blaze took 13 years.
The cathedral was reopened to visitors only in 1985.
Legendary goalie and traveller Pfannenstiel may become a scout for Inter Milan
German ex-goalie Luz Pfannenstiel may join the staff of Inter Milan.
Kicker reports that the 47-year-old specialist was offered a position as head of the scouting division.
Pfannenstiel occupied a similar position with Fortuna Düsseldorf from December 2018 through May 2020, and before that he worked with Hoffenheim.
During his time as a football player, Pfannenstiel became known for his frequent transfers.
He is the only professional player to have played for all six FIFA associations, and he transferred between over 20 clubs, among them representatives of the championships in Singapore, South Africa, New Zealand, Canada, Namibia, and a number of other countries.
Many believe driving is an activity solely reserved for those who can see.
A blind person driving a vehicle safely and independently was thought to be an impossible task, until now.
Hello, my name is Dennis Hong, and we're bringing freedom and independence to the blind by building a vehicle for the visually impaired.
So before I talk about this car for the blind, let me briefly tell you about another project that I worked on called the DARPA Urban Challenge.
Now this was about building a robotic car that can drive itself.
You press start, nobody touches anything, and it can reach its destination fully autonomously.
So in 2007, our team won half a million dollars by placing third place in this competition.
So about that time, the National Federation of the Blind, or NFB, challenged the research committee about who can develop a car that lets a blind person drive safely and independently.
We decided to give it a try, because we thought, "Hey, how hard could it be?"
We have already an autonomous vehicle.
We just put a blind person in it and we're done, right?
(Laughter) We couldn't have been more wrong.
What NFB wanted was not a vehicle that can drive a blind person around, but a vehicle where a blind person can make active decisions and drive.
So we had to throw everything out the window and start from scratch.
So to test this crazy idea, we developed a small dune buggy prototype vehicle to test the feasibility.
And in the summer of 2009, we invited dozens of blind youth from all over the country and gave them a chance to take it for a spin.
It was an absolutely amazing experience.
But the problem with this car was it was designed to only be driven in a very controlled environment, in a flat, closed-off parking lot -- even the lanes defined by red traffic cones.
So with this success, we decided to take the next big step, to develop a real car that can be driven on real roads.
So how does it work?
Well, it's a rather complex system, but let me try to explain it, maybe simplify it.
So we have three steps.
We have perception, computation and non-visual interfaces.
Now obviously the driver cannot see, so the system needs to perceive the environment and gather information for the driver.
For that, we use an initial measurement unit.
So it measures acceleration, angular acceleration -- like a human ear, inner ear.
We fuse that information with a GPS unit to get an estimate of the location of the car.
We also use two cameras to detect the lanes of the road.
And we also use three laser range finders.
The lasers scan the environment to detect obstacles -- a car approaching from the front, the back and also any obstacles that run into the roads, any obstacles around the vehicle.
So all this vast amount of information is then fed into the computer, and the computer can do two things.
One is, first of all, process this information to have an understanding of the environment -- these are the lanes of the road, there's the obstacles -- and convey this information to the driver.
The system is also smart enough to figure out the safest way to operate the car.
So we can also generate instructions on how to operate the controls of the vehicle.
But the problem is this: How do we convey this information and instructions to a person who cannot see fast enough and accurate enough so he can drive?
So for this, we developed many different types of non-visual user interface technology.
So starting from a three-dimensional ping sound system, a vibrating vest, a click wheel with voice commands, a leg strip, even a shoe that applies pressure to the foot.
But today we're going to talk about three of these non-visual user interfaces.
Now the first interface is called a DriveGrip.
So these are a pair of gloves, and it has vibrating elements on the knuckle part so you can convey instructions about how to steer -- the direction and the intensity.
Another device is called SpeedStrip.
So this is a chair -- as a matter of fact, it's actually a massage chair.
We gut it out, and we rearrange the vibrating elements in different patterns, and we actuate them to convey information about the speed, and also instructions how to use the gas and the brake pedal.
So over here, you can see how the computer understands the environment, and because you cannot see the vibration, we actually put red LED's on the driver so that you can see what's happening.
This is the sensory data, and that data is transferred to the devices through the computer.
So these two devices, DriveGrip and SpeedStrip, are very effective.
But the problem is these are instructional cue devices.
So this is not really freedom, right?
The computer tells you how to drive -- turn left, turn right, speed up, stop.
We call this the "backseat-driver problem."
So we're moving away from the instructional cue devices, and we're now focusing more on the informational devices.
A good example for this informational non-visual user interface is called AirPix.
So think of it as a monitor for the blind.
So it's a small tablet, has many holes in it, and compressed air comes out, so it can actually draw images.
So even though you are blind, you can put your hand over it, you can see the lanes of the road and obstacles.
Actually, you can also change the frequency of the air coming out and possibly the temperature.
So it's actually a multi-dimensional user interface.
So here you can see the left camera, the right camera from the vehicle and how the computer interprets that and sends that information to the AirPix.
For this, we're showing a simulator, a blind person driving using the AirPix.
This simulator was also very useful for training the blind drivers and also quickly testing different types of ideas for different types of non-visual user interfaces.
So basically that's how it works.
But this vehicle is a prototype vehicle, and it's not going to be on the road until it's proven as safe as, or safer than, today's vehicle.
And I truly believe that this can happen.
But still, will the society, would they accept such a radical idea?
How are we going to handle insurance?
How are we going to issue driver's licenses?
There's many of these different kinds of hurdles besides technology challenges that we need to address before this becomes a reality.
Of course, the main goal of this project is to develop a car for the blind.
But potentially more important than this is the tremendous value of the spin-off technology that can come from this project.
The sensors that are used can see through the dark, the fog and rain.
And together with this new type of interfaces, we can use these technologies and apply them to safer cars for sighted people.
Or for the blind, everyday home appliances -- in the educational setting, in the office setting.
Just imagine, in a classroom a teacher writes on the blackboard and a blind student can see what's written and read using these non-visual interfaces.
This is priceless.
So today, the things I've showed you today, is just the beginning.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Second trailer for Bill and Ted with Keanu Reeves released
The second trailer for the third part of the Bill and Ted franchise was posted on the Orion Pictures film studio's YouTube channel.
The trailer reveals some details of how these best buds are living now: they've settled in a suburban area, married to their girlfriends Joanna (Jayma Mays) and Elizabeth (Erinn Hayes) from Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure (1989), and what's more, these tireless adventure-seekers have been raising daughters for many years now.
Brigette Lundy-Paine (The Glass Castle, Atypical) plays Ted's daughter Billie, and Samara Weaving (Ready or Not) - Bill's daughter Thea (yes, Bill and Ted made a pun naming their daughters Billie and Thea).
On top of all that, one more great adventure awaits them: they have to go to the future to steal their own song - it's the only way to save the whole world.
In the trailer, you can also see the American rapper Kid Cudi and William Sadler (August Rush, Hard to Kill, The Green Mile), in the role of Death again.
The film was initially set to be released on August 21, but the date was pushed to September 1.
The filmmakers reportedly don't intend to reschedule the film release again.
The film will also be immediately available online.
Earlier, we wrote that Keanu Reeves will be the writer for a comic about the demigod Berzerker.
I want to ask you all to consider for a second the very simple fact that, by far, most of what we know about the universe comes to us from light.
We can stand on the Earth and look up at the night sky and see stars with our bare eyes.
The Sun burns our peripheral vision.
We see light reflected off the Moon.
And in the time since Galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope at the celestial bodies, the known universe has come to us through light, across vast eras in cosmic history.
And with all of our modern telescopes, we've been able to collect this stunning silent movie of the universe -- these series of snapshots that go all the way back to the Big Bang.
And yet, the universe is not a silent movie because the universe isn't silent.
I'd like to convince you that the universe has a soundtrack and that soundtrack is played on space itself, because space can wobble like a drum.
It can ring out a kind of recording throughout the universe of some of the most dramatic events as they unfold.
Now we'd like to be able to add to a kind of glorious visual composition that we have of the universe -- a sonic composition.
And while we've never heard the sounds from space, we really should, in the next few years, start to turn up the volume on what's going on out there.
So in this ambition to capture songs from the universe, we turn our focus to black holes and the promise they have, because black holes can bang on space-time like mallets on a drum and have a very characteristic song, which I'd like to play for you -- some of our predictions for what that song will be like.
We might one day see a shadow a black hole can cast on a very bright background, but we haven't yet.
And yet black holes may be heard even if they're not seen, and that's because they bang on space-time like a drum.
Now we owe the idea that space can ring like a drum to Albert Einstein -- to whom we owe so much.
Einstein realized that if space were empty, if the universe were empty, it would be like this picture, except for maybe without the helpful grid drawn on it.
But if we were freely falling through the space, even without this helpful grid, we might be able to paint it ourselves, because we would notice that we traveled along straight lines, undeflected straight paths through the universe.
Einstein also realized -- and this is the real meat of the matter -- that if you put energy or mass in the universe, it would curve space, and a freely falling object would pass by, let's say, the Sun and it would be deflected along the natural curves in the space.
It was Einstein's great general theory of relativity.
Now even light will be bent by those paths.
And you can be bent so much that you're caught in orbit around the Sun, as the Earth is, or the Moon around the Earth.
These are the natural curves in space.
What Einstein did not realize was that, if you took our Sun and you crushed it down to six kilometers -- so you took a million times the mass of the Earth and you crushed it to six kilometers across, you would make a black hole, an object so dense that if light veered too close, it would never escape -- a dark shadow against the universe.
But Einstein always thought black holes were a mathematical oddity.
He did not believe they existed in nature.
He thought nature would protect us from their formation.
It was decades before the term "black hole" was coined and people realized that black holes are real astrophysical objects -- in fact they're the death state of very massive stars that collapse catastrophically at the end of their lifetime.
Now our Sun will not collapse to a black hole.
It's actually not massive enough.
But if we did a little thought experiment -- as Einstein was very fond of doing -- we could imagine putting the Sun crushed down to six kilometers, and putting a tiny little Earth around it in orbit, maybe 30 kilometers outside of the black-hole sun.
And it would be self-illuminated, because now the Sun's gone, we have no other source of light -- so let's make our little Earth self-illuminated.
And you would realize you could put the Earth in a happy orbit even 30 km outside of this crushed black hole.
This crushed black hole actually would fit inside Manhattan, more or less.
It might spill off into the Hudson a little bit before it destroyed the Earth.
But basically that's what we're talking about.
We're talking about an object that you could crush down to half the square area of Manhattan.
So we move this Earth very close -- 30 kilometers outside -- and we notice it's perfectly fine orbiting around the black hole.
There's a sort of myth that black holes devour everything in the universe, but you actually have to get very close to fall in.
But what's very impressive is that, from our vantage point, we can always see the Earth.
It cannot hide behind the black hole.
The light from the Earth, some of it falls in, but some of it gets lensed around and brought back to us.
So you can't hide anything behind a black hole.
If this were Battlestar Galactica and you're fighting the Cylons, don't hide behind the black hole.
They can see you.
Now, our Sun will not collapse to a black hole -- it's not massive enough -- but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
And if one were to eclipse the Milky Way, this is what it would look like.
We would see a shadow of that black hole against the hundred billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy and its luminous dust lanes.
And if we were to fall towards this black hole, we would see all of that light lensed around it, and we could even start to cross into that shadow and really not notice that anything dramatic had happened.
It would be bad if we tried to fire our rockets and get out of there because we couldn't, anymore than light can escape.
But even though the black hole is dark from the outside, it's not dark on the inside, because all of the light from the galaxy can fall in behind us.
And even though, due to a relativistic effect known as time dilation, our clocks would seem to slow down relative to galactic time, it would look as though the evolution of the galaxy had been sped up and shot at us, right before we were crushed to death by the black hole.
It would be like a near-death experience where you see the light at the end of the tunnel, but it's a total death experience.
(Laughter) And there's no way of telling anybody about the light at the end of the tunnel.
Now we've never seen a shadow like this of a black hole, but black holes can be heard, even if they're not seen.
Imagine now taking an astrophysically realistic situation -- imagine two black holes that have lived a long life together.
Maybe they started as stars and collapsed to two black holes -- each one 10 times the mass of the Sun.
So now we're going to crush them down to 60 kilometers across.
They can be spinning hundreds of times a second.
At the end of their lives, they're going around each other very near the speed of light.
So they're crossing thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second, and as they do so, they not only curve space, but they leave behind in their wake a ringing of space, an actual wave on space-time.
Space squeezes and stretches as it emanates out from these black holes banging on the universe.
And they travel out into the cosmos at the speed of light.
This computer simulation is due to a relativity group at NASA Goddard.
It took almost 30 years for anyone in the world to crack this problem.
This was one of the groups.
It shows two black holes in orbit around each other, again, with these helpfully painted curves.
And if you can see -- it's kind of faint -- but if you can see the red waves emanating out, those are the gravitational waves.
They're literally the sounds of space ringing, and they will travel out from these black holes at the speed of light as they ring down and coalesce to one spinning, quiet black hole at the end of the day.
If you were standing near enough, your ear would resonate with the squeezing and stretching of space.
You would literally hear the sound.
Now of course, your head would be squeezed and stretched unhelpfully, so you might have trouble understanding what's going on.
But I'd like to play for you the sound that we predict.
This is from my group -- a slightly less glamorous computer modeling.
Imagine a lighter black hole falling into a very heavy black hole.
The sound you're hearing is the light black hole banging on space each time it gets close.
If it gets far away, it's a little too quiet.
But it comes in like a mallet, and it literally cracks space, wobbling it like a drum.
And we can predict what the sound will be.
We know that, as it falls in, it gets faster and it gets louder.
And eventually, we're going to hear the little guy just fall into the bigger guy.
Now I've never heard it that loud -- it's actually more dramatic.
At home it sounds kind of anticlimactic.
It's sort of like ding, ding, ding.
This is another sound from my group.
No, I'm not showing you any images, because black holes don't leave behind helpful trails of ink, and space is not painted, showing you the curves.
But if you were to float by in space on a space holiday and you heard this, you want to get moving.
(Laughter) Want to get away from the sound.
Both black holes are moving.
Both black holes are getting closer together.
In this case, they're both wobbling quite a lot.
And then they're going to merge.
Now that chirp is very characteristic of black holes merging -- that it chirps up at the end.
Now that's our prediction for what we'll see.
Luckily we're at this safe distance in Long Beach, California.
And surely, somewhere in the universe two black holes have merged.
And surely, the space around us is ringing after traveling maybe a million light years, or a million years, at the speed of light to get to us.
But the sound is too quiet for any of us to ever hear.
There are very industrious experiments being built on Earth -- one called LIGO -- which will detect deviations in the squeezing and stretching of space at less than the fraction of a nucleus of an atom over four kilometers.
It's a remarkably ambitious experiment, and it's going to be at advanced sensitivity within the next few years -- to pick this up.
There's also a mission proposed for space, which hopefully will launch in the next ten years, called LISA.
And LISA will be able to see super-massive black holes -- black holes millions or billions of times the mass of the Sun.
In this Hubble image, we see two galaxies.
They look like they're frozen in some embrace.
And each one probably harbors a super-massive black hole at its core.
But they're not frozen; they're actually merging.
These two black holes are colliding, and they will merge over a billion-year time scale.
It's beyond our human perception to pick up a song of that duration.
But LISA could see the final stages of two super-massive black holes earlier in the universe's history, the last 15 minutes before they fall together.
And it's not just black holes, but it's also any big disturbance in the universe -- and the biggest of them all is the Big Bang.
When that expression was coined, it was derisive -- like, "Oh, who would believe in a Big Bang?"
This animation from my friends at Proton Studios shows looking at the Big Bang from the outside.
We don't ever want to do that actually. We want to be inside the universe because there's no such thing as standing outside the universe.
So imagine you're inside the Big Bang.
It's everywhere, it's all around you, and the space is wobbling chaotically.
Fourteen billion years pass and this song is still ringing all around us.
Galaxies form, and generations of stars form in those galaxies, and around one star, at least one star, is a habitable planet.
And here we are frantically building these experiments, doing these calculations, writing these computer codes.
Imagine a billion years ago, two black holes collided.
That song has been ringing through space for all that time.
We weren't even here.
It gets closer and closer -- 40,000 years ago, we're still doing cave paintings.
If it was the Big Bang we were going to pick up, it would sound like this.
It's literally the definition of noise.
It's white noise; it's such a chaotic ringing.
But it's around us everywhere, presumably, if it hasn't been wiped out by some other process in the universe.
And if we pick it up, it will be music to our ears because it will be the quiet echo of that moment of our creation, of our observable universe.
So within the next few years, we'll be able to turn up the soundtrack a little bit, render the universe in audio.
But if we detect those earliest moments, it'll bring us that much closer to an understanding of the Big Bang, which brings us that much closer to asking some of the hardest, most elusive, questions.
If we run the movie of our universe backwards, we know that there was a Big Bang in our past, and we might even hear the cacophonous sound of it, but was our Big Bang the only Big Bang?
I mean we have to ask, has it happened before?
Will it happen again?
I mean, in the spirit of rising to TED's challenge to reignite wonder, we can ask questions, at least for this last minute, that honestly might evade us forever.
But we have to ask: Is it possible that our universe is just a plume off of some greater history?
Or, is it possible that we're just a branch off of a multiverse -- each branch with its own Big Bang in its past -- maybe some of them with black holes playing drums, maybe some without -- maybe some with sentient life, and maybe some without -- not in our past, not in our future, but somehow fundamentally connected to us?
So we have to wonder, if there is a multiverse, in some other patch of that multiverse, are there creatures?
Here's my multiverse creatures.
Are there other creatures in the multiverse, wondering about us and wondering about their own origins?
And if they are, I can imagine them as we are, calculating, writing computer code, building instruments, trying to detect that faintest sound of their origins and wondering who else is out there.
Thank you. Thank you.
(Applause)
Minneapolis residents create street patrol detachments
Detachments are being created to patrol the streets in Minneapolis, The Wall Street Journal reports.
Local residents want to help the police.
Some of the volunteer citizen patrollers are armed.
The armed citizens insist that they will not open fire, and that this would be possible only in cases of extreme necessity.
According to the journalists' information, the creation of these patrols is linked to police budget cuts.
The organs of law and order will receive $10 mln less each year (this amount may be reduced).
The previous law enforcement budget was $193 mln.
The Minneapolis city council took this decision after the death of George Floyd and the demonstrations against police brutality of the past two months.
Original drawing of Olympic rings sold at auction for €185 thousand
The original drawing of the Olympic rings by the founder of the modern Olympic Games, Pierre de Coubertin, was sold at auction for €185 thousand.
The drawing was done on a white canvas measuring 21 x 27.5 cm and is the interweaving of five rings of various colors - blue, yellow, black, green, and red.
The first modern Olympic Games were held in 1896 in Athens.
Dynamo won’t extend contract with Panchenko
Forward Kirill Panchenko is leaving Moscow Dynamo because his contract is coming to an end.
According to one source, the club has already informed the soccer player of its decision.
30-year-old Panchenko spent four seasons with Dynamo, scoring 37 goals in 103 matches.
Dynamo Moscow earlier presented its uniform for next season.
City and Real may play the return match of the Champions League 1/8 final in Manchester
The British newspaper The Guardian reports that Manchester City and Real Madrid may end up playing the August 7th return match of the Champions League 1/8 final in Manchester at the Etihad Stadium.
Yesterday, on July 25th, the government of the United Kingdom adopted a resolution stating that all individuals arriving to Great Britain from Spain must undergo a 14-day quarantine due to a new uptick in the coronavirus pandemic.
For Real, however, an exception will be made.
Earlier, Great Britain's Culture Secretary Oliver Dauden announced the possibility that quarantine measures would be relaxed for sports teams and film crews.
In February, Real succumbed to Manchester City on their home field with a score of 1–2.
The return match is planned for August 7th.
The presidents of Russia and Ukraine discussed the implementation of an armistice in Donbass

A call to take part in the "Buy from grandma" movement appeared on one of Tyumen's public pages.
The organizers are putting out a call to buy vegetables, flowers, and fruits from elderly ladies, grown by them in their own gardens, and not to haggle.
The author of the post even gave an example, providing a real address where an elderly lady sells cherries.
But residents of Tyumen soon erupted with irate comments.
"I saw with my own two eyes how a seller from a neighboring country came right up to an old woman and gave her a new batch of goods 'from grandma's garden' to sell.
Be careful about what you buy!!!" wrote Nadezhda Grigoreva, sharing her observations.
"More than once I've seen them get herbs from sellers who come from neighboring countries, and then sell them.
I don't trust them." Larisa Kharlamova agreed.
"Not long ago I saw that an only woman had victoria "shimmer"; we couldn't get it to grow in our garden. I ask, 'Is that from your garden?'
'Yes!'
I bought it, it tasted awful, simply no way it was fresh from a garden. Then I see these "yeses" on every corner; the old lady fooled me—she really got it from someone else," Tatyana Krasilnikova said about her experience.
That being said, users underscore that they are not calling on people to not make purchases from elderly ladies, but are just sharing their opinions and advising others to pay attention to the quality of the products.
Residents of the Tyumen region are celebrating the Year of Remembrance and Glory in an offline format.

decision to expand RPL wouldn't be supported by either EUFA or FIFA
The president of the Russian Football Union (RFU), Alexander Dyukov, believes it would be inappropriate to expand the Russian Premier League (RPL) to 18 teams at the moment.
"First of all, it was the decision of the RPL, but I'll agree with it, because it's wrong to change the rules after the tournament's over.
It violates the integrity of the tournament and the principle of fair play.
And, of course, this decision wouldn't be supported by either EUFA or FIFA", Dyukov said after the final of the Russian Cup, Zenit - Khimki (1:0).
The RPL currently includes 16 clubs, but the possibility of increasing the number of teams to 18 was considered.

Kirilenko shared memories of NBA games with Bryant and Jordan
The head of the Russian Basketball Federation (RBF) Andrey Kirilenko shared memories of National Basketball Association (NBA) games against the legendary Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan.
I knew not to offend Bryant’s ego with any trash talk, so as not to encourage his athlete’s rage.
Kobe had a killer instinct, so I tried to talk to him on the court in such a way that he wouldn’t take the game so aggressively.
I would give him compliments on the court: “Oh!
Kobe, good shot, great pass!
Hearing my enthusiastic responses, he would forget a little bit that he had to get the ball again and score another 3 – 4 points.
Kobe and I communicated well”, Vechernyaya Moskva quotes Kirilenko as saying.
He also spoke about his first game against Jordan.
“I was guarding him.
For the first three minutes of the game, I was running around delighted at having a legend next to me whom I had only seen on TV.
While I was still unable to breathe for joy, Michael scored several points.
Soon I calmed down, I blocked his shots a couple of times…
My team won the game, but Jordan still scored 44 points”, the head of the RBF added.
Kirilenko spent 12 seasons in the NBA.
He was chosen 24th overall by the Utah Jazz in the 1999 draft.
Besides Utah, where he spent ten seasons, the Russian forward played for the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Brooklyn Nets.
Overall, he averaged 11.8 points, 5.5 rebounds, 2.7 assists, and 1.8 blocked shots in 797 games.
Earlier, it was reported that Kirilenko would put forth his candidacy in the elections for head of the RBF.

During a meeting on Sunday, July 26 with Sovetskaya Gavan residents, Khabarovsk Krai acting governor Mikhail Degtyarev was surprised that the region buys Sakhalin gas extracted by the American company Exxon Neftegas for dollars.
The American gas is under a dollar contract until 2025.
"To tell you the truth, I didn't know, and I'm knocked down by this information.
"I did not have any idea that this was still possible in 2020 in Russia," RIA Novosti quotes him as saying.
Degtyarev noted that this matter was discussed with the head of the Russian Energy Ministry Alexander Novak during his visit to Khabarovsk on July 24.
The acting governor also emphasized that by 2025 Gazprom will switch to the supplies of Russian thermal power plants and facilities, meaning that Russian gas will be used, purchased in rubles "at normal prices".
The Sakhalin-1 project is being implemented under a production-sharing agreement, in which the project operator is Exxon Neftegas Ltd with a 30% share, another 20% is held by Rosneft, 30% by Japanese Sodeco, and 20% by Indian ONGC.
Khabarovsk Krai has been purchasing gas from this project since 2005.

Russian TV series actor responded to "propaganda of LGBT and feminism" accusations
An actor from the Russian serial "Chicks", whose creators have been accused of "propaganda of LGBT and feminism", responded to the complaints about the film.
The authors "understood the pungency of the issues raised and didn't want to offend anybody", said American Stephen Thomas Ochsner in an interview with the publication Podyom.
"I think it's a story about power and general aspects of human life.
It's got nothing to do with LGBT and feminism," said the actor, who plays the father of a boy who cross dresses.
He stressed that he is "proud of the work" and does not consider it propaganda.
At the same time, the American added, some people's reaction to the serial's storyline frightens him: for example, there was an incident when "someone on a drinking binge fired shots at the set and said it was all wrong".
"Then there were a couple of times when we met disgruntled locals who didn't understand what we're doing.
"But we were open, so the people who initially came with complaints began to understand us," he concluded.
The shooting incident, the publication explains, occurred in September 2019 in Kabardino-Balkaria: a drunk man attacked the film crew's vehicle with a weapon, and was later detained by police officers.
Earlier it was reported that the public commissioner for the protection of the family, Olga Baranets, sent a complaint to the MVD and the Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media about the more.tv service which runs the Russian serial "Chicks".
Baranets accused the serial's creators of "propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations and feminism", noting that the main characters of the film work as prostitutes and the serial itself contains "scenes of physical and psychological violence".
The commissioner was also upset that "the serial pays a lot of attention to the homosexual sexual orientation" of an underage character.
The comedy drama "Chicks" tells the story of three prostitutes who start a new life and open a business on a female friend's advice.

Singer Polina Gagarina named the foods that aid weight loss
Russian singer Polina Gagarina named five foods that helped her correct her figure and not gain weight afterwards.
First on the list was water.
The singer prefers to drink pure still water before each meal, to suppress hunger pangs and eat less.
Vegetable salads, brown rice and seafood are also ideal for staying in shape.
They form the foundation of a balanced diet: vegetables contain fiber, rice contains complex carbohydrates, and seafood is a source of protein, beneficial vitamins and amino acids.
On fasting days the singer opts for apples.
Thanks to these foods, Gagarina was able to lose more than 30 kilograms of excess weight.
The singer also switched to fractional meals – eating often and in small portions – and excluded fatty, sweet and calorific foods from her diet.
Gagarina does not eat fried food, baked goods, sausage products or processed meats, kp.ru reported on July 26.
She also replaced red meat with fish and seafood.
She favors vegetables (besides potatoes), whole grains and plenty of greens.
Gagarina also actively works out in the gym, does yoga, and runs.
Earlier, Russian singer Sergey Lazarev told how he lost the weight he gained during self-isolation.
The artist said he corrected his diet and took up running.
