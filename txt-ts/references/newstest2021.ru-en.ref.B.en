Semilarski vs the prosecutor's office: Tartu former deputy mayor's appeal will be considered on August 4
This means that a decision on the matter will, most likely, be delivered at the start of September.
Judges from the two courts of first instance refused to consider the claim, but in April, his cassation appeal was taken up by the State Court.
On December 12, 2019, the Tartu administrative court returned the complaint to the applicant, as it did not fall within the competence of the administrative court.
The court's decision stated that the complaint contains demands for compensation for damages incurred during criminal proceedings.
"The prosecutor's office and district court should deal with these issues," Annett Kreitsmann, press secretary for the Tartu Courts, told ERR previously.
According to her, Valvo Semilarski appealed this ruling to the district court, which on February 5 declined to overturn the ruling of the court of first instance.
The State Court now has to make its statement.
According to Semilarski's lawyer, sworn attorney Oliver Naas, his client has been unjustifiably under suspicion of bribe-taking for about two years.
He is now demanding that the prosecutor's office refute its incorrect statements about himself and compensate him for moral damages.
The reason for submitting the complaint to the court was an announcement by the prosecutor for special cases of the Louna District Prosecutor's Office Margus Gross, made by him in October 2017, when Semilarski together with another Tartu deputy mayor, Artjom Suvorov, were held on suspicion of committing several crimes.
"I remember that when they held me, the security police and prosecutor's office immediately organized a press conference and informed all of Estonia that the leadership of Tartu – one of the most influential local governments – was corrupt.
These groundless public allegations have been following me for about two years.
And now, when these assertions and allegations turned out to be false, the prosecutor's office wants to say nothing about it," said Semilarski at the beginning of August 2019.
According to Oliver Naas, the prosecutor's press conference stepped outside legal bounds that the prosecutor's office should remain within.
"The assertions of bribe-taking and corruption turned out to be false, but that is not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its rulings on Russia, as well as Latvia, that at this stage of investigations, government representatives should be careful with their choice of words, so that suspects will not be portrayed as criminals prior to the issuing of a verdict.
The prosecutor's office is obliged to support the presumption of innocence, which was not followed in the case against Valvo Semilarski, said Naas.
"Semilarski's public representation as a serious lawbreaker and bribe-taker in circumstances when the facts that formed the basis of the suspicions of bribe-taking were still being clarified is unacceptable, it contradicts the presumption of innocence and is unfair fo the claimant," added the lawyer.
According to russ.err.ee the former deputy mayor of Tartu, Valvo Semilarski, will not be charged with bribe-taking – the case that was brought against him in July has been partially closed.
Meanwhile, the former civil servant is being tried on charges of knowingly violating anti-corruption laws when conducting transactions of an especially large scale.
According to the criminal indictment, from 2015 to 2017, the former Tartu deputy mayor took part more than 30 times in meetings of the city council while it made decisions concerning companies operating in Tartu, the owners or managers of which Semilarski actively communicated with on a personal level outside of office hours.
According to Gross, in all these cases Semilarski had a personal interest, and as such he should have withdrawn from participation in making decisions.
As wrote rus.err.ee, the prosecutor's office earlier set forth their suspicions of Semilarski's bribe-taking and violating anticorruption laws in conducting transactions of especially large scale.
This took place in October 2016, when he was held together with another deputy mayor Artjom Suvorov (Center Party).
At the time, the prosecutor's office and Security Police announced that they had compelling evidence against both deputy mayors.
Following that both civil servants stepped down.
The case against Suvorov later went to court, which completely acquitted him on all charges.
The judicial inquiry in the case against Valvo Semilarski is currently continuing.
The former singer of the group Ruki Vverkh visited Tver region
The former singer of the group Ruki Vverkh, now solo performer, businessman and actor Sergei Zhukov, posted a photo from Kalyazin in Tver region on his official Instagram account.
The photo was published a day ago, on Saturday, July 25.
"I raise my hands to a new 'Kroshka' and send you greetings from intoxicatingly fresh air!
"Write in the comments how the weather is in your city.
"Here today there's no rain, but it won't go above +20..." Zhukov writes in social media networks.
The singer is probably vacationing in the wonderful Tver region town with his family.
Residents of the region already thanked the performer for his visit, and also expressed hopes to meet and socialize in person.
The new "Kroshka" mentioned in the post probably refers to a new version of the old song that Zhukov has now written with the blogger and musician David Manukyan (DAVA M).
At the same time, most fans remain FOR the old version: "Sergei, the old version of the song is well clearly 1,000,000 times better!
"Support me, devoted Ruki Vverkh fans", "We don't need a 'new kroshka'".
The majority also write directly that they prefer the original, which became a hit in its time.

The name of the clubs in Italy looking to sign Lokomotiv star Miranchuk and his potential paycheck have been revealed.
According to information from Sport Express, Serie A teams Milan, Lazio, Fiorentina, and Atalanta are currently interested in the Lokomotiv halfback, Alexei Miranchuk.
The 24-year-old football player would like to sign a four-year contract with remuneration of no less than 2 million euros a year with bonuses.
Any club making such an offer will receive priority.
Lokomotiv is determined to sell their main star and is working towards this.

Milan is counting on signing a contract with left-back Diego Laxalt.
During the 2019/2020 season, Miranchuk played in 32 matches for Lokomitiv, he scored 16 goals and made five assists.
The halfback together with Lokomotiv were Russia champions (2017/18), took the nation's cup three times (2014/15, 2016/17, 2018/19) and the Russian Super Cup once (2019).
The US called on Qatar and its neighbors to cease their dispute
Trust and unity must be established between Qatar and other states, said the US special envoy for Iran, Brian Hook.
He announced that the conflict between the emirate and other countries of the region had been continuing for too long and was damaging regional stability, development, and security.
So far, the US has unsuccessfully tried to act as an intermediary in regulating the disagreement, which Washington views as a "threat to efforts to contain Iran".
Diplomatic relations were severed between Qatar and the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Bahrain three years ago.
They implemented a transport blockade, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorism.
Doha responded that its neighbors were envious of its economic success – according to the International Monetary Fund, for several years Qatar has led in terms of GDP per capita by a large margin.
The emirate has the third-largest reserves of natural gas, is the sixth-largest exporter of natural gas, and is a major exporter of oil and petrochemicals.

Former American diplomat called M. Pompeo's statements against China "primitive and ineffective"

Pompeo called for ending the long-standing approach to mutual relations with China and create a "new alliance" in order to make China change in accordance with Washington's wishes.

"We're fresh now, we have no injuries of other complaints."
Nonetheless, Ovechkin also admitted that he and his teammates needed to keep in mind some tactical combinations: "We don't have that much time in order to play the majority and remember the March practices on how to move the puck in such situations.
But time still remains: I am sure that we can devote some of our training to this.
The majors and minors are important in the play-offs.
And I am confident in our specialty team."
The Washington Capitals' restart is scheduled for August 3, when the Capitals play against Tampa Bay Lightning.
Following that, the Caps' hockey players are also to play against the Philadelphia Flyers (August 6) and the Boston Bruins (August 9).

On Sunday, parades in honor of Russian Navy Day were held in Saint Petersburg and near all large naval bases, including in Tartus, Syria
219 ships and 15,000 military personnel participated in the parades.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin, who introduced the main parade in Saint Petersburg, said that the Navy will grow to include 40 new ships of various classes in 2020, and will also gain new armaments, including hypersonic strike systems and pilotless submersible vessels.
2020 marked the first year that the parade was held in Kaspiysk, where the base of the Caspian Fleet has been relocated from Asrakhan.
Aside from Saint Petersburg, parades were held in Baltiysk, Kaspiysk, Severomorsk, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Vladivostok, and also in Sevastopol, which has been annexed, and in the roadstead of the Syrian port of Tartus.
4,000 members of the armed forces and 46 vessels took part in the main parade in the Neva water zone and on the Finnish Gulf, including nuclear- and diesel-powered submarines, as well as Naval Aviation helicopters and planes.
Before the parade began, Putin, accompanied by Minister of Defense Sergei Shoygu, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy Admiral Nikolai Yevmenov, and Commander of the Western Military District Colonel General Zhuravlyov, inspected several ships on the Kronstadt Roadstead and the Finnish Gulf, greeting the personnel.
A facsimile of the first Russian ship of the line, the Poltava, reconstructed from archived blueprints, decorated the parade.
Emperor Peter I took part in its laying out.
In his speech, Putin reminded his audience that this year marks the 200th anniversary of the discovery of Antarctica, which was the result of the expedition of Russian mariners Fabian Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lavarev.
And on the roof of the building of the Senate and Synod, snipers providing security were seen during the parade.
The parade in Baltiysk, where the Baltic Fleet is based, included over 46 combat ships and more than 1,500 members of the armed forces, and the large combat ship Kaliningrad performed a seaborne landing operation.
In annexed Sevastopol, a parade was held that included 30 ships and a presentation dedicated to the history of the Black Sea Fleet, featuring a group of scuba divers emerging from beneath the water.
The new strategic nuclear-powered submarine Prince Vladimir, which joined the Northern Fleet in June, participated in the parade in Severomorsk.

How the Central Bank's decision to lower the key rate will affect the economy
The Bank of Russia has again lowered the key rate, as expected.
It dropped by another 0.25 of a percentage point, to 4.25% per annum – formally another historical low.
Judging by the return of the short-step rate cut, and also the Central Bank's tone and the updated forecasts for the Russian economy, the regulator sees the economic outlook more optimistically than before.
This means that the current cycle of monetary policy easing may soon be over.
"We continued easing monetary policy, above all considering that there are still risks of inflation fluctuating down from 4% in 2021," said Bank of Russia head Elvira Nabiullina.
They are associated with a significant reduction in economic activity, a fall in internal and external demand.
Economic recovery, according to Nabiullina, will take more than one-and-a-half years.
At the same time, she noted that after the lifting of the restrictions due to the pandemic, economic processes came back to life: energy consumption rebounded, consumer and investor demand, construction and consumer goods output expanded, there was a slowing in the annual pace of decline of cargo transport turnover, industrial production.
According to the Central Bank's updated forecast, economic contraction in 2020 will be 4.5%-5.5% (previously 4%-6% was expected), and recovery economic growth in 2021 will be 3.5%-4.5%, and in 2022 – 2.5%-3.5%.
Also, the Central Bank revised the oil price forecast to 38 and 40 dollars per barrel of Urals in 2020 and 2021 respectively.
Previously the Central Bank expected 27 and 35 dollars a barrel.
Finally, the Bank of Russia's inflation forecast for 2020 was 3.7%-4.2% against the previously expected 3.8%-4.8%.
The Bank of Russia's view on the economic situation is becoming more optimistic, which brings us toward the end of the easing cycle, Renaissance Capital Russia and CIS economists Sofya Donets and Andrei Melashchenko believe.
As such, the Bank of Russia has been progressively lowering the key rate for more than a year, since the start of last year it has already dropped by 3.5 percentage points.
At the last meeting in June, the Central Bank lowered it by one percentage point in one fell swoop due to the slow pace of inflation connected with flat demand and the need to stimulate the economy, which had slowed because of the pandemic and related restrictions.
Chances of further monetary policy adjustments remain (at the next meeting on September 18 and before the end of the year), but the limit is already close, agrees Rosbank chief analyst Yevgeny Koshelev.
A combination of inflationary risks also indicates that a pause in interest rate policy is near – supply chain breakdowns, possible rising costs due to anti-epidemic measures and more rapid (compared with expectations) recovery in demand, he says.
On top of that, subsequent Bank of Russia actions will require more attention to inflationary processes during the harvest season, and also external volatility, which has grown on the backdrop of geopolitical conflicts, Koshelev indicates.
In any case, lowering of the key rate will lead to further reduction in rates for the most reliable borrowers, and also, possibly, in mortgages, says the senior economist for analytical management at Otkritie bank, Maxim Petronevich.
The rates correction will have a less pronounced character than the reduction in the key rate, he clarifies.
BKS Premier economist Anton Pokatovich does not rule out that consumer credit rates may fall by another 0.3-0.6 of a percentage point in the course of the second half-year, and mortgage rates may end the year in the range of 6.2%-7%.
Average rates for deposits, in his opinion, will also fall – in the coming months they may drop to 4.2%-4.5% (currently slightly above 4.5%).
They even may drop further to 4% if the Central Bank lowers the key rate in autumn, Pokatovich believes.
The Center Party promises to pay off all its debts by the end of the year
General Secretary of the Center Party Mihhail Korb spoke of this in an interview with ERR.
According to him, the total sum that the party has to pay is approximately 300,000 euros.
"According to current financial forecasts, the Center Party will pay off its current debts and obligations by the end of this year," said Korb.
It was earlier revealed that the prime minister's party returned to the government 110,100 euros, which were declared to be forbidden donations.

Ukrainian armed forces will oversee the ceasefire in Donbass
Ukrainian armed forces have begun preparations for a ceasefire on the demarcation line in Donbass. Military forces with experience in peace-support missions will oversee the implementation of the agreement, the Joint Forces Staff reported on Facebook.

It notes that, beginning at 00:01 on July 27, specially lead Ukrainian forces will provide additional oversight of the ceasefire at each Ukrainian position. Most of these forces have combat experience and have addressed special issues under the auspices of the UN during peace-support missions.

Emelianenko still cannot forget his breakup with his beloved woman – psychologist
Psychologist Veronika Stepanova, who has more than 1 million subscribers on YouTube, spoke of MMA fighter Alexander Emelianenko, the ex-husband of her sister.
Olya dated Alexander, a passionate romance began between them, Stepanova said in a video on her YouTube channel.
It was a very beautiful story, they immediately had a child, everything was great and wonderful.
At some point, Alexander became tired of all this, and wanted to get out and about a little.
And if any other woman could relate to this normally (well, think that he's going out, dancing a little), this isn't Olya.
She doesn't put up with these things.
And his story of going out a little ended with my sister immediately getting married to another man and giving birth to his baby.
When Alexander realized what happened, he couldn't believe it.
He begged on his knees, gave her diamonds.
His oversized pride broke his brain.
He wanted everything back again, but how to go about this he didn't know.
They have maintained a friendly relationship, they share a child, but to this day he can't come to his senses.
His destructive behavior – it is either a cry of despair, an attempt to kill himself, or draw her attention to himself.

When will I start for Legion?
It is completely possible that I will play in the Estonian Cup for a bit on July 29, and on August 1 I'm on the roster for the championship match against Paide.

Our task for this year is to maintain our position in the league and play more confidently," added Prosa.

Returning to football after such a long pause isn't easy.
My main task at the moment is to help the team remain in the top league and rise up the table as high as possible," said the forward.

The Main Naval Parade was marked with new ships and filming technologies
New filming technologies were used at the Main Naval Parade in Saint Petersburg: a video camera "passed" under one of the ships, showing it "from the inside".
The Sovetsk series-built small missile ship was filmed from this angle as it passed the Admiralty Embankment.
The Main Naval Parade was broadcast by the Russia 1 television station and the Russia.tv website.
Earlier, on June 24, at the parade marking the 75th anniversary of the Great Victory a camera "passed" through a tank barrel of an armored vehicle while swapping from one shot to another, and the camera "flew out" of the exhaust nozzle of an aircraft while the Russkiye Vityazi and Strizhi aerobatic teams fighter planes were flying.
Forty-six warships, motorboats, and submarines, 41 navy aircraft and helicopters, and more than 4000 military personnel took part in the Main Naval Parade in the waters off Kronstadt.
Among the ships that took part in the parade were the large antisubmarine ship Vice-Admiral Kulakov, the corvette Stoyky, the large landing ships Minsk and Patriot, submarine Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, patrol ship Vasily Bykov, small anti-submarine ships Kazanets and Urengoy, small missile ships Liven and Passat, missile boat Chuvashia.
The large landing ship Pyotr Morgunov, built according to Nevsky Design Bureau Project 11711 design at the Baltic Yantar Shipyard, was on display for the first time at the Kronstadt Roadstead in the Gulf of Finland.
The lead ship from this series, the Ivan Gren, already serves in the Northern Fleet, TASS reports.
Among other new ships that have recently entered service with the navy was the first serial frigate Admiral Kasatonov, built according to Project 22350 at the Severnaya Verf shipyards.
Another new navy ship is the Project 636.3 Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsk diesel-electric submarine of the Rubin Central Design Bureau for Marine Engineering, built at the Admiralty Shipyards.
It joined the Russian Pacific Fleet in December 2019.
Other new ships that recently joined the navy include the Project 22800 Karakurt-class corvettes Sovetsk and Mytishchi, designed by the Almaz Central Marine Design Bureau.
Also taking part in the parade were the Project 21631 Buyan-class corvettes Veliky Ustyug and Sepukhov.
The largest participants were the nuclear-powered cruise missile submarine Orel and the large destroyer Vice-Admiral Kulakov – both were on display in the Gulf of Finland.
In recognition of the large role that the Russian fleet plays in researching the world's oceans, together with the warships two new hydrographic boats, the Georgy Zima and Mikhail Kazansky also sailed the Neva's waters. At the Kronstadt Roadstead was the oceanographic research vessel Admiral Vladimirsky, which in June, together with the Russian Geographic Society, completed a scientific global expedition to the shores of Antarctica to mark the 200th anniversary of its discovery by Russian navigators Thaddeus Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev.
The first Russian ship of the line Poltava, created at the historical shipyards, could be seen from Palace Bridge.
The 54-cannon sailing ship first took to the waters in 1712, participated in the war with the Swedes, and in 1717 landed marines on the island of Gotland.
In 1725, the ship was decommissioned from the Baltic Fleet, and after its recreation, took to the waters again on May 27, 2018.
Access to Kronstadt was restricted during the parade this year due to prophylactic measures put in place to restrict the spread of COVID-19, RIA Novosti reported.

Poll: Lithuania's ruling Union of farmers and "greens" tops party rating once again
The Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union, which heads the ruling coalition of the Saeima, topped the party ratings.
This was shown by a poll conducted by the sociological research company Vilmorus, commissioned by the newspaper Lietuvos rytas.
After victory in the parliamentary elections of 2016, the "farmers" lost first place and for a long time the lead was held by the main critic of Russia in Lithuania, the opposition Homeland Union – Lithuanian Christian Democrats (conservatives).
Nonetheless, recently Lithuanian president Gitanas Nausėda, evaluating the party's electoral possibilities, announced that the Union of farmers and "greens" would probably be able to form a coalition once again after this year's parliamentary elections.
This announcement upset the conservatives.
The last poll showed: if the parliamentary elections took place today, 17.6 percent of voters would vote for the farmers, and 17.2 percent for the conservatives.
According to Vilmorus director Vladas Gaidys, the separation is within the margin of error, and nonetheless the ruling party is no longer lagging behind the conservatives.
In Gaidys's opinion, the sociological success of the "farmers" was thanks to the news that prime minister Saulius Skvernelis will lead the party list.
This politician was first in the list of the "farmers" at the 2016 elections.
In third place is the Social-Democratic Party, for which 7.1 percent of respondents are now willing to vote.
It unexpectedly lost 2 percent in a month.
Fourth is the Labour Party, headed by Viktor Uspasskikh, a businessman of Russian heritage.
The remaining political organizations, judging by the poll, currently could not overcome the 5-percent electoral barrier.
Putin spoke about the unique advantages of the Russian Navy
At the Main Naval Parade in Saint Petersburg, President of Russia Vladimir Putin announced that the Russian Navy will attain unique advantages and improve its combat capabilities via the integration of cutting-edge digital technologies.
The head of the government specified that Russian hypersonic strike systems and pilotless submersible vessels are unparalleled in the rest of the world.
In addition, the Russian leader devoted attention to the Russian Federation's most effective defensive systems.
According to the Russian leader, the infrastructure of the Russian Navy is constantly expanding; to wit, this year 40 new ships and vessels of various classes will be inducted into its ranks.
It was further mentioned that focus will be directed towards unprecedented hypersonic strike complexes.
Today, the armaments of the Russian Navy include the latest ships equipped with high-precision guns, strategic submarine cruisers, and multi-role submarines, as well as unprecedented special technologies, the President added.
Putin also stressed that naval mariners have been admirably performing highly complex tasks, serving their country impeccably.
Ministry of Emergency Situations warned residents of Moscow Region about a thunderstorm
A thunderstorm and wind gusts of up to 15 m/s are expected in the Moscow Region. This was reported by the regional branch of the Ministry of Emergency Situations on Sunday, July 26.
Residents are recommended to remove household items from their yards and prune dry trees that could do damage to their homes.
Cars should be parked in garages or far from trees and weakly fortified structures.
To avoid a lightning strike, it’s recommended not to heat the stove or use electrical appliances in your house during a thunderstorm, and not to take shelter under trees (especially ones by themselves) or swim in reservoirs.

Superfluous public procurement application requirements to be legally excluded
Comprehensive requirements for public procurement participation applications may be established by law.
At the autumn session of the plenary sitting of the State Duma, there are plans for a second reading of a draft law establishing requirements for the content and composition of applications to participate in public procurement, where only small and medium-sized businesses can participate.
The government is making amendments to the law "On procurement of goods, works, and services by certain types of legal entities".
The draft law was developed during fulfilment of the road map for the implementation of the Strategy for development of small and medium-sized enterprises in Russia up to the year 2030, approved by the government.
It provides for the preparation of a draft law on an exhaustive list of application documents that the ordering party has the right to demand of purchase participants that are small or medium-sized enterprises.
Also – a list of requirements for the specified documents.
At present, procurement activities by different types of legal entities are regulated within the framework of the law "On procurement of goods, works, and services by certain types of legal entities".
Requirements for the content, form, presentation and composition of applications to participate in public procurement are set by the ordering party independently in the procurement documentation.
"As a result, the ordering parties set superfluous requirements for the content and presentation of applications, as well as for the obligatory inclusion of supporting documentation, certificates and statements, for which the date of receipt by authorized bodies is the same as for the submission of applications, which makes it impossible to participate in such procurement and reduces the number of procurement participants," says the draft law's explanatory note.
The new draft law provides for the establishment of an exhaustive list of documents that ordering parties have the right to demand to be included in an application from procurement participants that are small and medium-sized enterprises.
"Acceptance of the document will facilitate the exclusion of ordering parties' arbitrarily set demands for the content and composition of applications from participants that are small and medium-sized enterprises," says the explanatory note.

Republicans will propose another $1 trillion to support US economy
Republicans will propose spending another $1 trillion to support the United States economy, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin confirmed on Fox News on Sunday, July 26.
“The $1 trillion package includes the most urgent and high priority things”, the head of the US Treasury Department said.
The support package includes new direct payments to Americans.
The proposal must be passed by Congress and signed by US President Donald Trump.
Representatives of the US Democratic Party believe the proposed funds aren’t enough.
The US allocated about $3 trillion to support the economy in the spring.
On April 24, Trump signed a bill on nearly half a trillion dollars of financial assistance to the American economy to fight the coronavirus and its consequences.
Analysts believe the US GDP will fall 25% in annual terms in the second quarter of 2020, which will be the biggest drop in the country’s history.

The company will broaden its range of users with the new version of the OS.
To do so, computers with older versions of the system will be automatically updated.
It’s assumed that a specially developed algorithm from the company will identify devices with older versions of the program platform that will soon be unsupported and automatically install the Windows 10 May 2020 update on them.
This will affect computers with Windows 10 (1809) and Windows 10 (1903), whose support expires on November 10 and December 8 respectively, in the near future, the outlet notes.
It was reported on July 21 that users encountered problems connecting to the internet after updating Windows 10 – there was no network access.
The difficulties weren’t with the connection to the network itself, but with the connection status.
Dr. Myasnikov identified main indicators of human health
One of the main criteria in the “deadly quartet” was a large waist size
The doctor and TV host Alexander Myasnikov spoke about the key indicators that can be used to determine someone’s health.
His so-called “deadly quartet” included four criteria – increased blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, and waist size, the doctor said on the channel Russia 1.
Myasnikov encouraged everyone to be attentive to these factors.
Moreover, according to him, controlling waist size is even more important than weight.
For men, this parameter should be no more than 102 centimeters, for women – 88 centimeters.
Exceeding these standards could mean health is at risk.
This primarily concerns the state of the heart – a waist size above the norm is a risk factor for a stroke, heart attack, as well as cancer and diabetes.
Recall that Myasnikov earlier spoke about why you can eat cady at night.
The doctor explained that sugar itself isn’t dangerous for health, that desserts are unhealthy only when you have such food in large quantities, and candy at night, according to him, isn’t the worst snack.

Experts from USA call Pompeo worst Secretary of State in country’s history
International affairs experts Aaron David Miller and Richard Sokolsky have named Mike Pompeo the worst Secretary of State in United States history.
CNN published the material with their opinion on July 23.
“In just two short years, Mike Pompeo – with an eye on the presidency in 2024 and the support of President Donald Trump – became the worst Secretary of state in US history, but also the most politically-biased”, the text says.
The experts accused Pompeo of “politicizing the position of Secretary of State and desecrating the institution he runs” for the sake of advancing his personal political agenda and protecting Trump “from responsibility and the rule of law”.
According to them, the Secretary of State, in particular, covers up “Trump’s blackmail of Ukraine” and is ready to expose employees of the American Foreign Ministry for their cooperation with Congress on this matter.
Pompeo was also remembered for being rather friendly with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who took partial responsibility for the murder of The Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.
Trump announced the decision to appoint Mike Pompeo as the head of the State Department on March 13, 2018, after firing the former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.

For the third time this year, the Yangtze River in China has flooded
After a very heavy downpour in the upstream waters of the Yangtze River, the longest waterway in China, flooding occurred for the third time in a year.
The flood was caused by a rise in the water level of upstream tributaries, which led to the rapid increase in water flowing into the Chinese hydroelectric power station Sanxia, or Three Gorges.
At 2 pm on July 26, water was observed flowing into the reservoir at the rate of 50,000 cub. m/s, and is expected to reach its maximum of 60,000 cub. m/s on the evening of July 27, reported the Yangtze River Water Management Committee under the PRC Ministry of Water Resources.
Today the committee released a river flooding notification for one upper section of the Yangtze River and overflowing of the Sanxia hydroelectric power station reservoir.

Father of infant abducted in Salsk shares details of incident
The father of a newborn abducted from a maternity clinic in Salsk, Rostov Oblast, shared the details of what happened.
Aleksandr Rusikov told channel 360 that the woman who kidnapped the infant entered his wife's ward when she was getting ready to go to the bathroom.
The mother of the abducted infant couldn't believe that a person with malicious intent could appear in a maternity clinic.
The woman stepped literally a couple meters away from her ward when she heard the screams of her neighbors.
The infant was already no longer in the ward.
According to Rusikov, all this occurred between three and four o'clock in the morning.
He also said that his spouse's ward was located between two medical desks, but at the time of the incident the nurses weren't at their posts.
The father of the abducted infant also said that no comments or apologies from the hospital workers had been forthcoming.
We'd like to remind our readers that the newborn boy, who was kidnapped from a maternity clinic in Salsk on Saturday, was found that same day in the Republic of Kalmykia.
Police arrested a 40-year-old suspect in the kidnapping.

Expert appraised role of vitamins in building immunity
The Moscow Health Department's head consulting specialist for adult primary medical care Andrei Tyazhelnikov assessed the role of vitamins in building immunity.
"It's impossible to create stable immunity with extra doses of any kind of medication, vitamins, or foodstuffs," he told the Govorit Moskva radio station.
According to him, there are certain rules.
For example, in summer it's best to spend more time outdoors, including in the sunshine.
Tyazhelnikov also noted that in the summer it is necessary as much as possible to consume a large amount of fresh vegetables and fruits.
"This strengthens immunity in general, provides a certain reserve of vitamins and a certain reserve of health," he added.
Earlier Tyazhelnikov named several differences between flu and coronavirus.

Regional head Igor Kobzev met with the mayor of Ust-Orda Buryat district
Remote agricultural territories' main development trends were discussed at an Irkutsk regional government meeting today, July 24.
During trips around areas of the Ust-Orda Buryat district, the regional head issued a number of instructions.
Today the mayors reported on their fulfilment.
Firstly, House of Sport construction has resumed in Ust-Orda.
The Russian President gave instructions regarding this facility 14 years ago.
Only now has it been possible to bring it out of a dead end.
866 million rubles will be spent on construction.
Construction is to be completed in 2022.
And as soon as this year a school in the village of Bayanday should be commissioned.
At present, fit-out has been completed.
Landscaping the territory is among the work that remains to be done.
Overall, the program to build preschool and middle-school facilities is a priority for the region.
For your region – in particular.
The demographic situation here is the best in the region.
And we are obliged to create all the conditions for the education and leisure of children of all ages, noted acting Irkutsk region governor Igor Kobzev.
At the meeting, the regional head instructed all mayors to actively take part in developing the general plans of population points.
This is one of the main conditions for the region's comprehensive development.
All population points must have established borders and a general plan.
This is essential for the development of the territory, for the construction of socially significant facilities, and also for infrastructure and cultural heritage objects, the regional head emphasized.
During the conversation, the problematic issue of the 30% reduction in milk supplies received from cooperatives was raised.
This occurred due to the processing enterprise's redistribution of milk purchases in favor of peasant farms.
As a result, cooperatives' share of production decreased.
The head of the region instructed the acting agriculture minister to go to the location, study the structure of milk supplies, analyze the experience of other territories, and come up with ways to solve the problem.

Moscow area authorities spoke about what happened to garbage dumps that were closed
The process of closing solid waste landfill sites continues in areas around Moscow.
The authorities promise to close the rest ones this year.
Some of the 39 existing dumps are being upgraded to modern garbage processing facilities.
But not every solid waste landfill site is suitable for this – some are within densely constructed residential areas.
After a landfill site is closed, it is subject to reclamation – it is covered with soil, and decontamination and infiltration drainage systems are monitored.
This allows chemical processes within the dump to be halted, so that it will not burn or stink, or contaminate the earth and groundwater.
The former garbage dump then remains a raised, useless heap amid residential buildings.
Why not make something useful out of it?
For example, in Ruza, where literally days ago reclamation of the Annino landfill site was completed, the authorities are considering turning the heap into a ski slope.
This landfill, used from 1976 through 2016, has grown beyond its originally set boundaries.
Reclamation demanded buying up surrounding land plots that long ago were subsumed by garbage heaps.
"After a while, the landfill will settle and harden, and we will think about what we can do to make it useful.
It hits you in the face – a ski resort," said Ruza district head Nikoloai Parfyonov.
Two landfills will become renewable energy source extraction sites
The Torbeyevo landfill in Lyubertsy and the Timokhovo landfill in Bogorod district will become sites for the extraction of renewable energy from garbage and biological gases.
On the Torbeyevo territory, by the end of the year a gas piston power plant will open, capable of producing up to 8 million kilowatt-hours of electrical energy and about 0.95 gigacalories of thermal power per year, which will provide for the landfill site's future needs – providing heating for administrative and industrial premises.
Timokhovo will produce 72.5 million kilowatt-hours and continue to function as a waste processing facility.
And at Balashikha's Kuchino landfill, which was closed after residents' complaints via the Direct Line with the country's president, a museum might be created.
"There was such an idea – create a Moscow area landfill reclamation museum," said the deputy prime minister and minister of ecology and nature management for the region, Dmitry Kurakin.
Israel reported a drone crash in southern Lebanon
An Israeli army drone crashed in southern Lebanon.
The Armed Forces reported that it crashed “during operational activities”.
The causes of the device’s plummet were not reported.
“Some time ago, during operational activities near the border with Lebanon, an Israeli army drone crashed on Lebanese territory.
There is no risk of information leakage”, the Israeli army said on Twitter.
Recall that the Israeli army decided this week to strengthen its military units on the border with Lebanon, fearing revenge by the Lebanese movement Hezbollah for the murder of its combatants in Syria.
The leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, promised not to let the death of any his “brothers” go unanswered.
Read more about the situation in the Kommersant article, “Israel awaits Hezbollah’s revenge”.
Furgal's replacement spoke with protesters for the first time
Mikhail Degtyarev, acting governor of Khabarovsky Krai, spoke with participants of protests in support of the former head of the region, Sergei Furgal, who was arrested, for the first time.
A live feed of the meeting was posted on his Instagram page.
"Moscow hears all of you. That's why they sent you a replacement — so that the region doesn't come apart without leadership... Regarding Furgal, I'll say again: he's, A, my comrade; B, in the same party as me; C, I'm very concerned about what will happen with him. The party is helping him, giving him food, and Zhirinovsky is knocking on the door of every office," the active governor announced.
According to Degtyarev, Khabarovsky Krai can't be left without a leader right now, which is why he was appointed as head of the region by the order of President Vladimir Putin — so that the "wondrous building (the regional government) operates, everything works, and the budget is spent on social needs."
The acting governor explained that he hadn't previously spoken with protesters because he couldn't have a conversation with thousands of demonstrators.
That's why he runs live steams via social media and reads all the comments written to him.
On July 25 in Khabarovsk two protests were held one after the other.
Demonstrations supporting the ex-governor have been ongoing in the region since July 11.
On the eve of one such demonstration, Mikhail Degtyarev announced that he would be leaving the city on the day of the protest.
His motorcade was stopped by protesters who called on him to share his opinion on the fate of arrested ex-governor Furgal.
Degtyarev had earlier declined to speak with demonstration participants.
"A leader has other things to do than to go out and talk with people screaming under his window," the acting governor said.

what connected the Vatican and Nazi Germany
This week marks the 87th anniversary of the signing of an agreement between the Vatican and Nazi Germany.
The document, which was signed several months after Hitler came to power, served as the basis for relations between the Holy See and the Nazis.
Cardinal Pacelli, who was among those who helped prepare the agreement, would become pontiff Pius XII in six years' time, prior to the beginning of World War II.
In Sochi, the body of a dump truck crashed into a truck cab killing the driver.
Footage of the accident, which occurred in Sochi this past Saturday, on July 25, has appeared on the internet.
The recordings show how the raised body of the dump truck fell down while unloading work was taking place, directly hitting the truck cab.
The Ministry of Emergency Situations reported that a 59-year-old man died behind the wheel from the injuries that he received.
Rescuers' help was needed to retrieve the dead man's body.
Beautiful tall minarets only grace the Hagia Sophia
About the Hagia Sophia again – Fr.Vladimir Zelinsky's text turned up, which, it's said, needs to be tested.
Firstly, entry there became free – hooray!
I have not been to Istanbul, but in the House of God free entry is better than paid.
Secondly, Muslims conquered this land just as honestly as Orthodox Christians conquered the Volga-Oka interfluve, the Muslim Caucasus (and put a church in Grozny), and planted apple trees on Mars.
God to the rescue!
Jews conquered the Holy Land.
Americans conquered Americania.
Are we going to give everything back?
Do you think pagans can't be found who demand the return of their temple, on the site of which the Church of the Tithes stands?
Thirdly, Muslims improved the building, invested in it.
That is, it's the same as how the factories and estates that Leninists took as their own property from the bourgeois belong to Leninists – to Putin and other nomenklatura.
They improved everything – from the Kremlin to the Angara, so it's all theirs according to the right of the progressors.
Beautiful tall minarets grace the Hagia Sophia very much, very much so.
It was a stupid inkstand, it became a stupid inkstand with beautiful minarets.
Fourthly, there are no "Islamic" or "Orthodox Christian" civilizations.
There are believers, there are hypocrites, there are bigots combining faith and hypocrisy.
Believers do not think about categories of civilization.
That's the thinking of British Foreign Ministry official Toybee, a believer would be ashamed to think like that.
But for a believer, there is a place for prayer everywhere.
And always.
A believer doesn't pray only in a place that they're asked to leave – they go somewhere else and pray there.
They are after all believers, not remainers.
We are roly-polies, not grumpy-rocks.

Rwanda native admits to setting fire to Nantes cathedral
A Rwanda native who volunteered at the Cathedral of Sts. Peter and Paul in the French city of Nantes has confessed to setting it on fire one week after the fire.
This was reported on Sunday by the TV channel France-3.
According to the channel, the man who was already detained on July 19, the day after the fire, was detained again the day before.
He appeared before an investigating judge on Saturday evening.
After being arraigned for intentional damage to property, the man confessed to setting fires in three places – under the large organ, under the small organ, and by an electrical box.
Now he faces up to 10 years in prison and 150 thousand euros in fines.
The 39-year-old Rwanda native’s motives for his actions have not yet been reported.
It’s known only that he volunteered at the cathedral and was supposed to lock the doors on the day of the fire.
However, according to the security camera footage, he left the religious institution about 15 minutes after calls came in about a fire in the building.
The fire in the Cathedral of Sts. Peter and Paul occurred on July 18.
More than 200 firefighters spent several hours fighting for the monument of Gothic architecture.
Nevertheless, they were unable to save the stained-glass windows from the time of Louis XII and the unique Baroque-era organ.
They were able to get the situation under control only three hours after the fire started.
No one suffered as a result of the incident.
The current fire isn’t the first in the history of the church.
In 1972, the roof was destroyed in a fire.
It took 13 years to repair the damage from that fire.
The cathedral didn’t open to parishioners again until 1985.

Second "Bill and Ted" trailer with Keanu Reeves released
The second trailer of the third part of the "Bill and Ted" franchise has appeared on the Orion film studio's YouTube channel.
The trailer reveals some details from the present life of the bosom buddies: they moved to the suburbs, are married to their girlfriends Joanna (Jayma Mays) and Elizabeth (Erinn Hayes) from "Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure" (1989), and besides that, the irrepressible adventure seekers have already been raising daughters for a long time.
Brigette Lundy-Paine ("The Glass Castle", "Atypical") plays Ted's daughter Billie, and Samara Weaving ("Ready or Not") – Thea, the daughter of Bill (yes, Bill and Ted named their daughters Billie and Thea, such is the pun).
In addition to everything else, another great adventure awaits them: they have to go to the future to steal their own song from themselves – that's the only way they can save the whole world.
Also featured in the trailer are the American rapper Kid Cudi and William Sadler ("August Rush", "Hard to Kill", "The Green Mile") reprising his role of the Grim Reaper.
Initially the film was planned to be released on August 21, but the date was shifted to September 1.
The creators are said to be not planning to postpone the release date again.
The picture will also be immediately available online.
Earlier we wrote that Keanu Reeves is becoming the author of a comic about the demigod Beserker.

Degtyarev surprised by information about Sakhalin-1 gas purchased with dollars
During a meeting with residents of Sovetskaya Gazan on Sunday, July 26, Mikhail Degtyarev, the Acting Governor of the Khabarovsk Territory, was shocked that the region uses dollars to buy Sakhalin gas, produced by the American company Exxon Neftegas.
The American gas is contracted in dollars until 2025.
“To be honest, I didn’t know about it, and I feel knocked off my feet by this information.
I had no idea that this was even still possible in Russia in 2020”, RIA-Novosti quotes him as saying.
Degtyarev noted that the issue was discussed with the head of the Russian Ministry of Energy Alexander Novak during his visit to Khabarovsk on July 24.
The Acting Governor also emphasized that by 2025, Gazprom is switching to supplying Russian thermal power plants and capacities, which means that Russian gas purchased in rubles “at normal prices” will be used.
The Sakhalin-1 project is realized through a production sharing agreement with Exxon Neftegas Ltd as project operator having a share of 30%, and Rosneft with another 20%, the Japanese Sodeco with 30%, and the Indian ONGC with 20%.
The Khabarovsk Territory has been purchasing gas through this project since 2005.

Russian TV series actor responded to accusations of “LGBT and feminism propaganda”
An actor in the Russian TV series Chiki, whose creators were accused of “LGBT and feminism propaganda”, responded to complaints about the show.
The creators “understood the acuteness of the topics raised and didn’t want to offend anyone”, said American Stephen Thomas Ochsner in an interview with Podem.
“It seems to me it’s a story about power and general aspects of human life.
It has nothing to do with LGBT and feminism”, said the actor who played the father of a boy who changes into women’s clothing.
He emphasized that he’s “proud of the work” and doesn’t consider it propaganda.
At the same time, the American added that he’s afraid of some people’s reaction to the show’s storyline: for example, there was an incident when “a man on a heavy binge shot at the set and said it’s all a lie”.
“Then there was a couple of cases where we encountered unhappy locals who didn’t understand what we were doing.
But we were open, so the people who initially came with complaints started helping us”, he concluded.
The incident with the shooting, the outlet explains, occurred in Kabardino-Balkaria in September 2019: a drunk man attacked the film crew’s car with a weapon, after which he was detained by the police.
It was earlier reported that the Public Commissioner for the Protection of the Family Olga Baranets sent a complaint to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Roskomnadzor about the service more.tv, which hosted the Russian TV series Chiki.
Baranets accused the series creators of “promoting non-traditional sexual relations and feminism”, noting that the main characters in the series work as prostitutes and that the series itself contains “scenes of physical and psychological violence”.
The ombudsman was also indignant that “the series gives a lot of attention to the homosexual orientation” of underage characters.
The comedy drama Chiki tells about three prostitutes who began a new life and opened a business at the advice of a friend.
