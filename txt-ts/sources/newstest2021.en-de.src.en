Couple MACED at California dog park for not wearing face masks while having lunch (VIDEO) - RT USA News
There's mask-shaming and then there's full on assault.
A California couple having lunch with their puppy at a dog park experienced the second, when an irate woman pepper-sprayed them for refusing to mask up... while eating.
Ash O'Brien and husband Jarett Kelley say they were grabbing a bite to eat at Dusty Rhodes dog park in San Diego on Thursday, with their three-month-old pug in tow.
The pair had their masks off to eat, when a "random old lady" approached, calling them "idiots" for not masking up, even though "you can't wear a mask and eat at the same time."
O'Brien told the woman to leave the park and stop harassing her, at which point the woman unleashed a can of mace at the couple.
Video footage captured by a bystander begins with Kelley wrestling the spray can from the woman, and getting a dose of mace into the face for his troubles.
O'Brien can be heard crying in the background as the attacker walks away with her dogs.
O'Brien shared the video on Facebook and told ABC 10 that she wants to see the woman "go to jail."
Face masks are mandatory across the state of California, even in fresh air.

Even in the current era of "mask-shaming," that's still a crime carrying a penalty of a fine of $1,000 or up to three years in a state prison.

Seattle Protests: Fires and Pepper Spray as Thousands March Through City
SEATTLE - After weeks of escalating confrontations between protesters and federal authorities in Portland, Ore., a crowd of about 2,000 people mobilized in Seattle on Saturday, marching through the streets and clashing with the police.
Three police officers were injured, including one who was hospitalized with a leg injury caused by an explosive, and 16 protesters were arrested as of early evening, the police said.
Carrying signs such as "Feds Go Home" and shouting chants of "No justice, no peace," the protesters stopped at the site of a future youth detention center and lit buildings there on fire. Some smashed windows of nearby businesses.
The police confronted the crowd in the Capitol Hill neighborhood, deploying flash grenades and pepper spray before they began taking people into custody.
Bipasha Mukherjee, 52, of Kirkland, Wash., said she has been protesting on the streets since May and said it was worrisome to her to see such aggressive tactics by the police.
"This is not the country I immigrated to," said Ms. Mukherjee, who arrived from India more than 30 years ago. "It feels like we are rapidly becoming a fascist state and a police state."
Michaud Savage of Seattle said the protests were aimed at both local authorities and the deployment of federal officers who have waged a crackdown against a long-running protest in Portland. Mr. Savage said the law enforcement tactics in Portland, which have included the use of tear gas and crowd-control munitions, were dangerous and inappropriate.
"It's a very hard slide in an extremely violent direction," Mr. Savage said as he washed his eyes of pepper spray and nursed a wound on his arm from a flash grenade.
The death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis in May ignited mass protests that drew millions to the streets in dozens of cities, but those demonstrations have waned in most cities.
Seattle and Portland, however, have seen extended demonstrations. Seattle protesters at one point laid claim to several blocks of the Capitol Hill neighborhood and declared an autonomous zone. After a series of shootings there led the police to clear the area, protests had subsided.
Portland, meanwhile, has continued protesting, with some of the heaviest protests around federal buildings in the city. After President Trump issued an executive order to protect statues and federal property, the Department of Homeland Security deployed tactical teams to the city, beginning a series of clashes that have resulted in injured protesters, inspector general investigations and calls from local leaders for federal agents to leave.
Protest crowds in that city have swelled into the thousands, and demonstrations there were continuing. This week, federal officials deployed a tactical team to Seattle, and protesters cited that development as one reason for Saturday's demonstrations.
While the Portland protests have centered in downtown, the demonstrations on Saturday roamed areas east of the downtown core, where the city's federal courthouse is.

Dominic Cummings is held hostage by the SAS... on base tour
PM's chief adviser underwent the experience last week during a tour of the base
The idea of Dominic Cummings being held hostage with rifles pointed at his head might be one for some harassed civil servants to secretly savour.
But the Prime Minister's uncompromising chief adviser underwent just this experience last week during a tour of the SAS headquarters, Stirling Lines.
The Mail on Sunday can reveal that part of his visit on Wednesday involved a trip to the "Killing House" where elite soldiers hone their skills on tackling terrorists.
The guided tour of the Hereford base also included an inspection of the regiment's military hardware and a briefing on recent operations, including efforts to eliminate Islamic State terrorists in Iraq.
High-profile visitors to Stirling Lines are offered an unusual welcome - a turn in the "Killing House," a two-storey building where the SAS practise close-quarter fighting.
Previous guests include Princess Diana, whose hair caught fire thanks to a spark from a grenade thrown during an exercise in 1983.
It is understood that Mr Cummings arrived at the base - named in honour of the regiment's founder, Colonel David Stirling - by helicopter.
He also visited the neighbouring Pontrilas Army Training Area where other top-secret units are based.
The visit was part of his tour of Britain's highly classified UK security installations that has raised eyebrows among politicians and military chiefs.
When news of his plans emerged earlier this month, Tobias Ellwood, a Tory backbencher and chair of the Commons Select Defence Committe, said MPs should be given the same opportunity to question him about defence and security matters as they are afforded for Ministers and civil servants.
Special advisers, who are appointed by politicians, are rarely required to give evidence to select committees.
It is understood that senior SAS officers used Wednesday's event to stress the importance of maintaining the number of personnel in the Royal Marines and the Parachute Regiment.
It has been reported that these units, which provide the majority of Special Forces troops, could shrink or be merged to save money.
"More than half the soldiers in the 250-man SAS were previously Paras while the even smaller Special Boat Service (SBS) couldn't continue without the support of the Royal Marines," said a defence source.
"So Cummings was told that these units must be preserved in their entirety."
Mr Cummings, who has complained that military procurement "has continued to squander billions of pounds," recently attended meetings at the headquarters of MI5 and MI6 and is also planning to visit the SBS's headquarters in Poole, Dorset, along with the Government's top secret laboratories at Porton Down in Wiltshire.

Virginia Beach takes down Confederate monument
VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. -- The city of Virginia Beach removed a 115-year-old Confederate monument from public grounds on Saturday, less than two days after the City Council voted unanimously to do so.
Workers took down the 27-foot (8.2-meter) tall monument on Saturday morning, media outlets reported.
It was installed in 1905 and stood outside the old Princess Anne County courthouse, in the same place that slave auctions were once held.
The council voted unanimously Thursday night to begin the removal process.
The council had listened to dozens of speakers and decided the monument is viewed by many as divisive and a painful reminder of the past.
The statue recently had been completely covered, with a locked gate around it following recent protests and vandalism at other Confederate monuments.
The monument will be stored for now.
The city now must wait for any offers from historical groups or other entities that might want to take the monument.

I want to ask you all to consider for a second the very simple fact that, by far, most of what we know about the universe comes to us from light.
We can stand on the Earth and look up at the night sky and see stars with our bare eyes.
The Sun burns our peripheral vision.
We see light reflected off the Moon.
And in the time since Galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope at the celestial bodies, the known universe has come to us through light, across vast eras in cosmic history.
And with all of our modern telescopes, we've been able to collect this stunning silent movie of the universe -- these series of snapshots that go all the way back to the Big Bang.
And yet, the universe is not a silent movie because the universe isn't silent.
I'd like to convince you that the universe has a soundtrack and that soundtrack is played on space itself, because space can wobble like a drum.
It can ring out a kind of recording throughout the universe of some of the most dramatic events as they unfold.
Now we'd like to be able to add to a kind of glorious visual composition that we have of the universe -- a sonic composition.
And while we've never heard the sounds from space, we really should, in the next few years, start to turn up the volume on what's going on out there.
So in this ambition to capture songs from the universe, we turn our focus to black holes and the promise they have, because black holes can bang on space-time like mallets on a drum and have a very characteristic song, which I'd like to play for you -- some of our predictions for what that song will be like.
We might one day see a shadow a black hole can cast on a very bright background, but we haven't yet.
And yet black holes may be heard even if they're not seen, and that's because they bang on space-time like a drum.
Now we owe the idea that space can ring like a drum to Albert Einstein -- to whom we owe so much.
Einstein realized that if space were empty, if the universe were empty, it would be like this picture, except for maybe without the helpful grid drawn on it.
But if we were freely falling through the space, even without this helpful grid, we might be able to paint it ourselves, because we would notice that we traveled along straight lines, undeflected straight paths through the universe.
Einstein also realized -- and this is the real meat of the matter -- that if you put energy or mass in the universe, it would curve space, and a freely falling object would pass by, let's say, the Sun and it would be deflected along the natural curves in the space.
It was Einstein's great general theory of relativity.
Now even light will be bent by those paths.
And you can be bent so much that you're caught in orbit around the Sun, as the Earth is, or the Moon around the Earth.
These are the natural curves in space.
What Einstein did not realize was that, if you took our Sun and you crushed it down to six kilometers -- so you took a million times the mass of the Earth and you crushed it to six kilometers across, you would make a black hole, an object so dense that if light veered too close, it would never escape -- a dark shadow against the universe.
But Einstein always thought black holes were a mathematical oddity.
He did not believe they existed in nature.
He thought nature would protect us from their formation.
It was decades before the term "black hole" was coined and people realized that black holes are real astrophysical objects -- in fact they're the death state of very massive stars that collapse catastrophically at the end of their lifetime.
Now our Sun will not collapse to a black hole.
It's actually not massive enough.
But if we did a little thought experiment -- as Einstein was very fond of doing -- we could imagine putting the Sun crushed down to six kilometers, and putting a tiny little Earth around it in orbit, maybe 30 kilometers outside of the black-hole sun.
And it would be self-illuminated, because now the Sun's gone, we have no other source of light -- so let's make our little Earth self-illuminated.
And you would realize you could put the Earth in a happy orbit even 30 km outside of this crushed black hole.
This crushed black hole actually would fit inside Manhattan, more or less.
It might spill off into the Hudson a little bit before it destroyed the Earth.
But basically that's what we're talking about.
We're talking about an object that you could crush down to half the square area of Manhattan.
So we move this Earth very close -- 30 kilometers outside -- and we notice it's perfectly fine orbiting around the black hole.
There's a sort of myth that black holes devour everything in the universe, but you actually have to get very close to fall in.
But what's very impressive is that, from our vantage point, we can always see the Earth.
It cannot hide behind the black hole.
The light from the Earth, some of it falls in, but some of it gets lensed around and brought back to us.
So you can't hide anything behind a black hole.
If this were Battlestar Galactica and you're fighting the Cylons, don't hide behind the black hole.
They can see you.
Now, our Sun will not collapse to a black hole -- it's not massive enough -- but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
And if one were to eclipse the Milky Way, this is what it would look like.
We would see a shadow of that black hole against the hundred billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy and its luminous dust lanes.
And if we were to fall towards this black hole, we would see all of that light lensed around it, and we could even start to cross into that shadow and really not notice that anything dramatic had happened.
It would be bad if we tried to fire our rockets and get out of there because we couldn't, anymore than light can escape.
But even though the black hole is dark from the outside, it's not dark on the inside, because all of the light from the galaxy can fall in behind us.
And even though, due to a relativistic effect known as time dilation, our clocks would seem to slow down relative to galactic time, it would look as though the evolution of the galaxy had been sped up and shot at us, right before we were crushed to death by the black hole.
It would be like a near-death experience where you see the light at the end of the tunnel, but it's a total death experience.
(Laughter) And there's no way of telling anybody about the light at the end of the tunnel.
Now we've never seen a shadow like this of a black hole, but black holes can be heard, even if they're not seen.
Imagine now taking an astrophysically realistic situation -- imagine two black holes that have lived a long life together.
Maybe they started as stars and collapsed to two black holes -- each one 10 times the mass of the Sun.
So now we're going to crush them down to 60 kilometers across.
They can be spinning hundreds of times a second.
At the end of their lives, they're going around each other very near the speed of light.
So they're crossing thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second, and as they do so, they not only curve space, but they leave behind in their wake a ringing of space, an actual wave on space-time.
Space squeezes and stretches as it emanates out from these black holes banging on the universe.
And they travel out into the cosmos at the speed of light.
This computer simulation is due to a relativity group at NASA Goddard.
It took almost 30 years for anyone in the world to crack this problem.
This was one of the groups.
It shows two black holes in orbit around each other, again, with these helpfully painted curves.
And if you can see -- it's kind of faint -- but if you can see the red waves emanating out, those are the gravitational waves.
They're literally the sounds of space ringing, and they will travel out from these black holes at the speed of light as they ring down and coalesce to one spinning, quiet black hole at the end of the day.
If you were standing near enough, your ear would resonate with the squeezing and stretching of space.
You would literally hear the sound.
Now of course, your head would be squeezed and stretched unhelpfully, so you might have trouble understanding what's going on.
But I'd like to play for you the sound that we predict.
This is from my group -- a slightly less glamorous computer modeling.
Imagine a lighter black hole falling into a very heavy black hole.
The sound you're hearing is the light black hole banging on space each time it gets close.
If it gets far away, it's a little too quiet.
But it comes in like a mallet, and it literally cracks space, wobbling it like a drum.
And we can predict what the sound will be.
We know that, as it falls in, it gets faster and it gets louder.
And eventually, we're going to hear the little guy just fall into the bigger guy.
Now I've never heard it that loud -- it's actually more dramatic.
At home it sounds kind of anticlimactic.
It's sort of like ding, ding, ding.
This is another sound from my group.
No, I'm not showing you any images, because black holes don't leave behind helpful trails of ink, and space is not painted, showing you the curves.
But if you were to float by in space on a space holiday and you heard this, you want to get moving.
(Laughter) Want to get away from the sound.
Both black holes are moving.
Both black holes are getting closer together.
In this case, they're both wobbling quite a lot.
And then they're going to merge.
Now that chirp is very characteristic of black holes merging -- that it chirps up at the end.
Now that's our prediction for what we'll see.
Luckily we're at this safe distance in Long Beach, California.
And surely, somewhere in the universe two black holes have merged.
And surely, the space around us is ringing after traveling maybe a million light years, or a million years, at the speed of light to get to us.
But the sound is too quiet for any of us to ever hear.
There are very industrious experiments being built on Earth -- one called LIGO -- which will detect deviations in the squeezing and stretching of space at less than the fraction of a nucleus of an atom over four kilometers.
It's a remarkably ambitious experiment, and it's going to be at advanced sensitivity within the next few years -- to pick this up.
There's also a mission proposed for space, which hopefully will launch in the next ten years, called LISA.
And LISA will be able to see super-massive black holes -- black holes millions or billions of times the mass of the Sun.
In this Hubble image, we see two galaxies.
They look like they're frozen in some embrace.
And each one probably harbors a super-massive black hole at its core.
But they're not frozen; they're actually merging.
These two black holes are colliding, and they will merge over a billion-year time scale.
It's beyond our human perception to pick up a song of that duration.
But LISA could see the final stages of two super-massive black holes earlier in the universe's history, the last 15 minutes before they fall together.
And it's not just black holes, but it's also any big disturbance in the universe -- and the biggest of them all is the Big Bang.
When that expression was coined, it was derisive -- like, "Oh, who would believe in a Big Bang?"
This animation from my friends at Proton Studios shows looking at the Big Bang from the outside.
We don't ever want to do that actually. We want to be inside the universe because there's no such thing as standing outside the universe.
So imagine you're inside the Big Bang.
It's everywhere, it's all around you, and the space is wobbling chaotically.
Fourteen billion years pass and this song is still ringing all around us.
Galaxies form, and generations of stars form in those galaxies, and around one star, at least one star, is a habitable planet.
And here we are frantically building these experiments, doing these calculations, writing these computer codes.
Imagine a billion years ago, two black holes collided.
That song has been ringing through space for all that time.
We weren't even here.
It gets closer and closer -- 40,000 years ago, we're still doing cave paintings.
If it was the Big Bang we were going to pick up, it would sound like this.
It's literally the definition of noise.
It's white noise; it's such a chaotic ringing.
But it's around us everywhere, presumably, if it hasn't been wiped out by some other process in the universe.
And if we pick it up, it will be music to our ears because it will be the quiet echo of that moment of our creation, of our observable universe.
So within the next few years, we'll be able to turn up the soundtrack a little bit, render the universe in audio.
But if we detect those earliest moments, it'll bring us that much closer to an understanding of the Big Bang, which brings us that much closer to asking some of the hardest, most elusive, questions.
If we run the movie of our universe backwards, we know that there was a Big Bang in our past, and we might even hear the cacophonous sound of it, but was our Big Bang the only Big Bang?
I mean we have to ask, has it happened before?
Will it happen again?
I mean, in the spirit of rising to TED's challenge to reignite wonder, we can ask questions, at least for this last minute, that honestly might evade us forever.
But we have to ask: Is it possible that our universe is just a plume off of some greater history?
Or, is it possible that we're just a branch off of a multiverse -- each branch with its own Big Bang in its past -- maybe some of them with black holes playing drums, maybe some without -- maybe some with sentient life, and maybe some without -- not in our past, not in our future, but somehow fundamentally connected to us?
So we have to wonder, if there is a multiverse, in some other patch of that multiverse, are there creatures?
Here's my multiverse creatures.
Are there other creatures in the multiverse, wondering about us and wondering about their own origins?
And if they are, I can imagine them as we are, calculating, writing computer code, building instruments, trying to detect that faintest sound of their origins and wondering who else is out there.
Thank you. Thank you.

Safari park baboons seen armed with knives, screwdrivers and CHAINSAW as 'pranksters give them weapons to wreck cars'
The primates at Knowsley safari park, Merseyside, are long known to pounce on anyone pausing in the enclosure and ripping off a windscreen wiper or mirror.
Baboons have been armed with knives, screwdrivers and even chainsaws at Knowsley safari park, Merseyside.
Workers fear pranksters are arming the pesky primates, who are known to pounce on anyone who pauses and rip off windscreen wipers and mirrors.
Workers now fear they are being armed with the lethal weapons "for a laugh" by visitors to bolster their attacks and the apes have even been seen rummaging around toolboxes themselves.
One park worker told The Sunday Times: "We're not sure if they are being given weapons by some of the guests who want to see them attack cars, or if they're fishing them out of pick-up trucks and vans."
"They will literally go into people's toolboxes and carry them around. One of the baboons was seen lugging around a chainsaw."
Another worker said: "The baboons have been found with knives and screwdrivers. I do wonder if it's some of the guests handing them out."
And the baboon attacks are so inevitable that mechanics across the northwest of England have come to know the enclosure well.
One mechanic in Sale, Greater Manchester said people know what to expect at the park and that he has had two customers fall victim to the baboons this year.
They added that one minute kids want monkeys on the car and the next it has no registration plate - but the issue provides "good money" for the garage.

The 550-acre park, home to lions, tigers, rhinos, wildebeest and camels, dismissed reports of armed apes as an urban myth.
A spokesperson said: "We believe many of these stories have grown in exaggeration as they've been retold, with embellishment to make the objects that are sometimes found in the enclosure seem more exciting and unbelievable."
In 2012 car manufacturer Hyundai let 40 monkeys from the park loose on its New Generation i30 model for 10 hours to prove it had the strength for families with small children.

So I'm going to show you what I believe is the current state of manufacturing, and then compare that to some natural systems.
So in the current state of manufacturing, we have skyscrapers -- two and a half years [of assembly time], 500,000 to a million parts, fairly complex, new, exciting technologies in steel, concrete, glass.
We have exciting machines that can take us into space -- five years [of assembly time], 2.5 million parts.
But on the other side, if you look at the natural systems, we have proteins that have two million types, can fold in 10,000 nanoseconds, or DNA with three billion base pairs we can replicate in roughly an hour.
So there's all of this complexity in our natural systems, but they're extremely efficient, far more efficient than anything we can build, far more complex than anything we can build.
They're far more efficient in terms of energy.
They hardly ever make mistakes.
And they can repair themselves for longevity.
So there's something super interesting about natural systems.
And if we can translate that into our built environment, then there's some exciting potential for the way that we build things.
And I think the key to that is self-assembly.
So if we want to utilize self-assembly in our physical environment, I think there's four key factors.
The first is that we need to decode all of the complexity of what we want to build -- so our buildings and machines.
And we need to decode that into simple sequences -- basically the DNA of how our buildings work.
Then we need programmable parts that can take that sequence and use that to fold up, or reconfigure.
We need some energy that's going to allow that to activate, allow our parts to be able to fold up from the program.
And we need some type of error correction redundancy to guarantee that we have successfully built what we want.
So I'm going to show you a number of projects that my colleagues and I at MIT are working on to achieve this self-assembling future.
The first two are the MacroBot and DeciBot.
So these projects are large-scale reconfigurable robots -- 8 ft., 12 ft. long proteins.
They're embedded with mechanical electrical devices, sensors.
You decode what you want to fold up into, into a sequence of angles -- so negative 120, negative 120, 0, 0, 120, negative 120 -- something like that; so a sequence of angles, or turns, and you send that sequence through the string.
Each unit takes its message -- so negative 120 -- it rotates to that, checks if it got there and then passes it to its neighbor.
So these are the brilliant scientists, engineers, designers that worked on this project.
And I think it really brings to light: Is this really scalable?
I mean, thousands of dollars, lots of man hours made to make this eight-foot robot.
Can we really scale this up? Can we really embed robotics into every part?
The next one questions that and looks at passive nature, or passively trying to have reconfiguration programmability.
But it goes a step further, and it tries to have actual computation.
It basically embeds the most fundamental building block of computing, the digital logic gate, directly into your parts.
So this is a NAND gate.
You have one tetrahedron which is the gate that's going to do your computing, and you have two input tetrahedrons.
One of them is the input from the user, as you're building your bricks.
The other one is from the previous brick that was placed.
And then it gives you an output in 3D space.
So what this means is that the user can start plugging in what they want the bricks to do.
It computes on what it was doing before and what you said you wanted it to do.
And now it starts moving in three-dimensional space -- so up or down.
So on the left-hand side, [1,1] input equals 0 output, which goes down.
On the right-hand side, [0,0] input is a 1 output, which goes up.
And so what that really means is that our structures now contain the blueprints of what we want to build.
So they have all of the information embedded in them of what was constructed.
So that means that we can have some form of self-replication.
In this case I call it self-guided replication, because your structure contains the exact blueprints.
If you have errors, you can replace a part.
All the local information is embedded to tell you how to fix it.
So you could have something that climbs along and reads it and can output at one to one.
It's directly embedded; there's no external instructions.
So the last project I'll show is called Biased Chains, and it's probably the most exciting example that we have right now of passive self-assembly systems.
So it takes the reconfigurability and programmability and makes it a completely passive system.
So basically you have a chain of elements.
Each element is completely identical, and they're biased.
So each chain, or each element, wants to turn right or left.
So as you assemble the chain, you're basically programming it.
You're telling each unit if it should turn right or left.
So when you shake the chain, it then folds up into any configuration that you've programmed in -- so in this case, a spiral, or in this case, two cubes next to each other.
So you can basically program any three-dimensional shape -- or one-dimensional, two-dimensional -- up into this chain completely passively.
So what does this tell us about the future?
I think that it's telling us that there's new possibilities for self-assembly, replication, repair in our physical structures, our buildings, machines.
There's new programmability in these parts.
And from that you have new possibilities for computing.
We'll have spatial computing.
Imagine if our buildings, our bridges, machines, all of our bricks could actually compute.
That's amazing parallel and distributed computing power, new design possibilities.
So it's exciting potential for this.
So I think these projects I've showed here are just a tiny step towards this future, if we implement these new technologies for a new self-assembling world.
Thank you.

Ted Cruz says Pelosi's objectives are "shoveling cash at the problem and shutting America down"
Washington - Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas accused House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats of pushing a coronavirus relief package that focuses on "shoveling cash at the problem and shutting America down" as negotiations on the next measure continue.
In an interview with "Face the Nation" on Sunday, Cruz said the country is confronting two crises simultaneously: a global pandemic that has claimed the lives of more than 600,000 people worldwide and an "absolute economic catastrophe" in the U.S.
But Cruz said Pelosi, who appeared on "Face the Nation" ahead of the senator, " is "focused on neither of those."
"Her objectives are shoveling cash at the problem and shutting America down," the Texas Republican said.
"And in particular, you look at the $3 trillion bill she's trying to push, it's just shoveling money to her friends and not actually solving the problem. Our objective should be Americans want to get back to work. They want to be able to provide for their family."
Senate Republicans and the White House spent last week negotiating the terms of the fourth phase of the coronavirus response, which they expect to cost $1 trillion.
Over the weekend, White House chief of staff Mark Meadow and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin headed back to Capitol Hill for more talks with Senate staff, and Mnuchin told Fox News in an interview Sunday the details are set to be unveiled by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday.
The most pressing issue for lawmakers - and a point of contention between Republicans and Democrats - is the expiration of enhanced unemployment benefits, which began to go away this weekend.
While Democrats want the "phase four" coronavirus package to keep the $600 boost to the benefits, Republicans are calling for it to be pared back and argue some Americans make more from unemployment than they did in wages.
Cruz said more than half of Americans receiving the enhanced unemployment benefits are paid more now than when they were working and said he's talked to small business owners in Texas who are having trouble rehiring employees.
"Of course, they won't come back because the federal government is paying them, in some instances, twice as much money to stay home," he said.
Cruz said Congress should be focusing on passing a recovery bill that would make it easier for Americans to return to work by easing taxes and regulations on small businesses:
"instead of just shoveling trillions out the door, a recovery bill would suspend the payroll tax, which would give it a pay raise to everyone in America who's working. That actually gets people back to work," he said.
President Trump demanded last week the next aid package include a payroll tax cut, but Mnuchin said it will not be part of the legislation, as the proposal was ill-received among Republicans.
Mr. Trump acknowledged the payroll tax cut would be absent from the next bill but sought to pin the blame on Democrats.
Cruz, who last week objected to the cost of the next package, said Sunday he is not on board with the measure from his fellow Senate Republicans.
But he also criticized the $3 trillion bill passed by the Democrat-controlled House in May and accused his political opponents of deliberately crafting a measure that damages the president ahead of the November election.
"The only objective Democrats have is to defeat Donald Trump, and they've cynically decided the best way to defeat Donald Trump is shut down every business in America, shut down every school in America," he said.
"You know, Nancy Pelosi talks about working men and women. What she's proposing is keeping working men and women from working."

US "failures" are holding back search for coronavirus drugs
The global effort to produce useful anti-Covid medicines is being hampered by the US because researchers are testing drugs in "an arbitrary, willy-nilly way," the expert leading the UK's programme has warned.
Britain's Recovery Trial programme, which has involved 12,000 patients at several hundred British hospitals, has already pinpointed one promising new drug to tackle the disease and also highlighted two others - previously thought to be potential life-savers - as being useless.
But the failure of the US medical system to match this output has meant that other promising treatments that could have been cleared for widespread use have still to be evaluated.
In particular, convalescent plasma (blood plasma that is taken from Covid-19 patients and which contains antibodies that could protect others against the disease) has still to be properly tested on a large-scale randomised trial.
"Tens of thousands of people have already been given convalescent plasma in the US but these treatments were not randomised," said Professor Martin Landray, one of the founders of the Recovery programme.
"They just give individuals convalescent plasma in the hope it will work. Vast quantities have been given and they still have no idea whether it helps or harms or has no impact," added Landray, an expert in the setting up of large-scale drug trials.
The US is failing to do large, randomised trials and that ends up providing bad medicine
Randomised drug trials are the gold standard for pinpointing useful medicines.
They remove unconscious biases that might cloud clinicians' judgments.
Thousands of people are given a drug and thousands of others are given a placebo.
No one knows which they have been given.
Then results are compared and the efficacy of the treatment revealed.
In this way, Recovery was able to demonstrate that the steroid dexamethasone reduced deaths by a third in Covid-19 patients on ventilators.
It also showed that the much-hyped drug hydroxychloroquine - as well as the combined therapy of the drugs lopinavir and ritonavir - had no effect in saving patients' lives.
Crucially these trials needed very large numbers of patients and no single hospital has enough for such research.
Britain has had one key advantage - a centralised National Health Service.
By contrast, the US health service is fragmented and its only success in pointing a possible treatment has been highlighting the usefulness of the highly expensive drug remdesivir for speeding recovery of some Covid-19 patients.
"There are lots and lots of small drugs trials involving a few dozen or a few hundred patients going on in the US but nothing of any substance," added Landray.
"They are failing to do large, randomised trials and that ends up providing bad medicine. It makes the practice of medicine poorer and the outcomes for patients poorer."
Landray said this failure was particularly exasperating when it came to the use of convalescent plasma, which many doctors believe could have a key role to play in treating seriously ill Covid-19 patients.
"If you look at the US, huge quantities of this treatment have been used on an arbitrary willy-nilly basis. The UK excels beyond measure compared with what's going on there," he added.
Professor Peter Horby, an expert on infectious diseases and the other founder of the Recovery programme, said:
"There have been reports of 20,000 patients getting convalescent plasma in a cohort but none of those patients were randomised. If they had put these patients into randomised trials, we would now have a clear answer about the effectiveness of convalescent plasma."
Horby added that UK Recovery has now launched a randomised trial of convalescent plasma but does not expect results to be ready until later this year.

Watford relegated from Premier League as Aubameyang fires Arsenal win
Some of Watford's players sank to their knees; others made for the tunnel without a moment's delay.
The whistle had just blown on their five years in the Premier League and nobody could say that, when the occasion demanded them to hurl the kitchen sink at Arsenal, they went down without a fight.
This was a performance full of the crispness, urgency and aggression that have hallmarked their best work over the last half-decade but it came too late, as did the fightback that almost completely overhauled a three-goal deficit on the day.
Had Emiliano Martínez not brilliantly saved Danny Welbeck's backheel 16 minutes from time, shortly after his former teammate had tapped in to put Watford within two goals of safety, there is every chance they could have completed a comeback for the ages.
In the end they fell short and their caretaker manager, Hayden Mullins, might reflect that he would have never been handed this most thankless of tasks if his team had shown comparable application previously.
Across the season they have not been good enough, but then nor has the organisation that employs them.
One poor campaign may not wreck an empire, but nor do the foundations put in place by the Pozzo family offer any kind of guarantee they will sail straight back up from the second tier.

Troy Deeney faces up to relegation despite getting on the scoresheet at the Emirates.
Players will depart, Ismaïla Sarr showing again here that it should be inconceivable he will be playing Championship football in September, and a steady hand should be a priority.
There was nothing stable about the boom-or-bust fare in an encounter Mikel Arteta described as "a bit of a basketball game," although it certainly made for fine entertainment.
Arteta said afterwards Watford's forwards had been "cheating," although he quickly clarified that as a football term for "gambling, staying up front."
They certainly needed to: any suggestion a battling point might eventually suffice was quickly scotched and they might wonder how things would have transpired if they had not been obliged to play catch-up.
Instead they conceded a penalty almost immediately.
Craig Dawson had bundled carelessly into Alexandre Lacazette within 40 seconds but it took VAR almost three minutes to be confident of awarding the spot kick, which Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang dispatched unfussily.
Watford gathered themselves to press relentlessly, with Sarr in electric form on the right, and came close through Roberto Pereyra and Troy Deeney.
But then Aubameyang teed up Kieran Tierney for a deflected second and, at the first drinks break, the game had been so oddly skewed that Arteta was the manager tearing a strip off his players despite Arsenal's advantage.
Aubameyang then controlled Tierney's long throw and converted a masterful overhead kick that left him one goal short of the golden boot, an award he would have shared with Jamie Vardy if Ben Foster had not blocked one last chance near the end.
Watford appeared done for but they persevered and, after David Luiz had produced another rash penalty-area challenge for the album on Welbeck, Deeney rammed in his own penalty before the break.
Deeney, walking wounded for most of the season, hauled himself around the pitch and was in gladiator mode throughout.
He would probably have gobbled up the chance Adam Masina missed early in the second period and further openings were spurned, too.
Welbeck was thwarted for a first time by the excellent Martínez, who Arteta confirmed will start Saturday's FA Cup final, and then had the entire Watford contingent pitchside on their feet upon converting a fizzing cross from Sarr.
But Watford's prospects faded when his next effort was repelled and the soul-searching, from top to bottom, will need to be extensive.

Top British bank HSBC denies "setting up trap" for China's Huawei in US investigations - RT Business News
London-headquartered multinational bank HSBC took to social media to say it was not, as Chinese media claimed, "fabricating evidence" against Huawei, which led to the arrest of the company's chief financial officer in Canada.
In a now-unavailable post on WeChat, the lender said that its actions did not trigger US investigations into the world's largest supplier of telecommunications network equipment, as the scrutiny of Huawei for allegedly violating US sanctions on Iran began well before the bank's involvement in late 2016.
"HSBC does not have any hostility towards Huawei and did not "frame" Huawei," the bank said on Saturday, adding that it would never distort any facts about its clients.
"In response to US DOJ's [US Justice Department] requests for information, HSBC Group simply presented the objective facts.
HSBC did not "fabricate" evidence or "hide" facts."
The post has been blocked on the platform with a note that it "violates regulations" and is not available now.
The statement comes shortly after multiple Chinese media outlets, including state-linked newspapers, accused HSBC of "conspiring" with Washington to set a trap for Huawei.
The company has been at the epicenter of a diplomatic scandal for more than a year and a half since Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou was arrested in December 2018 in Canada on a warrant from the US.
Meng faces fraud charges for allegedly using a shell company to violate sanctions against Iran and allegedly lying to banks about the link between Huawei and Iranian company Skycom.
According new evidence cited by the Global Times, HSBC was well aware of the Chinese company's relationship with Skycom.
The bank reportedly opted to "collude" with the US government to escape more severe punishment in 2012, when the bank had to admit to money laundering and sanctions violations, including restrictions on Iran.
It was ordered at the time to pay around $1.9 billion in penalties and to prevent any similar misconduct.
"The evidence indicated that HSBC understood this relationship but intentionally sold out its customer's confidential business documents to the US side so that the US government could overlook the British bank's own misconduct and not punish it under the 2012 Deferred Prosecution Agreement," the newspaper said in one of its articles on the matter.
In a veiled warning, the Beijing-controlled newspaper added that the lender, if proven to be guilty of this "collusion," could face "harsh punishment" in China, one of the major markets for HSBC.
It is not the first time the renowned bank has come under fire in recent weeks.
Last month, HSBC was lambasted for supporting the new national security law for Hong Kong, the city where its business started and which accounts for over half of its profits.
The bank faced criticism from both sides - from the West, with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo calling the endorsement a "corporate kowtow," and the East, with the Chinese side reportedly saying that its support was "belated."

'What happened there?!' UFC fighter Correia gets pummelled after turning back on rival mistakenly thinking round is over (VIDEO) - RT Sport News
Brazilian bantamweight Bethe Correia is a UFC veteran but made an amateur error by turning her back on opponent Pannie Kianzad and mistakenly thinking the round was over in their bout on Fight Island, and got tagged as a result.
Coming to the end of the first stanza of their showdown on the undercard in Abu Dhabi, the 37-year-old Correia appeared to mistake the 10-second warning for the actual end of the round, reaching out a glove before turning her back on Kianzad and making her way back to her corner.
The Swedish fighter capitalized without hesitation, tagging her opponent with a right hand before following up with a series of blows to back Correia against the cage.
Momentarily appearing in danger, the Brazilian then regained control to stifle the threat and back Kianzad up before the actual end of the round was called.
"What happened there? Oh my word," the commentary team on ESPN+ were heard exclaiming.
It was just one part of a frustrating night for former bantamweight title challenger Correia, who went down to a unanimous decision defeat which is her third loss in her past four octagon outings and leaves her overall record at 11-5, with one draw.
For the Iranian-born Kianzad, 28, it was a second win on the spin following her victory over Jessica-Rose Clark at UFC Fight Night in Moscow back in November.

Gwyneth Paltrow wants kids to have good 'worth ethic'
Gwyneth Paltrow has said she wants to raise her children to have a good worth ethic as she tries 'not to just hand them things'.
Paltrow has two children, Apple (16) and Moses (14), with ex-husband Chris Martin and she wants them to have good values and not get by on their parents fame.
"That's why I think it's so important... To raise a kid that has a work ethic and whose values are aligned with yours or with their own sense of who they are, etc," she told Rob Lowe on his podcast.
"The truth of the matter is the doors can be opened for you, but if you think about all the people who try and it doesn't happen."
She added, "As a parent you think, all I can do for these kids is teach them right from wrong and teach them what work is. I've really have tried not to just hand them things."
Paltrow has also taken steps to allow her children to live as privately as possible, and ensures they keep their social media accounts private.
"I won't let them be public on any social media or anything like that, I try to keep them out of the public eye as much as possible," she said.

£10m fund set up to support Scottish events
Organisers of cultural, community and sporting events are to be offered financial support while they remain affected by lockdown restrictions.
The Scottish government's £10m funding package also aims to help event suppliers.
The government said it was looking at how events could restart safely in the future.
Economy Secretary Fiona Hyslop said the coronavirus pandemic had had a "devastating impact" on the sector.
Scotland's festival scene and sporting events such as the Highland games have been among those affected by restrictions brought in to prevent the spread of Covid-19.
Ms Hyslop said: "Whilst we've had the positive step that drive-in events can resume, most of the sector will be unable to operate for some time to come.
"We've worked closely and constructively with the sector on the challenges they face and they have brought forward some creative ideas on how they can begin to operate safely.
"In addition to providing immediate support, some of this funding will look to bolster innovation and aid the longer-term recovery of the events industry."
The Event Industry Advisory Group said the sector had been one of the first to go into lockdown and would be among the last to fully emerge from it.
Chairman Peter Duthie, who is also chief executive of the SEC in Glasgow, said events contributed about £6bn each year to Scotland's economy.
He said: "Additional funding from government for this important sector is very welcome and much needed, both by the event organisers and the wider supply chain businesses who are being hit exceptionally hard by the ongoing effect of an extended period of lockdown."

Angola: Pedalé Hospital Assigned to Health Ministry
Luanda - The President of the Republic, João Lourenço, determined this Friday the transfer of the supervision of the Pedro Maria Tonha Pedalé Hospital, under construction in Luanda, to the sphere of the Ministry of Health.
In a note, the Press Office of the President of the Republic informs that the measure aims to materialize the Government principle of construction and expansion of the network of public hospitals to ensure better medical care and medication to the population.
"In this specific case, the idea is to make available to Angolans a reference hospital, differentiated and equipped with modern technology and high precision in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases of high complexity," the document reads.
It stresses that the decision of the Angolan Head of State also takes into account the demographic growth of the country, which has motivated a "huge demand" for quality health services in the most diverse specialties.
This demand, the note continues, justifies with the inclusion in the hospital specialized for the treatment of complex diseases, teaching and research, interventions related to ophthalmology and maternal-infant medicine, areas whose strategy and management deserve to be under the responsibility of the Ministry of Health.

Be wary of gardening gimmicks that look too good
It might be an embarrassing thing for a plant scientist to admit, but I am a total sucker for a garden gimmick.
I like to think it's because I am open-minded or maybe just irrationally optimistic, particularly as many things in the plant world are often extremely counterintuitive.
But I am not ashamed to say I have fallen for dozens of them over a lifetime in horticulture.
While I firmly believe in the value of trying things out for yourself, if you don't fancy learning the hard way, here are some of the most common garden gimmicks I have come across.
First up, and probably the worst offender, grafted tomato-potato plants.
Hailed as a revolutionary breakthrough, grafting tomato plants on to potato roots is, in fact, an old-school botanical curiosity, dating back to at least the 1920s.
As they are both from the same family and have broadly similar internal "plumbing," you can indeed create such surgically enhanced marvels.
But here's the problem: creating resource-intensive structures like fruits and roots takes up a lot of metabolic energy, and if plants are attempting to do both their limited energies inevitably become split.
That means the yields of these grafted plants are terrible and nothing like what you see in the marketing pictures.
Then there is the fact that the crops mature at different rates, so to harvest the spuds you have to kill the plants before the tomatoes have ripened.
On the subject of marketing imagery, there's a lot of dodgy dealing here, too.
I've seen roses Photoshopped sky blue and fruit trees with a physiologically impossible amount of fruit on their branches in some major catalogues.
I've even seen photos "borrowed" from my Instagram account and used by shopping networks as images of their trial grounds.
Sadly the work of a small minority of cavalier companies mean you have to view advertising images, particularly online, with a very sceptical eye.
If it looks too good to be true, it probably is.
Speaking of which, the colour blue is relatively rare in the botanical world, so if you see a dazzling new heather, orchid or cactus, shining out in the most intense "disinfectant" shade of blue, it's almost certainly been sprayed or dyed.
Which would be fine, so long as vendors made this clear, but they rarely ever do.
Blue moth orchids will revert back to their original white, but sprayed cacti and heathers, coated in a light-suppressing layer of dye, are unlikely to survive for long.
Finally, I have to flag up bonsai kits or, even worse, bonsai seeds, that promise miniature trees will sprout from their packets.
Bonsai is not a species of plant.
It's a training technique used to give the illusion of ancient trees on distant mountaintops.
They are almost always started from mature shrubs that are hacked back and new growth wired in place.
I know I'll keep falling for gimmicks, it's part of the fun of experimentation.
But side-step these ones and you may find one that actually has a chance of living up to its promise.

Coronavirus: Travellers from Spain told to quarantine
Travellers arriving in the UK from Spain must now quarantine for 14 days, under new coronavirus travel rules.
They were announced on Saturday following a spike in coronavirus cases in Spain, with more than 900 new cases of the virus reported on Friday.
Spanish officials have also warned a second wave could be imminent as major cities have seen cases surge.
Airlines including British Airways have criticised the new measures as "yet another blow" to British holidaymakers.
People currently on holiday in Spain have been advised by the Department of Transport to follow the local rules, return home as normal, and check the Foreign Office's travel advice website for further information.
The Foreign Office is advising against all but essential travel to mainland Spain, however the quarantine measures apply to those returning from mainland Spain, the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands, such as Majorca and Ibiza.
Foreign Office advice has ramifications for travel insurance.
Among those affected by the new rules is Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, who began his holiday in Spain on Saturday.
He is expected to continue his trip as planned and isolate in line with guidance on his return.
Quarantine measures for UK travellers were first introduced in early June.
But after pressure from the aviation and travel industries, the government and devolved administrations published lists of countries exempt from the rules.
British Airways said it was "disappointed" about the latest changes to the government's travel advice and rules, although the airline said its flights were continuing to operate.
It said the move was "throwing thousands of Britons' travel plans into chaos."
The Airport Operators Association said the new measures would "further damage what is already a fragile restart of the aviation sector which continues to face the biggest challenge in its history."
The UK's biggest tour operator, Tui, cancelled its flights due to depart to mainland Spain and the Canary Islands on Sunday.
Customers currently on holiday will be able to return on their intended flight home.
However, budget airline EasyJet said it was "disappointed" and would operate a full schedule in the coming days.
"Customers who no longer wish to travel can transfer their flights without a change fee or receive a voucher for the value of the booking," the company said in a statement.
A spokesman for the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) said the government's quarantine rule change was "disappointing."
"We suggest the government considers lifting the quarantine rules for flights to and from certain regions with lower infection rates, or to places such as the Balearic Islands or the Canaries - which are geographically distinct from mainland Spain - to avoid further damage to the UK inbound and outbound tourism industries," he said.
Spain has so far seen more than 28,000 coronavirus deaths.
On Thursday, it saw the biggest daily increase in infections since its lockdown ended.
Catalonia has become the latest region to crack down on nightlife.
The wealthy north-east region, which is home to Barcelona, ordered all nightclubs to close for two weeks and put a midnight curfew on bars in the greater Barcelona area.
The BBC's Guy Hedgecoe in Madrid says contagion among young people is a particular worry, as they have been gathering in large numbers in cities at night.
France has warned its citizens not to travel to Catalonia while Norway has said it will start quarantining people arriving from Spain.
The government is urging employers to be "understanding of those returning from Spain who now will need to self-isolate."
But Labour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds called for the government to explain in detail how it would support those affected, adding that the news would be "deeply concerning for families who are in caught in Spain or are planning travel."

During Tribute To Kargil Heroes, PM Narendra Modi Says Pakistan Tried To "Backstab" India
Pakistan tried to "backstab" India despite her attempts to keep friendly relations, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said today in his tribute to the armed forces on the 21st anniversary of Kargil war.
In his monthly radio address Mann ki Baat, PM Modi said "Pakistan undertook this misadventure with sinister plans to capture India's land and to divert its ongoing internal conflicts."
"Pakistan had the audacity of trying to occupy Indian soil and deviate attention from its own internal unrest," he said.
"At the time, India was trying for improve relations with Pakistan.
But as it is said, evil's nature is to fight everyone without reason.
People of this nature can only think of doing evil even to those who try to do them good.
That's why Pakistan backstabbed India despite India's attempts at cordial relations," he said.
"You can imagine, the enemy was perched high on the mountains while our forces were fighting them from below. But the high morale and true of our forces won against mountains," he added.
"Thanks to the courage of our armed forces, India showed great strength in Kargil," PM Modi said, recalling his own visit to the area.
Kargil Diwas is celebrated every year, marking the day the Indian Army recaptured all the Indian posts in Ladakh's Kargil that had been occupied by Pakistan's army 21 years ago.
On July 26, 1999, the Army had announced the successful culmination of "Operation Vijay."

In the decades since Kargil, India-Pakistan relations have been strained following a series of terror strikes.
India has insisted that talks and terror cannot go hand-in-hand and Pakistan needs to dismantle all the terror camps operating from its soil.

Tunisia interior minister named new PM, to form government in a month
Tunisia's Interior Minister Hichem Mechichi has been appointed to form the next government, the president's office said, amid political tensions among major parties in the North African country.
The 46-year-old lawyer succeeds Elyes Fakhfakh, who resigned as prime minister earlier this month.
But Mechichi was not one of the names proposed by the governing political parties to President Kais Saied.
In a statement following Saturday's announcement, Mechichi said he would "work to form a government that meets the expectations of all Tunisians."
Tunisia has been praised as a rare success story for democratic transition after the Arab Spring regional uprisings sparked by its 2011 revolution.
But its leaders have struggled to meet the expectations of the Tunisian people and the already fragile economy has been battered by the closure of the country's borders because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The disease has killed nearly 50 people and infected more than 1,400 in Tunisia.
As well as being the interior minister in the outgoing government, Mechichi has been a counsellor to President Saied, handling legal matters.
He has previously been chief of staff at the Ministry of Transport and also served in the Ministry of Social Affairs.
He now has a month to form a government, which will then face a parliamentary vote of confidence and will need an absolute majority to succeed.
Failing that, parliament will be dissolved and new elections will be held within three months.
In the last elections held in October, the Ennahdha party came on top but fell far short of a majority and eventually agreed to join a coalition government.
Fakhfakh's resignation on July 15, after less than five months in office, threatened fresh political deadlock in the nation as it struggles with the economic fallout of the pandemic.
The resignation deepened the political dispute with Ennahdha over allegations against Fakhfakh of conflicts of interest.
Relations between the 47-year-old outgoing leader and Ennahdha have been strained since the October legislative elections.
Fakhfakh stepped down the same day the party filed a no-confidence motion against him.
Ennahdha had initially nominated an independent for prime minister, but he failed to win the support of parliament, leading the president to name former Finance Minister Fakhfakh for the post.
Faced with the prospect of fresh elections, Ennahdha eventually agreed to join the coalition government.

Bodies of mother, 2 infants found in car submerged in pond
AUGUSTA, Ga. -- Authorities pulled a submerged vehicle from a Georgia pond and found the bodies of a woman and her twin 10-month-old children inside.

AP blasts White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany for "political" briefings - but reporters keep asking political questions - RT USA News
The Associated Press has accused White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany of worrying the media by making her briefings political rather than informational -- apparently forgetting that reporters choose the questions.
An article Saturday by the AP, the largest US news agency, said White House press briefings may be a "broken tradition," as McEnany has made them "a streamlined, full-throated advertisement for a president facing re-election, a venue for attacks on the media and a forum relatively light on information" about what the government is doing.
The last of those assertions is indisputable, as hardly any new information is revealed at the briefings.
What the AP failed to mention is that hardly any new information is actually sought at the briefings.
Reporters frequently use White House pressers to draw attention to themselves, an art form perfected by CNN's Jim Acosta.
They go beyond the typical adversarial media-administration relationship, repeating each other in asking gotcha questions aimed only at impugning President Donald Trump.
In some cases, they make themselves the news, such as when CBS News reporter Weijia Jiang responded to an "ask China" retort from Trump by making a not-so-subtle hint at racism: "Sir, why are you saying that to me specifically?"
A July 6 briefing offered a prime example of the disconnect over how the briefings have ceased to be a source of meaningful information for Americans.
Trump tweeted that morning that NASCAR's television ratings had been hurt by a false allegation of a hate crime against driver Bubba Wallace and by its decision to ban display of the Confederate flag at its events.
Predictably, most of the questions were about the tweet as reporter after reporter asked McEnany questions designed to prompt her to say that Trump supports the Confederate flag.
McEnany didn't provide the answer reporters wanted - a sound bite that would hurt Trump - but she repeatedly responded by saying the president wasn't taking a position on the Confederate flag and that the gist of his message was that NASCAR fans were wrongly being portrayed as being racist.
The AP said she sounded "exasperated" during the briefing.
The AP's story echoed a Washington Post op-ed column earlier this month by ABC News reporter Jonathan Karl, who also is president of the White House Correspondents Association.
Karl argued, "denying reality and using the White House podium for purely political purposes is a violation of public trust."
Yet McEnany's quick wit and combative style have made her a hero of some Trump supporters, since she gave her first briefing on May 1 after taking over as press secretary in April.

"It's not just a gotcha game," Hume said of the intended purpose of the pressers.

Famously clear Lake Tahoe has been polluted by climate change
South Lake Tahoe, California - Despite the pandemic, even on a weekday, people still crowd Pope Beach at Lake Tahoe.
"I like camping and having a bike ride and going swimming at the Lake," said one girl named Dakota.
"This is something beautiful everybody wants to visit," said Emerica Benitas.
Which is why Matt Meunier's dive business is still going strong, even in a pandemic.
He says he sees "exceptional clarity. Lake Tahoe is the cleanest, most wonderful lake, I think, in the country."
Now the bad news: Lake Tahoe's not as clean, not as clear, as it used to be when he moved here over two decades ago.
"The thing that we're noticing more and more is down on the rocks," Meunier said.
"You're getting this strange algae on the rocks."
Climate change, scientists believe, has affected the water temperature and thus, the clarity.
And 15 million people visit the lake annually - along with the garbage they leave.
Meunier said dive trips to clean up the bottom of the lake found old trash.
"And when I say old trash, I mean '60s, '70s," Meunier said.
"Beer cans, soda cans, church key cans from the old days."
Scientists monitor the clarity of Lake Tahoe every year by dropping a white disc, then measuring how far down they can see it.
UC Davis professor Geoff Schladow said it's an "important indicator of how healthy the lake is."
When it was measured last year, the clarity of the lake was about 80 feet.
That means you can see that disc 80 feet down.
But, consider this, about 20 years ago, the clarity of lake was 100 feet.
That's the trend scientists are trying to reverse.
But they're fighting the impacts of climate change, development around the lake and something added to the lake in the 1960's: A tiny invasive shrimp brought in to feed the fish.
It didn't work.
"Once the shrimp came in, there were suddenly no natural cleaners in the lake," Schladow said.
Similar challenges are facing lakes and bodies of water around the world.
"The lesson here is, if you can't do it at Tahoe, then what hope is there for all the rivers and estuaries, streams and lakes around the country that are never going to have the same degree of attention, the same level of resources?" Schladow said.
Meunier said he is "hopeful" because "if there's a silver lining of our pandemic, I think it showed that nature will come back and heal itself if we just relieved that pressure, that human pressure, off of it and allow it to happen.  There's facts there now."

Shivraj Singh Chouhan On Testing Covid Positive
Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, who on Saturday confirmed he had tested positive for COVID-19, tweeted Sunday morning to say that he is "fine" and to offer his praise for front-line workers in the war on coronavirus.
The Chief Minister also repeated his warnings from yesterday, when he urged people to follow guidelines, such as social distancing and the use of face masks.
"I am fine, my friends. The dedication of coronavirus warriors, who selflessly risk their lives, is praiseworthy. I salute all coronavirus warriors of the state," Mr Chouhan tweeted from Bhopal's Chirayu Hospital, where he was admitted yesterday.
"Keep two metres distance, wash your hands frequently and wear face masks - these are the biggest weapons we have to avoid the coronavirus. I appeal to all people - use these weapons for yourself and your loved ones," he said.
"All of you be careful, stay safe and healthy. This is what I pray to God," Mr Chouhan added.
On Saturday Mr Chouhan had tweeted that he had tested positive for the virus despite his best efforts to avoid infection and warned that "just a little carelessness invites the coronavirus."
Tweeting this morning Mr Chouhan said that despite the threat of infection there was "no need to fear" and urged those showing symptoms to get themselves tested.
"If you are infected, there is no need to fear. Do not hide symptoms but tell doctors immediately, so treatment can be started. Timely treatment will make you healthy," he said.

Online lenders warn SME loan scheme may miss the mark
The small business sector, often under-served by the big banks, has increasingly turned to online lenders to meet its funding needs.
However, Mr Callaghan said online lenders were disadvantaged compared to the big banks because they did not have access to the same lower priced funding and warned as a result the SME guarantee scheme was not gaining traction.
"I think it has probably missed the mark where all the people who call us, call in the expectation they can get very cheap funding rather than the government backing 50 per cent of the loan," he said.
"So they call and they get very disappointed because the expectation has been put out there that there is discount pricing and we look at our cost of funding which hasn't changed at all."
Mr Callaghan added if fintechs were able to access cheaper funding and pass that on to small businesses the scheme would be a "no brainer."
"It's been a bit of a Catch 22 the major banks have got access to the lower cost funding but they are more risk averse so they don't actually go out to lend in the same way, they can't get access to the data and they can't get comfortable unless you have property," he said "Until we can access that cheaper funding I think there is a fiction out in the market on how popular the scheme is going to be."
Melbourne-based Moula is also participating in the scheme and chief executive Aris Allegos said the benefit of the 50 per cent guarantee, implicit in the government scheme, should be passed on to small businesses but different lenders were handling this in different ways.
"I can understand there might be others who are not passing through that cost structure," he said.
"That might be a function of how their funding is structured and it might be a function also of which categories they are lending into and how they assess risk within those categories."
Mr Allegos would not provide details of the number of loans Moula had issued under the scheme but said the revamped scheme was "a core recognition of what needed to change" to offer more flexibility to lenders and borrowers.
However, he said his major concern was the "two speed economy" that was operating and the impact this would have on small businesses.
"The biggest issue Moula has to face and lenders with respect to small businesses is that proverbial cliff and how to manage into that cliff," he said.
"Generally speaking with respect to demand we have not returned to pre-COVID levels although appetite is growing."
ASX-listed online lender Prospa also would not detail the amount of loans it had issued under the scheme as it said the information was commercially sensitive but chief executive Greg Moshal said the goverment's extension of the scheme was welcome.
"We support any enhancements to the scheme that will enable small businesses to access a wide range of funding products that meet their requirements, including flexible cash flow products over shorter terms," he said.

Rahul Gandhi Goes To People On Rajasthan Issue
Congress's Rahul Gandhi tweeted a video today attempting to mobilise the people against the BJP over the events in Rajasthan.
Using hashtag #SpeakUpForDemocracy, his Hindia post urged the people to "Unite and raise our voice for democracy."
The Congress is planning a countrywide protest on Monday over the situation in Rajasthan, where the Ashok Gehlot government is struggling to survive.
While the party said a protest will be held outside the Rashtrapati Bhavan, the official residence of President Ram Nath Kovind.
In the video, the Congress has accused the BJP of "Ripping up the constitution and demolishing democracy" while the whole country is fighting the coronavirus.
It has done the same in Madhya Pradesh, the Congress said.
"We demand to immediately convene an assembly session which is within our constitutional rights," the party said in the video.

Mr Gehlot's government has been in deep crisis after his deputy Sachin Pilot turned rebel with a chunk of MLAs supporting him.
The party has been unable to disqualify the rebels to bring down the majority mark in the assembly.
Mr Pilot -- who was stripped of his posts in the party and the government -- has been given temporary relief from disqualification by the Rajasthan High Court, which held that the Speaker cannot take any action until the larger constitutional question about his powers is decided.
That question will be taken up tomorrow by the Supreme Court, which will also decide whether a court can interfere with the Speaker's decisions.
The Congress stands only one past the majority mark in the 200-member assembly.
Team Pilot claims the support of 30 MLAs, but so far, the evidence points to only 19.
The BJP has 72 and including allies and Independents, it stands at 97.
If the court decides in favour of Mr Pilot, the Congress can lose the second of the three governments it formed in the heartland states following the 2018 assembly elections.
In March, it lost the Kamal Nath-led government in Madhya Pradesh after Jyotiraditya Scindia joined the BJP with 22 of his MLAs.

Kudlow says next coronavirus stimulus bill will include more checks, extend moratorium on evictions
White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow promised on Sunday that the federal government will extend the moratorium on evictions and send out another round of checks as part of the next coronavirus stimulus package.
Kudlow's comments come after a week where the White House's hoped for payroll tax cuts were shot down by Congress.
"There's a $1,200 check coming. That is going to be part of the new package. I would have preferred a payroll tax cut, on top of that check," Kudlow said on CNN's "State of the Union.
"But, be that as it may, politically, it doesn't work."
While no deal has been officially announced, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows have been on Capitol Hill recently to discuss the details of a new relief package with congressional leaders.
On ending the additional $600 in unemployment benefits the federal government was supplying, Kudlow argued that the extra money was hurting small businesses from hiring workers.
"We have had a flood of inquiries and phone calls and complaints that small stores and businesses, restaurants can't hire people back," he said.
"They went too far. Maybe last March, it was necessary for that, but, really, there are consequences of people not returning to work."
Mnuchin earlier in the day on "Fox News Sunday" said it a little more bluntly: "I think workers and Americans understand the concept that you shouldn't be paid more to stay home than to work."
Mnuchin said the new bill will provide additional unemployment benefits, but noted that it will be less than the payments issued under the CARES Act.

Salmonella outbreak sickens 212 people in 23 states
July 25 (UPI) -- The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is investigating an outbreak of salmonella that has sickened 212 people in 23 states.
In a Friday press release the CDC reported that 87 people had become ill since its last update on the outbreak Tuesday.
The agency said people began showing symptoms linked to a strain of salmonella, which can take two to four weeks to manifest symptoms, between June 19 and July 11.
Thirty-one people have been hospitalized since the outbreak began, but no fatalities have been reported.
According to the CDC, a specific source for the salmonella strain has not been identified.

Algeria: Mahmoud Guemama's Death - Algeria Loses a Patriot, Committed Militant, Says President Tebboune.
Algiers - President of the Republic, Abdelmadjid Tebboune, sent a message of condolences to members of the People's National Assembly (APN), Mujahed Mahmoud Guemama, who died Friday, in which he said that Algeria "has lost a patriot and a militant committed to the causes of his people and his nation."
Algeria loses today, by the death of Mujahed Mahmoud Guemama, a patriot and a militant committed to the causes of his people and his nation, a man who has never wavered and whose determination remained intact from the moment he took up arms, alongside his valiant Mujahedeen brothers, until his last breath on this sad day when we can only resign ourselves to God's will," President Tebboune wrote in his message of condolence.
"The late Mahmoud Guemama, peace be upon him, belonged to a unique generation of faithful patriotic militants who sacrificed themselves for their homeland," added President of the Republic.
"The deceased devoted his life to the liberation of Algeria from the torments of abject colonialism, by joining the ranks of the Revolution in the prime of life in 1960 in the Tahart training camp of the historic wilaya VI."
"The late President is known to all for his proven militancy and his commitment to anchoring the image of a prosperous and united Algeria," said President Tebboune.
"In the far south, the late Mahmoud Guemama enjoys great renown as a mediator, intervening to reconcile brothers in the same country whenever the fire of discord is kindled," added the President in his message.
"All these qualities and values earned the late Mahmoud Guemama the respect and trust of the people of Tamanrasset who chose him to represent them in the People's National Assembly (APN) for several terms, during which he was the ambassador and defender of the concerns of the region and the aspirations of its people, and even the representative and spokesman of all Algerians," wrote the President of the Republic.
"All expressions of condolence will not be enough to pay tribute to the mujahed Mahmoud Guemama, peace be upon him.
He is leaving us today at a time when Algeria needs him," said the President.
"I pray to Almighty God to surround the deceased with His Holy Mercy, to welcome him in His vast paradise alongside the shuhadaa and virtuous.
I also pray to God to lend his family and loved ones patience and comfort...there is no strength or power except in God," the President of the Republic concluded.

You all know the truth of what I'm going to say.
I think the intuition that inequality is divisive and socially corrosive has been around since before the French Revolution.
What's changed is we now can look at the evidence, we can compare societies, more and less equal societies, and see what inequality does.
I'm going to take you through that data and then explain why the links I'm going to be showing you exist.
But first, see what a miserable lot we are.
(Laughter) I want to start though with a paradox.
This shows you life expectancy against gross national income -- how rich countries are on average.
And you see the countries on the right, like Norway and the USA, are twice as rich as Israel, Greece, Portugal on the left.
And it makes no difference to their life expectancy at all.
There's no suggestion of a relationship there.
But if we look within our societies, there are extraordinary social gradients in health running right across society.
This, again, is life expectancy.
These are small areas of England and Wales -- the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.
A lot of difference between the poor and the rest of us.
Even the people just below the top have less good health than the people at the top.
So income means something very important within our societies, and nothing between them.
The explanation of that paradox is that, within our societies, we're looking at relative income or social position, social status -- where we are in relation to each other and the size of the gaps between us.
And as soon as you've got that idea, you should immediately wonder: what happens if we widen the differences, or compress them, make the income differences bigger or smaller?
And that's what I'm going to show you.
I'm not using any hypothetical data.
I'm taking data from the U.N. -- it's the same as the World Bank has -- on the scale of income differences in these rich developed market democracies.
The measure we've used, because it's easy to understand and you can download it, is how much richer the top 20 percent than the bottom 20 percent in each country.
And you see in the more equal countries on the left -- Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden -- the top 20 percent are about three and a half, four times as rich as the bottom 20 percent.
But on the more unequal end -- U.K., Portugal, USA, Singapore -- the differences are twice as big.
On that measure, we are twice as unequal as some of the other successful market democracies.
Now I'm going to show you what that does to our societies.
We collected data on problems with social gradients, the kind of problems that are more common at the bottom of the social ladder.
Internationally comparable data on life expectancy, on kids' maths and literacy scores, on infant mortality rates, homicide rates, proportion of the population in prison, teenage birthrates, levels of trust, obesity, mental illness -- which in standard diagnostic classification includes drug and alcohol addiction -- and social mobility.
We put them all in one index.
They're all weighted equally.
Where a country is is a sort of average score on these things.
And there, you see it in relation to the measure of inequality I've just shown you, which I shall use over and over again in the data.
The more unequal countries are doing worse on all these kinds of social problems.
It's an extraordinarily close correlation.
But if you look at that same index of health and social problems in relation to GNP per capita, gross national income, there's nothing there, no correlation anymore.
We were a little bit worried that people might think we'd been choosing problems to suit our argument and just manufactured this evidence, so we also did a paper in the British Medical Journal on the UNICEF index of child well-being.
It has 40 different components put together by other people.
It contains whether kids can talk to their parents, whether they have books at home, what immunization rates are like, whether there's bullying at school.
Everything goes into it.
Here it is in relation to that same measure of inequality.
Kids do worse in the more unequal societies.
Highly significant relationship.
But once again, if you look at that measure of child well-being, in relation to national income per person, there's no relationship, no suggestion of a relationship.
What all the data I've shown you so far says is the same thing.
The average well-being of our societies is not dependent any longer on national income and economic growth.
That's very important in poorer countries, but not in the rich developed world.
But the differences between us and where we are in relation to each other now matter very much.
I'm going to show you some of the separate bits of our index.
Here, for instance, is trust.
It's simply the proportion of the population who agree most people can be trusted.
It comes from the World Values Survey.
You see, at the more unequal end, it's about 15 percent of the population who feel they can trust others.
But in the more equal societies, it rises to 60 or 65 percent.
And if you look at measures of involvement in community life or social capital, very similar relationships closely related to inequality.
I may say, we did all this work twice.
We did it first on these rich, developed countries, and then as a separate test bed, we repeated it all on the 50 American states -- asking just the same question: do the more unequal states do worse on all these kinds of measures?
So here is trust from a general social survey of the federal government related to inequality.
Very similar scatter over a similar range of levels of trust.
Same thing is going on.
Basically we found that almost anything that's related to trust internationally is related to trust amongst the 50 states in that separate test bed.
We're not just talking about a fluke.
This is mental illness.
WHO put together figures using the same diagnostic interviews on random samples of the population to allow us to compare rates of mental illness in each society.
This is the percent of the population with any mental illness in the preceding year.
And it goes from about eight percent up to three times that -- whole societies with three times the level of mental illness of others.
And again, closely related to inequality.
This is violence.
These red dots are American states, and the blue triangles are Canadian provinces.
But look at the scale of the differences.
It goes from 15 homicides per million up to 150.
This is the proportion of the population in prison.
There's a about a tenfold difference there, log scale up the side.
But it goes from about 40 to 400 people in prison.
That relationship is not mainly driven by more crime.
In some places, that's part of it.
But most of it is about more punitive sentencing, harsher sentencing.
And the more unequal societies are more likely also to retain the death penalty.
Here we have children dropping out of high school.
Again, quite big differences.
Extraordinarily damaging, if you're talking about using the talents of the population.
This is social mobility.
It's actually a measure of mobility based on income.
Basically, it's asking: do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons, or is there no relationship between the two?
And at the more unequal end, fathers' income is much more important -- in the U.K., USA.
And in Scandinavian countries, fathers' income is much less important.
There's more social mobility.
And as we like to say -- and I know there are a lot of Americans in the audience here -- if Americans want to live the American dream, they should go to Denmark.
(Laughter) (Applause) I've shown you just a few things in italics here.
I could have shown a number of other problems.
They're all problems that tend to be more common at the bottom of the social gradient.
But there are endless problems with social gradients that are worse in more unequal countries -- not just a little bit worse, but anything from twice as common to 10 times as common.
Think of the expense, the human cost of that.
I want to go back though to this graph that I showed you earlier where we put it all together to make two points.
One is that, in graph after graph, we find the countries that do worse, whatever the outcome, seem to be the more unequal ones, and the ones that do well seem to be the Nordic countries and Japan.
So what we're looking at is general social disfunction related to inequality.
It's not just one or two things that go wrong, it's most things.
The other really important point I want to make on this graph is that, if you look at the bottom, Sweden and Japan, they're very different countries in all sorts of ways.
The position of women, how closely they keep to the nuclear family, are on opposite ends of the poles in terms of the rich developed world.
But another really important difference is how they get their greater equality.
Sweden has huge differences in earnings, and it narrows the gap through taxation, general welfare state, generous benefits and so on.
Japan is rather different though.
It starts off with much smaller differences in earnings before tax.
It has lower taxes.
It has a smaller welfare state.
And in our analysis of the American states, we find rather the same contrast.
There are some states that do well through redistribution, some states that do well because they have smaller income differences before tax.
So we conclude that it doesn't much matter how you get your greater equality, as long as you get there somehow.
I am not talking about perfect equality, I'm talking about what exists in rich developed market democracies.
Another really surprising part of this picture is that it's not just the poor who are affected by inequality.
There seems to be some truth in John Donne's "No man is an island."
And in a number of studies, it's possible to compare how people do in more and less equal countries at each level in the social hierarchy.
This is just one example.
It's infant mortality.
Some Swedes very kindly classified a lot of their infant deaths according to the British register of general socioeconomic classification.
And so it's anachronistically a classification by fathers' occupations, so single parents go on their own.
But then where it says "low social class," that's unskilled manual occupations.
It goes through towards the skilled manual occupations in the middle, then the junior non-manual, going up high to the professional occupations -- doctors, lawyers, directors of larger companies.
You see there that Sweden does better than Britain all the way across the social hierarchy.
The biggest differences are at the bottom of society.
But even at the top, there seems to be a small benefit to being in a more equal society.
We show that on about five different sets of data covering educational outcomes and health in the United States and internationally.
And that seems to be the general picture -- that greater equality makes most difference at the bottom, but has some benefits even at the top.
But I should say a few words about what's going on.
I think I'm looking and talking about the psychosocial effects of inequality.
More to do with feelings of superiority and inferiority, of being valued and devalued, respected and disrespected.
And of course, those feelings of the status competition that comes out of that drives the consumerism in our society.
It also leads to status insecurity.
We worry more about how we're judged and seen by others, whether we're regarded as attractive, clever, all that kind of thing.
The social-evaluative judgments increase, the fear of those social-evaluative judgments.
Interestingly, some parallel work going on in social psychology: some people reviewed 208 different studies in which volunteers had been invited into a psychological laboratory and had their stress hormones, their responses to doing stressful tasks, measured.
And in the review, what they were interested in seeing is what kind of stresses most reliably raise levels of cortisol, the central stress hormone.
And the conclusion was it was tasks that included social-evaluative threat -- threats to self-esteem or social status in which others can negatively judge your performance.
Those kind of stresses have a very particular effect on the physiology of stress.
Now we have been criticized.
Of course, there are people who dislike this stuff and people who find it very surprising.
I should tell you though that when people criticize us for picking and choosing data, we never pick and choose data.
We have an absolute rule that if our data source has data for one of the countries we're looking at, it goes into the analysis.
Our data source decides whether it's reliable data, we don't.
Otherwise that would introduce bias.
What about other countries?
There are 200 studies of health in relation to income and equality in the academic peer-reviewed journals.
This isn't confined to these countries here, hiding a very simple demonstration.
The same countries, the same measure of inequality, one problem after another.
Why don't we control for other factors?
Well we've shown you that GNP per capita doesn't make any difference.
And of course, others using more sophisticated methods in the literature have controlled for poverty and education and so on.
What about causality?
Correlation in itself doesn't prove causality.
We spend a good bit of time.
And indeed, people know the causal links quite well in some of these outcomes.
The big change in our understanding of drivers of chronic health in the rich developed world is how important chronic stress from social sources is affecting the immune system, the cardiovascular system.
Or for instance, the reason why violence becomes more common in more unequal societies is because people are sensitive to being looked down on.
I should say that to deal with this, we've got to deal with the post-tax things and the pre-tax things.
We've got to constrain income, the bonus culture incomes at the top.
I think we must make our bosses accountable to their employees in any way we can.
I think the take-home message though is that we can improve the real quality of human life by reducing the differences in incomes between us.
Suddenly we have a handle on the psychosocial well-being of whole societies, and that's exciting.
Thank you.

Scotland-England Union Chain Bridge is 200 years old
A bridge linking Scotland and England has turned 200 years old ahead of a £10m renovation.
The Union Chain Bridge crosses the River Tweed from Fishwick in the Scottish Borders to Horncliffe in Northumberland.
When it opened in 1820, it was the longest wrought iron suspension bridge in the world with a span of 449ft (137m).
It was also the first vehicular bridge of its type in the UK.
The bridge was designed by English Royal Navy officer Capt Samuel Brown.
He patented and produced wrought iron chains after being affected by the loss of Royal Naval ships which had broken free from ropes.
Friends of the Union Chain Bridge and the Institution of Civil Engineers (Ice) Scotland have been marking the crossing's bicentennial.
Robert Hunter, of the friends group, said: "This is truly one of the most historic bridges in the world and a fascinating piece of engineering.
"We had planned a number of celebrations to mark the occasion, but unfortunately they have had to be postponed.
"However, the fact that work is shortly going to begin on the £10m renovation is the best birthday present possible and will ensure generations to come will be able to enjoy the bridge in all its splendour."
Ice Scotland director Hannah Smith described the bridge as an "often-overlooked" part of Scotland's engineering heritage.
She said: "We know it is renowned the world over and it is fantastic that work will shortly commence on its renovation."

Dominic Raab: Government can't make apologies for Spain quarantine decision
Dominic Raab has defended the Government's decision to re-introduce quarantine measures on Spain at short notice.
Ministers announced on Saturday that holidaymakers who had not returned from Spain and its islands by midnight would be forced to self-isolate for 14 days.
The country had been on a list of "travel corridor" nations deemed safe to visit by Downing Street, but a recent surge in coronavirus cases has sparked fears of a second wave of the disease.
On Sunday, the Foreign Secretary defended the sudden reimposition of restrictions as a "real-time response" to a worrying spike in infections reported in the region.
He said the situation was then assessed yesterday afternoon "and we took the decision as swiftly as we could."
"We can't make apologies for doing so," he added.
"We must be able to take swift, decisive action, particularly in relation to localised, or internationally in relation to Spain or a particular country, where we see we must take action."
"Otherwise, we risk re-infection into the UK, potentially a second wave here and then another lockdown."
Transport secretary among Spain holidaymakers forced to quarantine
The decision was made after Spain recorded more than 900 new daily Covid-19 cases for two days running.
The Foreign Secretary acknowledged that many tourists had been left with no time to cancel or alter their plans.
"I understand it is disruptive for those going through this who are in Spain or have been considering going but we must be able to take swift, decisive action to protect the UK," he said.
"We've made such progress in getting the virus down and preventing the virus re-taking hold in the UK."
Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth condemned the Government for its "frankly shambolic" handling of the measure.
He said Downing Street's sudden decision had left holidaymakers "confused and distressed."
The Labour MP told Sophy Ridge: "I understand why they've made the decision but, of course, the way in which this decision has been made in the last 24 hours is frankly shambolic.
"There are holidaymakers in Spain at the moment confused and distressed, there are people about to go on holiday to Spain and the islands like Tenerife who are confused, and they don't know whether their employers will allow them to take two weeks" quarantine.
"The Government is just saying, "we hope that employers co-operate.""
"The way in which this decision has been made in the last 24 hours is frankly shambolic."
What does Spain being on quarantine list mean for holidaymakers?
He urged ministers to offer "clarity" on whether those who are asked to quarantine will receive financial support if their employers refuse to pay them during the quarantine period.
He added that clear information was also needed "for those holidaymakers who are currently in Spain who have properly saved up all year for their family holiday who are confused and distressed."
"The way in which this decision has been communicated is obviously causing anxiety," he stressed.
Mr Raab said no worker following the new guidance should be penalised by employers, including by being put onto sick pay.
He said: "We are changing the rules - the law is changed in relation to holidaymakers and travellers - and of course we expect employers to show those employees who will have to quarantine because of the law the flexibility they need.
"If someone is following the law in relation to quarantine and self-isolating the way they should, they can't have penalties taken against them."

Rock from Mars heads home after 600,000 years on Earth
A small piece of rock will be hurled into space this week on one of the strangest interplanetary voyages ever attempted.
A tiny piece of Martian basalt the size of a 10p coin will be launched on board a US robot probe on Thursday and propelled towards the red planet on a seven-month journey to its home world.
This extraordinary odyssey, the interplanetary equivalent of sending coals to Newcastle, will form a key part of Nasa's forthcoming Mars 2020 expedition.
Space engineers say the rock - which has been donated by the Natural History Museum in London - will be used to calibrate detectors on board the robot rover Perseverance after it lands and begins its search for signs of past life on the planet.
Some of the Martian meteorites we have are very fragile, but we chose this one specifically because it's as tough as old boots
"When you turn on instruments and begin to tune them up before using them for research, you calibrate them on materials that are going to be like the unknown substances you are about to study.
So what better for studying rocks on Mars than a lump that originated there?" said Professor Caroline Smith, the Natural History Museum's curator of meteorites.
Scientists were confident that the rock they were returning to Mars originated on the planet, added Smith, who is also a member of the Mars 2020 science team.
"Tiny bubbles of gas trapped inside that meteorite have exactly the same composition as the atmosphere of Mars, so we know our rock came from there."
It is thought that the Martian meteorite was created when an asteroid or comet plunged into the planet about 600,000 to 700,000 years ago, spraying debris into space.
One of those pieces of rubble swept across the solar system and eventually crashed on to Earth.
That meteorite - now known as SAU 008 - was discovered in Oman in 1999 and has been in the care of the Natural History Museum since then.
Among the instruments fitted to the Perseverance rover is a high-precision laser called Sherloc, which will be used to decipher the chemical composition of rocks and determine if they might contain organic materials that indicate life once existed - or still exists - on Mars.
The inclusion of a piece of SAU 008 is intended to ensure this is done with maximum accuracy.
"The piece of rock we are sending was specifically chosen because it is the right material in terms of chemistry, but also it is a very tough rock," added Smith.
"Some of the Martian meteorites we have are very fragile. This meteorite is as tough as old boots."
Once Perseverance has selected the most promising rocks it can find, it will dump them in caches on the Martian surface.
These will then be retrieved by subsequent robot missions and blasted into space towards Earth for analysis.

Senior UN official skips Pakistan visit, citing flight issue
ISLAMABAD (AP) - The incoming president of the United Nations General Assembly announced Sunday that he was postponing a scheduled visit to Pakistan "due to some technical flight problems."
Turkish diplomat Volkan Bozkir was elected president of the 75th session of the United Nations General Assembly last month and was scheduled to arrive in Islamabad on Sunday.

UN says thousands of anti-Pakistan militants in Afghanistan
ISLAMABAD -- A U.N. report says more than 6,000 Pakistani insurgents are hiding in Afghanistan, most belonging to the outlawed Pakistani Taliban group responsible for attacking Pakistani military and civilian targets.
The report released this week said the group, known as the Tehreek-e-Taliban (TTP), has linked up with the Afghan-based affiliate of the Islamic State group.
Some of TTP's members have even joined the IS affiliate, which has its headquarters in eastern Afghanistan.
The Afghan government did not respond Sunday to requests by The Associated Press for comment.
The report said IS in Afghanistan, known as IS in Khorasan province, has been hit hard by Afghan security forces as well as U.S. and NATO forces, and even on occasion by the Afghan Taliban.
The report was prepared by the U.N. analytical and sanctions monitoring team, which tracks terrorist groups around the world.
The report estimated the membership of IS in Afghanistan at 2,200, and while its leadership has been depleted, IS still counts among its leaders a Syrian national Abu Said Mohammad al-Khorasani.
The report also said the monitoring team had received information that two senior Islamic State commanders, Abu Qutaibah and Abu Hajar al-Iraqi, had recently arrived in Afghanistan from the Middle East.
"Although in territorial retreat, (the Islamic State) remains capable of carrying out high-profile attacks in various parts of the country, including Kabul.
It also aims to attract Taliban fighters who oppose the agreement with the United States," the report said, referring to a U.S. peace deal signed with the Taliban in February.
That deal was struck to allow the U.S. to end its 19-year involvement in Afghanistan, and calls on the Taliban to guarantee its territory will not be used by terrorist groups.
The deal is also expected to guarantee the Taliban's all-out participation in the fight against IS.
The second and perhaps most critical part of the agreement calls for talks between the Taliban and Kabul's political leadership.
Late Saturday, the U.S. State Department issued a statement saying its peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad was again shuttling through the region seeking to jump start those negotiations, which have been repeatedly postponed as both sides squabble over a prisoner release program.
The U.S.-backed deal calls for the Afghan government to release 5,000 Taliban prisoners and the Taliban to free 1,000 government and military personnel as a so-called good will gesture ahead of talks.
Until now the government is refusing to release nearly 600 Taliban prisoners it calls high-profile criminals and has offered to free alternatives.
The Taliban have refused.
"The parties are closer than ever to the start of intra-Afghan negotiations, the key next step to ending Afghanistan's 40-year long war," said the U.S. State Department statement.
"Although significant progress has been made on prisoner exchanges, the issue requires additional effort to fully resolve."
The Taliban's political spokesman earlier this week said it was ready to hold talks with Kabul's political leaders after the Islamic holiday of Eid al-Adha at the end of the month, providing the prisoner release is completed.
A big worry for Pakistan is the presence in Afghanistan of militants, particularly linked to the TTP or Jamaat-ul-Ahrar or Lashkar-e-Islam, as well as those with the Baluchistan Liberation Army, which has taken responsibility for high-profile attacks this month in the southern Sindh province as well as in southwestern Baluchistan Province.
Several Pakistan military personnel have been killed this month in southwestern Baluchistan province in battle with insurgents.
The TTP took responsibility for one of the most horrific attacks in Pakistan in 2014, when a Pakistani army school was attacked and 140 were killed.
Most were students, and some were as young as 5.
"The total number of Pakistani foreign terrorist fighters in Afghanistan, posing a threat to both countries, is estimated at between 6,000 and 6,500, most of them with TTP," the report said.

Many believe driving is an activity solely reserved for those who can see.
A blind person driving a vehicle safely and independently was thought to be an impossible task, until now.
Hello, my name is Dennis Hong, and we're bringing freedom and independence to the blind by building a vehicle for the visually impaired.
So before I talk about this car for the blind, let me briefly tell you about another project that I worked on called the DARPA Urban Challenge.
Now this was about building a robotic car that can drive itself.
You press start, nobody touches anything, and it can reach its destination fully autonomously.
So in 2007, our team won half a million dollars by placing third place in this competition.
So about that time, the National Federation of the Blind, or NFB, challenged the research committee about who can develop a car that lets a blind person drive safely and independently.
We decided to give it a try, because we thought, "Hey, how hard could it be?"
We have already an autonomous vehicle.
We just put a blind person in it and we're done, right?
(Laughter) We couldn't have been more wrong.
What NFB wanted was not a vehicle that can drive a blind person around, but a vehicle where a blind person can make active decisions and drive.
So we had to throw everything out the window and start from scratch.
So to test this crazy idea, we developed a small dune buggy prototype vehicle to test the feasibility.
And in the summer of 2009, we invited dozens of blind youth from all over the country and gave them a chance to take it for a spin.
It was an absolutely amazing experience.
But the problem with this car was it was designed to only be driven in a very controlled environment, in a flat, closed-off parking lot -- even the lanes defined by red traffic cones.
So with this success, we decided to take the next big step, to develop a real car that can be driven on real roads.
So how does it work?
Well, it's a rather complex system, but let me try to explain it, maybe simplify it.
So we have three steps.
We have perception, computation and non-visual interfaces.
Now obviously the driver cannot see, so the system needs to perceive the environment and gather information for the driver.
For that, we use an initial measurement unit.
So it measures acceleration, angular acceleration -- like a human ear, inner ear.
We fuse that information with a GPS unit to get an estimate of the location of the car.
We also use two cameras to detect the lanes of the road.
And we also use three laser range finders.
The lasers scan the environment to detect obstacles -- a car approaching from the front, the back and also any obstacles that run into the roads, any obstacles around the vehicle.
So all this vast amount of information is then fed into the computer, and the computer can do two things.
One is, first of all, process this information to have an understanding of the environment -- these are the lanes of the road, there's the obstacles -- and convey this information to the driver.
The system is also smart enough to figure out the safest way to operate the car.
So we can also generate instructions on how to operate the controls of the vehicle.
But the problem is this: How do we convey this information and instructions to a person who cannot see fast enough and accurate enough so he can drive?
So for this, we developed many different types of non-visual user interface technology.
So starting from a three-dimensional ping sound system, a vibrating vest, a click wheel with voice commands, a leg strip, even a shoe that applies pressure to the foot.
But today we're going to talk about three of these non-visual user interfaces.
Now the first interface is called a DriveGrip.
So these are a pair of gloves, and it has vibrating elements on the knuckle part so you can convey instructions about how to steer -- the direction and the intensity.
Another device is called SpeedStrip.
So this is a chair -- as a matter of fact, it's actually a massage chair.
We gut it out, and we rearrange the vibrating elements in different patterns, and we actuate them to convey information about the speed, and also instructions how to use the gas and the brake pedal.
So over here, you can see how the computer understands the environment, and because you cannot see the vibration, we actually put red LED's on the driver so that you can see what's happening.
This is the sensory data, and that data is transferred to the devices through the computer.
So these two devices, DriveGrip and SpeedStrip, are very effective.
But the problem is these are instructional cue devices.
So this is not really freedom, right?
The computer tells you how to drive -- turn left, turn right, speed up, stop.
We call this the "backseat-driver problem."
So we're moving away from the instructional cue devices, and we're now focusing more on the informational devices.
A good example for this informational non-visual user interface is called AirPix.
So think of it as a monitor for the blind.
So it's a small tablet, has many holes in it, and compressed air comes out, so it can actually draw images.
So even though you are blind, you can put your hand over it, you can see the lanes of the road and obstacles.
Actually, you can also change the frequency of the air coming out and possibly the temperature.
So it's actually a multi-dimensional user interface.
So here you can see the left camera, the right camera from the vehicle and how the computer interprets that and sends that information to the AirPix.
For this, we're showing a simulator, a blind person driving using the AirPix.
This simulator was also very useful for training the blind drivers and also quickly testing different types of ideas for different types of non-visual user interfaces.
So basically that's how it works.
But this vehicle is a prototype vehicle, and it's not going to be on the road until it's proven as safe as, or safer than, today's vehicle.
And I truly believe that this can happen.
But still, will the society, would they accept such a radical idea?
How are we going to handle insurance?
How are we going to issue driver's licenses?
There's many of these different kinds of hurdles besides technology challenges that we need to address before this becomes a reality.
Of course, the main goal of this project is to develop a car for the blind.
But potentially more important than this is the tremendous value of the spin-off technology that can come from this project.
The sensors that are used can see through the dark, the fog and rain.
And together with this new type of interfaces, we can use these technologies and apply them to safer cars for sighted people.
Or for the blind, everyday home appliances -- in the educational setting, in the office setting.
Just imagine, in a classroom a teacher writes on the blackboard and a blind student can see what's written and read using these non-visual interfaces.
This is priceless.
So today, the things I've showed you today, is just the beginning.
Thank you very much.

Do you know how many species of flowering plants there are?
There are a quarter of a million -- at least those are the ones we know about -- a quarter of a million species of flowering plants.
And flowers are a real bugger.
They're really difficult for plants to produce.
They take an enormous amount of energy and a lot of resources.
Why would they go to that bother?
And the answer of course, like so many things in the world, is sex.
I know what's on your mind when you're looking at these pictures.
And the reason that sexual reproduction is so important -- there are lots of other things that plants can do to reproduce.
You can take cuttings; they can sort of have sex with themselves; they can pollinate themselves.
But they really need to spread their genes to mix with other genes so that they can adapt to environmental niches.
Evolution works that way.
Now the way that plants transmit that information is through pollen.
Some of you may have seen some of these pictures before.
As I say, every home should have a scanning electron microscope to be able to see these.
And there is as many different kinds of pollen as there are flowering plants.
And that's actually rather useful for forensics and so on.
Most pollen that causes hay fever for us is from plants that use the wind to disseminate the pollen, and that's a very inefficient process, which is why it gets up our noses so much.
Because you have to chuck out masses and masses of it, hoping that your sex cells, your male sex cells, which are held within the pollen, will somehow reach another flower just by chance.
So all the grasses, which means all of the cereal crops, and most of the trees have wind-borne pollen.
But most species actually use insects to do their bidding, and that's more intelligent in a way, because the pollen, they don't need so much of it.
The insects and other species can take the pollen, transfer it directly to where it's required.
So we're aware, obviously, of the relationship between insects and plants.
There's a symbiotic relationship there, whether it's flies or birds or bees, they're getting something in return, and that something in return is generally nectar.
Sometimes that symbiosis has led to wonderful adaptations -- the hummingbird hawk-moth is beautiful in its adaptation.
The plant gets something, and the hawk-moth spreads the pollen somewhere else.
Plants have evolved to create little landing strips here and there for bees that might have lost their way.
There are markings on many plants that look like other insects.
These are the anthers of a lily, cleverly done so that when the unsuspecting insect lands on it, the anther flips up and whops it on the back with a great load of pollen that it then goes to another plant with.
And there's an orchid that might look to you as if it's got jaws, and in a way, it has; it forces the insect to crawl out, getting covered in pollen that it takes somewhere else.
Orchids: there are 20,000, at least, species of orchids -- amazingly, amazingly diverse.
And they get up to all sorts of tricks.
They have to try and attract pollinators to do their bidding.
This orchid, known as Darwin's orchid, because it's one that he studied and made a wonderful prediction when he saw it -- you can see that there's a very long nectar tube that descends down from the orchid.
And basically what the insect has to do -- we're in the middle of the flower -- it has to stick its little proboscis right into the middle of that and all the way down that nectar tube to get to the nectar.
And Darwin said, looking at this flower, "I guess something has coevolved with this."
And sure enough, there's the insect.
And I mean, normally it kind of rolls it away, but in its erect form, that's what it looks like.
Now you can imagine that if nectar is such a valuable thing and expensive for the plant to produce and it attracts lots of pollinators, then, just as in human sex, people might start to deceive.
They might say, "I've got a bit of nectar. Do you want to come and get it?"
Now this is a plant.
This is a plant here that insects in South Africa just love, and they've evolved with a long proboscis to get the nectar at the bottom.
And this is the mimic.
So this is a plant that is mimicking the first plant.
And here is the long-probosced fly that has not gotten any nectar from the mimic, because the mimic doesn't give it any nectar. It thought it would get some.
So not only has the fly not got the nectar from the mimic plant, it's also -- if you look very closely just at the head end, you can see that it's got a bit of pollen that it would be transmitting to another plant, if only some botanist hadn't come along and stuck it to a blue piece of card.
(Laughter) Now deceit carries on through the plant kingdom.
This flower with its black dots: they might look like black dots to us, but if I tell you, to a male insect of the right species, that looks like two females who are really, really hot to trot.
(Laughter) And when the insect gets there and lands on it, dousing itself in pollen, of course, that it's going to take to another plant, if you look at the every-home-should-have-one scanning electron microscope picture, you can see that there are actually some patterning there, which is three-dimensional.
So it probably even feels good for the insect, as well as looking good.
And these electron microscope pictures -- here's one of an orchid mimicking an insect -- you can see that different parts of the structure have different colors and different textures to our eye, have very, very different textures to what an insect might perceive.
And this one is evolved to mimic a glossy metallic surface you see on some beetles.
And under the scanning electron microscope, you can see the surface there -- really quite different from the other surfaces we looked at.
Sometimes the whole plant mimics an insect, even to us.
I mean, I think that looks like some sort of flying animal or beast.
It's a wonderful, amazing thing.
This one's clever. It's called obsidian.
I think of it as insidium sometimes.
To the right species of bee, this looks like another very aggressive bee, and it goes and bonks it on the head lots and lots of times to try and drive it away, and, of course, covers itself with pollen.
The other thing it does is that this plant mimics another orchid that has a wonderful store of food for insects.
And this one doesn't have anything for them.
So it's deceiving on two levels -- fabulous.
(Laughter) Here we see ylang ylang, the component of many perfumes.
I actually smelt someone with some on earlier.
And the flowers don't really have to be that gaudy.
They're sending out a fantastic array of scent to any insect that'll have it.
This one doesn't smell so good.
This is a flower that really, really smells pretty nasty and is designed, again, evolved, to look like carrion.
So flies love this.
They fly in and they pollinate.
This, which is helicodiceros, is also known as dead horse arum.
I don't know what a dead horse actually smells like, but this one probably smells pretty much like it.
It's really horrible.
And blowflies just can't help themselves.
They fly into this thing, and they fly all the way down it.
They lay their eggs in it, thinking it's a nice bit of carrion, and not realizing that there's no food for the eggs, that the eggs are going to die, but the plant, meanwhile, has benefited, because the bristles release and the flies disappear to pollinate the next flower -- fantastic.
Here's arum, arum maculatum, "lords and ladies," or "cuckoo-pint" in this country.
I photographed this thing last week in Dorset.
This thing heats up by about 15 degrees above ambient temperature -- amazing.
And if you look down into it, there's this sort of dam past the spadix, flies get attracted by the heat -- which is boiling off volatile chemicals, little midges -- and they get trapped underneath in this container.
They drink this fabulous nectar and then they're all a bit sticky.
At night they get covered in pollen, which showers down over them, and then the bristles that we saw above, they sort of wilt and allow all these midges out, covered in pollen -- fabulous thing.
Now if you think that's fabulous, this is one of my great favorites.
This is the philodendron selloum.
For anyone here from Brazil, you'll know about this plant.
This is the most amazing thing.
That sort of phallic bit there is about a foot long.
And it does something that no other plant that I know of does, and that is that when it flowers -- that's the spadix in the middle there -- for a period of about two days, it metabolizes in a way which is rather similar to mammals.
So instead of having starch, which is the food of plants, it takes something rather similar to brown fat and burns it at such a rate that it's burning fat, metabolizing, about the rate of a small cat.
And that's twice the energy output, weight for weight, than a hummingbird -- absolutely astonishing.
This thing does something else which is unusual.
Not only will it raise itself to 115 Fahrenheit, 43 or 44 degrees Centigrade, for two days, but it keeps constant temperature.
There's a thermoregulation mechanism in there that keeps constant temperature.
Now why does it do this, I hear you ask.
Now wouldn't you know it, there's some beetles that just love to make love at that temperature.
And they get inside, and they get it all on.
(Laughter) And the plant showers them with pollen, and off they go and pollinate.
And what a wonderful thing it is.
Now most pollinators that we think about are insects, but actually in the tropics, many birds and butterflies pollinate.
And many of the tropical flowers are red, and that's because butterflies and birds see similarly to us, we think, and can see the color red very well.
But if you look at the spectrum, birds and us, we see red, green and blue and see that spectrum.
Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet, and they see various shades of ultraviolet.
So there's something that goes on off the end there.
And wouldn't it be great if we could somehow see what that is, I hear you ask.
Well yes we can.
So what is an insect seeing?
Last week I took these pictures of rock rose, helianthemum, in Dorset.
These are little yellow flowers like we all see, little yellow flowers all over the place.
And this is what it looks like with visible light.
This is what it looks like if you take out the red.
Most bees don't perceive red.
And then I put some ultraviolet filters on my camera and took a very, very long exposure with the particular frequencies of ultraviolet light and this is what I got.
And that's a real fantastic bull's eye.
Now we don't know exactly what a bee sees, any more than you know what I'm seeing when I call this red.
We can't know what's going on in -- let alone an insect's -- another human being's mind.
But the contrast will look something like that, so standing out a lot from the background.
Here's another little flower -- different range of ultraviolet frequencies, different filters to match the pollinators.
And that's the sort of thing that it would be seeing.
Just in case you think that all yellow flowers have this property -- no flower was damaged in the process of this shot; it was just attached to the tripod, not killed -- then under ultraviolet light, look at that.
And that could be the basis of a sunscreen because sunscreens work by absorbing ultraviolet light.
So maybe the chemical in that would be useful.
Finally, there's one of evening primrose that Bjorn Rorslett from Norway sent me -- fantastic hidden pattern.
And I love the idea of something hidden.
I think there's something poetic here, that these pictures taken with ultraviolet filter, the main use of that filter is for astronomers to take pictures of Venus -- actually the clouds of Venus.
That's the main use of that filter.
Venus, of course, is the god of love and fertility, which is the flower story.
And just as flowers spend a lot of effort trying to get pollinators to do their bidding, they've also somehow managed to persuade us to plant great fields full of them and give them to each other at times of birth and death, and particularly at marriage, which, when you think of it, is the moment that encapsulates the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another.
Thank you very much.

I first went to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, where I saw my first icebergs.
I was in awe.
My heart beat fast, my head was dizzy, trying to comprehend what it was that stood in front of me.
The icebergs around me were almost 200 feet out of the water, and I could only help but wonder that this was one snowflake on top of another snowflake, year after year.
Icebergs are born when they calve off of glaciers or break off of ice shelves.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a distinct way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some refuse to give up and hold on to the bitter end, while others can't take it anymore and crumble in a fit of dramatic passion.
It's easy to think, when you look at an iceberg, that they're isolated, that they're separate and alone, much like we as humans sometimes view ourselves.
But the reality is far from it.
As an iceberg melts, I am breathing in its ancient atmosphere.
As the iceberg melts, it is releasing mineral-rich fresh water that nourishes many forms of life.
I approach photographing these icebergs as if I'm making portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these individual moments they exist in that way and will never exist that way again.
It is not a death when they melt; it is not an end, but a continuation of their path through the cycle of life.
Some of the ice in the icebergs that I photograph is very young -- a couple thousand years old.
And some of the ice is over 100,000 years old.
The last pictures I'd like to show you are of an iceberg that I photographed in Qeqetarsuaq, Greenland.

You can see here, it begins to roll, and the boat has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there.
This is an average-size Greenlandic iceberg.
It's about 120 feet above the water, or 40 meters.
And this video is real time.
(Music) And just like that, the iceberg shows you a different side of its personality.
Thank you.

Tony Blair vows never to stop meddling in British politics despite severe Brexit backlash
Tony Blair has pledged not to stop intervening in UK politics, following severe backlash to his involvement in the Labour Party and anti-Brexit campaigning.
Mr Blair, who has been out of office for more than ten years, told Sophy Ridge on Sky News that he will "never" stop speaking out in British politics.
However, the controversial political figure acknowledged "a lot of people watching this might think I should stop talking about things."
Sophy Ridge told Mr Blair: "I always get the sense you can't wrench yourself away from politics.
"You are always publishing reports on coronavirus or coming up with arguments on Brexit.
"I just wonder if people think, why after ten years of being PM, are you still trying to be involved in politics?
"Isn't it time to take some time out, go around the golf course."
The former prime minister rejected this and vowed to stay around in UK politics as long as he can.
He said: "It's not something I want to do. A lot of people watching might think that's exactly what he should do and stop talking about things, but I care about the country."
"We are at a huge moment of change in the world and the institute I built works around the world.
"I know I've done something that previous prime ministers have not done but in the future I predict many more will try to do."
Earlier in the interview, Mr Blair said that the UK and EU could still land a deal on Brexit before the end of the year.
He said: "They could land a deal. But even the deal we land is going to be bad."
"It's essentially going to be good for Europe because it will allow easier trade in goods but very inhibiting for us on the issue of services."
The former Labour leader also told Sky News the UK is going to be living with COVID-19, not eliminating it, for the foreseeable future.

Tight Security Presence outside US Consulate in Chengdu, China
There was a tight security presence outside the U.S. consulate in the city of Chengdu, China Sunday, as the American staff prepared to leave the premises.
Three moving trucks were seen entering the building compound, while uniformed and plainclothes police lined both sides of the street, which were lined with metal barriers.
The editor of China's Global Times tabloid tweeted that the U.S. consulate in Chengdu was given 72 hours to close, or until 10 a.m. (0200GMT) Monday, July 27.
China charged that some personnel at the Chengdu consulate were "conducting activities not in line with their identities."
Without giving any details, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman, Wang Wenbin said such activity had interfered in China's affairs and harmed its security interests.
China's order to close the consulate in Chengdu was issued Friday in retaliation for a U.S. order to close the Chinese consulate in Houston, Texas.
Washington ordered China to close the Houston office "to protect American intellectual property and Americans' private information."
As Chinese consulate closure in Houston took effect on Friday, a group of men who appeared to be U.S. officials were seen breaking-in to the facility through a back door.
Wang said on Saturday that violated international and bilateral agreements and China would respond, without specifying of how.
The tit-for-tat closures further escalated the tensions between the two countries over issues from trade and industrial espionage to human rights.

Courthouse set on fire during protest in California
OAKLAND, Ca. -- Protesters in California set fire to a courthouse, damaged a police station and assaulted officers after a peaceful demonstration intensified late Saturday, Oakland police said.
Demonstrators broke windows, spray painted graffiti, shot fireworks and pointed lasers at officers, the Oakland department said on Twitter.
Several tweets called for peace and asked organizers to "help us provide safe spaces and safe places for demonstrators."
The protest began earlier Saturday evening with groups such as the "Wall of Moms," similar to a group that formed in Portland, Oregon, as protesters faced off with U.S. agents deployed to that city to guard a federal courthouse.
President Donald Trump had sent the federal agents to clamp down on protests that have occurred nightly since the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25.
The protest in Oakland began peacefully, but turned violent later into the night.
An "unlawful assembly" was declared by police around 11:30 p.m. and officers asked the crowd to disperse.
The fire broke out at the Alameda County Superior Courthouse and was contained a short time later, news outlets reported.
Police said protesters at one point were "breaking windows and chanting racial slurs at residents."

Billboard giants push for discounts from airports, councils
oOh! Media raised capital earlier this year to provided more financial certainty as the pandemic started to spook advertisers.
Sources said that the companies were discussing ways to offset the large declines through a rent reduction for the sites they operate or through the removal or reduction of a minimum revenue guarantee, which is typically introduced when a deal is first signed.
One source indicated that the large billboard companies may have guaranteed as much as 85 per cent of their revenue projections in rent.
Some contracts have clauses that allow them to reduce the minimum guarantee if the amount of people in an area reduces by a certain percentage, but it is unclear whether this condition is in any of the current contracts between the billboard companies and their landlords.
At the same time, the companies are offering large discounts to advertisers to fill available slots on billboards and give them the most value for money possible.
Billboards in Sydney CBD and outer suburbs that typically host six ads are struggling to fill all of the available slots.
But some sites - such as oOh!media's 40 x 10 metre billboard at Sydney Airport - have been upgraded.
oOh! Media declined to comment, but at a Macquarie Australia conference in May, it flagged more than $20 million in fixed rent expense savings.
JC Decaux declined to comment.
Airports and public transport are lucrative advertising contracts for billboard companies.
According to the 2019 Outdoor Media Association Report, revenue from transport - including airports - was $169.4 million while revenue from street furniture and and the outside of buses and trams was $266.5 million.
JC Decaux business has contracts with Sydney Airport, Yarra Trams, Perth Airport and Sydney Buses.
oOh! Media has billboards in areas such as Qantas lounges, outside Sydney airport, Adelaide Airport, Darwin Airport and inside train stations in Sydney and Melbourne.
Tenders for Melbourne Airport and Sydney Trains have been taking place during the pandemic and an official decision has not been made.
Melbourne is the second largest airport contract in Australia and pre-coronavirus was worth tens of millions each year.
At full year results in February, oOh! Media said it generated $65.9 million from its 'fly' category, which is predominantly made up of revenue from Sydney Airport.
Revenue from 'commute', which is made up of the rail contracts and street furniture previously owned by Adshel before it was bought by oOh!, was $234.8 million.
JC Decaux Australia made $37.7 million in revenue from transport in 2018, according to its 2018 financial results filed to the Australian Securities and Investment Commission.
But both figures are likely to be significantly smaller this year.
Standard Media Index figures, which report the spend of four of the five major ad agency groups, said that the outdoor advertising market had plummeted 68 per cent in June.
By comparison, interim June results show that digital spending is down 37 per cent, while metropolitan radio had fallen 48 per cent.
Metropolitan television fell 34 per cent in June, newspaper spending dropped by 49 per cent and spending in magazines plummeted 66 per cent.

India's PM to attend temple groundbreaking at disputed site
NEW DELHI (AP) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will attend a groundbreaking ceremony next month for a Hindu temple on a disputed site in northern India where a 16th century mosque was torn down by Hindu hard-liners in 1992, according to the trust overseeing the temple construction.
The ceremony is set for Aug. 5, a date organizers said was astrologically auspicious for Hindus but that also marks a year since the Indian Parliament revoked the semi-autonomous status of its only Muslim-majority state, Jammu and Kashmir.
The symbolism was impossible to miss for both supporters and opponents of Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP, whose manifesto had for decades included pledges to strip restive Kashmir's autonomy and to build a temple to the Hindu god Ram where the Mughal-era mosque once stood, a site in the city of Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh state that devotees believe to be Ram's birthplace.
Because the coronavirus is still rampaging across India, which has reported the world's third-highest caseload, the ceremony will be broadcast live on state television and the number of participants and spectators will be limited, according to Vishwa Hindu Parishad, or the World Hindu Organization, a Hindu nationalist group allied with the BJP.
The temple will serve as "an enduring and immortal beaming center of social harmony, national unity and integration and awakening of the feeling of Hindutva," or Hindu way of life, the organization's spokesperson Vinod Bansal said in a news release Saturday.
A century-long dispute over the site was resolved last year following the BJP's landslide election victory.
In November, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the temple trust, saying that Muslim petitions would be given five acres at an alternative site.
Hindus hard-liners have long contended that Mughal Muslim invaders built a mosque on top of a preexisting temple in the ancient city of Ayodya.

Kanye West says he can beat Joe Biden "off of write ins" - RT USA News
Fresh from airing his family's dirty laundry on Twitter, rap enigma Kanye West has once again breathed life into his will-he-won't-he presidential bid, claiming that he could beat Joe Biden on write-in votes alone.
Days after announcing a new album and revealing that he's been trying to divorce wife Kim Kardashian for two years, Kanye West again turned his attention to his 2020 presidential campaign on Saturday, in an all-caps announcement declaring "I CAN BEAT BIDEN OFF OF WRITE INS."
If West is still serious about running for the presidency, write-in votes may be his only path to victory, or indeed any kind of showing.
The rapper announced his candidacy on July 4, past the deadline to file as a candidate in at least six states.
Nevertheless, West pressed ahead and filed the proper papers with the Federal Election Commission (FEC), and managed to get his name on ballots in Oklahoma.
Since then he's held one campaign rally, during which he addressed a crowd clad in a bulletproof vest, delivering his speech without a microphone or podium.
West came out against abortion, weeping as he delivered a pro-Christian message he said would make the media "tell you that I'm crazy."
That much was true, and West's rally was described across news sites and gossip mags as a publicity stunt, evidence of mental illness, or both.
However, a recent poll put West at two percent nationwide, neck and neck with the Libertarian Party's Jo Jorgensen and a point ahead of the Green Party's Howie Hawkins.
While it is extremely unlikely that he could surpass Joe Biden's reputed 48 percent, he could in theory siphon enough votes from Biden to see President Donald Trump clinch a second term - something pundits on both sides suspect may be his plan.

Police try new, less-lethal tools as protests continue
As violent clashes continue between law enforcement and protesters in Portland and around the country, debate is swirling around how police can cut back on lethal force.
Some companies are stepping up to offer new high-tech tools like remote handcuffs for police to use instead of the more dangerous options like pepper spray, rubber bullets and flash grenades.
Human rights group Amnesty International analyzed 500 videos from protests from May 26 through June 5 and found 125 incidents of excessive force across 40 states and the District of Columbia.
"We saw a misuse of tear gas, pepper spray, pepper balls, 40 millimeter impact rounds, basically every combination of less-lethal weapon being used in inappropriate ways," said Amnesty International weapons investigator Brian Castner.
Still, some insist that having options is important for avoiding the need for a firearm.
"All of these devices should be at hand for the cops to use other than deadly physical force being used by a firearm because it's the only profession in America where the citizens give you the right to take your life," said Corey Pegues, former New York Police Department Deputy Inspector.
One of the newest tools is called the Bola Wrap, a handheld device that shoots out an 8-foot Kevlar cord that wraps around a suspect.
There are Long Range Acoustic Devices, also known as sound canons, directed energy weapons that use lasers to heat a person's skin, new projectiles made from things like foam and chalk, stink bombs, and of course the Taser.

The market for less-lethal weapons is expected to reach $11.85 billion by 2023.

Israel coronavirus cases top 60,000 as infections jump
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - The number of people to test positive for coronavirus in Israel topped 60,000 on Saturday as the government struggles to contain a resurgence in infection rates.
The latest daily tally showed 1,770 new infections, bringing the total number of cases to 60,496, the country's health ministry reported.

North Korea declares state of emergency as Covid-19 case reported
North Korean leader Kim Jong-un convened an emergency politburo meeting after a person suspected of having Covid-19 returned from South Korea after illegally crossing the border this month, state media said on Sunday.
If confirmed, it would be the first case officially acknowledged by North Korean authorities, who have so far said the country has no confirmed cases of coronavirus.
Kim declared a state of emergency and imposed a lockdown on the border city of Kaesong, calling it a "critical situation in which the vicious virus could be said to have entered the country," state news agency KCNA reported.
According to KCNA, a person who defected to South Korea three years ago returned across the fortified border that divides the two Koreas with symptoms that suggested Covid-19.
"An emergency event happened in Kaesong city where a runaway who went to the south three years ago, a person who is suspected to have been infected with the vicious virus returned on 19 July after illegally crossing the demarcation line," KCNA said.
KCNA did not specifically mention whether the individual had been tested, but said an "uncertain result was made from several medical check-ups of the secretion of that person's upper respiratory organ and blood," prompting officials to quarantine the person and investigate anyone he may have been in contact with.
North Korea has received thousands of coronavirus testing kits from Russia and other countries, and imposed strict border closures.
Thousands of people in the secretive nation were quarantined, but restrictions had recently eased.
In recent weeks, North Korea has also stepped up a campaign criticising defectors to South Korea as "human scum" and calling for South Korea to crack down on groups that send propaganda messages and food aid into the North.
Kim ordered an investigation into the military units along the border where the person was suspected of crossing to "administer a severe punishment and take necessary measures."

Kansas City mayor welcomes federal help in solving murders, but worries about Trump's motives
Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas questioned on Sunday President Trump's motives for sending federal agents into U.S. cities - saying that while he would welcome the help in solving a slew of murders in the Midwestern city, he thinks the move could be more about buoying Trump's reelection chances.
"I was pretty frustrated this week [that] the president mentioned the George Floyd protests, mentioned the Black Lives Matter movement," Lucas, a Democrat, said on "Fox News Sunday" of the recent protests over racial inequality and police brutality.
"That is not the case in Kansas City. We've had year-over-year increases [but] what we need help on is actually clearing some of the unsolved murders."
Lucas added: "Let's try to have a pinpointed and targeted focus on solving murders...I think if you listen to recent statements... we are happy to work with federal agents in a limited scope."
Despite his willingness to have federal agents work with local law enforcement, Lucas said that Trump's rhetoric - specifically in light of the controversy surrounding the tactics employed in Portland, Ore., by the federal agents - has caused many of his constituents to voice concern about the presence of agents on the city streets.
"What we don't need is more fuel on the fire from federal agents to make, I think, an exciting political issue," he said.
Trump on Wednesday announced that he was deploying 100 federal agents to Chicago to help combat rising rates of some crimes - a move that marks an expansion of the White House's intervention into local law enforcement as Trump continues to position himself as the "law and order" president.
The "surge" of agents announced on Wednesday to Chicago and other American cities is part of Operation Legend - named after 4-year-old LeGend Taliferro, who was fatally shot while sleeping in a Kansas City apartment late last month.
While sending federal agents to aid local law enforcement is not unprecedented - Attorney General Bill Barr announced a similar surge effort in December for seven cities that had seen spiking violence - the type of federal agent being sent, and some of their tactics, have raised concerns among state and local lawmakers.
A number of lawmakers from New York to Portland have spoken out against the Trump administration sending the agents to their cities, especially following reports that unidentified federal agents detained protesters in Portland and took them away in unmarked vehicles.
Portland has been hit with near-daily demonstrations against police brutality and systemic racism since the death of George Floyd while in Minneapolis police custody on May 25.
Local authorities also have complained that the surges have only exacerbated tensions, and criminal justice experts say the efforts defy explanation because of the unprecedented moment America is living through - with a pandemic, historic unemployment and a mass reckoning over racism and how people of color are treated by police.

Threats to Australian democracy are closer to home than China
But a series of recently passed or pending measures in the Commonwealth Parliament give rise to concerns about our own, home-grown authoritarianism.
They include a roll out of facial recognition technology, forcing technology companies to decrypt information held on their customers" computer systems, forcing technology companies to provide access to their customers" cloud-based information without notification to the owner of the information and extending ASIO's compulsory questioning powers.
These measures raise serious questions about the border between citizens and government, but the ASIO Bill is particularly worrying.
Unlike any of the other Five Eyes countries - United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and New Zealand - in the wake of September 11, ASIO was given power to compulsorily question people for up to seven days in relation to terrorism offences.
While it might be accepted that the extreme violence associated with terrorism offences justifies extraordinary powers - extreme violence at least offers a bright line border around these extraordinary powers.
That certainly cannot be said about the "sweeping and vague" definitions used in this bill to trigger the compulsory questioning power: dealing with information which prejudices Australia's "political, military or economic relations with another country"; or activities in collaboration with a foreign power which are clandestine or deceptive and are "detrimental to Australia's interests."
It is hard to imagine more "sweeping and vague "national security" legislation" than this.
ASIO would be allowed to compulsorily question anyone about these things - not just suspected offenders.
This includes journalists, business people, university academics and staff, lawyers, citizens, residents and visitors.
ASIO would simply have to show the questioning would "substantially contribute to the collection of intelligence" about foreign interference, which seems to be the main target of the bill.
The person could then be questioned for up to 40 hours (not including breaks).

Rules that are fundamental in our legal systems - indeed protected by the constitution in the United States - are overturned by this bill.
People - including people already facing charges - will be compelled to provide evidence that may then be used to prosecute them.
They could have a lawyer present, but the lawyer would be confined to clarifying questions that were ambiguous or unclear.
The new bill transfers the decision to issue a questioning warrant from a judge to the Attorney-General.

"The Persians" Review: Aeschylus's Ancient Portrait of Defeat
There is not much action, barely even a plot, in "The Persians." People just mill about, talking (admittedly rather intensely) about events (admittedly of the tragic kind) that happened far away.
Yet this National Theater of Greece production unleashes gale-force sound and fury. At its peak, the show hits like a blow to the solar plexus, taking your breath away - the impact is only slightly dulled by watching online.
First produced in 472 B.C., Aeschylus's "The Persians" is considered the oldest surviving Greek play. This Dimitris Lignadis staging was broadcast live on Saturday from the ancient amphitheater of Epidaurus; in the spirit of the theater, no recording exists online. The venue was originally conceived as part of the city's asclepeion (a healing center) because the Greeks considered the balance between body and soul essential to good health. Let's all wistfully ponder that philosophy.
The show deals with the aftermath of Salamis, a naval battle in which the outnumbered Greeks routed the mighty Persian army 2,500 years ago. At a time when our horizons are closing in, it is downright vertigo-inducing to virtually join a live audience in watching (subtitled) live actors all the way in Greece as they perform a millenniums-old play.
Aeschylus himself had fought at Salamis, but his play has a twist: This veteran of the winning side set his story among the defeated, casting a fairly sympathetic eye on his recent enemies" distress.
A chorus of Persian men, wearing long, tan-colored skirts and white button-down shirts, opens the proceedings. They are in their capital city anxiously waiting for news of their king, Xerxes, who is off duking it out with Athens.
Enter Xerxes's widowed mother, Queen Atossa (Lydia Koniordou), in a rather large black gown that appears to wear her, rather than the reverse; she is a human in an exoskeleton of fabric, both vulnerable and formidable. Koniordou, who is among Greece's greatest stage actresses, knows the role inside out - she directed and starred in an earlier National Theater of Greece production of "The Persians" that played New York City Center in 2006 - and she anchors the proceedings without seemingly doing much at all. For the most part, she stands in the middle of the circular stage, effortlessly projecting smoldering fury and agonizing sorrow as the scope of the disaster that befell the home troops is revealed.
The apprehension everybody was feeling is confirmed, in harrowing details, by a messenger (Argyris Pandazaras) returning from the front. In an absolutely incredible scene, he recounts the battle, whipping himself into a frenzy as the chorus members dance around him and Giorgos Poulios's drone-like score swells to what must have been a deafening level.
Later they are joined by Atossa's dead husband (Nikos Karathanos), summoned from the underworld, and Xerxes (Argyris Xafis), who has somehow escaped alive from the wreckage. Pieces of string on his tunic mark blood (Eva Nathena's exquisite costumes always contribute to the storytelling). The characters lament the lost lives and devastation together, in an act of communal mourning.
Quite a bit of the classical theater we see in the United States attempts to make it more accessible in one way or another. Often this is done with relatively naturalistic line readings, in an effort to make the text less foreign, easier to digest. But Lignadis and his troupe fully embrace declamation, which may sound a little forced to modern ears but highlights the text's rhythmic power. While technically they do not sing, for example, the four lead actors essentially deliver arias, achieving an incantatory power that feels otherworldly.
We never forget, though, that the play is rooted in emotions that are all too human.

Leicester happy to hit target of European football says Golden Boot winner Jamie Vardy
Jamie Vardy acknowledged his disappointment at missing out on Champions League football, but said Leicester City achieved their early-season objective of qualifying for Europe.
The Foxes were second in December and third when football restarted after lockdown, but they took just four points from their last five games to finish fifth in the Premier League.
A final-day win over Manchester United would have secured a top-four finish, but Brendan Rodgers" side suffered a 2-0 loss, which Vardy says was the most upsetting aspect.
"It was disappointing, more the way we've ended up losing the game," he said on Sky Sports at full-time.
"But we've said in the dressing room, we targeted behind closed doors to qualify for Europe and we've done that.
"We had the chance to qualify for the Champions League and that was even better, but we'll reflect on it and come back stronger next year.
"It's hard to take, but our main target was Europe and we've managed to do that."
While his team fell short, Vardy himself ended the season as the Premier League's top scorer at 33 years of age, scoring 23 times.
He paid tribute to his team-mates in receiving the award and said there are still plenty of miles left in him at the top level, despite his advancing age.
"I'm delighted, it's all about the team. I wouldn't have been in the position I was for the goals without them and I've put quite a few away.
"I'll have a rest for a bit now and come back for next season ready to go.
Fortunately I don't feel my age, my legs are still fine and touch wood I don't pick up many injuries, so it's about keeping on top of that and come back as strong as I can next year."

Home Secretary Priti Patel demands explanation from Twitter and Instagram over 'abhorrent' Wiley tweets
Priti Patel has demanded an explanation from Twitter and Instagram over the length of time it took to remove "abhorrent" posts made by Wiley.
Police are currently investigating a series of antisemitic comments posted on the Grime artist's social media accounts.
The Home Secretary tweeted on Sunday: "The antisemitic posts from Wiley are abhorrent.
"They should not have been able to remain on Twitter and Instagram for so long and I have asked them for a full explanation.
"Social media companies must act much faster to remove such appalling hatred from their platforms."
Twitter was accused of "ignoring antisemitism" as Wiley's tweets were still visible 12 hours after they were first posted.
A number of tweets have since been removed and the 41-year-old has been issued a seven-day ban by the site.
Twitter previously said Wiley's account had been temporarily locked "for violating our hateful conduct policy," while Facebook said there was "no place for hate speech on Instagram."
The Metropolitan Police said on Saturday: "The Met takes all reports of antisemitism extremely seriously. The relevant material is being assessed."
Meanwhile, Wiley's management company, A-List Management, "cut all ties" with the star.
The artist's now former manager, John Woolf, who is Jewish, wrote on Twitter: "Following Wiley's antisemitic tweets today we at @A_ListMGMT have cut all ties with him. There is no place in society for antisemitism."
He had earlier said he did not support or condone what Wiley posted but that he would speak to him privately and "help educate him."
However, in a video on Instagram, Wiley appeared to say it was him who had cut ties with his management.
Other MPs criticised Twitter for allowing the tweets to remain visible.
Labour MP Jess Phillips said on Saturday: "Just seen all the Wiley stuff. Why on earth have @Twitter left up such blatant antisemitism and hatred? It hits all the dangerous beats, Jews get things you don't get, they are in control, they think their better... This is dangerous stuff. Surely it should come down."
Fellow MP Neil Coyle added: "His management appear able to act quicker than @Twitter emphasising, once again, that legislation (including the Online Harms Bill) should ensure social media platforms are not used to spread hate."
John Mann, the government's independent adviser on antisemitism, said the tweets "demonstrated precisely why the law needs changing to hold them to reasonable account."
Meanwhile, the Campaign Against Antisemitism asked police to investigate Wiley's content and called on his social media accounts to be shut down "to prevent further outpouring of anti-Jewish venom."
