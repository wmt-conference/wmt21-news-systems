The women's basketball team failed to reach the WOC 17 medal, finishing fourth
The Americans also won the third WOC 17, defeating Spain just 77-75 in the final despite 40 points from Spain's Angela Salvadores.
"We wanted to win very much and not be potatoes, but maybe we wanted it too much. We caught the start, but we couldn't keep it because they overpowered us under the basket," lamented captain Karolína Malečková. "It was an incredible experience to play in front of such an audience," she praised the fans in Klatovy and Plzeň.
The Czechs started very well, taking an 8-0 lead thanks to two threes and dominating the field for the entire first quarter. At that moment it seemed that they would repay their opponents' 85-88 group defeat after extra time. But the referees whistled them 15 fouls at half-time and with questionable decisions helped Hungary return to the game with a 12-2 lead.
"I'm convinced that it was enough to make two more three baskets, run away to 20 points and we wouldn't let it go. But instead came our mistakes. I am not interested in the referees, but in what we did wrong and there were mistakes that helped the opponent to catch on," said coach Richard Fousek.
"It was not the first time we had a lapse in concentration. But the girls are fighters, they didn't let anything out and fought to the end. But the opponent was very good," he added.
The Czechs were kept in the game in particular by Petra Holešínská's accurate shooting from distance and the pivot Tereza Šípová. However, the best Czech scorer had a problem with fouls and a large part of the third quarter was missing on the pitch. The Hungarians took advantage and gained a slight lead, which they already held, although the Czechs fought until the last seconds.
"For us the first five games were very difficult, we turned the games in a tight rotation and it cost us a lot of strength. Even against Spain it was obvious that the girls were tired and there was no place to take. Because of the physicality we were not consistent in our defence. We didn't play a quick counter-attack, we lacked a rebound. And the Hungarians are of such quality that if you don't combine everything together you can hardly win," added Fousek.
He believes that his charge has a promising future. "In two years, the girls managed to win the Youth Olympics, to be second in the European 16-year-old championship and now they are fourth in the world. By our standards, they are a quality team with good character and it is necessary to work with them and develop their talent. Now it is up to the federation to assign a coach to them in the higher categories," added Fousek.
Thomas Cook: Czechs kicked out of hotel in Mallorca. Guarantees weren't enough
The Austrian, German and Polish divisions of the group also filed for insolvency in the week. The future of the Czech branch is currently being discussed, and a decision should be made by the end of September.
According to the vice-chairman of the Association of Travel Agencies of the Czech Republic, Jan Papež, there are three possible solutions in play - a liquidation will be announced, or the company will be sold, or a team from the Czech branch will set up a new travel agency. "Which one it will be, but it is impossible to predict, will be up to the German owner," he told ČTK today.
In addition to two early terminated trips, CK is also dealing with cases where clients had to pay for their stay out of their own pockets, although the company is trying to provide guarantees to hoteliers. CK has promised to reimburse its clients, according to Popež, the company has sufficient security to do so.
Problems in hotels arose mainly in Mallorca, where the company also asked the Czech consulate for help. In this context, the Pope described to the Czech News Agency one of the cases where the hotel there threw out all of the office's tourists. "The hotelier was unable to determine who belonged to the German company and who belonged to the Czech company. Therefore, it threw out all of the hotel despite the fact that the domestic Neckermann provided guarantees," he said. According to Šrámek, the situation was eventually resolved.
The Czech branch of the bankrupt British group Thomas Cook increased its sales to CZK 995 million last year, almost 21 percent more year-on-year, according to the company's annual report. It covers the financial period from October 2017 to the end of September 2018. The company's net profit, on the other hand, decreased by about seven million to CZK 15.3 million. However, the company has been left with an unpaid loss of almost CZK 103 million from previous years. The branch includes two basic divisions - besides CK Neckermann, it is also the company Global Travel Lufthansa City Center.
Novák helped Trabzonspor to second place, Škoda also scored
Defender Filip Novák helped Trabzonspor to the vice-championship with a goal in the last round of the Turkish Football League.
His team won 2-1 at Kayserispor, holding off third-placed Besiktas.
Striker Milan Škoda scored his 10th goal for Rizespor after a January transfer from Slavia, who saved himself despite a 1-3 defeat at Fenerbahce.
Novák confirmed the defender's excellent productivity with his seventh goal of this league year.
In the 63rd minute, the Kayserispor goalkeeper just kicked out a sharp shot and the Czech footballer drove the ball into the net from an angle.
The home side managed to equalise five minutes before the end, but Trabzonspor pulled off the victory in the sixth minute of the set-up by successfully finishing off a four-on-one break.
Škoda levelled the game at 1-1 at the start of the second half with Fenerbahce.
Rizespor did not hold on to the tie for long, but he did not have to regret it, as the results of the opponents left them three points above the relegation zone.
The competition will end with Sunday's Championship Basaksehir duel at Kasimpasa.
The well-hidden Cave at the Hermit in the woods near Nový Bor was not really habitable
In the north of Bohemia, in the foothills of the Lusatian Mountains, near Nový Bor in Českolipsko, in the woods through which the Hraběcí cesta led, there are several sandstone rock formations hidden.
Natural and artificially created.
And we will follow the one created by human hands.
The place is called the Cave at the Hermit.
In fact, no hermit has ever lived here and the cave served as a shelter, more precisely a hiding chamber apparently for grain.
The cave is carved from the side into the rock spur and accessible by stairs from above.
However, it is virtually invisible until the last moment.
It is revealed only by the narrow stairs leading to a kind of rock gallery, from where the rock is only just entered.
Although the chamber seems to be quite far from human dwellings, at the time of its creation there may have been a field on the plateau where the forest is today.
"The fact that the object has no window and even a traditional place of furnace clearly proves that no hermit could ever survive the winter here," explains historian Kamil Podroužek from the Faculty of Philosophy of Jan Evangelista Purkyně in Ústí nad Labem.
The one-dimensional object has only a stone bench at the back, which is probably used for putting away containers.
"I see it as a chamber for storing some food or products from the field," adds Kamil Podroužek.
There are traces of tools on the walls of the cave.
Breaking the sandstone with a pick was quite simple and quick for the initiates.
It was enough to use the claws appropriately and to gradually break the sandstone off.
By the length of the pick track and the way of cutting it can be given a general indication of the period of the cave's formation.
According to the historian, it is probably the end of the 18th century.
The cave is freely accessible and according to the mess that appears in it, nowadays someone sometimes sleeps there.
If you approach the cave from above from one of the forest paths and you are attracted by a flowing stream and the nearby Count's path, you will surely find the path down as well.
And on the way out of the forest you may still be captivated by the nearby Raven Rocks.
Someone killed a non-confrontational homeless woman under the bridge. Police are looking for witnesses
According to the Prague police, the murder took place sometime during the early evening and into the night from Tuesday to Wednesday. This is the time when the police call for possible testimony applies.
"One of the drivers who drove on the bridge connecting Libeň and Žižkov or on Pod Krejcárkem Street could have filmed the killer, for example, on a dashboard camera. A witness could have only seen him and could have described him. In short, we will welcome any testimony to this case and accept it on line 158," said the spokesperson of the regional police headquarters, Jan Daněk.
According to the spokesperson, Daněk, the murdered homeless woman was non-confrontational, did not drink alcohol and did not seek out the company of other people. The woman lived at the scene. "Most often she moved around Krejcárek, Palmovka and Holešovice, when she carried large blue shopping bags," added Daněk's description of the victim, which could also help potential witnesses.

Nokia sues Brno-based company over Lokia name. People won't mistake us, Moravians believe
Nokia has filed objections to Lokia's application to the Industrial Property Office. According to CCV, product confusion is unlikely.
Brno-based company developing CCV software is facing legal action from Finnish telecommunications equipment manufacturer Nokia. Finns don't like the fact that the Brno-based company's warehouse management program is called Lokia WMS, daily E15 reported. Nokia has therefore filed objections to Lokia's application to the Industrial Property Office. CCV considers that confusion is unlikely.
Marketing director Petr Ondrášek said that the program is already used by two dozen customers and has been on the market since last September.
"The Nokia brand enjoys recognition and trust around the world. When someone tries to register a brand that we believe may lead to confusion or weakening of our brand, we take steps to protect our valuable asset," said Nokia spokesman Mark Durrant.
Brno developers say they did not think of the brand famous for mobile phones in the past when creating the warehouse program. CCV's designation of Lokia is based on the Latin name for one type of dragonfly, whose rapid movement is supposed to be analogous to the movement of warehouse storekeepers around the warehouse.
"In the Czech market, the possibility of confusion is unlikely. We sell modern cloud software that companies equip their warehouse operations with, and we are not really heading into the field of mobile phone production. And we do not want to be compared to a brand that may be missing the train in its field," responded CCV manager Tomáš Kormaňák in E15.
CCV applied for brand protection in August before launching the program at the Industrial Property Office. "It applied for protection for products and services belonging to Classes 9, 35 and 42, as the software belongs to Class 9, the related warehouse business management services belong to Class 35, and the development of computer software belongs to Class 42 according to the international classification," said Ondrášek.
Nokia's objection is based on the fact that the earlier Nokia trademark is valid in all classes of goods and services and thus covers the widest possible range of goods and services and therefore of course overlaps also in Classes 9, 35 and 42. "CCV does not dispute the objection's assertion as far as the conformity of these classes of products and services is concerned. Realistically, however, these are completely different brands aimed at different target groups," said Ondrášek.
According to E15, a trademark dispute can take months and may complicate the company's activities.
Coal will give way to gas and nuclear. Renewables will not cover increased demand, says ExxonMobil's European boss
Renewables will not be enough for the Czech Republic to meet future energy demand. Because of the unsuitable climate, wind and solar power plants need to be supplemented with other alternatives, such as those using natural gas.
Philippe Ducom, president of the European branch of ExxonMobil, one of the largest global oil producers, says so in an interview with HN. He also mentions that large storage sites that could store unused energy from days when there is enough sun and wind for later are still too expensive.
Ducom visited ExxonMobil's center in Prague, which employs 1,200 people and is tasked with supporting the company's business activities and providing logistics and other services needed for the company to function.
Sydney to London in four hours? In 2030, a possible reality
The Sabre combines a classic aircraft engine with a rocket engine. It is designed to power the aircraft at twice the speed of the Concordes. "Once the Sabre engine is operational, it could allow us to reach Australia in about four hours," said Turnock. And the distance between London and New York, for example, the aircraft could cover in one hour.
The Independent notes that so-called hypersonic flights, which exceed five times the speed of sound, are complicated due to engine overheating. But Sabre (Synergetic Air Breathing Rocket Engine) should deal with this problem by using super-cold helium to keep temperatures from rising.
"The most important thing about the Sabre is that it is a hybrid rocket and aircraft engine that is powered by a jet of exhaust gases generated from the air," says Shaun Driscoll of Reaction Engines. "Rockets have not undergone as much development in the last 70 years, while aircraft rockets have. So when you combine the engines, you can have a very light and efficient propulsion system and basically create a space plane," he said.
The engine is currently being tested, with test flights scheduled to begin around the middle of next year. Commercial flights then around 2030.
I still see myself as a boy who is just settling in, says Jan Cina
"That was a big school for all those who worked on it. I fell in love with afro dancing there. The way I have something Romani in me after my dad, it absolutely fascinated me," said Jan Cina, who considers himself mainly a musical actor.
He has much more recent memories than the First Step series of playing a painter in the new film Národní třída. Cina revealed that director Štěpán Altrichter must have been very tempted. "The work was challenging, but the result is worth it. The film was made a year ago. Hard and honest, but at the same time entertaining. It was filmed on Národní třída, where I drove as a non-driver. A lot was also filmed on South Town in Prague," he said of the Czech-German co-production.
Although he is nominated for the Thalia Award for his role in the production of The Little Prince, he does not consider it the peak of his career. "I don't feel that way. I still see myself as a boy who is just settling in. But the nomination is very pleasant and surprising. I can see the peak far ahead of me," he revealed, adding that he did not even think about a thank-you speech in case of victory. "Not really, but as a child, when I listened to talk shows on the radio, I always imagined speaking to people."
Jan Cina has been living with his colleague Petr Vančura for thirteen years. What is his recipe for a happy relationship? "To like each other and to see problems as a challenge and a good thing to solve," he revealed, reminiscing about the Czech Lions awards, when his friend fell on the stairs.
"Yes, it really happened. He had new slippery shoes and the red carpet was slippery too. So it wasn't long before he was lying on the ground. He managed to make it a priority. He had a workshop called Vančura stairs, where he taught how to fall safely down the stairs at VIP events."
Germans elect Keller to head the Football Union
As expected, Fritz Keller, the previous head of Bundesliga Freiburg, has become the new chairman of the German Football Union. The 62-year-old winemaker, gastronome and hotelier was elected unanimously for three years, with no opponent.
In the post, Keller replaced Reinhard Grindel, who resigned in April due to an affair with unacknowledged income. His other predecessors Theo Zwanziger and Wolfgang Niersbach will again go on trial for possible bribery in awarding the 2006 World Cup.
Keller said one of the main objectives would be to restore the union's confidence and get it out of the crisis. "It won't be a One Man Show, many people will be held responsible. The union is better than its reputation," said Keller, who presented all his tasks under the slogan: Together we can do it.
After being elected to head the union, Keller left the position in Freiburg.
Jockey Minařík is in an artificial sleep after a heavy fall in Germany
"Filip is in the best hands now.
The institute is arranged for such cases, and fortunately we have part of the family in Hanover.
This makes my situation much easier and also the care of my daughter Finja," Jezdci.cz quoted a statement from Minařík's wife Katja.
"Everyone is doing their best, Filip needs time to recover now.
There is no point in giving any prognoses.
Anyone who has ever encountered the issue of head trauma and patients in an artificial sleep knows that the situation can change.
Filip is a great fighter.
We all have to be patient now and give him time," said the wife of the 45-year-old jockey.
Star Frankie Dettori, who won the seventh race of the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot on Saturday, has also called for financial support from the injured Minařík, equalling the legend Lester Piggott.
Gofundme has raised nearly €70,000 to date.
The goal is €100,000 (2.6 million crowns).
The video referee took four goals from the Sassuolo players, losing 0-2
The Sassuolo players took the ball four times in their opponent's goal in Saturday's game in Naples, but in the end they had to accept a 0-2 defeat.
Neither of their goals was conceded by the referee after consulting the video for offside.
According to the Italian media, this is a record of unfavorability of the technology, so many hits have never been thwarted by the VAR for one team.
"The VAR was stricter on Sassuolo than the road radar and punished it like no team has ever been.
The new technology is breaking records," wrote Gazzetta dello Sport in the commentary.
"The festival of unaconceded goals by Sassuolo.
Never before has the VAR been so strict on one team," added Corriere dello Sport.
Napoli took the lead in the 8th minute on Saturday, but after half an hour of play it seemed that Sassuolo had equalized.
However, Filip Djuričič's goal was not conceded after the video referee's intervention for offside.
For the same reason, Djuričič's other hits and those of Francesco Caputo and Domenico Berardi did not pay off.
The home side added one more goal.
Electric cars report a new record.
In the Czech Republic, they charged the most in history
"The growth was driven both by a 30 percent increase in the number of stations in our network and the trend of more frequent charging at public stations, as well as by the accelerated development of new e-car registrations," said Tomáš Chmelík, head of ČEZ's clean technology department.
Other big players, such as PRE and E.ON, the electric car manufacturer Tesla, as well as the supermarkets Billa and Lidl, are also reporting their share of the market.
The operators of classic petrol stations are represented by the company MOL.
However, it does not have figures yet.
"We only started building our network for electromobility last year," explained company spokesperson Jana Jusková.
However, the editorial of Deník exclusively obtained data from all 216 electric stands operated by the company ČEZ.
They show that drivers took an average of 13.5 kWh from the stations.
This corresponds to the range of roughly 100 kilometers of a smaller electric car.
Excluding small pumps of up to 1 kWh, the average charging time is two and a half hours.
The vast majority of refuelling took place in a free tariff.
If motorists had already paid for their collection, their typical spend was around 330 crowns.
Electromobility runs mainly in the capital city.
On the territory of Prague, there are all five of ČEZ's busiest chargers, which will eclipse even entire regional towns with their popularity.
Olomouc leads among the regions.
On the other hand, there is the least interest in remote stations in the borderlands, for example in Bohumín or Prachatice, which often remain unused throughout the day.
More than four thousand electric cars are currently registered in the Czech Republic.
In the first half of this year alone, 1274 new e-cars were added.
In an extensive survey by Deník "Czechs on the Move" eight percent of readers said that they were considering buying an electric car for their family.
However, only a third of respondents know where to look for the nearest charging station in their area.
Epilepsy complicated his love of sports, thanks to surgery he has a new hope
The first time Honza's parents noticed that something was wrong with him was in a year and a half. He would stare into space for a few minutes, freeze and not react to anyone. The pediatrician therefore sent him to the pediatric neurology clinic, where doctors, after a series of examinations, diagnosed him with epilepsy and immediately put him on medication, which however did not work immediately.
It took almost a year for doctors to find the ideal combination of medications, thanks to which he completely stopped having seizures. At the age of five, doctors stopped his medication, and since the seizures did not return, his parents thought that Honza was healthy and began to guide him more into sports. He rode his bike, skied, played tennis and floorball, spent his free time playing games with his sister and friends. At the age of eleven, however, he had another seizure and everything started anew.
Doctors tried different combinations of medications again, but this time nothing worked, the seizures in the form of absences were constantly repeated. Since during the seizure Honza always lost his senses, his parents were terrified that he would get it during sports and get injured. Gradually Honza stopped riding his bike and swapped downhill skis for cross-country skis and snowboard. Although from time to time the sport caused him to have a seizure, he never gave it up completely. He even fulfilled his dream and ran the Spartan Race, but together with a friend who kept an eye on him all the time to help in case of emergency.
When Honza was 15 years old, his parents decided to try to change doctors and turned to specialists at the Motol University Hospital Hospital. After a series of examinations, doctors there concluded that Honza was a candidate for surgery to remove a lesion from his brain - the source of his epileptic seizures. "I had to have 2 surgeries in a row, first the doctors inserted probes into my brain to scan his activity, then they could remove the lesion. It was a hell for several weeks. I just had to lie there and hardly move, with wires sticking out of my head that were connected to a computer," recalls Honza.
The operation was successful and the doctors removed a relatively large bearing. "The first days after the operation were very psychologically challenging, Honza was apathetic, confused, sad and hardly spoke. It was a scary change compared to how he is normally alive and communicative, but fortunately after a few days everything returned to normal," describes his mother and adds: "A month and a half after the operation he had 1 seizure, but according to the doctors it happens. Since then he has been seizure-free for 3 months."
This school year Honza will graduate, besides sports he enjoys languages and started working with E Company, with which he goes to meetings about epilepsy in schools. Honza is not fully engaged in sports activities yet, he starts to return to sports slowly. "I am learning how to play sports properly, how to breathe well so that I don't expose my body to sudden stress, which is quite a challenge with my competitive nature," explains Honza.
This year he will therefore not actively participate in the traditional EPPI boating triathlon, where epilepsy sufferers and healthy athletes meet and which takes place this weekend on 28 September 2019 at Veselská pískovně. But next year he will.

Not only for better water retention.
Environmental activists protest in Prague
According to organizers, the government's actions to date on issues of protecting and restoring the Czech landscape and tackling the climate crisis are insufficient, and speakers called on the state to take a more aggressive approach.
Representatives of large organizations such as the Rainbow Movement, Greenpeace or the Green Party participated in the event, as well as smaller local associations.
"For example, we have people here who have been speaking out against expansion at the Turów mine for a long time, there are people here who are speaking out against gravel-sand mining at the Uherský Ostroh, there are people here who are speaking out against the construction of meaningless dams," said Marika Volfová, speaking for the organizers.
She said that the main demands of the protesters are the creation of a plan to retain water in the landscape, a radical change in agricultural policy and subsidy system to promote sustainable agriculture, and the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources as soon as possible.
"The government is supposed to defend the interests of the people, not a ruthless and devastating business," she said.
A stall with a petition calling on representatives of the Czech state to work for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the restoration of the Czech soil and landscape was set up on Malostranské náměstí.
The people present were equipped with banners with slogans such as "End of Depression from Rapeseed" or "Less Coal, More Newts."
Jan Škoda from the association Za vody pro lidi, which is protesting against the gravel-sand mining plan in Hodonínsko, came to Prague from southern Moravia.
"It threatens the source of drinking water for 140,000 people," he said.
He added that the wells represent the fifth most abundant source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
According to him, the planned gravel-sand mining is located only about 500 meters from the wells and according to the assessments it is certain that the quality of the water will be endangered.
Vojtěch Veselý came from the village of Valeč in Karlovy Vary for the so-called agro-ecological farmers.
He drew attention to the merits of small farms that do not chase yields and profits and supply the inhabitants directly on the spot.
"Small agro-ecological farms are able to feed the whole population completely normally, on top of that they do not cause such destruction on the shape of the countryside and the environment," he said.
Kovosvit sells office building and other halls. Expects rainy days
Due to the restructuring, Kovosvit ended last year with a consolidated loss of CZK 100 million, consolidated turnover was CZK 1.3 billion. Among the main problems last year, Kuchař ranks the lack of staff and shifts of subcontractors. This year, demand for machine tools dropped by 10 to 20 percent year-on-year. "This is related to the expected decline in turnover of the order of ten percent," said the CEO. In 2017, Kovosvit had sales of CZK 1.3 billion and profit after tax of CZK 40.1 million. The loss for 2016 was CZK 719 million.
Kovosvit now offers for sale several properties, halls and land that it either does not use or only minimally. This also applies to the office building, where it uses two out of five floors, and not yet fully. "Part of the long-term restructuring plan is to slim down Kovosvit, to make its business more efficient. The sale of property is not part of any current solution, whether it is cash-flow, for example, but part of a long-term plan where we want to devote all resources to investment development," said the CEO.
About half of the production is exported by Kovosvit. Its standard markets are the EU and Russia, and last year Asia to a lesser extent. This year, Kuchař ranks India among the most interesting, where Kovosvit won a contract for machines enabling five-axis machining worth CZK 100 million. This year, the company also exported two five-axis machines worth CZK 30 million to China. "Another contract in the same volume is under negotiation, which we would like to fulfill before the end of the year," said Kuchař. In the Russian market and elsewhere, Kovosvit faces restrictions due to sanctions.
Last year, the company sold two five-axis machining centres to France, a company that is a subcontractor of Airbus. This May, the company delivered another machine, one more should be delivered at the end of the year or early 2020.
This year's main company investment was the conversion of heating from steam to hot water for CZK 20 million. Kovosvit employs 500 people, the average worker's wage is CZK 28,500. The company is looking for casting grinders for foundries, machinists, turning machines and electricians.
The company is owned by industrialist and arms maker Jaroslav Strnad since September 2016. The company has a tradition in the production of machine tools. It was founded in 1939 by Tomáš Baťa. The company had up to three thousand employees at the time.
Three people die as plane crashes on house in Germany
Three people died and two others were injured when an ultralight plane crashed on an apartment building in western Germany today.
Local emergency services reported that two crew members and one occupant of the house are believed to be among the dead.
The plane crashed on the roof of a building in the town of Wesel in North Rhine-Westphalia.
A fire subsequently engulfed the penthouse, which was one of five apartment units in the house.
Firefighters have already managed to get the flames under control.
Robert Meyboom, the deputy chief of the local fire department, said that both crew members of the plane were believed to have died.
The third victim, according to police, is a woman who lived in the house.
The Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ), citing the mayor of Wesel, reported that she was a single mother whose two-year-old daughter was rescued from the apartment with minor injuries.
An emergency parachute was found near the accident, which apparently served as a brake during landing.
Police assume that it came from the crashed plane.
There was room for two people in the plane.
The plane took off from the airport in the nearby town of Marl.
The Rheinische Post, citing eyewitnesses, reported that the plane collided with a hot-air balloon before it crashed.
However, this information has not yet been confirmed.
WAZ, citing other witnesses, wrote that the plane disintegrated in mid-air before hitting the ground.
D5 accident: Truck collision closes the motorway
The incident was reported around 08:00 on the 22nd kilometer in the direction of Prague. "The motorway is closed, at least for freight traffic. Passenger cars can go through a gas station," police spokesperson Michaela Richterová said in the morning. Traffic was restored around 14:30. Preliminary damage is at least two million crowns, according to Richterová, the cause of the accident is being investigated by police officers.
Central Bohemian fire department spokesperson Petr Svoboda said that one truck was transporting passenger vehicles and the other a plastic granulate. "Due to the large impact, the transported vehicles were moved, which the firefighters first had to secure against a possible fall," he added.
One of the cars had a damaged fuel tank, which leaked about 200 liters of diesel. Another 200 liters were siphoned off by firefighters. Workers from the environmental department of the Beroun town hall were called to the accident due to a fuel leak. The rescue of the crashed vehicles and the clearing of the highway was ensured by a private company, which also extracted contaminated soil.
Microplastics have reached the human gut, study confirms for the first time
Scientists have confirmed their suspicions over several years. A team led by University of Vienna professor Philipp Schwabl has published a study which, for the first time, proves the presence of microplastics in human stool. While the study is small, with eight participants from Europe, Japan and Russia, tiny particles of plastics measuring between 50 and 500 micrometres were found in samples of all the subjects studied. None of the eight subjects were vegetarians, six of them did not avoid sea fish, all drank water from plastic bottles and food packed in plastic.
And it would actually be a bit of a miracle if nothing was found. We already know that microplastics - which are either produced directly, for example, for the needs of the cosmetic industry, or are produced by breaking up larger pieces - are present in marine animals, insects, tap water and soft drinks; in short, everywhere on the planet. So their entry into the human digestive system has only been officially confirmed. There were roughly 20 microplastic particles per ten grams of stool, and scientists estimate that more than half of the world's population will have them in them.
Of course, both the layman and the scientific mind suspect that this is not a good thing. But humanity still does not know how bad it is - and what effect microplastics have on "host" organisms. Small particles can reach the bloodstream or the lymphatic system and end up in the liver, for example. "This is the first study of its kind, and it has confirmed what we have long thought. Now that we have the first evidence of microplastics in the human body, we must continue to investigate exactly what this means for human health," Schwabl says.
So far, it is known that microplastics in the gut can negatively affect the immune responses of the digestive system, making it easier for toxic chemicals and other pathogens to be absorbed into the body. And so far, there is no known solution other than to reduce the use of plastics, especially polypropylene. But that will be difficult - the first task facing governments and authorities will at least be to stop its steep rise. As for plastic bottles alone, experts estimate that in three years, mankind will consume one-fifth more than it does today. The current rate is a staggering one million bottles bought per minute. Every year, roughly eight million tons of plastic end up in the seas and oceans. Waste threatens marine ecosystems and poisons the digestive systems of marine animals.
Some countries have already taken restrictions and other measures; Kenya, for example - under threat of draconian penalties - has banned plastic bags. The European Commission is considering small bans (well-known straws), and the country's environment ministry is moving in the same direction. Critics, however, argue that such measures, while nice, are totally inadequate.
The repair of the Krkonoše museum will be a year late
The Krkonoše National Park Administration (KRNAP) has moved the deadline for submitting bids to the second tender for the repair of the Krkonoše museum in Vrchlabí by three weeks. The original deadline for opening the envelopes was 20 September, said national park spokesman Radek Drahný. The reason for the postponement of the deadline for submitting bids is the reduction of the budget from CZK 110 million to CZK 83 million.
"We are currently working with the prices that are on the market. There has been a change in the budget, it is the price that we expect to be offered. If someone submits an offer that is acceptable, then the work will start as soon as possible," said Drahný.
Compared to the original plans, the start of the repair of the museum is about a year late. KRNAP wanted to have a selected contractor for the construction part by the end of last year and start construction work this spring. According to the management of the national park administration, European subsidies of CZK 123 million for the project are not at risk.
The KRNAP administration has not managed to select a construction company for the museum repairs. It launched a second competition this summer because in the previous tender all offers from the companies significantly exceeded the then expected price of 65 million crowns. Bids exceeded 100 million crowns.
The museum, which is located in the former Augustinian monastery and belongs to the KRNAP administration, has been closed since autumn 2017. The selected company should provide the construction part of the project. The total cost, including the construction of a new exposition, is estimated at 210 million crowns. The KRNAP visitor centre should be created in the now cleared building by the end of 2021 after the transformation of the expositions.
The repaired museum with a new interactive exposition, which should be a story of nature and people settled in the mountains and follow up on the successful exposition Stone and Life, should serve as a representative entrance gate to the Giant Mountains for visitors. The visitor centre should provide the most comprehensible form of information about the past and present of the Giant Mountains and motivate people to discover the mountains and protect them. It should also take on the role of a traditional museum. The centre will also offer opportunities for concerts, festivals, theatre performances or open-air lectures. The plans include building a new entrance to the building, creation of a research room or a café.
Česká spořitelna erroneously charged some card payments twice on Saturday.
The error has already been corrected
Česká spořitelna erroneously charged its clients some card payments twice on Saturday afternoon.
According to bank spokesman Lukáš Kropík, the problem could have involved thousands of transactions.
The error has already been corrected by the bank and the money returned to the clients.
The problems with double billing of card payments were noted by the bank on Saturday afternoon.
"As recently as yesterday (Saturday) night, we updated the system and immediately returned all these double payments to the clients.
At the moment, everything is working smoothly," Kropík told the bank on Sunday afternoon.
The exact number of clients for whom the bank deducted money from card payments twice is unknown to the bank spokesman, who estimates it was a lower number of thousands of transactions.
The causes of the problems are being investigated by the bank.
"It could have been a combination of several factors," said Kropík.
Česká spořitelna is the largest bank in the Czech Republic by the number of clients.
At the end of March, it had 4.6 million.
Sparkasse KölnBonn is owned by the Austrian financial group Erste Group Bank, which is a key player in the Central and Eastern European banking market.
Vojtěch will present a system of three emergency levels against the coronavirus on Monday
"The levels will be based on the strength of community dissemination at the level of regions.
We are working on this together with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics," Vojtěch told ČT.
It will be a so-called traffic light, individual regions will be marked with green, orange or red according to the risk of coronavirus occurrence.
The minister added that he will still talk to epidemiologists about the inclusion of individual regions.
He admitted that only the Moravian-Silesian region would be orange at present and Prague would be approaching it.
Individual measures for regional sanitation stations, hospitals, social facilities and employers will also feature on the map.
"We want to address this at the level of regions, because the situation in them is not uniform," said Vojtěch.
"Terrifying study result." Islam does not belong in the West, thinks overwhelming majority of Austrians
1,200 respondents were questioned, the survey shows considerable distrust of Islam in Austrian society.
Almost 60 percent of the population in Austria fears that some Muslims are terrorists, and 48 percent would demand the introduction of a ban on the construction of mosques. 80 percent are in favour of more monitoring of the centers of Islam.
A majority of Austrians also want Muslims to be restricted in their religious practices, claiming that the presence of Muslims sometimes makes them feel like foreigners in their own country.
"The study result is frightening," says study author Wolfgang Aschauer, adding: "Such a tendency towards ethnocentrism could eventually lead to the adoption of discriminatory attitudes. There is a risk that religious freedoms granted to Muslims will become narrower."
For believers, the critical stance is less pronounced. Aschauer argues that in Austria it is not a conflict between religions, but between cultures. Dialogue and education could help to blunt polarization, according to the sociologist.
According to the study, voters of the extreme right, those without a university degree or older than 75 years old hold the most hostile attitudes toward Muslims. Instead, Green voters, those under 30 and college students are the most welcoming.
According to estimates by the Austrian Interior Ministry, there are approximately 700,000 Muslims living in Austria, which has a population of roughly 8.7 million. The vast majority have Turkish roots. There are more than 400 Muslim prayers and mosques in the country, and Islam has been officially recognized as a religion since 1912.
Which Cities Will Disappear Under the Sea?
The vote by the upper house of Canada's parliament confirmed a familiar rumor for days: Canada is revoking the honorary citizenship of the former human rights legend, Nobel Peace Prize winner Do Aung San Suu Kyi. The current leader of Myanmar (Burma), who spent years under house arrest for trying to bring freedom to her country, lost her honorary title for her part in the genocide against the minority Rohingya nation.
The decision to revoke Suu Kyi's honorary citizenship was approved by the lower legislature a week ago, and has now been unanimously supported by senators. "This is the right message for her, for Myanmar, and for the world," said independent Senator Ratna Omidvar, commenting on the decision of her colleagues. "We must make it clear that accomplices to genocide are not welcome here in Canada - all the more so as honorary citizens."
The Canadian parliament's verdict technically changes nothing for Suu Kyi, it is just an honorary title, but on a symbolic level it is a powerful message for her. The silence of a long-time human rights activist on the atrocities that the army of majority-Buddhist Myanmar has been perpetrating against the Muslim Rohingya minority for endless months is intolerable.
The fact that an officially organized genocide is taking place in Myanmar, and that Suu Kyi - the de facto prime minister of the country's government - has utterly failed in her duty to protect her citizens, was recently reported in a UN report. Specifically, it mentions the names of several army commanders who, according to the investigation team, should stand trial for crimes against humanity committed in actions that, the report says, "shock with both the horror of their actions and the sheer scale of their actions." According to the UN, Suu Kyi and her administration have been complicit primarily in covering up the soldiers' actions and releasing a fog of lies around them by protecting them - such as an "anti-terrorist operation."
After Suu Kyi's removal, five figures remain on Canada's list of honorary citizens: the Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, Nelson Mandela, Tändzin Gjamccho, the 14th Dalai Lama, Karim Aga Khan IV, the 49th Imam of Shiite Muslims, and Malala Yousafzai.
Developments around the former icon of the fight for freedom and democracy have also been reflected by the Canadian Museum of Human Rights, where Suu Kyi's profile has been updated with information about atrocities against the Rohingya and a parliamentary decision to take away her honorary title. "We have also dimmed the illumination of her picture on a human rights timeline board and are thinking of replacing her face with a portrait of a member of the Rohingya minority," Canadian media quotes museum spokesman Rorie McLeod as saying.
The only thing that will remain in Suu Kyi's current turmoil - at least for now - is the Nobel Peace Prize, awarded to her at the suggestion of Václav Havel in 1991 for her enormous contribution to the fight for democracy. "While Suu Kyi's current actions are regrettable, her award will not be annulled," Nobel Foundation head Lars Heikensten told CBS Canada.

Technology Firms Want to Rule Our Cities
Francis Fukuyama's history got a little screwed up. In 1992, at the height of the wave of liberalism that followed the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Iron Curtain, this political scientist wrote in his most famous book, The End of History and the Last Man, "What we may be witnessing... is the final point in the ideological evolution of mankind and the universal acceptance of Western liberal democracy as the final form of governance."
Twenty-six years later, we are rather witnessing, from the US to Russia, from Turkey to Poland, and from Hungary to Italy, rather illiberal models prevailing, and various forms of nationalism and radicalism thriving. Fukuyama's current ninth book, Identity: The Demand for Dignity and the Politics of Resentment, attempts to match the rise of these forces. As his interview with George Eaton for the New Statesman shows, many of his former positions are being reconsidered: he argues that the ideas of socialism should be put back into the public domain, and Marx was right about much of this. While he also insists that his intellectual development is still in line with the position of the 1990s, and critics of The End of History and the Last Man have misunderstood.
"What I said at the time was that one of the problems with modern democracy is that while it provides peace and prosperity, people want more than that... Liberal democracy doesn't even try to define what a good life is. It leaves it up to individuals who feel alienated, don't see the point, and therefore group together in identity groups that give them a sense of belonging."
At the time, The End of History and the Last Man was written as a powerful argument against Marxists who saw communism as the final stage of history. When Fukuyama is asked about how he now perceives the rise of socialists in Britain and the US, he replies, "It all depends on what you mean by socialism. If we're talking about ownership of the means of production, then, except when clear public services are demanded, I don't think it will work. But if you are referring to redistribution programs that attempt to address the huge imbalance in income and wealth that we are seeing, then yes. I think not only could he come back, he should come back. The long period that President Reagan and Prime Minister Thatcher started, in which certain types of ideas about the benefits of an unregulated market came to the floor, has had a disastrous effect in many ways."
Finally, Fukuyama tries to calm the current situation as well, warning all liberals that even the emergence of new not-quite-democratic regimes will not mean the end of history.
Civilization in Lent Time
I recently recalled a beautiful "line" from one of the great stories of Shimka and Grossmann, set partly in a cemetery, which reads: "I warned her that she cries well, but on someone else's grave!" It occurred to me that many of the world's politicians engaged in the senseless fight against climate change are now behaving very similarly.
They are behaving as if people were in control on planet Earth. In fact, we are just a speck on its surface, which she can blow out like a candle flame in a gust of wind. Probably not many of them are watching the famous British and American nature documentaries about the destructive powers of our blue ball. After all, all it would take is for one of the larger active volcanoes to make a big "fart" and our advanced civilization will shit itself out.
And that this will happen in the immediate future is highly likely. Many large volcanoes, in the opinion of leading volcanologists, are "charged and armed" (for example, Katla in Iceland).
In a way, it would be ideal if the eruption, if it must happen someday, should happen as soon as possible. Even before trillions of dollars are wasted on measures to reduce carbon dioxide production, because any properly angry volcano, along with dust and poisonous volcanic gases, can release at least a hundred times more into the atmosphere than has been saved at the expense of the people of Europe.
So violently limiting CO2 production makes no sense. Moreover, it has been scientifically proven that, with its significantly higher proportion in the air, plants form more biological matter and are also more resistant to drought. Possible warming is considerably more favourable for mankind than, for example, a rapid return of the Ice Age.
Considering the hitherto insufficiently studied influence of solar cycles on the Earth's climate, we must reach only one sensible conclusion: let us strive to keep the Earth as clean as possible, and let us adapt at least cost to other changes with which we cannot measure ourselves!
Vodník a Karolínka
When the water-sprite Jonáš and the miller's daughter Karolínka fall in love, it is not easy for them.
Jonáš is prevented from loving by his father, the rude water-sprite Hastrbuch, while Karolínka has no idea that her dear Jonáš is not a man.
Luckily there is young Libor, who will do his best to protect the whole village, and especially Karolínka, from the water-sprite villain.
So what if he plots and lies?
Especially if he can make Karolínka reject Jonáš and give preference to him, the brave Libor.
Before long, it is clear to everyone in the village who is to blame for the drowning of the pond Konvička, the spoiled flour, the fire of the mill and other mischief.
Angry villagers organize a hunt for the water-sprite, and an implacable water-sprite curse falls on Jonáš's head.
And now Konvička's soul gives advice to Karolínka!
How to soften old Hastrbuch, convince the neighbors of Jonáš's innocence, find Jonáš and free him from the curse?
The fairy-tale was filmed in September 2010 in the studios of ČT and in exteriors at the Brzina pond, in Obděnice in Sedlčansko and in the beautiful setting of the historic mill in Hoslovice.
Kristýna Plíšková failed to reach the final, her second title eludes her so far
Plíšková's environment in Tashkent was good, she won her first WTA tournament here in 2016, and this year she performed very well.
After her wins against Paolini, Kawa and Kužmová, she fought her way into the top four.
But the match against Alison Van Uytvancková did not go well for Kristýna. The Belgian held her serve and broke Plíšková's serve twice in the first set. In the second set, Van Uytvancková took an early 3-0 lead, and Kristýna failed to break back, even though she managed to convert one break point in the end. In the last one, she averted one match point, but the second one came to an end.

Purpose defamation? Ústí zoo is looking for a new veterinarian, no one is interested
Most recently at the end of this month. The city's management attributed this to the rumors that swarmed around the zoo's former director and veterinarian, Václav Poživil, that he purposely killed exotic animals that he cared for. For example, it was a female Zamba rhinoceros, Kala the elephant or Snuňák the orangutan.
The city council therefore announced a new contract. "For veterinary care for the zoo with an estimated value of performance of 3.5 million crowns excluding VAT and for the city's Center for Animals in Need with an estimated value of performance of 2.8 million crowns excluding VAT," said Romana Macová, the city's spokesperson.
Deputy Mayor Věra Nechybová (UFO) explained that the city was announcing a competition for veterinary services for the third time. "Dr. Poživil had to explain the unfounded suspicions. I consider it a blatant defamation of such a high-quality expert," she said.
Experts specializing in exotic animals are very few in number. "It's certainly not pleasant. The zoo provides veterinary care in the form of orders," she said. Orders and contracts cost the same money. "The garden must comply with the Public Procurement Act in terms of funding," explained zoo spokesperson Nikola Roštejnská.
Václav Poživil himself is one of the recognized experts. For example, he participated in a unique operation in which the cheetah Jane was the world's first cheetah to receive a total prosthesis. He served as the zoo's director from 2009 to 2012. He did not comment on the anonymous rumors about himself. Yesterday he did not receive phone calls or respond to text messages.
As for the contract for the zoo, some veterinarians believe that in zero interest there is not necessarily a fear of similar purposeful allegations, as in his case, but simply little information. For example, veterinarian Jiří Král has not heard of it. "This is the first I've heard from you. No one has approached us. I think such a thing will spread quickly," he added.
Most Autodrom launches new e-shop
Customers of the Most Autodrom can use the new e-shop on its website.
They will also buy coupons for free and test rides by car or motorcycle on a large racing circuit, which was previously only possible in person with an autodrom worker in the starting tower.
"We have proceeded to improve the e-shop so that it is user-friendly and at the same time we have expanded the portfolio of products and services that can be purchased through it.
At the same time, we have prepared a bonus for our customers on this occasion in the form of a discount of CZK 1,000 for all safe driving courses from our offer.
They will find the discount coupon at www.autodrom-most.cz," explained the sales and marketing director of AUTODROM MOST, Jana Svobodová.
The e-shop website is now clear, the customer can easily navigate it.
"A visitor of the e-shop chooses on the bar the focus they are targeting.
For example, sports, safe or sports driving courses, trainings, experience programs, gift items, gift vouchers, activities for children and others," said the director.
Among the novelties in the offered products and services of the e-shop are, for example, a Racing Legends T-shirt with a surprise, a car track, a safe driving course with reduced visibility, advertising and gift items from the domestic professional racing team Buggyra Racing, or Engelmuller gloves from the limited edition watch manufactory BOHEMATIC, created on the occasion of the historic victory in the prestigious 24 Hours of Le Mans race in 1949.
"The offer is very varied, the customer can choose from more than 200 items," said Jana Svobodová.
When paying for the selected product or service, the customer can choose one of four options.
Payment by deposit (bank transfer), cash on delivery, cash on personal collection or online via a payment gateway.
Plane crash near Žinkov in Plzeň: Two people did not survive the accident
There were two people on the plane, a man (†63) and a woman (†38). "The plane at 8:30 p.m. asked for permission to land at the Chaloupky airport near Klatovy," police spokesperson Dana Ladmanová said. That was also the last record, at which time it was supposed to be located near Vojovice near Žinkov, according to GPS coordinates.
But it never reached the Klatovy airport. A search was immediately launched for the lost aircraft, which sent a distress signal. "In addition to the police, a military helicopter was involved," police spokesperson Martina Korandová said. But the search operation did not have a happy ending.
In the forest near Petrovic near Měčín, which is about six kilometers from where the plane last reported, a helicopter crew noticed the wreckage before 9 a.m. "We found the plane and two bodies with no signs of life," Korandová confirmed.
The crashed machine remained partially wedged in the branches of trees, and pieces fell on the ground nearby. "We will determine the cause of the accident in cooperation with expert experts and staff of the Institute for Professional Investigation of the Causes of Air Accidents," Korandová added.
Most of them are mild, only three percent of those infected need to go to hospital
Either a milder form of coronavirus is spreading through the Czech Republic, or a summer dose of sunshine has significantly improved our immunity.
Infectious wards of hospitals are half-empty, although the numbers of those infected are rising.
"The situation today and in April is completely different and it is mainly due to the number of hospitalized people," confirms Health Minister Adam Vojtěch.
It is worth remembering that on April 11, when the first wave of the epidemic peaked in our country, everyone wore masks, the army took samples, the republic was closed and the Czechs used disinfectant for the year ahead.
Nevertheless, ten people were dying every day.
Now the daily increases in the number of infected are higher, but every day with covid-19, a maximum of two people die.
Karvinsko still has the highest number of infected per population, similar numbers already have Jihlava due to an outbreak at the local Alzheimer centre, where there are already 57 infected - 40 clients and 17 employees.
Another home for the elderly has been closed by the sanitation department in Černozice in the Hradec Králové region.
Tests in one of the nurses confirmed the disease.
"We are tracing, we have reduced movement, we have all the hygiene measures," says Martin Scháněl, the director of the nursing home.
According to him, none of the home's clients have symptoms of the disease yet.
Health officials will start the blanket testing tomorrow and then decide on further measures.
Hospitals are also responding to the increased number of infections.
The Oncological Institute in Brno today launched an automatic camera system at the entrance, which can tell if people are wearing a mask when entering.
The record is reported by South Bohemian health officials, who recorded twenty-five cases of coronavirus - most of them foreign employees of the powder company.
Overall, there were 131 infections on Saturday - half of Friday's number - but there are fewer tests at the weekend.
Only children. We don't have reproduction, but we don't have to scare
Some words have ominous connotations, even if they only communicate the state of things. They include the word only child. It refers to a child growing up without siblings, but it doesn't sound neutral. "You know, only child," they say, without needing to add. Interestingly, this trait has always been carried by the "only child," back in the days when words like demographic crisis were not widely used.
Today, even people outside the scientific community know that a fertility rate of 2.1 children per woman is required to ensure simple reproduction of the population. It is also widely known that no state in Europe today achieves this level. France or Sweden, at most, is close to it, but European states are not assured of simple reproduction rates. (Within the West, only Israel stands out, with a combined fertility rate of 3.1 children per woman.) This is a situation made for alarmism. That's why it's no surprise when the minister of labor and social affairs, Maláčová, also falls for it: "There are almost as many only children as there are two-child families," she said in an interview with the LN. But she neglected the devil hidden in the detail.
Yes, it's good to draw attention to the problem instead of downplaying or ideologizing it. Like in Germany, for example, where the campaign for more children easily gains the label of fascism (in the style of "Hitler also supported it"). It's good to recall that many couples directly plan only children. It's good if politicians show the will to remove the obstacles that lead to those decisions (for example, the weak expansion of work from home discourages women from further pregnancies). But let's point out one thing.
When Minister Maláčová says that "there are almost as many only children" there is a hint of demagoguery. That statement was appropriate twenty years ago. Let's remember that fertility in the Czech Republic last ensured simple reproduction in 1980 ("Husák's children"). Then it dropped to a formidable 1.14 in 2000. But since then it has risen by almost fifty percent, to the current 1.70 children per woman, which is Europe's above average. It's not enough for simple reproduction, so the activity of politicians is appropriate. Only with this alarmism can they slow down a bit.
Neckermann cancels all flights, five hundred Czech clients involved
Neckermann cancels flights in connection with the insolvency of the British Thomas Cook and his German daughter.
"The Czech company Thomas Cook, s. r. o., operating under the business name Neckermann Cestovní kancelář, has not filed for insolvency," Šrámek said in a press release.
"CK Neckermann is, however, forced to continue cancelling the scheduled departures of its clients," he added, adding that this currently applies to all departures from 26 September to 6 October.
According to Šrámek, the cancellations will affect about 500 clients. The 800 clients of Neckermann who are currently abroad, he said, "will be taken care of and their safe return to the Czech Republic by their scheduled flight is ensured."
The travel agency admitted that some clients were asked to pay for their stay. "In such a case, it is necessary that clients immediately contact CK Neckermann's SOS line," Šrámek added.
Thomas Cook's bankruptcy occurred on Monday. In August this year, the travel agency entered into an agreement under which creditors were to inject £900 million into the company.
Half of the sum was to be obtained from the Chinese firm Fosun Tourism. The latter was to become the majority owner on that basis. The other half was to be provided by bondholders and creditor banks. However, as early as September 20, it was reported that creditors had asked the travel agency to obtain a reserve of £200 million, or the deal was off. On Monday, the company announced that it had gone bankrupt.
Jaromír Soukup spoke about Gotta: He mainly wishes him peace
Moderator and entrepreneur Jaromír Soukup (50) does not shy away from any questions. In his show Call and Write to the Boss, he publicly comments on various topics. And he is not a stranger to tabloid cases, which he gloats sparkly and wittily. Although this time he did not feel like laughing.
Jaromír Soukup commented on the sad news, which is a very serious illness of Karel Gott. He promised the singer one very considerate thing for himself.
"You know, Karel got sick and said it fairly, without the need to poke around tabloid journalists. I don't want to comment on it, it's a serious illness, we all have enormous respect for Karel Gott. And I would of course wish him a successful treatment and especially peace! The peace that he needs now," commented Barrandov, the owner of the TV.
"I wish the media would leave him alone. And wait for the news that the Master himself decides to give to the media. I don't much like the various statements of what his old acquaintances and various celebrities think about his health. And on behalf of our media, I can say that we will only address his illness and his person if he shows an interest in it. In my opinion, the other media should consider a similar approach."
Mahulena Bochanova interrupted her year-long detox and is sinning again!
More than a year ago, Mahulena Bochanova told Lightning that she had given up alcohol. "During the holidays, I decided to give my old, battered fifty-year-old body a breather. I gave myself a deadline forever. I feel terribly rested, I have a lot of energy and, most of all, my psyche has improved. I haven't been mentally well lately. I'm getting up better, I don't have a headache, I have more energy, more money."
A year's abstinence was enough and the actress found her way back to alcohol again. "Sometimes I have bubbles or good wine, but I don't drink what I used to. I have one glass and I have fun until morning. I have a bottle of wine in the fridge for a week. I also enjoyed non-alcoholic beer, which I can drink at any time," said Mahulena, who still forms a couple with the Brno businessman Petr.
Bochanova also returned to the theatre season after the holidays and will take a new role in the series Ordinace in the Rose Garden. "I'm ashamed of the first two performances, I was really bad, I overheard myself. But it's getting better," smiles the actress critically.
The pair wrapped tape around the dog and drowned it in the river, the bag was found by the children
The case took place at the end of July in the village around Valašské Klobouk. A 27-year-old woman brought home a donated dog, one to two years old, which she wanted to take care of. But her ten-year-old partner didn't like the fact that it was a dog, so he decided to get rid of it.
"He wrapped the animal with duct tape and rope and significantly eliminated its vocal expression. He put the dog in a jute bag, which he tied up. Then they took the animal together to the river, where they threw it in the bag. At the moment when the dog was thrown into the water, the dog was demonstrably alive," said Zlín police spokesperson Monika Kozumplíková.
The following day, children playing by the river found a jute bag on the bank. When they opened it, they discovered the body of a dead dog inside. So they called out to a woman who was passing by and fled. The woman reported the incident to the police emergency number 158.
"Thanks to the knowledge of the townspeople they found out who is probably the perpetrator of this incredible act. And they were not wrong. Both the man and the woman confessed to the crime and described how the event took place," added a police spokesperson.
An expert statement from the field of veterinary medicine confirmed that the dog died unequivocally agonizingly as a result of suffocation, when the animal suffered within a matter of minutes before its death.
"The actions of the perpetrators undoubtedly show a clear intention to dispose of the animal at all costs in this reprehensible way, even though they could have donated or sold the dog. The criminal police commissioner from Zlín accused the couple of committing the crime of animal cruelty committed in complicity. The two so far unpunished accused could spend up to three years behind bars if convicted," Kozumplíková said.
The Declaration of the End of the Right in the House, or What "Right-wing" Coalition of ODS, TOP 09, STAN and KDU?
The media and commentaries have been reporting on the upcoming coalition of these parties recently. Many applaud that the "right" is finally coming together, but I am asking why these parties still call themselves right-wing.
Leaving aside the new Trikolora movement, the Czech Chamber of Deputies no longer has a real right-wing party. And it does not matter how these entities label themselves or what label is parroted by the mainstream media. ODS is hardly centrist in its average of top politicians of this party, TOP 09 is clearly a party of the urban pseudo-liberal left (which is ashamed of its leftism and thus hypocritically describes itself as conservative or even right-wing). STAN is a party which, in its conception, ideology and voter targeting, essentially merges with TOP 09 (the reason for its existence is simply not clear to me). And the KDU even labels itself as centrist in the long term - but their political compass is much more to the left than they say.
Do you feel that I have taken everyone out of the same water? No, I am based on the real political steps of these parties. If I consider myself to be a classically liberal right-wing voter, the highest value for me is individual freedom, free market and minimal state interference in the lives of individuals and the economy. How do these parties fulfil this general assumption of rightness? How many laws slashing people's freedoms by the salami method, increasing taxes, confirming new regulations and increasing surveillance, increasing the link to the socialist EU or supporting environmental and gender madness have they supported in recent years? A lot, a lot indeed. Not their own labels, but actions identify them. These parties, despite all sorts of declarations or partial concessions, want to strengthen the role of the state in our lives. And this has nothing to do with rightwing.
I wouldn't be surprised at TOP 09, STAN and KDU coalition cooperation, they simply belong together on the political map, and apart from the Christian or homosexualist and gender aspects, I basically don't see an obvious difference for the voters in terms of the state's influence on their lives. However, ODS has long portrayed itself as "the only right-wing" and by associating with these three entities it is already openly revealing its true political affiliation.
By the way, when I mentioned the labels briefly. Have you noticed how often all these parties quite consistently and cheaply refer to critics of dirigisme and socialism coming from the European Union as pro-Russian agents? Can't they or just don't want to understand that there are many people who don't like eurosocialism and increasing disenfranchisement as strongly as the authoritarian regime in Russia? Aren't they hiding their total argumentative incompetence and the unreasonable or blind adoration of the Euro-EU situation?
It's simply possible that in the Czech Republic other than centrist politics no longer has a chance of greater success. Maybe this is the kind of association voters really want. Maybe they want left-of-centre politics under the guise of the "right" because they are ashamed of their political beliefs (or can't even identify them). I don't know. But I certainly don't belong among such voters.
Debutant champion!
Van den Bergh finishes fairy tale, Anderson gets swept away
The big surprise of the tournament by the name of Dimitri van den Bergh produced an outstanding performance in the match against the player who won the second most prestigious event within the PDC in 2018.
The opening match was a two-way tie, the break coming at 8:7 for the Belgian darter.
Van den Bergh took a break with a 13-dart lego and has had the upper hand ever since.
He was literally crushing his opponent with his game and the much more experienced "Flying Scot" had a hard time getting to the doubles.
The way in which the "Dream Maker" had him in the grip is also evidenced by the fact that a flustered Anderson played his first best only in the 24th lego.
In addition, the young Belgian managed brilliantly high checkouts.
The last time he lost was in the 11th lego, but he "caught a big fish" in an unfavourable state and closed with a 170.
At the end of the match Anderson showed great frustration.
Rather, he just threw the darts and his behind-the-triumph opponent performed perfectly well.
Van den Bergh converted the first of three match darts and lived up to his name - he wrote his big dream.
Winning the trophy named after Phil Taylor is all the more valuable for the Belgian dart player because it is his first major win.
It remains the case that the last player who managed to beat van den Bergh is Karel Sedláček.
Babiš calls for security cooperation at terror victims' memorial
Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš and his wife Monika visited Ground Zero in New York on September 27, 2019.
Terrorism is the main enemy against which all nations of the world should fight together. At the end of a five-day visit to the United States, Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš said today at the New York City memorial to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. On this occasion, the Prime Minister honored the memory of the two victims of Czech origin.
"It's a very moving place," the Prime Minister said as he, accompanied by his wife Monika, laid a white rose next to the names of Lukáš Rambousek and the Czechoslovak émigré Alena Sešínová. Both were among the more than 2,750 dead claimed by the hijacked aircraft attack on the former pair of World Trade Center (WTC) skyscrapers. The towers of the WTC collapsed on impact, and in their place there is now a memorial with a list of the victims' names.
"We need to remember what happened here, the horror," said Babiš. The attack on the US on September 11, 2001 was cited by the Prime Minister as the reason why the UN should cooperate in a united campaign against international terrorism. The terrorists then, in addition to destroying the WTC skyscrapers, crashed the hijacked plane into the building of the Ministry of Defense in Washington and planned another strike on a target in Washington, probably the White House or Congress. But this aircraft crashed when the passengers confronted the hijackers.
"This is our main enemy, where all the countries of the world should come together and fight international terrorism in a coordinated way," the Czech Prime Minister added.

Ondřej Houska's Czechs in Europe: Should Czechoslovakia have rejected the Munich Agreement and gone to war with Germany in 1938? Three NO's
An undated picture depicts Adolf Hitler visiting a Czechoslovak border fortification. The task of the fortifications was never to stop the German army, but to slow its advance before the Allies got involved.
If almost exactly 81 years ago Czechoslovakia had rejected the Munich Agreement and then faced a German attack, what would have put out the most Czechoslovak soldiers? German tanks, air force, or perhaps artillery? It might well not have been either of these weapons, even though the Germans had an overwhelming advantage over the Czechoslovaks. The Czechoslovak army would probably have suffered the greatest losses - due to blisters.
Charges dropped in Nantes over cathedral fire, man confesses
St Peter and Paul's Cathedral in the heart of Nantes caught fire last Saturday and the fire severely damaged the original 16th-century stained glass windows and destroyed the organ.
The suspicion of arson was being investigated by investigators because the fire was moving through the temple from three different locations.
At the same time, police found no sign of forced entry into the cathedral.
The accused is a volunteer with the local diocese, a 39-year-old Rwandan refugee.
Police arrested him shortly after the fire, but released him without prosecution.
Now the prosecution has informed that based on new evidence, the man was arrested again on Saturday, confessed and faces arson charges.
If found guilty, he faces up to ten years in prison and a heavy fine.
According to his lawyer, the man regrets the crime and has decided to cooperate fully with the investigators, Le Monde reported.
Zeman the Monument Maker - The Man Stretching the Constitution Calls for Law Enforcement
Those who move in a divided society and don't want to go completely crazy, will welcome situations where they don't have to root for their own. When they can give the benefits to those they otherwise criticize. If only to avoid feeling that they are oriented only by pre-assigned labels. Such situations include the list of badly damaged monuments that President Zeman fences during his favorite trips to the regions.
Everyone knows what this is all about. And those who occasionally travel through the Czech Republic see many of these devastated monuments - from the centers of historic cities to individual castles, monasteries, old houses, churches or farms - with their own eyes. Everyone suspects that demagogy can come into play here, too. That if we criticize the town hall for not caring for the monuments or some horror in the master plan, it may be the work of former administrations. Or it may be an object privatized, whose owner is not traceable. The head of state calls on local politicians: "A section of the Monuments Act allows you to fine owners of objects who do not take care of their property." But even if the owner is unreachable, it must be admitted that the president is calling for law enforcement. Which even critics of his bending of the constitution should acknowledge as a plus.
Of course, Milos Zeman would not be Milos Zeman if he considered all the details and formalities of a complex problem. But he stands for a good cause, much like squatters, which he does not recognize himself. Two years ago, we wrote: "Despite all the name-calling, squatters draw attention to a problem outside the current interest. To the fact that this or that building is in disrepair." And, admittedly, the president is de facto doing the same.
When you arrive in the historic center of Jáchymov, you are amazed at how devastated it is - including the houses with Renaissance cores. At a time when Jáchymov is celebrating 500 years of silver mining and the stamping of dollars (dollars for Americans). Why? Because of the rapid sale of houses in the 1990s, officials there say. But why is it that the island, seven kilometers away, home of the Schliks who minted the Jáchymov dollars, has the historic core nicely repaired? It's good for the President to point these things out.
Vojtěch: On Monday, we will present a "traffic light" for epidemiological measures
The new system is intended to fulfil the role of a pandemic plan, the absence of which is facing criticism from the government and the Ministry of Health.
"Degrees will be according to the strength of the community spread," explained the minister.
He added that at present, for example, the Moravian-Silesian Region or Prague would reach a medium, orange level.
The system is designed as a regional one, because the situation in the individual regions varies significantly, he added.
On the system, the ministry cooperated with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (IHIS).
According to the minister, specific measures will be linked to the individual levels, whether it concerns the obligation to wear masks or the organization of special departments in hospitals.
Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) called for the creation of an epidemiological plan on Prima Partie television, according to which people should have clear information about what measures they can expect if the epidemiological situation worsens.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has been growing in recent days, although the number of hospitalized people remains low.
Vojtěch commented that nothing major is happening, there is no need to talk about declaring an emergency or re-convening an emergency staff.
In view of the increasing number of infected since Saturday, the government has again introduced the obligation to wear masks at internal events for over 100 people throughout the Czech Republic.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be limited to 500 people, now it amounts to 1,000 people.
The government's approach, when it was not clear until the last moment what measures and when they would start to apply or when they would be announced, has received criticism.
"I think that in a situation that is quite tense, the main actors should create a sense of security and straighten out the confusion," Senator Marek Hilšer said in Questions.
Measures can already vary by region, for example, in Prague from Sunday, the obligation to wear masks also applies in non-residential health facilities, i.e. pharmacies or waiting rooms at the doctor's office.
The obligation to wear masks when visiting health and social facilities or pharmacies has also been introduced in the Liberec and Ústí Region since Friday.
In Vysočina na na Jihlavsku it is necessary to wear masks in indoor public spaces, in public transport and in health facilities since 14 July.
In the Moravian-Silesian Region, on the other hand, anti-epidemic measures have been relaxed, as well as in the Central Bohemian Region in Kutnohorsko.
At the beginning of June, the Czech government also approved the so-called traffic light for Europe, which differentiates in colour the level of risk of infection in individual European countries and adjusts the rules applicable to entry into the Czech Republic from these countries accordingly.
For low and medium risk countries, the authorities have not required Czech citizens to have a negative test for the coronavirus since 15 June or have not ordered quarantine instead.
These are mandatory when Czechs return from high risk countries.
At the moment, all EU member countries are now in the low risk category.
Costa Rica is a champion in the fight against climate change
Costa Rica received the title for several reasons. For starters, it plans to be carbon-neutral by 2050 - but plenty of countries have pledged to do so under the Paris Agreement. The Central American nation, with a population of around five million, produces only 0.4 percent of the world's emissions. Costa Rica has also pledged to fully switch to renewable energy by 2030, with 70 percent of buses or taxis running on electricity.
The official tourism organization says that already about 95 percent of energy comes from renewable sources - Costa Rica operated on them for 300 days in 2017.
Costa Rica boasts nearly 30 national parks.
The density of forests also contributes to reducing emissions. Rainforest forests with diverse fauna and flora, covering more than half of the country's territory, are also one of the main tourist attractions. "Costa Rica is a pioneer in nature conservation, setting an example for other nations in the region, but also around the world. Climate change requires urgent action from all of us," the UN said in a statement.
Costa Rica boasts nearly 30 national parks, which is a lot given the small size of the country (51,100 square kilometers). Rainforests or misty forests, coral reefs or mangrove marshes are home to five percent of the world's biodiversity. The country also has volcanoes, picturesque waterfalls, and you would also find several rescue stations for sloths.
Gently towards the planet. Researchers' Night begins in Prague
"In Prague, I would definitely visit the Czech Technical University and see a model of how smart cities will look like. At Charles University, I would visit the Institute of Anatomy at the Medical Faculty, which is normally not accessible to the public," advises the National Coordinator of the Researchers' Night, Jitřenka Navrátilová.
The Institute of Anatomy offers a tour of the autopsy room and a chance to try working with surgical instruments.
"Then I would go to the Czech Technical University and watch the film Green Desert," adds Navrátilová. Nine laboratories will offer guided tours. The motto of this year's Researchers' Night is "gently towards the planet."
Wife swap: Ondra was cruelly abused by his parents! He ended up in an institution
It was nerve-racking. Allegedly troubled son Ondřej (9) was being severely punished by his father every moment. "He came home from school and lied with a snack. Lukáš looked at me and said he would kneel as punishment," Lucie described in the Exchange. Dad Lukáš made little Ondra kneel in a corner for several hours! Apart from the cameras, he had to suffer like this on a wooden foot massage mat! "Ondřej came to me after the filming and told me - aunt, I'm making these troubles and notes just so I won't be here, because I want to go to an institution," Lucie described the moment when she fully understood what was going on behind the door of the studio. And the boy's wish finally came true...
His condition was so serious that he was taken away from his family after the filming and placed in the Centre of Educational Care in České Budějovice for a month. He returned briefly to his father and surrogate mother Aneta (28), but then went to a diagnostic institute for troubled children. "When I came home, Aneta immediately added me on Facebook, we wrote to each other for a while. She was most interested in whether we got the money. I hardly reacted at all to that. But then she wrote me that the little one was in an institute, that they returned him to them, now he is in a diagnostic institute. They are both out of work," says mother Lucie from Plzeň.
Lightning of course addressed the other side, but got only a vague answer. "I'm not in the mood, I'm sick, call back later," said Aneta and hung up the phone.
Přindiš, Prskavec and Fišerová safely advanced to the semi-finals of the World Championships
Kayakers Vít Přindiš and Jiří Prskavec as well as canoeist Tereza Fišerová safely advanced to the semi-finals of the Canoe Slalom World Championships in Seu d'Urgell. Přindiš was fourth in Friday's qualification, Prskavec fifth and Fišerová eighth. The other three Czech representatives will be in Spain seeking a semi-final start in the afternoon corrective qualifying run.
Among the strong representative group of kayakers, Vavřinec Hradilek did not succeed, receiving a 50-second penalty at the start of the run for an incorrect pass. On the other hand, Přindiš and Prskavec can relax and concentrate on Sunday's semi-finals.
"I set myself a goal to go down to 30 on the first run, which I did. Not that I didn't care how I ended up, because on Sunday the start is very early in the morning, so I was hoping to be a bit higher to have a better starting position," said Přindiš, praising the well-being in Seu. "Before the watch race I felt the worst in the 14 days we've been here. But then the race was good and today it was better. It's beautiful all the time, nice races here, the spectators came, so fine," he smiled.
Prskavec was also happy. "In qualifying you don't want to make an unnecessary mistake. In the first gates it didn't quite work. Then I did the middle very well, without any problems and I knew I had the mileage, so there was a second mistake when I wanted to go straight down and I turned the erk. Overall I can't be dissatisfied. The form is, we'll see how it goes," said this year's overall World Cup winner.
Both representatives praised going to the start at the end of the semi-final block on Sunday. "I'm not a morning person, it's also cold here in the morning, and when you're here at eight, you want to wear a jacket and a sweatshirt," said Přindiš. "Overall, the semi-final lasts an hour and a half, which is quite a good difference from the point of view of sleep," agreed Prskavec.
Of the three Czech singcanoeists, only Fišerová succeeded, Eva Říhová finished two places behind the advancing 20, Kateřina Havlíčková was 35. "I went down the top part as expected, in the middle part I felt like I wasn't following and wasn't going according to plan, but I managed to get into the comfortable track I wanted to ride. I made two shots and I'm just behind the winner with a clean time. I have a good starting position for the semi-finals," Fišerová said.

Thank you for dancing! Singer Leonard Cohen's final album will be released posthumously
The album, Thanks for the Dance, will feature unreleased material and various musical collaborations put together by the singer's son. The album will be released on November 22.
In October 2016, the album You Want it Darker was released, on which Cohen collaborated with his son Adam. He asked Cohen to help him finish the songs. In the intimate recording, Cohen symbolically comes to terms with his impending death. He died a month after the album was released, at the age of 82.
Seven months later, Adam Cohen began working on the material left by his father. He invited a number of musicians to collaborate - Damien Rice, Bryce Dessner, Javier Mas, and the singer Beck, to name a few.
"When we invented the music for my father's words, we used his own distinctive musical techniques. So he's still with us," Adam Cohen told the album. "What amazes me most about him is the reaction of those who have heard him before. One by one, they say Leonard is still alive," he added.
The album's first swallow is the short song The Goal. "I'm almost alive, I'm almost home," Cohen sings in his distinctive honey voice. He sang about death, suspecting that he would not live to see the new material released. He admitted as much in an interview with The New Yorker a month before his death. "I'm ready to die. I hope it won't be too unpleasant," he said.
In September 2018, Adam Cohen published a collection of his father's poetry called The Flame. It will be published in Czech under the title Flame on December 31 by Argo.
For a holiday with only a payment card? The NEO account offers free withdrawals from ATMs all over the world!
According to surveys, roughly half of all Czechs who go abroad have become accustomed to paying directly with a card. The main reasons include comfort, security, but also the possibility of using travel insurance, which is often associated with a payment card.
Travellers in almost every corner of the world can appreciate the convenience of paying with a card. This is especially true in popular tourist destinations, but today, payment cards are accepted almost everywhere. "People who travel more often, for example for work, do not have time to go repeatedly to currency exchange offices to exchange cash. And even "vacationers" do not want to rely on cash being enough for them. Moreover, some foreign currencies are not even available to Czech banks or currency exchange offices. We have therefore solved this with the NEO account so that its users can withdraw cash free of charge from all ATMs, wherever they are," says Kateřina Petko, Director of Marketing and Communications and Spokesperson for Expobank CZ.
Moreover, a payment card is a much more reliable way of not losing your money than cash. If a full wallet is lost, its owner may not wait for the money he carried in it. However, if he only loses his payment card, he can easily block it immediately over the phone or via internet banking. With quick action, he may not suffer any financial loss at all. "Keeping money in a bank account has other advantages besides its reliable protection. For example, the NEO account has an interest rate of 1.6% per year, which is among the highest among current and savings accounts. It is set up and administered completely online without the need to visit a branch. In addition, money in a bank account is insured up to EUR 100,000 and the account management is completely free," adds Kateřina Petko.
For anyone who is going to go abroad, travel insurance should be a matter of course. Thanks to the possibility of arranging it and paying by card online, it can be done even at the last minute. However, just owning a payment card often means insurance protection when travelling. "For example, with embossed MasterCard Gold and MasterCard Business cards, travel insurance is an integral part of foreign travel to all countries of the world. Holders of these cards can also insure their family with whom they are travelling. This often eliminates any other arrangements," adds Kateřina Petko from Expobank CZ. However, it is always advisable to check the scope of the insurance, i.e. whether it covers all activities that travellers plan to undertake.
The Ministry plans a flat-rate meal plan from 2021. Nothing changes in tax
The Ministry of Finance is preparing an amendment to the Income Tax Act, according to which an employee would receive money for meals directly. According to the Ministry, a quarter of employees, i.e. about a million people who do not yet receive meal vouchers, will also be able to support meals.
However, according to the chairman of the Voucher System Operators Association, David Rýc, even a number of small companies that do not have a canteen or meal vouchers provide meals for their employees, for example by importing food or by agreeing with restaurants.
"The essence of the plan is that we do not change anything about the tax advantage. Furthermore, it will not pay for health and social insurance," Schiller said on Friday. She added that the limit for the maximum employer contribution applicable as a tax credit would also be maintained.
The Income Tax Act allows companies to pay a maximum of 55 percent of the meal voucher price. The remaining part is paid by employees, in some cases by the employer, but without the tax credit. The most advantageous value of the meal ticket for employees and employers this year is CZK 123.
Bloomberg: Venezuela has hidden bitcoins and doesn't know what to do with them
Venezuela's central bank is conducting internal tests to determine whether it can hold cryptocurrencies. It is responding to an order from the state-owned Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), which seeks to send bitcoins and ethers to the central bank and then pay the oil firm's suppliers with cryptocurrencies. Employees are also studying a proposal to allow the central bank to count cryptocurrencies in foreign exchange reserves, which are now near their 30-year low. Citing information from four sources, Bloomberg reported.
Sanctions imposed by the United States against President Nicolás Maduro's authoritarian regime have largely cut off Venezuela from the global financial system. This has exacerbated the country's economic crisis. The current crisis is one of the most serious in global terms, forcing officials to use a patchwork of different ways to move money. While Maduro's efforts to launch a state-owned cryptocurrency as the world's first failed, ongoing efforts to use digital currencies show how desperately the government is trying to find ways to circumvent the restrictions.
Neither the Central Bank of Venezuela nor PDVSA responded to a request for comment.
It is unclear how PDVSA came to own bitcoins and ethers, nor how much value it owns. The company is having trouble getting payments from customers through conventional channels, because large banks are unwilling to do business with entities that are subject to sanctions. Last month, the company received most of a $700 million (CZK 16.6 billion) payment in Chinese yuan, because the parties were unable to find financial institutions that would make the transaction possible.
PDVSA may have no appetite to sell cryptocurrencies on the open market, because that would require it to register on the exchange and undergo due diligence, a so-called due diligence. Instead, it wants the central bank to use the cryptocurrency and pay it to entities that PDVSA owes. Oil company officials believe the central bank is less exposed to any obstacles that might arise when paying with cryptocurrencies.
Bitcoins and ethers use a decentralized online ledger known as the blockchain to authenticate and record transactions. In some cases, relatively anonymous transfers are allowed without the need for an intermediary. Few banks are involved in digital currencies because of money laundering problems and client information that are related to them and complicate compliance.
Cryptocurrencies, after the 2018 debacle, are seeing a return to prominence this year, thanks to expectations of greater acceptance by institutions and Facebook's plan to come up with its own cryptocurrency. Even so, they remain unstable. Bitcoin has fallen nearly 20 percent in the last four days, but has made a profit of about 130 percent since the beginning of the year.
Jan Šindelář's commentary: Running the railways like a company
Sky's election, although perhaps not entirely smooth, is the conclusion of a sad story about the state's inability to give the railways a clear direction. The board of directors has been incomplete for over a year now, and even after Wednesday evening, that remains the case, as one of the members has resigned. The interim is ongoing.
The selection process itself has been a farce from the beginning, if only because the requirements for candidates, especially in the field of practice, have been significantly relaxed. Compared to the selection last year, the requirements for the size of the company in which the candidate should have worked in the past have been reduced. First, the members of the selection committee, and then the supervisory board, played only the role of pimprlat.
Sky submitted perhaps the weakest professional CV of the five finalists, yet without the practice of a large company, it beat the experienced guys from the management of logistics giants as well as transport companies. Participation of interesting managers from the private sector was perhaps the brightest side (and the greatest hope) of the whole process. Today, those concerned know that they played only the role of narrative scenery in the political game.
Maybe they will surprise Nebeský, show great talent, and in the end he will prove to be the best railway boss of all time. At least in the beginning, however, it will be accompanied by the aftertaste of political travesty. Czech Railways is not facing an easy period, it has to cope with competition in market liberalization and lack of employees in operation. There are no train drivers, shunters and mechanics. What motivation should they have for further work and respect for management if the state behaves like an elephant in a china shop in the top management?
The second important group is creditors. How they interpret the games at the head of the railways will be seen next spring, when the railways defend the rating. What is certain is that creditors perceive instability. Sadly, someone else comes to Moody's agency every year to defend the rating for Czech Railways. The agency has not missed the frequent changes in the management of the railways and the political influence on the company, it criticized them already this summer.
The ANO movement coins, among other things, the slogan that the state must be managed as a company. For a start, it would be enough if it managed one big state company as a company and not as a state. ČD is still one of the largest companies in the country and it would be good if the best ones led it. They applied, but the state scorned them. It can certainly be argued that the post at the head of the railways has always been a political matter. But then we can avoid the antics of the tender procedure.
An unusually open and unique image of Karel Gott in Olga Špátová's feature-length documentary
This unique film feature by Olga Špátová will be premiered in Czech cinemas next spring.
"In mid-September last year, Ivanka and Karel Gott called me and asked me if I would make a documentary about his life with Karel again after ten years. I didn't hesitate a minute! Shooting with a man who lasted more than half a century on the limelight of Czech culture thanks to his exceptional singing talent, artistic humility and immeasurable diligence, was and is a great honour for me. I accepted the invitation to make a feature-length documentary film about Karel Gott, who brings joy to three generations of listeners with his art, as a commitment to this legendary singer," director Olga Špátová describes her feelings.
Thanks to a quick agreement and agreement, the first shooting day took place already on 22 October last year and the last shots with Karel Gott were shot a few days ago. The goal was and is absolutely clear - to capture authentically Karel Gott as a phenomenal singer who gives himself away to his supporters, as a painter, but at the same time as a loving husband and father of his children. A man who for sixty years with his songs gives joy to several generations not only in our country, but also in Europe, and indeed all over the world. A man who has written himself into the hearts and souls of his listeners by simply being.
The film is not meant to be a parade of Karel Gott's undisputed fame and his achievements. "Therefore, it is not even possible to compare my previous film The Gott Phenomenon with this current one. Everyone is different. At least because we filmed them at a different stage of Karel Gott's life, and this will be very evident in his personal, almost intimate confession, which he gave us and which confirmed us all in what a legend we have the opportunity to work with and spend time with, which is truly indescribable," adds Olga Špátová.
The creators captured Karel Gott during his performances, during meetings with his fans in our country and in Hamburg, but especially in his home environment, whether in Prague, in a cottage in Czech Switzerland, in the village where he spent his childhood, and in other places that played an important role in his life. The film will thus be completely authentic and unique thanks to Karel Gott's sincere openness.
"Olga has a great gift for filming with her narrow team in such a way that we often let ourselves get carried away by the spontaneous atmosphere and naturally let her into our privacy, thanks to which I talked about topics quite intimate. She and her husband, the cameraman Jan Malíř, actually became part of our family. Originally, we wanted to release the film in 2019, when I celebrated my life's jubilee. But because I had a beautiful summer with my family, I wanted us to shoot as long as possible. Well, and because there was a lot of me in 2019, my wish was that it would be released in cinemas next spring. This documentary film is a thanks to my supporters and all those who supported and guided me in my profession," Karel Gott himself says about the film.

Managers of state-owned companies are to undergo a new selection procedure. The law will be possible to circumvent, says the opposition
"This is a typical bill that is unnecessary," said Zbyněk Stanjura, chairman of the ODS deputy club.
After several unsuccessful attempts, the Chamber of Deputies approved changes to prevent the opaque distribution of functions - critics talk about tobacconists - in state-owned companies in the future. Candidates are to undergo a new selection procedure in a given ministry and will also be assessed by the government committee for personnel nominations.
However, this is a compromise solution that the ODS, for example, does not like because it will allegedly allow ministers to make excuses that selection committees are to blame for any bad selection of state managers. Moreover, the opinion of the said committee will not be binding on the minister. The novelty still needs to be approved by the Senate and signed by President Miloš Zeman.

The library commemorates the anniversary of the death of Wenceslas IV with an exhibition of manuscripts
Six rare historical manuscripts from the turn of the 14th and 15th centuries, i.e. from the time of the Roman and Czech King Wenceslas IV, can be viewed today and Saturday by people in Prague's Klementinum. The National Library has released them from its vaults to commemorate this year's 600th anniversary of Wenceslas' death. This morning librarians and restorers placed the rare originals in the display cases in the Mirror Chapel. Admission to the exhibition is free, it is open on both days from 10:00 to 18:00.
The exhibition of documents entitled Ad mandatum domini Regis: From the Royal Office and the Library of Wenceslas IV was prepared by the library together with the National Archives. The National Archives looks at the written heritage from the time of the reign of Wenceslas IV from the point of view of official documents and the National Library from the point of view of literary works, said its author Jan Vojtíšek.
"Visitors can look forward to, for example, a work on agriculture by Peter de Crescentiis, which is basically a kind of encyclopedia of agriculture, or to a breviary, a prayer book of one of the Benedictines of St. George's Monastery at Prague Castle, from the beginning of the 15th century," he said, listing the reasons why people should look at the exhibition.
Also on display will be the Epistles of Peter of Blois, where the semi-figure of the English King Henry II is depicted in the opening miniature H (enrico). The author of the decoration is most likely the Master of Samson's History, who, in addition to two volumes of the Wenceslas IV Bible, also participated in the decoration of a number of other manuscripts. Visitors will also see the Latin collection of tracts by John Wycliffe from the period of about 1411 to 1414.
Not a single book has been preserved from the Wenceslas IV Library on Czech territory. According to experts, this library was one of the most extensive and also the most beautiful book collections in Central Europe at the time, because the young king longed to build a representative library to match the book collections of his French relatives. However, the library disappeared soon after Wenceslas' death. Apparently it was stolen or destroyed during the conquest of the castle by the Hussites. However, several codes have been saved. The Austrian National Library now owns the most of them.
"We have a number of treasures in our collections and I am glad that they are in a state that allows them to be exhibited and made available to the public so-called live and not only in the form of the Manuscriptorium digital library," said the director of the National Library, Martin Kocanda.
On Saturday's national holiday, an exhibition entitled What's Hiding Under the Floor, which presents the local archaeological discoveries, will also be opened free of charge in Klementinum.
Technoparty continues in Benešov region.
Plays at one-third capacity, should have ended at noon
Hlaváčkova Lhota (Benešov region) Technoparty continues in Hlaváčkova Lhota in Benešov region on Sunday evening.
A third of the original 12 music systems still play.
According to evening estimates by the police about 500 people remain here after 20:00, the initial rough estimates were about three hundred, in the morning there were about 900, said police spokesperson Lucie Nováková.
Originally, the technoparty was supposed to end at noon on Sunday, at which time part of the music systems actually ceased.
"Some have already left and others are preparing to leave.
The music production is still partially ongoing.
We expect that the disconnection and dismantling of the music systems will gradually take place," said Nováková.
"Police officers are still consistently checking departing visitors in order to prevent drivers from driving under the influence of alcohol or addictive substances.
Drivers have the opportunity to undergo a preventive breath test before leaving," she added.
Dozens of riot police are supervising the event, foreign police, traffic and riot police are on the scene, and dog handlers with service dogs are also on standby.
"During the day, officers checked 470 people moving in the event venue and 485 vehicles, 270 drivers were subjected to a breath test, six of whom got behind the wheel under the influence of alcohol," Nováková said.
A total of 95 drivers were tested by police for the presence of narcotic and psychotropic substances, one of which was positive.
Officers also dealt with 14 traffic offences.
At the request of techno party participants, officers conducted 300 preventive breath tests and four preventive tests for the presence of narcotic and psychotropic substances.
About 2,000 people were at the event on Saturday morning.
If the number of participants had not decreased, police would have intervened there.
Czech Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) told the Prima Partie television program.
However, the number of participants decreased below 1,000, so the police assessed that the intervention was not needed, and neither did the sanitation station or the Ministry of Health ask for it.
Czech Television (ČT) reported on Sunday that the techno-party extended to the surrounding land, whose owners did not agree with the use for the techno-party.
It is possible that the owners of the surrounding land will demand compensation for damages.
Supporters of techno came to the meadow near Hlaváček's Lhota on Friday evening.
Police originally guarded the meadow in Blažim in Benešov on Friday, where the techno-party took place last year.
Blažim is located roughly 30 kilometers from Hlaváček's Lhota, where the techno-party actually went.
According to Nováková, no one came to Blažim.
Viper bite: Little girl ended up in hospital!
"The first case this year was recorded in Železnorudsko.
A viper bit a girl in her leg, class of 2010, who was brought by her parents themselves to the local emergency services base," regional emergency services spokesperson Mária Svobodová told Deník, adding that the child was then taken to a hospital in Klatovy.
Viper is the only venomous snake in the Czech Republic and it is in Šumava that these animals are found in higher numbers, so it is good to be careful when walking.
However, there is no great danger from these animals.
The chance of being bitten by a viper is not very high, it is afraid of itself during normal contact.
And if it has the space to do so, it likes to crawl away with a loud hiss.
It will only attack if it feels very threatened - for example, if you accidentally step on it.
Even its bite is not a tragedy, its venom is very effective against small mammals, but it does not kill people.
This can only happen if a person has a particularly weakened organism or suffers from allergies.
The risk of danger is therefore especially for children, seniors and allergists.
"After a bite, a person often feels nauseous, sweats, has an elevated temperature, thirst, abdominal pain and diarrhea, in weakened individuals and especially allergists can go into anaphylactic shock," Miriam Gredová from Klatovy Hospital told Deník.
The man threatened to throw the infant out of the window.
He poured wine and threw dishes at the policewoman
After 23:00, a SWAT team entered the apartment and detained the man.
The infant was immediately taken into care by paramedics, regional police spokesperson Markéta Janovská said in a press release.
The man did not want to cooperate with the police, throwing dishes, knives or pouring wine out of the window at the police negotiator.
He amplified his threats several times during the negotiation by leaning out of the window with the child in his arms.
Once he even climbed on the windowsill himself, where he staggered.
The police are continuing to investigate the man.
They do not want to disclose further information yet.
Stosur prefers daughter to tennis season
Australian tennis player Samantha Stosur will not play in the coronavirus-affected season again this year.
The 36-year-old 2011 US Open champion, who became a mother in June, but does not want to finish her career just yet.
She plans to return to the courts next year and believes she will enjoy tennis even more than before thanks to her family and daughter.
Stosur announced on social media two weeks ago that her partner Liz Astling had given birth to her daughter Genevieve in mid-June.
"I'm going to stay home, spend time with my family, be around all the little milestones our Evie will experience in the next six months and just enjoy it," the former world number one doubles player posted on the Australian Federation's website.
The WTA Tour will resume its interrupted season on August 3 with a clay tournament in Palermo starting in March.
Sapa market: Raid reveals meat, fish and eggs of unknown origin
"One of the vehicles entering the area was transporting 1320 pieces of quail eggs of unknown origin, in unsuitable conditions.
Also these eggs will be disposed of at the rendering plant," said the State Veterinary Administration.
During the inspection of the live fish stall, it was then discovered that the vendor did not have documents of origin of the goods and was not registered for the sale of live fish.
The market has long been considered a problem from a veterinary point of view.
For example, last autumn, veterinarians discovered an illegal food shop, containing almost half a tonne of unmarked food without documents of origin.
For most of them, the expiry date could not be determined, some of the products had expired and were spoiled.
For five kilograms of cuttlefish, the expiry date was exceeded by three years.
Last May, veterinarians and police officers seized 80 kilograms of food without documents of origin, including dried fish, squid or frozen duck, in the area of the market, some of which was mouldy.
Spilkova at par. In Indianapolis, she is on the verge of advancing after the first round
Golfer Klara Spilkova is on the verge of advancing to the final rounds after the first round of the Tech Championship in Indianapolis. On Thursday, she made two birdies, two bogeys at the LPGA tournament and finished the opening day at par. With a 72, she is tied for 69th, which is the expected cut.
The 24-year-old Spilkova returned to the circuit a month ago after a two-month medical break and did not make it to the second half of the tournament in Portland. She was rested due to fatigue and exhaustion after passing illness.
The first Czech winner of a professional tournament at the European LET Series is a first-year member of the LPGA Tour and has not fared well so far. Of the 12 tournaments, she has made the cut three times, the best being 32nd in Hawaii. She is fighting to keep her card for the next season.
The tournament in Indianapolis was won best by Korea's Hor Mizhong. After the first round, she has a score of -9 and a two-shot lead over her three opponents.
Police charge CzechTourism manager Aleš Pangrác over promotion contracts
Police have charged a former manager of the state agency CzechTourism, Aleš Pangrác, over promotion contracts. Pangrác confirmed to the news server Seznamy Zprávy that he took over the charges this week. Czech Television (ČT) reported last year that officers in the case were examining contracts worth CZK 38 million. Some of the money, according to the police, was going back to Pangrác, the news server reports. In the case, the criminal investigators were also interested in the Minister for Regional Development, Klára Dostálová (for ANO), whose department CzechTourism belongs to. The investigation into the case continues, according to the news server.
Detectives from the National Centre against Organized Crime secured evidence in this case in the second half of last November. They were, for example, at the headquarters of the Ministry for Regional Development, at the headquarters of CzechTourism, at the autodrome in Most or at the agency Sport Invest. The service computer was also taken from the minister's apartment. The court search warrant for Dostálová, previously cited by ČT, said that the minister decided in 2016, when she was a deputy, on CzechTourism's expenses for the benefit of the chosen persons through mediation and outside the standard of official procedure. Dostálová said at the time that she felt absolutely innocent, she did not doubt, she could document everything and she cooperated fully with the police.
According to the agency, it was the fault of an individual. The media reported earlier that it was the former director of the regional partnership department at CzechTourism, Aleš Pangrác, who was dismissed due to the results of the audit. This showed that the CzechTourism agency had concluded 48 problematic contracts.
"Yes, they accused me. But I don't want to comment further," Pangrác told the server Seznam Zprávy.

Stores destroyed, street fires, memorial procession followed by riots
Five years ago, 43 students of a university in Ayotzinapa disappeared, despite extensive investigations, the case has not yet been solved. The students were allegedly detained by police in the Mexican state of Guerrero. It is not clear exactly what happened after that, but according to the investigation, the students apparently ended up in the hands of a local syndicate and were subsequently killed and burned, reports APTN.
On Thursday, a memorial procession was held in Mexico's capital, families wishing to express their frustration that answers and explanations for their children's disappearance were still not being found.
But the largely peaceful march was disrupted by smaller groups of vandals, who destroyed everything in their path. Vandals destroyed shops and hotels, did not shy away from destroying monuments, set fires around the city and blew out windows.
Even before the march, President Andres Manuel López Obrador said he would do everything to catch them, and asked the public for any information that would lead to a clarification of the case.
Over 142 people were detained as part of the investigation, but none of them were convicted. Many of them had to be released because their human rights had been violated, investigators allegedly had to torture the suspects, adds APTN.
Putin on the phone with Zelensky ahead of Donbass ceasefire, Kremlin criticizes planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke on the phone with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky about the situation in Donbass, where a new ceasefire is to take effect from midnight.
Putin, according to the Kremlin statement, criticized, among other things, the decision of the Ukrainian parliament to hold local elections; Kiev reported that Zelensky called for the release of the detained Ukrainians.
A new ceasefire was agreed on Wednesday evening by the negotiators of Ukraine and Russia, supported by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
The ceasefire is to begin after midnight on Monday night, is to be "complete and universal" and is to open the way for fulfilling other provisions of the peace agreements.
In the interview, Putin told Zelensky that the decision of the Ukrainian parliament to hold local elections contradicts the Minsk peace agreement and threatens the prospects for a settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
The Ukrainian parliament decided last week that the forthcoming local council elections will not take place in territories controlled by pro-Russian rebels.
The Minsk agreement foresees that Kiev will regain control of the border of Ukrainian territories occupied by separatists with Russia after giving these regions wide autonomy and holding local elections there.
According to Unian, Zelensky's office said that the two statesmen agreed on the benefits of the upcoming ceasefire in Donbass as well as on the need to implement other measures to support peace in the region, such as de-mining areas of fighting or withdrawing part of the troops from the front.
Zelensky also called on Putin to release Ukrainians detained in eastern Ukraine, the occupied Crimea peninsula and Russia itself.
The Minsk agreement has helped to stop the fighting, but people continue to die in occasional firefights and artillery attacks on both sides of the front.
The conflict in Donbass has resulted in over 14,000 deaths since spring 2014.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of military support for the separatists, which Moscow denies.
Zelensky has made ending the war in Donbass his priority, but no major breakthrough in negotiations has yet taken place.
And where are the spectators? Doha Can't Be London
But it is also a step backward, for in its pilgrimage to Doha, athletics has voluntarily and consciously renounced the thrilling atmosphere of a sold-out stadium in London 2017, as well as the European Championships in Berlin last year.
Giant banners on the walls of skyscrapers in Doha invite "the biggest sporting event of 2019." Nevertheless, concerns grow about how dignified its backdrop will be.
"Tickets for the finish line are sold out for all evenings," the organizers say.
But that is too little.
The upper gallery of the Khalifa Stadium, with a total capacity of 40,000 spectators, is already covered with brightly colored tarpaulins, which also display the flags of the 209 participating countries. Athletics has set out in Qatar for a territory where it has no roots, despite the annual Diamond League meeting.
No wonder, then, that only 50,000 tickets were sold for the 10 days of the Championships last week, although their price started at 60 Qatari riyals, or less than 400 crowns.
The organizers have now set themselves the goal of filling the uncovered portions of the stands at least half full. That is why, according to sources in the British newspaper Giuardian, they are reportedly (though the organizers themselves deny it) giving away free tickets to migrants who work here as workers, as well as to children. Which Sebastian Coe, the head of the IAAF athletics association, can also say positively: "That is how we can inspire the next generations."
Rich Qatar has won world championships in handball and cycling in the past, after athletics comes football in 2022. The financial offerings of an oil-rich power will always be lucrative, even for rich sports federations. That is the reality of today's sports world.
But even if we accept it and ignore the absence of fans in the stadium, we cannot help but feel a genuinely sporting sigh that the IAAF leaders should have timed the experiment with the first outdoor World Athletes' Championships in the Arabian Peninsula better - and for another year. The extreme late deadline, imposed by the climate, disrupts the entire scheduling of the pre-Olympic season, and thus the preparation for the pivotal Olympic season, which would normally begin for athletes in October.
Perhaps Qatar will make up for this with at least the technological innovations with which it promises an ultra-modern and attractive championship. Isn't it just 37 degrees? Already, the stadium's surface is artificially air-conditioned to 24 degrees. And advanced cameras, embedded directly in the blocks, are designed to show even television viewers in detail what happens to athletes in the hundredths of a second before and just after the starter's shot.

Rykl is the unexpected decathlon champion, Novotná dominated the heptathlon
Defending champion of the last two titles Doležal did not finish the 400 at the end of Saturday's program, Kopecký did not jump the pole on Sunday.
The decathlon was long ruled by Latvian representative Reinis Kregers, who is preparing in the group of coach Josef Karas, but he withdrew after the discus.
Rykl had two bronze medals from the outdoor Czech Championship so far, this time he was the only decathlete who made it past the 7,000 mark.
Other medals behind him were won by Vilém Stráský and Petr Urbánek.
Rykl recalled the absence of Adam Sebastian Helcelet and Jiří Sýkora after the competition.
"It's a pity that the boys weren't here and Kope didn't start, because then the results would have looked completely different.
But the title tastes very good, I especially appreciate the fact that I took a person by 30 centimetres in the distance.
Then I was even more pleased with the pole and the most disappointing thing was probably the disc, where I was below average," he acknowledged on the union facebook.
Kateřina Cachová won the first day of the heptathlon with more than 100 points, despite suffering from an injured ankle on the rebound leg.
In the distance sector, however, she then registered only 570 cm, did not throw 40 meters with a javelin and did not enter the final eight hundred.
Novotná collected 5878 points and won by 241 points ahead of Kateřina Dvořáková.
She came out mainly in the distance, 631 cm is the best Czech performance of the year.
"I really wanted it to be around the 630.
Yesterday my calf started to pull, but I'm really glad that I didn't feel it at all and that it didn't limit me at all," Novotná said on the union facebook.
Bio LPG arrives in the Czech Republic, promises ecological operation
Liquefied petroleum gas, abbreviated as LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas), is a very well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
It is especially popular for its substantially lower price compared to petrol or diesel, due to a significantly lower excise tax, but its benefit is also in lower CO2 emissions per kilometre driven.
Like petrol and diesel, it also has its environmentally friendly variant - "bio LPG".
But it is quite new - it first appeared on the European market two years ago and arrived in the Czech Republic a few days ago, according to a press release from the Czech LPG Association.
"In these days we have received the first fifteen tonnes of bio LPG, which will be distributed in a mixture with classic fossil LPG to our petrol stations," the association quotes Jiří Karlík from Primagas.
However, bio LPG cannot be taken as bioethanol or biodiesel.
According to the association, it is chemically identical to classic petroleum LPG, which many motorists are refueling in their cars now.
Therefore, it is also possible to mix both versions freely.
"The only difference compared to classic LPG is the way of production," says Ivan Indráček, chairman of the association, about bio LPG.
This is also said to be one of the great advantages of bio LPG over other alternative fuels.
It can be easily transported and stored, and the distribution infrastructure is also relatively good, e.g. compared to hydrogen or electricity.
Currently, this gas is obtained as a by-product in the production of bioethanol from food and sugar cane residues.
In the future, it should also be produced in a targeted way, e.g. from cellulosic biomass, i.e. from wood waste.
In contrast, classic petroleum LPG is produced partly as a by-product in the refining of oil, partly by separation in the extraction of natural gas.
As a result, depending on the production technology and the source, the operation of a car on bio LPG is 40-70% more environmentally friendly in terms of carbon footprint than the operation on petroleum LPG, and up to 90% compared to diesel.
But it is not about CO2 emissions from the exhaust of the car, but about the ecology of fuel production, i.e. the so-called "well-to-tank" part.
Some of the largest producers of bio LPG currently include the petrochemical companies Eni, Total and Neste.
According to a recent update of the National Clean Mobility Action Plan (NAP CM), Unipetrol is also investigating the possibility of production at its Lithuanian refinery.
According to estimates by the association, there are about 170,000 LPG vehicles in the Czech Republic; the Ministry of the Environment mentions a slightly higher number in the NAP CM, about 200,000.
According to statistics from the Ministry of Transport, almost 6,000 LPG-powered car conversions were carried out last year alone.
It is possible to refuel LPG in the Czech Republic at about 950 stations of various operators.
Vojtěch revises numbers of infected, number drops by 1775 cases
Health Minister Adam Vojtěch (for ANO) ordered the Ministry to revise the numbers of infected with the coronavirus.
The new statistics were published by the Ministry of Health on its website on Sunday.
On Sunday afternoon, the number dropped from Saturday's 5254 to 3479 cases, which is by 1775 fewer infected.
At present, therefore, there are 3422 patients in the Czech Republic.
"Behind the jump in the number of cured people is a revision of the data, which health officials have not been able to update recently," said the head of health statistics, Jaroslav Dušek.
By Sunday afternoon, 15 212 people in the Czech Republic had been infected with the coronavirus, 11 419 had recovered and 371 had unfortunately succumbed to the disease Covid-19.
Slovaks succeed, only pay a fine for racist insults
The Slovak Football Association has succeeded in appealing against the stadium closure for racism by fans. The national team was originally supposed to play Wales in the European Championship qualifying match without spectators, instead the association will now only pay a fine of €15,000 (about 387,000 crowns).
The UEFA Disciplinary Board punished Slovakia and Hungary for the behaviour of fans during the recent mutual qualifying match in Budapest, which the visiting charges of Czech coach Pavel Hapal won 2-1. It closed the stadium to both clubs for one match and fined Slovakia €20,000 and Hungary €67,000.
The Slovaks only received a fine of €15,000 for insulting political chants after the appeal. The national team's closest match in qualifying for the European Championship against Wales on 10 October in Trnava will thus be made available to fans.

Overview of bank accounts for children in the Czech market
Children's accounts are provided free of charge by banks. However, it is necessary to consider the offer, as some other services to the accounts are already charged. "The motivation of banks to offer accounts for children, whose basic management is usually free, is straightforward. Financial houses count on their waived fees being refunded one day. With the small migration of Czechs between banks, they are probably not wrong," says Kristýna Kuncová from dTestu.
"Small accounts," she says, can do almost anything that adult accounts can do. A child gets his own payment card, can enter payments, track account movements, and has his own electronic banking at his or her disposal somewhere. Banks set up the account, but it is up to parents to teach children how to use them and also check their payments.
"Relatively flexibly, a parent can set weekly or monthly limits, turn individual services on and off, and so on. Above all, however, he or she can monitor what is happening on the account, whether by looking over the internet or thanks to information SMS. Beware, these may no longer be free," Kuncová adds, adding: "If a parent is considering an account for their child, they should consider the child's abilities and options."
Museum in Semily returns to the Velvet Revolution with exhibition
An imitation of a normalisation room with a television in which footage of the brutal intervention of police officers against students on 17 November 1989 in Prague is shown. This is also in the museum's new exhibition in Semily, which is dedicated to the Velvet Revolution. "The basis is to present what happened in Semily after the events on Národní třída," said the exhibition's curator, Tomáš Chvátal.
"I would say that the atmosphere was basically the same everywhere, with the first demonstration in Semily on 22 November, and then gradually more people were packed up every day," he said. Among the most active was a group of local dissidents around Miroslav Matěcha, who was the only one from the town and the immediate surroundings to sign Charter 77, and Mr and Mrs Dědečková, who were expanding the Several Sentences petition. The Civic Forum was also created relatively quickly, according to Chvátal. "One specificity is that there was a very strong group of local doctors in the Civic Forum," said the curator.
Some 50 photographs should draw visitors into what was happening in the town at that time, the pictures were taken 30 years ago by Karel Bárta. A video of the general strike on 27 November 1989 by František Tomíček has been preserved, which will be looped throughout the exhibition. Ivan Hlas also spoke and sang at the demonstration. The Semily Archives also lent a number of preserved banners to the exhibition at that time. "They said: Let's not get drunk with a bun, From trough to trough, We don't want violence," said Chvátal. Some of the changes in the town were very rapid at that time, for example, as early as December, people decided in an all-Semily vote that the square would be Riegrovo and abolished the previous name of Gottwaldo.
The exhibition also captures what was happening before the November events. "In the first part, we present to both the witnesses and students what was before, such a late normalization. I think we have managed to collect unique documents from Semily, whether they are banners with various communist slogans or a bronze plaque from the then-museum of the workers' movement," Chvátal said. One room is supposed to create a feeling of what it might have been like in the living room of an ordinary household at that time.
The last part of the exhibition is again devoted to what happened after the Velvet Revolution. It focuses on the first free elections. "We wallpapered one room with election posters. Those who have experienced this will remember over the posters With us to Europe or there is Václav Klaus still under the OF banner with the beautiful motto Everyone for his community," added the curator.
A pike in a pond or a relatively affluent open-air museum?
Babiš chose for his optimistic view statistics such as good security (the Czech Republic is seventh in the world), low unemployment rate, low national debt. Or the fact that our country is, according to one recent study, the 24th in quality of life out of 140 evaluated countries.
Developer Dušan Kunovský and architect Josef Pleskot, in a television interview on the occasion of the Architecture and Development Summit, however, cited other, far from "rosy" data. For example, the Czech Republic is 154th in the world in speed of construction proceedings. It may be that the current economic "boom" will not leave behind any significant building heritage as it was in the past.
The biggest obstacle is not only the existing legislation, but also the slow, inefficient bureaucracy. Comparative studies show that the Czech Republic lags significantly behind the developed countries in the overall quality and performance of public administration.
Our country has simply not yet managed to make good use of the potential of the good economic situation of recent years to invest in the future. It is nice that salaries and pensions are increasing, but people with improved living standards will also want to have a place to live, travel modern and fast, have quality cultural stands, live without an intolerable environmental burden.
But in the capital Prague, for example, it has not been possible for years to complete the inner and outer circuit or to build a speedway or a metro to the airport. And Prague does not even have a modern, architecturally daring national library, concert hall, or national gallery. The reason for this is not only absurd wrangling over architectural competitions, zoning plans and building permits, but also some specifically Czech conservatism, which adheres to the motto "any bolder change is for the worse."
And when it seems that something bolder could succeed, it will almost certainly be thwarted by monuments or other somewhat stubborn societies, or politicians. In the absurd drama surrounding Jan Kaplický's "blob" designed for the new building of the National Library, even President Václav Klaus wanted to tie himself to the backhoes.
The list does not end with Prague. The Czech Republic is not able to complete its backbone motorway network or start building train speedways, so Germany has finally decided to lead its tracks for superfast trains from Berlin to Vienna by a "detour" through Bavaria. Moreover, repairs to existing infrastructure are often drowned in shenanigans. Getting quickly from Prague to Brno is now a puzzle.
Babiš came into politics promising to "get things done." But not much has happened so far as meaningful investments and acceleration of cumbersome bureaucratic procedures are concerned. An amendment to the law on the acceleration of construction of transport infrastructure is in force from 2018, but we will have to wait for the larger beneficial impacts of, for example, easier land expropriation. And a new building law, approved by the government, which should reduce the current average length of construction proceedings from 5.4 years to one year, will, if we are lucky, start to apply from 2021. But many people would probably not bet on it.

Mobile Election Units or Correspondence Election.
Political scientist and sociologist looking for options for the pandemic
According to Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD), a change in the law is needed to allow people in quarantine due to the coronavirus to vote in the October regional and Senate elections.
Parliament could discuss it in August or September under an accelerated regime.
He made the announcement on Sunday in Partia Tv Prima.
On Tuesday, he wants to discuss possible solutions with representatives of parliamentary parties at the ministry.
"Whatever we do, it will have to mean a change in the electoral law," Hamáček said.
On Wednesday, the Senate called on the government to find a solution within the framework of the legal rules in force.
However, the minister said that it would be necessary to modify the provision of the law according to which people in quarantine due to a medical condition cannot vote.
The ban on voting should be maintained, for example, for patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop said on the OVM program that the possibility of correspondence election has been postponed since 2004.
Even the current bill, which is in the Chamber, then envisages introducing it for voting abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
At the same time, Prokop considers the concerns of ANO or ČSSD (because according to experience from abroad it would rather benefit other types of parties) about correspondence voting to be overstated.
He personally opposes the possibility of electronic voting, where there is a considerable possibility of abuse.
Michal Klíma said that it is now necessary to invent ad hoc mechanisms (elections) that could be carried out already this year and with the least possible health risk.
He considers the main one to be ready for 2021, when parliamentary elections are to take place in the Czech Republic.
He considers correspondence voting (whether only abroad or also in the Czech Republic) to be one of the functional methods.
He sees as another the aforementioned electoral units or the possibility of proxy voting within the family.
He added that it is possible to learn how similar situations -⁠ elections at the time of the coronavirus -⁠ were handled in Croatia, Poland or France.
Due to the spread of the coronavirus disease, various types of elections in 67 countries around the world have been postponed already this year.
The Prague Stock Exchange grew moderately, Czech banks, O2 and Avast did well
The Prague Stock Exchange closed the trading week with a slight rise. The PX index rose 0.13 percent to 1038.45 points. It was driven by Czech banks, the telecommunications company O2 and the technology company Avast. On the other hand, Austrian titles and the media company CME did not do well. This is the result of trading on the exchange's website.
For most of Friday's session, the Prague Stock Exchange traded in slightly positive territory and eventually finished with a small gain. "However, for the whole week, it lost (the PX index) just over one percent," said Josef Dudek of Fio banka.
Domestic banks partly corrected the declines of the past few days. Komerční banka improved by 0.82 percent to CZK 803 and Moneta Money Bank by 0.41 percent to CZK 72.80. Avast shares appreciated by 0.89 percent to CZK 113 and the operator O2 added 0.46 percent to CZK 216.50.
Kofola's securities grew the most, by 1.38 percent to CZK 294. Philip Morris, a tobacco company, gained less than a percent, with its shares rising to CZK 13,640.
The securities of the energy company ČEZ stagnated at Thursday's CZK 520.
Three stocks were loss-making - Erste Bank wrote down 0.87 percent to CZK 779.20, CME 0.73 percent to CZK 109 and VIG 0.40 percent to CZK 618.
The crown weakened slightly against both major world currencies. It lost four pennies to the euro at CZK 25.85/EUR, and three pennies to the dollar at CZK 23.62/USD. This is according to data on Patria Online.
Protests in Bulgaria: Pig ears thrown by demonstrators at government building
Participants in a demonstration against Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov and his cabinet threw pig ears at the government building.
It was another in a series of protests against the "mafia style of governance" that have been taking place in Sofia and other cities for almost three weeks.
Organizers are planning a nationwide blockade on Wednesday, DPA reported.
Today's protest, which took place for the 18th consecutive day, had a weaker turnout than the previous one, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.
At 8 p.m. some 300 people had gathered, some streets had to be closed to traffic.
Demonstrators outside the government building staged a theatrical stunt in which they symbolically locked both Prime Minister Borisov and Attorney General Ivan Geshev in a prison cell in connection with the arrest of two aides to President Rumen Radev, who is a strong political opponent of the Prime Minister.
The resignation of both is one of the protesters' basic demands.
They also demanded the cancellation of the announced health care reform and an end to corruption in construction on the Black Sea coast.
Protest organizer Nikolai Hadjigenov said on public radio today that a "peak of escalation" is planned for Wednesday in the form of a "nationwide rally in Sofia and blockades throughout the country."
He reiterated the demand for the resignation of Borisov and his government, as well as the calling of early elections.
The regular elections should take place in March 2021.
Borisov has previously said that he does not intend to resign.
He justified this by, among other things, the need to carry Bulgaria through the covid-19 pandemic and the resulting economic crisis.
But on Friday he replaced five members of his government team, although the concession did not reassure the demonstrators.
Earlier this week, Borisov's government withstood a vote of confidence in parliament.
Attorney General resumes prosecution of mother who manipulated daughter against father
Attorney General Pavel Zeman disagrees with the acquittal of a mother who manipulated her daughter for a long time and interfered with her relationship with her father. She faced charges of abuse and endangering her upbringing. The regional court acquitted her, Zeman disagrees. Such behavior can be seen as a criminal act, according to his appeal to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court ruling could have a broader impact on other cases. "A more specific definition of such a specific form of abuse can be considered necessary also from the point of view of directing further application practice," reads Zeman's appeal.
Last year, the District Court in Svitavy first found the woman guilty of abuse of the person entrusted to her and endangering the upbringing of the child. She formed a strong, even symbiotic bond with her daughter, even in a situation where she was supposed to be entrusted to her father.
The result was a pathological fixation on the mother and a significantly negative relationship with the father. The situation marked the emotional development of the daughter, who was even hospitalized. She threatened to self-harm in case of transfer to the father's custody.
The Svitavy court sentenced the mother to two years in prison with a two-year probation period. However, the Pardubice branch of the Regional Court acquitted the woman on appeal, saying it was not a criminal offense. The Regional Court repeated the same verdict even after the Supreme Court once ordered it to rule again.
The Regional Court found that situations in which one parent manipulates a child against another are not exceptional. They are resolved in guardianship proceedings, possibly with the help of psychologists or social protection authorities for youth. Only exceptionally is the solution criminal law.
According to the Prosecutor General, however, the woman committed both abuse and endangering the upbringing. "The accused acted in a completely deliberate manner, stirring up negative feelings towards her father in her daughter, and she purposefully reinforced these negative emotions. By acting in this way, she not only pursued the illicit intention to limit or exclude the father's contact with a minor, but she must have been aware that this would cause negative consequences in the psychosocial sphere of the minor," the appeal reads.
Zeman asked the Supreme Court to refer the case back to the Regional Court once again. The appeal states that the child is now in the father's custody. ____________________________________________________
Let the fans be positive, Hašek wishes. Sparta will have a hit in Pilsen
"We will play at the limit of our ability, we will do everything in our power to succeed. To manage the match both gamely and in terms of results," promised Spartan Martin Hašek in an interview for the club television.
In the week the goal decided the cup duel in Jihlava (2:1). Sparta advanced to the next round, which was a duty for them. She was relieved, but she continues to suffer gamely.
Even though the season slowly spills into the second period, football Sparta is still looking for the face that coach Václav Jílek spoke about early in his engagement.
"But it's still Sparta, which has very good players. We have a difficult game ahead of us," warns fullback Roman Procházka.
When the Spartans last arrived in Štruncovy sady, in mid-May it was a straightforward affair in the superstructure. The visitors left after a mindless performance with a beating of 0:4, the biggest in the history of the independent Czech league.
While the difference between the clubs in the table was eight points before the match, now Sparta is losing nine points after ten matches of the new season. It is experiencing one of the worst entries to the season ever.
"It's not an easy situation for us, nor for the fans, who would like to see their beloved club completely different from what it is at the moment," Hašek feels. "But we would like them to continue to support us, stay positive and stand behind us."
Sparta does not know if they will be able to use Tetteh in Pilsen, who received a two-match suspension in Pilsen but appealed against him on Friday.
On the numerous sickbay remain Costa, Dočkal, Drchal, Panák, Pulkrab, Zahustel, Krejčí and Kadlec, who is the only one of the cadre remembering the last Spartans victory in Pilsen in 2011.
The home side, who have won the last five matches including Wednesday's cup in Hlučín, should be missing only the midfielder Čermák. And as captain they should be led into the match by the defender Jakub Brabec, a Spartans outcast.
Milan Jakubů: The funeral was stolen by the army for itself! Says Andor Šándor
There are still uncertainties surrounding the funeral of Brigadier General Milan Jakubů. Media speculated during the week that the army planned the last farewell to the Deputy Director of Military Intelligence despite the wishes of the family as bombastic as only soldiers can. There were also discrepancies regarding the date of the funeral. Ministry of Defence spokesperson Jan Pejšek denied this.
"It's nonsense! We have been in contact with the family from the beginning, the Friday funeral date agreed from the beginning is valid, no one has changed it. Just like military honors are paid. We will just deal with the possible participation of the media with regard to the family," Pejšek told Lightning on Wednesday. The funeral will finally take place on Friday and there will be no lack of all military honors, including the overflight of fighters.
But there is still a tense atmosphere around the last farewell to the popular general. The funeral ceremony will not be attended by people who worked with the general in the past because of the decision of the organizers!
For example, the former head of military intelligence, Andor Šándor (62), who met Milan Jakubů 17 years ago. Šándor remembers the former colleague as a hard-working, intelligent and "good guy."
Moreover, he met him regularly in recent years at the celebrations of the anniversary of the establishment of Military Intelligence. That is why he would like to say goodbye to Milan Jakubů. "I personally would like to go to the funeral of Milan Jakubů," Šándor told Lightning. But he cannot.
"I know other people from the organization who would like to go, but they are unlucky because the potentates will usurp the funeral for themselves. I think it is not right to privatize the funeral in this way," said the security expert. Nor does he like the supposedly considered closing the ceremony to the public because of the secrecy of military leaders.
"The leadership of the army is not kept secret and the leaders of military intelligence are not either, because they need to be promoted at Prague Castle, we see them there. If the information of the media is true and the family has really been embarrassed by the army, it is of course a matter for the family. I personally would never allow the army to overwhelm the family and their wishes," concluded Šándor.
Milan Jakubů died on Saturday near Špindlerův Mlýn in a car accident. The head-on collision of Milan's Rapid with a Ford Mustang was reportedly caused by the driver of the sports car Vojtěch Ch. (31).
An amateur racer on a curve should have driven into the opposite direction, Milan Jakubů apparently had no chance to prevent the collision. His wife (47) suffered serious injuries in the accident and it is possible that she will bear the consequences for the rest of her life. Police interviewed the culprit of the accident on Thursday.
Bologna coach Mihajlovic no longer wants matches without spectators
Bologna football coach Siniša Mihajlovič has had enough of Italian league matches without spectators.
The Serbian coach hopes that fans will return to the stadiums from the new season.
"What we are running here at the moment is not football.
I am sick of matches without spectators.
It is sexless football, it brings me no emotion, no joy.
The matches are worse than training.
Playing like this is terrible and I think I am not the only one who thinks so," said Mihajlovič before today's match against Lecce.
After the coronavirus break, the Serie A matches follow in quick succession and even though they are played in the evening, the players are exposed to the heat.
"We play every three days in terrible heat.
In such conditions, you can't even tell how the teams are.
I wish this season would end.
The measures had to be taken to finish the competition, but I hope that by September the fans will be back," said the coach, who has also managed Fiorentina and AC Milan in the past.
For Mihailovic this season is also unusual because he missed four months on the bench due to leukemia treatment.
"Despite my illness, the league break and everything else, we managed to take our team up a level.
We want to continue to grow and for that we need the players to be mentally stronger," he said.

The launch of the new toll is not at risk, reports Kremlík. But a change of operator is in play
On Friday, the Ministry of Transport launched preparations for a new tender for the operation of the new toll system. It is a back-up plan that the state would use if the current toll contract were to be definitively cancelled. In addition, the state is also preparing another provisional solution if the tender is not completed in time. On Facebook, the Minister of Transport Vladimír Kremlík (for YES) said.
On Thursday, the Office for the Protection of Competition (ÚOHS) banned the performance of the toll contract between the state and the CzechToll/SkyToll consortium, with a one-year delay. The ministry will file an appeal against this.
"The launch of the new toll collection system is not at risk. Starting today, we are starting the preparation of a new transparent tender, the subject of which will be the services of the operation of the new toll system, which is now being completed by the CzechToll and SkyToll consortium," said the minister.
The state would thus be looking for the operator of the currently prepared toll, which will be launched from this December. It would therefore not be a competition for a completely new toll system, as was the case with the last tender, nor for the use of the old system, which is now operated by Kapsch.
However, according to Kremlík, the ministry is also preparing for the fact that it would not be able to prepare the new tender in time. "Based on the experience so far with the toll tender process, I am deeply convinced that the ÚOHS is wrong and that it is objectively impossible to prepare and implement such a complex tender procedure and to hand over the operation of the toll system to the new operator within the 12-month period specified by the tender," he said.
The ministry will thus be preparing a provisional solution in addition to the new tender procedure, which would solve the toll collection for a transitional period until the state finds a fully-fledged form of solution.
The state will thus probably not use the offer presented to it by the current Kapsch toll administrator in recent days. The Austrian company offered the state to operate the existing system in case the toll contract was cancelled.
At the same time, Kremlík reiterated that he believes that the backup plan will not be needed. The ministry will therefore file an appeal against the antitrust authority's decision.
The ÚOHS issued a decision on Thursday in which it prohibited the toll contract from being fulfilled. However, the ban will only take effect one year after the authority's decision becomes final. This is not final and it is possible to file an appeal against it to the president of the authority. The ministry and CzechToll therefore continue to prepare the new toll, which should be launched in December.
The CzechToll/SkyToll consortium won last year's tender for the new toll system and its operator. It succeeded in the toll tender with an offer of 10.75 billion crowns for the 10-year operation. The current Kapsch operator protested against the tender and the validity of the toll contract, which failed in the tender with an offer of over 13 billion crowns.
My heart is like a bell and the lungs of a non-smoker. I'll just have a few infusions, joked Zeman
The head of state underwent a medical examination at the Central Military Hospital on Tuesday for several hours. According to the director of the hospital, Miroslav Zavoral, the doctors found no "diseased states" in the president. The president will celebrate his 75th birthday on Saturday.
The doctors found mild signs of dehydration in the president's check-up. His problems with low pressure were caused by insufficient water supply. "To fix the dehydration of the organism, I'll have a few infusions to get minerals into my body," said Zeman.
However, according to Zeman, the director of the Central Medical Hospital stated that "the Czech state has a healthy president." The president mentioned in this context that Zavoral had received several hateful messages because of the medical examination.
According to the president, the doctors examined him thoroughly and did not miss a single spot on his body. "So a brief recap: the heart is beating like a bell, the lungs are clean as if he were not a smoker, the liver is functioning as if I was a teetotaler, my kidneys are also fine and I can go on and on," said Zeman.
The editorial iDNES.cz contacted the military hospital to comment on Zeman's statement about his health.
The issue of Zeman's health became a topic especially during last year's presidential election or during some public appearances in which Zeman has obvious problems with walking. According to Prague Castle, the president has trouble walking because of diabetic polyfunctional neuropathy. He also has problems with low blood pressure and can hear worse. Because of his health, he has reduced smoking.

Sparta does not want to lose Tetteh in Plzeň. They appealed against the two-match penalty
Soccer Sparta appealed against the two-match penalty for striker Benjamin Tetteh, which the player received from the disciplinary committee for his expulsion in Sunday's derby with Slavia (0:3).
The Letenský club reported on its twitter and is now waiting for the verdict of the appeal committee.
Tetteh has already served half of the penalty in Wednesday's domestic cup match in Jihlava. Sparta are now aiming for the 22-year-old Ghana striker to take part in Sunday's 11th round of the first league in Plzeň.
The situation from last October could be repeated. At that time, Olomouc appealed against the penalty for Shimon Falta, who received a one-match suspension from the disciplinary committee on Thursday for his expulsion against Liberec.
The appeal committee did not have time to discuss the case, so the effectiveness of the penalty was postponed and Falta was able to take part on Saturday, ironically against Sparta.
The committee finally confirmed the one-match punishment for the Olomouc midfielder in the following week and Falta missed the following match with Zlín.
The disciplinary committee suspended Tetteh for a foul on Glory player David Hovorka, for which he received a straight red card from referee Miroslav Zelinka in the 82nd minute.
The alleged spitting by a Ghanaian player on the captain of the opponent Tomáš Souček has not been proven.
We Have Been Targeted by Foreign States' Cyber-Attack, Iran Says
Since the end of June, fires and explosions have been reported from a number of Iranian military, industrial and nuclear facilities, as well as oil refineries, power plants, factories and businesses.
Some Iranian officials have said that the fire that broke out in the Natanz underground nuclear facility earlier this month may have been caused by cyber sabotage.
The cause of a number of other incidents has not yet been explained.
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi told reporters, according to Iranian media, that the Islamic Republic's infrastructure faces "thousands of cyber attacks" every day.
He added that this is not a new phenomenon and that most of them will be repelled.
In recent months, Mousavi said, several wider cyber attacks have been reported, with analyses saying that "certain governments and groups" were behind them.
However, he did not provide further details on the possible perpetrators, according to Reuters.
Mousavi also added that fires in forests, refineries and other places are frequent in the summer.
An article by Iran's state-run IRNA news agency this month discussed how Iran's enemies, such as Israel and the US, may have been behind the recent incidents.
But neither country was directly accused of the specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States broke off diplomatic relations shortly after the 1979 revolution, when Iranian militant students attacked the US embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
Long-strained relations between the two countries escalated in 2018 after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers and imposed sanctions on Iran that have a severe impact on its economy.
Another significant escalation came this year after the US military killed Iranian General Qasem Soleimani and Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi Muhandis on January 3.
On January 8, Iran fired a number of missiles at bases in Iraq where the Americans are based.
The US only admitted with hindsight that dozens of US soldiers were wounded.
Israel considers Iran its arch-enemy and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is the main opponent of the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran.
According to the Israeli Prime Minister, Iran is trying to develop an atomic bomb, which Iran denies.
Harry in the footsteps of Princess Diana (†36)! Where's Meghan?
Diana was exceptional in that she could grab people's hearts. In January 1997, she caused a stir when she visited Africa and especially the minefield. The pictures of her wearing a protective suit and face shield became iconic. And even then, no one could have known that a few months later, the Princess of Human Hearts would die in a tragic car accident in Paris.
Now her younger son, Harry, has scored a point by going to the same place as her after 22 years. He went to the mine clearance site in Diric, Angola, also donning a special protective suit, looking very thoughtful. He couldn't help remembering his beloved mother, whom he had lost at the age of just 13.
Harry gave a speech on the spot, praising the efforts of the Halo Trust, which works to defuse minefields and other explosives in countries where war has taken place. "Mine fields are the unhealed wounds of war. By clearing them, we can help the community find the peace that comes with opportunity," he said, also appealing for the preservation and maintenance of wildlife and the local river as a source of water. After this visit, the Duke of Sussex moved to Huambo to rename the local orthopaedic centre after his famous mother, Princess Diana.
He did not forget to mention her on his official Instagram account: "The Duke is honoured to visit the place and community that were so important to his mother, to familiarise himself with their tireless mission, and to speak for all whom she (Diana) felt most needed to be heard, even though the problem was not exactly popular worldwide," Sussex Royal's Instagram post said.
But royal fans may be disappointed that he did not take his wife Meghan (38) and their son Archie (4 months) on such a quest to remember Diana. For both of them have had separate agendas for Harry since Wednesday, apparently to protect them. After all, taking a small baby to a minefield doesn't sound very safe, and Harry doesn't want to endanger his beloved family at any cost.
TPCA has extended production shutdown, now until May 25
Cologne-based Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile (TPCA) has again extended the production shutdown due to the coronavirus.
Production lines should be restarted on Monday, May 25 in the morning.
Dozens of sanitary measures will accompany the start-up, said Tomáš Paroubek, a spokesman for the car company.
Production has been stalled since the evening of March 18 due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Originally, the company intended to resume production on Monday, May 18.
The reason for the extension of the shutdown, according to Paroubek, is closed borders and closed dealerships, so there is no one to sell the cars.
According to Paroubek, the company will produce 100 percent, i.e. in two shifts, from the start.
Coronavirus-affected key markets of the company, such as Italy, the United Kingdom or Spain.
Mayor Michael Kašpar (Change for Cologne) said that the shutdown of production at TPCA does not affect life in the city.
"It was noticeable at the beginning, the city was empty.
But gradually the streets are filling up, especially now since Monday, when it has become very loose.
So the city is full," said Kaspar.
According to him, there are no complications even with the foreign workers who have stayed in the residential hotels.
"In those two months we had almost no problem to solve," said Kaspar.
For example, Škoda Auto in Mladá Boleslav, which has also suspended production due to the coronavirus crisis, resumed production on Monday 27 April at all three of its production plants in the Czech Republic.
Not one of the plants is operating at 100 percent capacity.
The resumption of production at Škoda was accompanied by more than 80 sanitary measures.
On the night of Monday to Tuesday, a third night shift was held in Mladá Boleslav and Kvasiny for the first time after the resumption of production.
The TPCA currently employs about 2,500 people and the company represents one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and also an employer in Cologne.
A new metro architect will oversee the D line, bringing experience from the London Underground
The Prague Transport Company has selected an architect to oversee the design of the Metropolitan Underground. Anna Švarc will become the architect from October, her primary task will be the design of the new D line, but she will also be in charge of the existing stations. According to her, the Underground cannot be viewed as just a transport structure, travelling by underground should also bring an aesthetic experience.
A Czech architect who participated in the reconstruction of three London Underground stations, for example, won the tender launched by the Prague Transport Company (DPP).
In addition to her, 14 other applicants took part in the tender. "The tender included a motivation letter and a curriculum vitae. It seems that my previous practice in London, where I created a kind of aesthetic manual for the Underground in a team of three people," the new metro architect says. Her practice from the Institute of Planning and Development of the Capital City of Prague could have made the same decision.
She does not see the Underground as just a transport functional structure. Stations should also have aesthetic value.
"I have ideas about how the metro will change, how the space will improve. But I will find out how it will be realistically in the coming weeks when the transport company introduces me to its ideas," says Švarc.
"It is not a series of dogmas, but rather recommendations, the aim of which is to keep the context of all stations in case they are reconstructed," the design manual says.
Whether a similar tool is also a way to improve public space in the Prague metro is a question. The Prague metro is specific. "Whether the manual is ideal or whether a personality can cover it, I really don't know yet," concludes Švarc.
Cancer kills bride shortly after wedding: She leaves message for family
For more than two years, Gemma Sisson battled a vicious cancer, and just when it seemed she had beaten the cancer, the disease came back.
The 39-year-old woman, who loved bodybuilding, eventually ended up in a hospice bed, where she was still able to marry the love of her life.
Sadly, she succumbed to the disease.
A few hours after her death, a shocking message appeared on her Facebook account for those closest to her.
Gemma Sisson, from Leeds, England, loved bodybuilding.
She and her boyfriend Ricky Moore, with whom she had lived for more than 16 years, toured competitions held all over the world.
The 39-year-old woman played sports and lived healthily, yet in April 2018, she was diagnosed with cancer.
Gemma began a grueling course of treatment, radiotherapy, in the hope that she would recover.
After months of treatment, it did seem that Gemma had managed to beat the cancer, but in August 2019, the cancer returned, this time attacking her spine.
The bodybuilder and personal trainer, according to the British Daily Mirror, underwent a 10-hour spinal surgery and eventually resumed the drastic treatment.
However, it was all in vain.
Earlier this year, on her thirty-ninth birthday, doctors told her she had a few months to live.
In April, the handsome blonde finally decided to attend a hospice in Leeds, where her family visited her every so often and even arranged her wedding to her love Ricky.
The marriage lasted two months.
Ricky took Gemma to a restaurant for the last time on their two-month anniversary.
Four days later, Gemma died in his arms.
Just hours after her death, a post that Gemma had written for her family appeared on her social media account.
'If this has been made public, it means I have finally died after weeks of fighting too long.
Although I will be heartbroken to leave my loved ones behind, I will be so glad to be rid of what this terrible illness has caused me.
I can't thank Ricky enough, who has been by my side all this time and has given me a tremendous amount of love and support during this terrible time," she wrote on the social media site, saying that the pain and suffering had finally stopped and she had found peace.
"I am also grateful for all the support I have received from all of my social media followers," she wrote, saying that everyone should treasure their lives and live them to the fullest.
The first Miss Christová finally got into herself: She lost a few pounds and saw right through
The first modern Miss from 1989 Ivana Christová (49) had long years of problems with her overweight, which caused not only physical problems but mainly psychological ones. She suffered because she had changed a lot since the time of Miss Czechoslovakia. But now it seems that she took the reproaches to heart and went into battle with the excess pounds. Even though it is a long haul.
She used to be a first-class beauty who conquered Paris. But since then it has been thirty years and Ivana Christová can only remember the beauty contest. Not only because of the fame, but also because of how thin she was.
Over time, she decided not to conform to the strict modelling rules, which ordered her to be as thin as possible and often not to eat. She decided to stop listening and started to indulge in what she wanted.
But she went from hunger strikes to overeating, which immediately took its toll on her figure. In addition, she tried to disguise the extra pounds with various loose clothes, which added to the bulky shapes.
Now it looks like Ivana really went for herself. She visibly lost weight, began to dress tastefully and appropriately for her fuller figure.
She surprised everyone at the book launch of Miloš Zapletal (75) that she had seen through again and now she has regained the features of the lovely brunette, who in 1989 entered history not only as the first winner of Miss after the revolution, but also by the controversy her victory caused.
Christová will forever be the first winner of beauty, but also the very first, who was booed by the audience at the Palace of Culture and Sport in Ostrava as she put on her crown.
"A parody of justice." Scientist warned of cancer from pollution, sits in Turkish jail
Sik, along with other scientists, participated in a study commissioned by the Turkish Ministry of Health between 2011 and 2015. Its conclusion was that water, soil and food pollution in some industrial areas in the west of the country was linked to an increased incidence of cancer in the local population.
The scientists mentioned in particular the industrial zone of Dilovasi, which lies about 80 kilometers from Istanbul, and which houses a number of chemical and metallurgical plants. People living in its vicinity, they said, suffer from cancer far more often than the international average.
Erdogan retaliates for coup, international criticism despite
Sik seemed to think that the government was taking no action on the matter, despite the clear conclusions of the study. He wrote several articles about the research in the opposition daily Cumhuriyet. The authorities subsequently began to prosecute him for revealing classified information.
"The study clearly showed the extent to which water resources were contaminated with toxic substances," Sik told reporters after the verdict. "The court's decision shows that the results of studies directly related to public health can be concealed. This is unacceptable," the scientist added.
"Instead of pursuing alarmists through the courts, the Turkish authorities should investigate this important public health problem," said Andrew Gardner of the Turkish branch of AI.
Environmental and human rights organizations have long accused the Turkish government of not enforcing environmental regulations, despite rapid industrial development in certain regions.
After the foiled 2016 coup, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's regime launched a massive wave of arrests. Nearly 80,000 people are now behind bars, including a number of employees of the daily Cumhuriyet. The authorities have also suspended or dismissed 150,000 civil servants and members of the armed forces altogether.
The opposition and human rights organizations accuse the government of using the attempted coup to persecute its opponents. But authorities argue that it is a measure needed to ensure national security.
Automats for art sell sweat dating, mushroom amulet and memory game
For one hundred crowns, passers-by will get a pocket work by mostly beginning Czech artists.
They create pictures and other creations directly for the artmat, so they know in advance that they must fit into the size of 8.5 by 5.5 centimeters.
Each piece is numbered and signed.
"In the package there is always a curatorial text about the artist and then the work itself," said Petra Widžová, the curator of the project.
Artmat works with the principle of chance.
The buyer can thus be surprised by what artwork he will get.
Currently, he may become the new owner of fanciful illustrations by Alexandra Štoplová or mini-postcards by Tereza Bonaventurová, which can also be sent.
The artist Punx 23, in cooperation with Dora Dutková, has prepared a memory game connected with a walk through Prague.
Cards must be paired with house signs.
Ilona Polanski has created a collection of tattoos for Artmat.
Marie Ladrová and Juliána Chomová sell pocket packs of spirituality: the first of the artists offers a protective amulet made of tinderbox and fortune cards, the second a series of illustrations based on her Spiritistky comics.
Slovenians beat Polish World Champions and are in the final of the European Championships
Slovenian volleyball players will play sensationally for the premier title of the European Champions. Supported by nearly 12,000 booing fans in Ljubljana, they beat the reigning two-time World Champions Poles 3-1 and are the first finalists.
Who they will challenge in Sunday's climax in Paris will be decided on Friday between France and Serbia.
The Slovenian team was much more compact than the Polish World Champions in the semi-finals. They had only the start of the first set and, with luck, the end of the second set, but the home volleyball players were outperforming in defence, and of the players in the red and white jersey, only the native of Cuba, León, basically scored.
But in the home line-up, both the packs of Chebulj and Urnaut, as well as the second all-rounder Štern, who soon succeeded the unimpressive Gasparini, were in life form. The Poles paid the price for winning all their previous matches at this Euro with mastery, while the Slovenians gained confidence after heavy battles in the play-offs with both the Bulgarians and the Russians.
With the Poles in August this year, the Slovenes lost 1:3 in the Olympic qualification in Gdansk, but were beaten back at home. But now Stožica will leave the sold-out Ljubljana arena. After today, however, they have already secured a second medal in history, in Paris they can improve on the unexpected silver medal from the European Championships four years ago.
At the previous European Championships, the Slovenes finished eighth, behind the Czech team.
The traveller Zikmund or General Boček. The Senate handed out commemorative medals
The 96-year-old Boček, who was a fighter pilot for the British Air Force during World War II, thanked all the awards for the medals. "The Senate was one of the first to remember and do not forget war veterans," he said. "The award I received today also belongs to my friends who are no longer with us," he added.
In his speech, Kubera warned against dividing society. "Let us not forget our roots, which unite and shape us all, whether we want to or not. It is from these values that our successful present comes," said Kubera.
The awards were cardiologist and the most quoted Czech scientist Renata Cífková, long-time rector of Tomáš Bata University in Zlín Petr Sáha, geologist, writer and traveller and popularizer of science Václav Cílek, President of the Czech Biathlon Union and Vice-President of the World Biathlon Union Jiří Hamza and František Paštěka. The upper house praised his heroism - in January this year he saved the life of his neighbour and his two-year-old granddaughter when he pulled them out of a burning car. Former upper house presidents Libuše Benešová and Milan Štěch were also awarded medals.
Zikmund, together with Jiří Hanzelka, undertook a number of travel expeditions around the world during which they gathered a number of documentary material. Fištejn was a commentator and broadcast director of Radio Free Europe, now he cooperates with the public media. Steigerwald also acts as a playwright and screenwriter, musician Kocáb was the head of the parliamentary commission for overseeing the withdrawal of Soviet troops.
The medal was given in advance to astronomer and emeritus head of the United Nations Office for Space Affairs Luboš Perek on the occasion of his hundredth birthday in July. Before the end of the year, the same award is to be given to the Czech native and first US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and the British philosopher and political scientist Roger Scruton, who, among other things, participated in the activities of the so-called underground university during the communist regime in the former Czechoslovakia.
Insects are up to 60 times fewer than 40 years ago
No other animal class is more represented in nature than insects. Beetles, butterflies and other species make up more than half of life on Earth. But there are increasing reports that the insect kingdom is shrinking radically. Another scientific study on the subject came out just this week, and the situation is even more serious than humanity has previously realized.
The study is based on field research in the tropical forest of Puerto Rico, in which American scientists copied a similar survey from 1976. As they write at the beginning of the report, insects in the forest today are "10 to 60 times fewer." It is the decline of the entire population, not the number of species, and the research involved not only insects but all arthropods. Because of the insect extinction, the population of other fauna that depend on insects in the food chain, such as birds, frogs or lizards, is also shrinking.
The authors of the research put their conclusions in direct connection with climate change. The average air temperature in the forest has risen by two degrees Celsius in the last thirty years, they say, and warming has become the driving force behind the collapse of the food chain. According to the authors' team, the study shows that the impact of climate change on tropical ecosystems may be much greater than previously thought.
The report was published on Monday in a big article in the Washington Post, which reports the new findings as hyperalarming. "It's one of the most disturbing articles I've ever read," David Wagner, an entomologist at the University of Connecticut, told the paper, citing him as an independent expert.
Insect extinctions also affect Europe. "In our country, the decline is also of the order," points out Lukáš Čížek of the Academy of Sciences' Entomological Institute. But in addition to climate change, it is also necessary to take into account landscape changes that play an essential role in Europe. "In our country it just runs for a significantly longer time than in Puerto Rico," adds Čížek, explaining why scientists could measure such a rapid decline in the forest compared to the 1970s.
French Oscar nominee Les Misérables opens the Be2Can show
The Golden Bear and the two Actor Award winners from this year's Berlinale, the Director's Award and the Jury Prize from Cannes and much more will present the 6th edition of the festival film from Berlin, Venice and Cannes. This year, the Be2Can festival will bring a selection of the most remarkable and stimulating presented by the competitions of three major European film festivals.

The film is a French Oscar nominee. The premiere of the film in Prague will be personally presented by the representatives of the two main roles of the police officers of the criminal unit, actors Alexis Manenti and Djibril Zonga. Alexis Manenti is also the co-author of the script of the film.
Be2Can will take place this year in Prague's Lucerna and Edison Filmhub cinemas, as well as in Brno (Art cinema), Ostrava (Minikino) and in Zlín (Golden Apple Cinema) from 2 to 8 October.

It won the Best Film and Best Screenplay Awards at the Durban IFF, was also shown at the IFF in Zurich, Shanghai, Munich, Melbourne, Sarajevo and will soon be shown in San Sebastián as well.
But within the festival, audiences can also look forward to the films Synonyms, Young Ahmed, Intruder of the System, Goodbye, My Son, Sorry, we missed you, Ghost City Anthology and At the Golden Glove. But they can also look forward to other fresh news from this year's Venice, which will be heading to Czech distribution: sci-fi Ad Astra, Joker, the Czech triumph of the Painted Bird.

Police union president Štěpánek resigns, wants to live as a free man
The chairman of the Independent Police Union, Milan Štěpánek, has decided to leave his post. Czech Radio - Radiožurnál reported on Friday. Štěpánek has led the union since 2005. He will be the union president for two more months. He will remain with the police even after leaving the head of the union.
"I can confirm that I handed over my written resignation to the Bureau this week, after which I will continue to perform my full duties for two more months," Štěpánek told Radiožurnál. "I have decided as a free man who does not want to be tied to the union forever. And who wants to live a quieter life," he said.
The Independent Police of the Czech Republic union brings together members and employees of the security forces or employees of the Ministry of the Interior. Among other things, the union participated in police protests against budget cuts or petitions for better conditions for the security forces. It also got into a dispute with the then Interior Minister Radek John in 2011 and organized a petition for his resignation. The leadership of the ruling coalition later agreed on John's departure.
Healthcare salaries will increase by a maximum of five percent next year.
A larger increase is unrealistic, according to Vojtěch
Healthcare salaries could increase by a maximum of five percent next year, said Health Minister Adam Vojtěch (for ANO) in Václav Moravec's Questions on Czech Television.
He considers the demand of trade unionists for an increase of up to 15 percent unrealistic.
He also said that the state should try to be self-sufficient in providing protective equipment.
Hospitals now have their supplies, he said.
"I think the increase (in salaries) can be somewhere up to five percent," said the minister.
According to him, it is necessary to reflect the current situation, when the coronavirus pandemic and government regulations against its spread intervened in the collection of insurance premiums from March.
Insurance companies' incomes fell at the time.
"A 15 percent increase seems unrealistic to me at the moment," said Vojtěch.
The average monthly earnings of doctors in acute inpatient care according to data from the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (IHIS) are likely to reach 88,312 crowns this year, nurses 47,498 crowns.
The difference between the salaries of nurses in state hospitals and those of other founders will be as high as CZK 7,000.
The IHIS data also show that the decline of nurses in hospitals has stopped.
The average wage in the Czech Republic was CZK 34,125 in 2019, according to data from the Czech Statistical Office.
Trade union representatives said in June that they would demand a minimum increase of ten percent for 2021, ideally 15 percent.
They criticize the long-term significant difference between the earnings of doctors and nurses in state hospitals, which have to follow pay scales, and contractual salaries in hospitals of cities, regions or private ones.
They also demand, therefore, that the pay scales be uniform for health workers.
For nurses this year, the difference will be as high as CZK 7,000 per month.
For example, for doctors, wages grew faster than salaries last year.
According to the president of the Czech Dental Chamber, Roman Šmucler, trade unionists should perceive how the state is currently doing.
The House recently approved an increase in this year's state budget deficit to a record 500 billion crowns due to the effects of the covid epidemic, of which 1.75 billion is to go towards the remuneration of health workers in hospitals and social services.
According to Šmucler, the Board of Health Care Providers does not agree with the across-the-board salary increases next year.
According to him, the remuneration should be decided by the hospitals themselves and the medical facilities, and the extra money should go to them via a reimbursement decree.
Vojtěch also said that hospitals currently have enough protective equipment.
The chairman of the Administration of State Material Reserves (SSHR), Pavel Švagr, said this week that the administration currently does not have a single protective medical device in its possession.
It is waiting for the tenders to be completed.
According to Vojtěch, suppliers in the world are now able to deliver goods better than in March, when they were bought out.
The state should also try to be as self-sufficient as possible and buy from Czech companies as well.
Petra Černocká changed her image and did well! She got younger in her blonde hair
The film Saxana Petra Černocká (69) looks absolutely fantastic for her age. Although she will celebrate her life's anniversary in November, she has never looked like a pensioner. And now she has helped to do it. She changed her image until her colleagues didn't recognize her.
The actress Petra Černocká never looked like a typical grandmother who had grey-streaked hair, wore sedentary things and went out sporadically. She always took care of herself and the older she gets, the more she can relax in looking at her image.
Fortunately, she hasn't succumbed to the trend of plastic surgery and is taking care of her skin with good old-fashioned indulone. And her anti-wrinkle formula is paying off. But now she has changed her hair color and completely seen through.
When she came to a social event where celebrities were saying goodbye to summer, no one could recognize Petra. Not only was her hair lighter and shorter, but she was also dressed in a yellow jacket that made her even more radiant.
Ladies should learn from Saxana how not to underestimate themselves, that even at the age of seventy, they can take risks with their looks. And it's paid off for Petra, who looks no more than fifty.
Lucie Bílá's father was not a fan at all. You won't believe what she was supposed to do for a living!
Who doesn't know that national treasure Lucie Bílá (53) is an original seamstress by her own name Hana Zaňáková, she probably doesn't live in the Czech Republic. But the singer herself has now revealed that she almost worked in a glass factory!
Lucie Bílá knew from a relatively young age that she wanted to be a singer. Her love for singing was born when she was a little girl performing at a cultural house in her native Otvovice, where the warbler still lives.
"And I remember exactly where my mother sat. A singer was born in me at that time," she admitted to Impuls radio.
But her father was a little worried about his daughter's future and recommended that she take the path of a craft that has a golden bottom.
"My father always said: 'Craft girl, craft. Walk on the ground!' He even talked me into going to the local glass factory. The glass factory doesn't work anymore, I pretty much do. I'm a trained seamstress and I make beads at home into various rosaries and pendants, which I then auction at auctions and buy wheelchairs with money," she added with a laugh.
The Děčín Zoo rejoices in a small macaque
"Our group currently consists of seven members. Its youngest member came into the world on August 17, gave birth to a female Buffy and is her fifth cub, the father being a male Hitam. For the first days after the birth, the female carried the cub tightly to her body and for a long time she did not want to show the world if she gave birth to a male or a female. However, at about three weeks of age the cub has already started to put it away for a little while and the keepers have known for a few days that it is a male," said zoo spokesperson Alena Houšková, adding that the Děčín Zoo has successfully bred already 12 cubs of this species.
Crested macaques are so-called endemites of the island of Sulawesi, which means that they do not live in the wild elsewhere in the world. A typical feature is the black fur and the crest on their head, according to which they are named. Crested macaques live in rain forests, mainly at lower altitudes.
They feed on plant and animal food like most primates. The diet is very much dominated by jungle tree fruits, which supplement flowers and leaves. They solve the need for protein by eating small arthropods, larvae and, to a lesser extent, bird eggs and chicks.
"Apart from natural enemies, which are pythons, everything else is written down by man. The locals hunt macaques as a favourite prey with tasty meat and for fur. Burning and cutting down the rainforest is fatal for these animals," the spokesperson added.
The unexplained death of a little girl (†8) in Příbramsko: No punishment for the culprit
Unexplained cases are called "monuments" in the criminal slang. But they are also investigated if new information emerges years later. Especially when it comes to the death of a child. In 1980, criminalist Jiří Markovič was able to investigate the murder of two girls in Prague's Prokop Valley, which was 12 years old at the time. "The case from 1955? That will be difficult, very difficult. It would take a file to start with, it may no longer exist, to talk to those who investigated it. There is always hope, but it would be really difficult," says Markovič.
Under the previous regime, violent crimes were not widely publicized by the public, but according to Markovič, this certainly does not mean that investigations were lax. "It has always depended on specific people," thinks the criminalist. The problem may be that materials from the 1950s can be destroyed, even if unfinished cases should not be shredded.
The scrubbing smart quarantine could be taken over by soldiers.
We are ready, they say
"The smart quarantine is working, there is something to improve of course.
We will discuss it with the army tonight.
The army is working perfectly and the question is whether they should run the whole thing again," the Prime Minister said on Sunday in his Facebook program "Hi people."
He said it was not possible to sufficiently connect IT systems and sanitation stations, which gradually have to move to more modern methods of operation.
The problems were in the Moravian-Silesian region, where there are some of the current outbreaks of the epidemic, according to the Prime Minister.
Defence Ministry spokesperson Jan Pejšek told ČTK that he did not have information about Sunday's meeting and that the government should discuss the matter on Monday.
The army is ready for this step, he says.
The smart quarantine project was taken over by the Ministry of Health on 25 May.
Until then, the smart quarantine was led by a 90-member central management team set up under the army as an advisory body to the government, led by former Deputy Minister Roman Prymula.
The grinding project was criticized by Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) on Sunday.
He, too, suggested that the army could take over again.
The government's IT and digitalization commissioner Vladimír Dzurilla, who is in charge of the project, previously admitted shortcomings in the project.
"The system works, but it's still being worked on.
For 20 years it was created independently and non-systemically, now we're trying to unify it within a few months.
It's not going at a gallop.
People on the march, poor people on the sanitation system on the march are adapting the new systems and catching up the errors," he said.
The Mayor of Ostrava, Macura, will not run again because he does not want to "go crazy in politics"
The current Mayor of Ostrava, Tomáš Macura (ANO), will not run in the next municipal elections.
The reason is to "not go crazy in politics," he told Respekt.cz.
Macura, who is also a member of the ANO movement's Bureau, has been the Mayor of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the 2018 municipal elections, the ANO candidate led by him won almost a third of the electoral votes in Ostrava.
Macura originally wanted to be in office for only four years.
"I told myself that I would last one term and with the experience of business I could turn everything around and get it back on its feet," he told Respekt.
He added that he had been persuaded to a certain extent for a second term.
"But for me it's the maximum.
I don't want to go crazy in politics," added Macura, who in an interview described himself as a heavy introvert who did not like frequent contact with people.
According to Respekt, there has been speculation about Macura's possible end in the ANO movement for some time.
The server recalls that Macura has criticized the ANO movement several times, for example for its alliance with the SPD movement or for supporting Miloš Zeman in the presidential elections.
As one of the few ANO figures, he supported Zeman's opponent Jiří Drahoš in the elections.
Macura does not plan to leave the ANO movement, which he joined in 2017.
"As long as I have the feeling that I can make a difference in the movement, that it is not a completely futile fight and that no one is interfering with me, I have no immediate motive to quit," he told Respektu.
The 56-year-old Macura graduated from the University of Economics in Prague.
Before he became Mayor of Ostrava in 2014, Macura served, among other things, as director of the pharmaceutical company Walmark.
He also sat on the bodies of other companies.
Uber will return to Brno offering transport services
Uber, a company offering transport services, will return to Brno at the end of July.
This is the result of a change in the law, Brno's transport councillor Petr Kratochvíl (ODS) said in a press statement on Thursday.
Cab drivers protested against Uber in Brno, pointing out that Uber does not meet the conditions such as a designation as a taxi or a taximeter.
However, the change in the law changed the conditions for operating regular and alternative taxis from July.
Kratochvíl has had several meetings with representatives of Uber in recent weeks.
"On the basis of these meetings, the company decided to return to Brno with its services at the end of July this year.
This step is the result of a change in the law that allows the company to legally operate.
The city has been notified of this change and we believe that the company will operate its services within the given limits," said Kratochvíl.
Uber has operated in Brno in the past.
It has been protested by taxi drivers for not marking vehicles as taxis or missing taximeters.
The court issued a preliminary injunction that banned Uber from driving in the city.
Brno initially supported taxi drivers, but Mayor Markéta Vaňková (ODS) said at the end of last year that the city would like to take steps to make Uber work in Brno.
According to later court decisions, Uber could have ridden in Brno, but the company did not take advantage of this.
It will now return on the basis of a change in the law.
Since July, it has become easier to operate a transport service ordered and paid for exclusively via mobile apps in addition to classic taxis with a flashlight and taximeter.
An overexuberant celebration in Brno: a flying chair landed a meter from a person on the sidewalk
An office chair flew from the fourth floor of an apartment building on Saturday evening in Brno and landed about a meter from the sidewalk.
A pedestrian was following him at that moment and immediately called for officers.
Immediately after arriving at the address in the western part of the city, the patrol noticed an open window with a chair still lying under it and several cans and cigarette butts beside it.
"The noise from the room on the fourth floor indicated that a rather noisy celebration was taking place inside.
The officers came out along the corridor to the apartment and asked the three young men present, aged between twenty-six and twenty-nine, for an explanation," said a spokesperson for the officers, Jakub Ghanem.
Young Czechs think they are good with money. Survey does not confirm this
"So it turns out that young Czechs have somewhat more confidence in their knowledge of finance than is the reality. In this case, women and respondents without a high school diploma had a significantly greater share of the wrong answers," said KRUK director Jaroslava Palendalová.
Men and young high school or university students are more likely to believe in their knowledge of financial products.
Young Czechs learn the most about the functioning of financial matters from their parents (37 percent), by self-study on the Internet (23 percent) and only in the third row from teaching at school (21 percent).
Women are the main ones who consult with their parents about financial issues, while men are the ones who look for information on the Internet. Getting information about finances from their parents predominates at all ages of young people, regardless of their educational attainment or personal income. Prospects from financial institutions, professional magazines and publications have practically minimal influence.
"Once again, the importance of raising children by their parents, who represent the authority in all major areas of life, is becoming apparent. This is why the level of financial literacy of parents, who pass on their knowledge and experience to their offspring, is crucial," said Palendalová.
Savings and investments are preferred by 94 percent of young people.
Clearly, young people are on the question of whether it is better to save and buy, for example, your own house or flat, or to enjoy and spend money, without savings and own housing.
The strategy of saving and investing in long-term tangible assets is followed by 94 percent of respondents. This is true across all age categories of young people, regardless of their educational attainment, social status or current level of personal income.
The strategy of saving is then 100 percent espoused by people married with two or more children and employees in the public sector. Instead, people living alone and with an income of more than CZK 30,000 per month are more likely to enjoy themselves.
Strict but fair, the hours are fun! That's how the Benešov grammar school students see their favourite teacher, the writer
Humanism should be present in every good book, Pavel Hoza believes. The secondary school teacher of Czech and history is at the same time a poet, a prosaic and a waker of literary life in a small town.
Bohuslav Reynek comes to mind above Pavel Hoza's lyrics. His poetry, his paintings. Bare trees, whitish country houses, quivering grass, shepherds, sheep and goats, old roads and people who have been following them for centuries. Mourning, cursing, blessing. This Reynek contemporary follower teaches Czech, literature and history at the grammar school in Benešov, runs the equivalent of Prague's Viola at the Café for a Word, and organizes the Benešov literary festival every year.
Demand to dismiss Rafaj will be discussed by Babiš with ČSSD
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO) plans to discuss with the coalition Social Democrats on Monday the demand for a proposal to dismiss the head of the Antimonopoly Office (ÚOHS), Petr Rafaj.
Rafaj has been called for by non-profit organizations at the meeting of the anti-corruption council of the government, as well as by the Ústí Region.
The Social Democrats state that an exchange at the head of the office is in order.
According to information from ČTK, Rafaj has not been invited to the Office of the Government for Monday.
His second mandate will expire in the middle of next year, according to the law he cannot be appointed for a third time.
His dismissal is in the competence of President Miloš Zeman.
In addition to the appeal by the non-profit organizations, the Prime Minister also received a letter with a similar request from the Ústí Region.
The reason is supposed to be among other things Rafaj's recent cases.
Last week, the Prime Minister refused to comment on the demand, saying that he would get acquainted with the materials and the governing parties would take "some position" on it.
He also said that he has not yet discussed the calls with the President, and he does not have a meeting with him arranged anytime soon.
According to the DOC's statement on the appeal, there is no reason, because Rafaj has not been accused of anything.
Last week, the IHNED.cz and Aktuálně.cz news servers wrote that the police were interested in Rafaj's meetings with the Governor Jiří Čunek.
The meetings were connected, among other things, with the decision-making on the competition for the controversial new Zlín hospital project worth eight billion, which Čunek is pushing hard.
Čunek admitted the meetings, saying they jointly addressed his "Senate activities."
Rafaj speaks similarly.
The Ústí Region Council called on the government to dismiss Rafaj at the end of June.
It is also asking for a reform of the office's decision-making mechanisms.
The DOC's decision-making on public contracts, according to the Deputy Governor for Transport Jaroslav Komínek, is not transparent and has signs of arbitrariness.
Last March, the police intervened at the antitrust office over a toll-collection tender.
In June this year, the Aktuálně.cz news server pointed out that Rafaj was using apartments written to the firm of the influential ČSSD backroom player Alexander Čuba.
However, a deposit of 3.5 million for an apartment in Brno was paid from Rafaj's account.
Rafaj has been the chairman of the Office for the Protection of Competition since 9 July 2009, and he appointed the former Social Democrat MP for a second term in June 2015.
In less than a year, Rafaj's second six-year mandate will expire.
The Act on the Antitrust Office states that the president may dismiss the chairman of the office on a proposal from the government.
He can be dismissed only if he has not been in office for more than six months, or if he seriously undermines the dignity of his office or the independence and impartiality of the office.

Employees collapsed in the Blansko library in the heat.
Air conditioning will help
The new technology will cost 740,000 and will be operational in the second half of August.
"It's good news for me.
With three children, we go to the library in Blansko city centre regularly.
In the warm months, however, it was practically impossible to stay there.
It was terribly hot and the air was bad.
The ventilation didn't help.
That's why I'm glad for the air conditioning," said Petr Novotný, one of Blansko's readers.
According to the director of the library, Lukáš Dlapa, the temperatures in the building often climbed to over thirty degrees.
The south wall of the building is glazed and functions as a greenhouse on sunny days.
"In addition, the sun shines into it for a large part of the day thanks to the curvature of the building.
At the same time, it's a big problem to air out the individual departments, because the windows have to be closed during the night for safety reasons.
Often, we have to reach thirty degrees since morning in the library," said Dlapa.
The worst was the study and reading room on the third floor.
And on the floor above, the exhibition rooms and the director's office.
There was also an unpleasant climate in the children's department, which is located under the roof of the building.
"Several times, librarians collapsed at work and ended up on sick leave.
The problem also regularly occurred in the culture room at lectures attended by dozens of people.
After a few minutes, it was impossible to breathe there," said Dlapa.
Originally, the city representatives wanted to make air-conditioning in all areas of the library this year.
In the end, there will be only three circuits out of five.
"Because of the limited funding, only the most problematic areas will have air-conditioning.
The study and reading room on the third floor.
Then there will be the culture room and the children's department on the floor above," said Jiří Svoboda from the Blansko Investment Department.
He added that in the first phase, the workers had installed air-conditioning in the above-mentioned areas last autumn and had modified the wiring.
It cost approximately CZK 360,000.
The Blansko Municipal Library has nearly three thousand registered readers.
Of these, there are about nine hundred within fifteen years.

Chicago prop banishes coronavirus.
Crawford gets back in the game
Not every infected athlete comes out with the truth.
Especially when it comes to NHL players, who remain silent as the grave about the players' health and make no public announcement.
One of the few to step out of the lineup was Crawford.
The 35-year-old Montreal native was only present for the first practice session, and has been absent from the lineup ever since.
"I'd like to let you all know that I tested positive for Covid-19 and that's why I've spent the last fortnight cooped up in my house," he said, revealing the reason for his absence.
Fans no longer have to worry about his health.
Crawford is ready to throw himself back into a full workload.
"It's amazing to be back.
I'm going to do everything I can to get in shape as soon as possible," he said.
The veteran goaltender won two Stanley Cups with Chicago, a solid part of the goaltending for the tenth consecutive season.
The Blackhawks face St. Louis in the preseason before facing Edmonton in the preseason.

Thousands protest against PM in Israel
Thousands of Israelis in several parts of the country protested against unemployment, corruption, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's handling of the coronavirus crisis.
The rallies took place outside Netanyahu's private villa in Caesarea, near his official residence, or in a park in Tel Aviv.
Protests have been taking place regularly in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv for weeks.
Participants are demanding the resignation of Netanyahu over the trial in which he is accused of corruption and fraud, as well as the government's handling of the next wave of the coronavirus epidemic.
"Bibi, go home," one demonstrator wrote on his banner, according to the AP, referring to Netanyahu's well-known nickname.
"Everyone can see that the emperor has lost his clothes," another read.
The 70-year-old Netanyahu is the first prime minister of Israel to be tried in office.
He is accused on three counts of corruption, fraud, and abuse of trust.
He denies all the charges, calling them a witch hunt.
According to local media, the trial may take up to three years, with over 300 witnesses called.
The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has been confirmed in nearly 60,500 people in Israel, which has a population of about nine million.
About 455 people have died in connection with the outbreak.
In March, the Israeli government imposed quarantine measures that helped reduce the daily increase in infections.
But after a gradual loosening of restrictions since late April, the numbers of infections began to rise again significantly, especially in late June.
Netanyahu's critics argue that the government has not sufficiently helped, for example, business owners affected by the quarantine measures.
Protesters are also annoyed that the government is issuing sometimes contradictory instructions to combat the coronavirus.
Stand down, Czernin called Schiller for saying opposition filth
"I find it completely unacceptable that a member of the Czech government anywhere, still less on the floor of the parliament, should use such totalitarian expression," Czernin wrote in an open letter to Schiller.
Her words caused a stir when the constitutional lawsuit against President Miloš Zeman was discussed. The opposition did not get enough votes and the constitutional lawsuit that the Senate came up with was thrown off the table.
"I get dozens of messages from people I don't know. There is not a single vote in support of this lawsuit. There are messages in support of the president and messages like how taxpayers' money is being spent here, how empty straws are being beaten. And I even dare, I don't use hard words, to quote one of them: It's opposition and senatorial filth," the finance minister said.
"With these words, the Nazis used citizens of Jewish origin and the Communists used to call their political opponents. It's totalitarian rhetoric, with no respect for man and opinion," TOP 09 Vice-President Czernin wrote to the minister, who will compete for the post of party chairman with the previous first vice-chairwoman, Markéta Pekarová Adamová, in the autumn.
"I was quoting one of many messages that I received dozens of during the House proceedings. Their common denominator was disgust at the constant personal defamation that we witness in domestic politics on a daily basis, which was also the main motive for Thursday's House proceedings. The fact that someone refers to themselves surprises me," Schiller responded to ČTK.
The driver smashed the car into a tree and was killed.
The body had to be cut out of the wreckage by firefighters
The tragic accident occurred around 11 p.m. near Neveklov on a narrow road leading from the Slap Dam.
The driver apparently flew down into the woods at no small speed and smashed the car into a tree.
He was killed at the scene.
The body had to be removed from the wreckage by firefighters, among other things cutting off the roof.
The circumstances of the crash are being examined by police officers.
They have ordered a forensic autopsy to clarify, among other things, whether the man was driving under the influence of alcohol or other addictive substances.
No more wasting and churning out one collection after another.
Pietro Filipi cancels discounts and bets on sustainability
The Czech clothing brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and is embarking on a fundamental change in strategy.
It cancels discounts and no longer wants to churn out one collection after another.
The fact that the fashion industry is among the biggest polluters of the environment is not news.
Billions of items of clothing end up in incinerators and landfills every year.
However, the view of slow fashion, the often despised approach to dressing, has changed quite quickly in recent years.
Approximately half of Pietro Filipi's goods were sold at full price.
The other half, which was sold thanks to discounts, is not so easy to buy.
The company does not want to churn out one collection after another and at the end of each season to discount products below their production price.
Moreover, according to the owner Michal Mička, the time of new and old collections and the blind following of rapidly changing fashion trends is over.
"Most retailers already count on discounts when buying goods, so a much higher margin is included in the full price.
So it's actually a bit of a fraud," says Pietro Filipi owner Michal Mička.
In addition, the company wants to support local business with its approach.
"Each of our products is made of carefully selected quality fabrics and designed by local designers.
We place emphasis on the fact that a large part of our collection is made up of so-called basic pieces - i.e. clothes that are timeless and over-seasonal.
Globally, the segment of premium brands is typical of the absence of any discounts, the price of the product simply corresponds to its quality and there is no need for a discount," adds Mička.
Giant graffiti depicts RAF airman Kurt Taussig
"The assignment was to create something for the anniversary of the end of the war.
And I remembered our fighter pilot, who fought in the ranks of the British Royal Air Force in the Second World War.
The city leadership liked the design," said Vacek, who finished his work after a fortnight of intensive work.
He used about 300 litres of paint and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplice-Shanov.
He left the city when he was 15 years old.
During the war, because of his Jewish background, the Nazis dragged him to an internment camp, where he was held for several weeks.
However, he and his brother managed to avoid the concentration camp thanks to the organization of Nicholas Winton.
In 1939, Taussig made it to Great Britain, where he volunteered for the Royal Air Force (RAF), and eventually received pilot training in African Southern Rhodesia and Palestine.
He became involved in combat operations in early 1945.
After the Velvet Revolution, he visited the Czech Republic and his native Teplice several times, which granted him honorary citizenship.
The 46-year-old Kamil Vacek, known to people in the field of street graphic art as Camo, has been working with spray paint in the streets of Teplice for over 20 years.
He started with graffiti on areas set aside for this purpose by then-Mayor Jaroslav Kubera (ODS).
Sparta is really charged this year, acknowledges Hradec bek Nedomlel
In his case, the increased motivation is more than understandable. Hradec hockey defender Richard Nedomlel will go in Friday's match against the club where he recently worked. But the former Spartan is convinced that his teammates will be similarly affected, even though they have never worn the jersey of the Prague club.
"Everyone wants to pull out against Sparta," says Hradec bek before the game of the 5th extra-league round.
Hradec Králové will try to stretch their winning streak, which at the moment counts three three-point wins in a row. After Kladno, Plzeň came the most appreciated by fans on Sunday, Mountfield went to neighboring Pardubice.
"But we can't watch the games that were. We need to focus on the matches that await us now and play in them the same way, if not better," warns Hradec defender.
Hradec shouldn't look back on last year's record with Sparta either. They lost in three of their four matches, taking points only once after the victory in Prague after extra time. In addition, Sparta's management brought in several significant reinforcements in the summer and expects the team to return to the top.
"Sparta has always had quality players, but what can we say, they are really charged this year," admits Nedomlel before the first match of the end of this week.
And the second one? Also a nice shift, waiting for Mountfield on Sunday afternoon in Třinec.
XXX Lutz can buy competitor Kika, the authority has approved. But there is a catch
"The Competition Protection Authority has authorised the merger of competitors - XLCEE-Holding GmbH on the one hand, and Kika Nábytek and Lambda Properties Czechia on the other hand - under the condition of fulfilling structural commitments set in favour of maintaining effective competition," said Martin Švanda, spokesperson for the Office for the Protection of Competition.
In addition to the XXX Lutz chain, XLCEE- Holding owns the Möbelix stores. If the Kika chain were also absorbed, it would occupy too large a part of the Czech furniture and accessories market. Therefore, it has to sell off part of the purchased company.
XLCEE-Holding also buys Kika branches in other countries where the chain operates, i.e. Hungary, Slovakia and Romania. The transaction must also be authorised by the antitrust authorities. The purchase of 22 foreign branches of the Kika chain from Signa was announced by XXX Lutz in May. Signa took over the failing Kika last year for a symbolic price.
The Kika chain entered the Czech market in 2005 and is second only to the Swedish firm IKEA. Before it was taken over by the Austrian company Signa, it had belonged to the South African firm Steinhoff International Holdings since 2013. The latter faced problems when it revealed inconsistencies in its accounts. Kika has nine outlets in the Czech Republic.
XXX Lutz has been operating in the Czech Republic since 2010. Alongside IKEA, Sconto, Jysk or Asko-Nábytek and Kika, it is one of the largest furniture retailers on the domestic market. The Möbelix brand has the same owner. After taking over Kika's foreign branches, XXX Lutz will operate over 300 department stores in 12 countries. According to the company's website, its annual turnover is 4.4 billion euros (about 114 billion CZK).
Storm Hanna reaches Texas coast
Hurricane Hanna reached the southwest coast of the U.S. state of Texas on Saturday afternoon, local time (before midnight GMT last night).
It hit Padre Island, Texas, about 24 kilometers north of the town of Port Mansfield, weakening to a tropical storm as it moved over land.
However, according to meteorologists, it still poses a major threat to coastal residents.
It has brought strong winds and heavy rainfall; along with local flooding, power outages and various material damage are reported, including damaged boats, according to the AP.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott already declared a state of natural disaster for 32 counties in southwestern Texas on Saturday and advised people to evacuate voluntarily.
The strongest warnings were received by people from the coastal strip between Port Mansfield and Mesquite Bay, but in total the storm is expected to hit an area of nearly 500 kilometers before moving gradually over northeastern Mexico.
"Although Hanna is now a tropical storm, heavy rain and winds, rising levels, dangerous surf and isolated tornadoes may pose a threat," warned the US National Hurricane Center (NHC).
This morning, local time (GMT afternoon), the storm was moving along the US-Mexico border, accompanied by winds of 85 kilometers per hour.
Hanna became the first hurricane of this year's Atlantic hurricane season on Saturday.
Winds of up to 145 kilometers per hour were accompanied by winds over the Gulf of Mexico, but gradually weakened to 112 kilometers per hour as it made landfall, once again removing Hanna from the hurricane category.
Authorities urged local residents to wait out the storm at home, not forgetting sanitary measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
Texas is one of the US states most affected by the covid-19 pandemic.
With existing security measures and the need to keep a distance, potential evacuations are also a major challenge.
Temporary shelters have been opened in hotels, schools, and gyms.
In Hidalgo County, Texas, one of the buildings has also been adapted as a shelter for evacuees who tested positive for the coronavirus or were otherwise exposed to the disease.
Local authorities have urged all evacuees to bring masks and disinfectant gels to the shelter if possible.
"It's not even close to being over yet.
We're expecting catastrophic flooding," the AP quoted Chris Birchfield, who works for the National Weather Service (NWS) service in Brownsville, as saying.
Forecasts say some places could get as much as 300 millimeters of rain in a few hours, in some cases close to 500 millimeters, which, together with sea level surges, could flood a number of coastal communities.
Toyota still believes in hydrogen, preparing a second generation Mirai
The Toyota Mirai was never meant to be just a concept. Toyota was so serious about it that even though there was virtually no infrastructure in the world to pump hydrogen, it still put it on the menu. Not a standard one, the customer really had to go after this car in a targeted way, but no one else offered such a variant at the time.
Toyota boss Takeshi Uchiyamada confirmed at an international conference on hydrogen that a new generation will arrive next year. Toyota still believes that these cars have a future and within ten years they will match the price of hybrids. Of course, this is linked to the development of petrol networks. But the future is connected with hydrogen as much as with electricity.
At the conference, the word hydrogen was often used to refer to the needs of ecological operation not of passenger cars but on the contrary of large tractors, ships, trains, etc. Simply those means of transport that need to cover long distances in one refuel. Purely battery-powered versions cannot offer that. Toyota could thus find new outlets thanks to its great experience and long development.
It remains to be remembered that, like Toyota, Hyundai, which now also offers the Nexo hydrogen crossover, believes in hydrogen propulsion.

Zeman to bestow general's rank on Colonel Lipka
President Miloš Zeman will bestow the general's rank on Colonel Pavel Lipka on Wednesday.
This follows from an overview of the expected events of the Ministry of Defence.
The reason for bestowing the rank of brigadier general is the August arrival of Lipka as deputy commander of the Alliance Multinational North-East Division in Poland.
Lipka still serves as deputy commander of the Czech Army's ground forces.
Promotion to Zeman was proposed by the government at the end of June.
Lipka will replace brigadier general Karel Řehka as deputy commander of the Multinational North-East Division in Elblag, Poland, which commands units of the Alliance Forward Presence on the territory of Poland and the Baltics, from the beginning of August.
Řehka became director of the National Office for Cyber and Information Security (NÚKIB) in March.
The government proposed to the president that he bestow the rank of brigadier general on Lipka.
According to the Act on Professional Soldiers, a higher rank can be granted to a soldier for the period of performance of an elected office or for the period of performance of a service task that requires the granting of a higher rank.
The post of Deputy Commander of the Allied Division corresponds to the rank of General.
A soldier who has been granted the rank has the same rights and obligations as if he had been appointed to that rank.
However, he is not entitled to an adjustment of the salary that would correspond to that rank.
The granting of the rank lasts until the reason for which it was granted ceases to exist.
"Colonel Lipka demonstrates high professional readiness and is a model for subordinates.
He is significantly involved in the fulfilment of tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic, including cooperation with foreign partners and ensuring the participation of the army in foreign operations," the Ministry of Defence said in June on the proposal for promotion.
Wednesday's promotion will take place at 12:30 at Prague Castle, attended by Minister of Defence Lubomír Metnar or Chief of General Staff Aleš Opata.
A technically perfect mix-up with a weak script. Gemini with Will Smith doesn't impress critics
The dystopian sci-fi spectacle Gemini Man boasts an interesting premise - Will Smith confronts his younger version in the film. But critics say the story is the weakest part of the film. The film hits Czech cinemas on 10 October.
Henry Brogan (Will Smith) is a top man in his field. He kills efficiently and without question. But one day he decides to hang up his career. This is understandably not to the liking of his employers, who send another assassin after Henry. The catch is that the assassin is Henry himself, more specifically his younger clone made of DNA. Can one determined man win the fight over himself? Literally this time.
Three-time Oscar winner Ang Lee was supposed to be a guarantee of quality. This is his first sci-fi, but he has extensive experience with dramatic action films, as he did in the aforementioned Tiger and the Dragon or the Western Ride with the Devil. Six writers collaborated on the script. The most famous is surely David Benioff, one of the creators of the highly successful Game of Thrones. But according to early reviews, all of this wasn't enough for a good film.
"Even though Ang Lee is trying to do great things in technical filmmaking, the film itself doesn't have the character to elevate it," thinks Fionnuala Hannigan of Screen Daily.
"This disappointing film is less than the sum of all the talents involved. The weak script and plot are held together only by the technological magic of the filmmakers," summed up Stephen Dalton of The Hollywood Reporter.
"Gemini is a case in which a huge amount of work has resulted in an incredibly uniquely action film," Variety reviewer Peter Deburge says.
"A confused product from a bizarre idea," Ella Kemp of IndieWire summed up the film in her review.
"It's hard to care that one man is another's double when neither man is behaving like a man," wrote Nicholas Barber of The Wrap.

Hundreds of enslaved children freed from religious school in Nigeria
According to the BBC, there were nearly five hundred men and boys there, Reuters reported, citing the police commissioner, that there were over three hundred children from the age of five upwards. Some were chained together, others were chained to iron rings in the wall.
Kaduna Police Chief Ali Janga told the BBC that the raid on the school was based on a tip-off. He described the school as a house of horrors. Starving people were held there by force, tortured and sexually abused. They could not leave, there was razor wire above the walls. He said it was a case of slavery.
Several people were detained during the raid, according to police spokesman Jakubu Sabo, who was a teacher there.
The children told police that they were taken to the school by parents or relatives, saying it was a religious school. "We have identified two children who come from Burkina Faso, but most of them were brought here by parents from Nigerian states in the north," said Sabo's spokesman on the identity of the victims. Nigerian states in the north of the country are predominantly Muslim.
Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal's school was posing as a religious school focused on the study of the Koran.
Those freed were taken to a stadium where they are provided with help and food. Some have already met relatives.
The fastest man on the planet has missed his tests. I don't take anything, he fights back
The traditionally high-profile race for the fastest man on the planet will be the hunt for defending silver champion Christian Coleman at the World Championships. The 23-year-old American is the world leader with a time of 9.81 seconds and has lost only once this year. But his start at the peak of the season was in jeopardy due to a case of missed doping tests.
The United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) closed his case in early September without filing charges for formal reasons. Although Coleman failed three doping tests last year and this year, not in 12 months. His first offense was backdated by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to April 1, 2018, the start of the second quarter, but he missed the test itself on June 6. And because the third omission occurred on April 29, 2019, Coleman did not commit a offense in the form of three missed checks in 12 months.
Coleman argued that he only forgot to update the data on the athletes' whereabouts app. "I don't take drugs or anything legal. A lot of athletes use legal creatine or protein powder or other supplements for faster regeneration. And I don't take anything, I work hard and that's what it's all about," he said before the start of the World Championships.
His only defeat in six of this year's 100 was when he entered the season at the Shanghai Diamond League, where he was just six thousandths of a second ahead of compatriot Noah Lyles. He took advantage of Coleman's absence to triumph in the Diamond League final, but will only run the 200 at the World Championships.
On paper, the second fastest competitor is 22-year-old Nigerian Divine Oduduru, with a 9.86, but he has only done so far at American college competitions.
The defending champion will be 37-year-old American Justin Gatlin, who flashed a 9.87 at Stanford in June. He ran the last 100 in Zagreb in only 10.29, however, as he slightly injured his posterior thigh muscle.
South Africa's Akani Simbine, the three-time Olympic medalist from Rio Andre de Grasse and the European champion Zharnel Hughes are also among the favorites. The fastest Jamaican is the 2011 World Champion Yohan Blake with a 9.96 time.
The men's 100 will start on Friday with a round and heats. Semi-finals and finals are on Saturday. The medals will be run at 21:15 GMT.
EU countries have coronavirus standards for aviation
European Union countries have agreed on common hygiene standards for air travel to help limit the spread of the new coronavirus.
German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer made the announcement.
The standards agreed include keeping a distance or wearing masks on planes and at airports, but the middle seats on planes will not have to remain unoccupied.
Reuters reported.
"I am pleased that my colleagues have accepted the German proposal for Europe and that we have been able to agree on these uniform standards," Scheuer said at the European Aviation Conference.
The German Transport Ministry added that the agreement had been concluded by officials and that it had yet to be formally approved by ministers.
The measures agreed include a requirement to cover the mouth and nose for passengers from the age of six, a requirement to keep a recommended distance during security checks and check-in at airports.
Enough fresh air must also be guaranteed on planes, and all information must be available in several languages.
Airlines will also be able to fill the middle seats.
The common regulations agreed upon by officials meet at least some of the airline's requirements.
Different standards have caused confusion.

Soldiers rehearse, draw the curtains. China prepares celebrations at massacre site
The army rehearsed the parade over recent weekends. Shops in central Beijing had to close, and residents near the square were ordered to close the curtains. Military vehicles rolled toward the square on empty streets, and combat aircraft circled in the sky.
Several Chinese told Reuters they were proud that their country would display its military might. But one woman said it was hard to deny that the celebrations would unsettle other nations.
She seemed to be referring to Taiwan, which China claims, and where elections are coming. But they may also be worried in the semi-autonomous city of Hong Kong, where thousands of people have repeatedly demonstrated against China's appointed administrator.
Celebrations are being prepared outside Beijing. The southern Chinese port of Xiamen already put on a special light show on Thursday night. Xiamen lies across from island Taiwan and is one of China's top ten most innovative cities.
Before the anniversary, the list of banned items is growing. It already includes drones, balloons, dragons, alcohol, radios and radio-wave devices, the Guardian pointed out. It added that China's popular social network Weibo erases "damaging political information."
"This is another milestone, another opportunity to show that China's Communist Party remains (at the oar) despite all predictions," said historian Maura Cunningham, who works on China. "This is the moment when the Party can demonstrate order, control and power," she added.
The People's Republic of China was established in 1949 when the Communists under Mao Zedong won a battle with Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists, who retreated to Taiwan.
In the second half of the 1960s, China underwent a disastrous Communist experiment in the form of the so-called Cultural Revolution. In June 1989, the Tiananmen Square regime massacred thousands of pro-democratic protesters, both students and workers, with tanks.
Since the late 1970s, China has increasingly taken over elements of the capitalist economy. According to critics, it is now a mixture of the worst of communism (one-party monopoly and persecution of the opposition) and (Dickensian) capitalism (exploitation of workers).

Germany reports the first case of West Nile infection from a mosquito on its territory. Linked to climate change
In addition to West Nile, mosquitoes can also transmit malaria.
On Friday, Germany reported the first case of a human being infected with West Nile fever on German territory after being stung by an infected mosquito. The DPA news agency reported. Until now, all sick people have contracted the virus while travelling or through contact with sick animals. Experts say the breakthrough case is linked to climate change.
The Robert Koch Institute said the virus was contracted by a 70-year-old man from Saxony. The disease was severe and he was treated for brain inflammation in a hospital in Leipzig. He is now healthy.
The West Nile virus was first detected in 1937 in Uganda. Meanwhile, it spread to large parts of Africa, Asia and Europe, and in the 1990s to the United States. Its carriers are mainly birds, as well as mosquitoes that become infected with their infected blood.

Trump considers deregistering Chinese stocks in the US
US President Donald Trump's administration is considering revoking Chinese firms' permission to trade on stock markets in the United States. An informed source told Reuters today. Such a move would be a radical escalation of trade tensions between the US and China. Shares of the firms in question on the New York Stock Exchange immediately headed down following the news, dragging the entire market down with them.
The withdrawal of the shares would be part of a broader effort to curb US investments in China, the source added. He confirmed a Bloomberg report that had sent financial markets into shock shortly before. Shares of Chinese firms Alibaba Group Holding, JD.com, Pinduoduo, Baidu, Vipshop Holdings, Baozun and IQIYI were down from two to four percent.
According to government data from February, 156 Chinese firms are trading on the US Nasdaq and NYSE stock exchanges. There are also at least 11 state-owned enterprises among them.
Bloomberg pointed out that no precise mechanism has yet been devised to ensure the withdrawal of Chinese companies from the US exchanges. Any plan would have to be approved by Trump, who has given the go-ahead for negotiations on the matter.
China and the US have been engaged in a trade war for more than a year, imposing tariffs on each other. The dispute between the two countries has had negative effects on the world economy and has raised fears of a global recession. Washington is using tariffs to try to get Beijing to change its trade practices and reduce China's trade surplus with the US.
According to CNBC, trade negotiations between the US and China should resume on October 10. It aims to end the trade war.
Former French President Chirac to be buried on Monday, public commemoration on Sunday
The funeral of former French President Jacques Chirac, who died on Thursday at the age of 86, will take place on Monday evening at the Montparnasse cemetery in Paris. French media are reporting the news, citing Chirac's family. The ceremony will be private.
The public will be able to bid farewell to the former head of state on Sunday afternoon at a commemoration ceremony at the Paris Invalides, where the coffin containing Chirac's remains will be on display, the Élysée Palace announced.
Crowds have been pouring into the presidential residence since Thursday evening, according to AFP, to sign a book of condolences. This will be possible until Sunday. On Monday, President Emmanuel Macron declared a state of mourning.
Meanwhile, there have been further reactions from around the world and from France to the death of the former mayor of Paris and president from 1995 to 2007, whom Prime Minister Édouard Philippe today called "a Frenchman in the truest sense of the word."
Chirac was remembered by the Japanese, for example, because the politician was known for his love of their country and the sport of sumo. The news of the death of the former French president appeared on the front pages of all Japanese newspapers, including the sports ones, the French press notes.
The museum of tribal art on Paris's Quai Branly avenue, which Chirac founded, will not charge admission for ten days in honour of the former head of state.
Arctic Spitsbergen set a temperature record, measuring almost 22 degrees
"Longyearbyen set a 41-year-old record," the Norwegian Meteorological Institute said on Twitter.
By early evening, the temperature had risen to 21.7 degrees Celsius, 0.4 degrees above the 1979 record, it added.
The roughly 2,000-strong Longyearbyen is the largest city on Spitsbergen, located about 1,300 kilometres from the North Pole.
Spitsbergen heats up faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This highlights the dangers of warming in other parts of the Arctic - from Alaska to Siberia, according to a report last year by the Norwegian Center for Climate Study.
The average temperature on Spitsbergen has risen by three to five degrees since the 1970s, he said.
It may even rise by ten degrees by 2100, if greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere are not reduced.
Temperature rises on Svalbard can melt permanently frozen soil, threatening the stability of many buildings, roads or airports, and may cause more avalanches and landslides.
Warming climate also threatens Arctic fauna, such as polar bears or seals, which depend on the ocean's ice cover.
Failed Qualification. Czech Athletes Fail to Succeed in Doha
The World Championships in Doha began with qualifying setbacks for Czech athletics. Diana Mezuliáníková fell in the 800-meter heat and neither pole-sitter Romana Maláčová nor hammer-sitter Kateřina Šafránková, who defended the eighth place she had surprised in London the previous year, failed to qualify.
The hurdler Vít Müller will take the heat on Friday and Marcela Joglová will run the night marathon race.
Šafránková threw her third attempt at 65.46 meters and fell nearly six meters short of her best this year, which she would have had to improve in order to advance. Maláčová jumped 435 cm, 450 cm was already beyond her strength. To participate in the final it was necessary to overcome the limit of 460 cm.
Mezuliáníková, who made it to the championships at the last minute thanks to an invitation from the international federation IAAF, finished in the fourth heat in the penultimate sixth place and even the time of 2:03.48 minutes was not enough to advance to the semi-finals. She fell one and a half seconds behind her best this year. "It was quite fast for me, unfortunately I was fighting with my opponent in the turn there, which took away my strength. I felt that I still had my strength, but it slowed me down there. I almost stopped and had to start again, so it was a bit uncomfortable in this one. I can't be completely satisfied," said the Czech representative.
She was happy to overtake at least one opponent in the finish line. "She was really not doing well, so every defeated opponent was good. But I think it was for the fifth place. Unfortunately," she added. The fastest halfback in the heats was Winnie Nanyond from Uganda in 2:00.36.
Missing in Doha is the best eight-player in recent years Caster Semenya from South Africa, who has too high testosterone levels in her body but, like some other runners, refuses the treatment prescribed by IAAF rules from this year.
In the heats in the 100 meters, the number one favourite was confirmed by American Christian Coleman, who with a time of 9.98 was the only one to get under the ten-second limit. His compatriot Justin Gatlin, who at 37 years old is seeking to defend his title, also advanced to the semifinals. Nigerian Divine Oduduru, who is the number two runner in this year's standings with a performance of 9.86, was expected to compete against Coleman, who has a performance of 9.81 this season.
Cuban Juan Miguel Echevarría showed great form already in the long jump qualifying, reaching a distance of 840 cm with his first jump. No athlete has jumped that far in a World Championship qualification in the last 20 years. The 21-year-old Cuban leads this year's standings with a performance of 865 cm.
Berlin responds to public pressure and solves housing crisis Buys 6,000 flats from private firm
Berlin will buy 6,000 former social flats sold by the city 15 years ago from the private Luxembourg firm ADO Properties SA for €920 million (CZK 23.8 billion). It responds to public pressure against skyrocketing rental prices. According to Berlin Senator Katrin Lompscher of the Left Party (Die Linke), this is the largest such buy-out in the history of the German capital. The opposition is critical of the move.
"The intention is to maintain stable rents in Berlin and to give tenants security," Berlin Mayor Michael Müller (SPD) said in a statement. "At the same time, we will continue to build new flats and legally treat the rent freeze," he added. Municipal firm Gewobag will take over the thousands of flats located in the Spandau and Reinickendorf neighborhoods in the western part of the city this December.
According to Jefferies analyst Thomas Rothäusler, the city bought too much. Rothäusler told Bloomberg that he estimated that it overpaid the flats by about ten percent above their book value.
According to the German opposition party, the Liberals (FDP), the Berlin authorities are contributing to property speculation through their actions. The FDP tweeted this on Friday. The Alternative for Germany (AfD) protest party called the move a "waste of money."
Already in mid-July, Gewobag got back 670 flats in Berlin's Karl-Marx-Allee street, Der Spiegel recalled on its website. The price was not published by the council at the time. The dispute over flats on the former exhibition avenue from the GDR era was accompanied by protests and filled the front pages of the German press. It became a symbol of the plight of tenants in Germany's big cities, the paper wrote.
Meanwhile, the German metropolis used to be famous for its low cost of living and low rents. But it has become more attractive in recent years. According to AFP, rental prices have doubled over the past decade, making it difficult for some residents to find affordable housing.
Britons returning from Spain face mandatory two-week quarantine
The British cabinet has also urged citizens to avoid all unnecessary travel to mainland Spain due to the risk of spreading covid-19.
The Canary and Balearic Islands are therefore not mentioned, but even after returning from them, people have to go into isolation for two weeks.
The new rules come into force at midnight.
"Protecting public health is our absolute priority.
We have taken this decision to prevent the possible spread of the virus in Britain," British diplomacy said in its statement.
"We have always made it clear that we will immediately remove a country from the safe list if needed," it added.
As the British newspaper Metro noted, the latest announcement will hit the travel plans of thousands of Britons.
Spain is one of the most popular holiday destinations.
Among other things, Britons are concerned about whether they will be paid sick pay if they have to go into isolation for 14 days after returning from holidays.
For example, Neil Hunter from Sittingbourne has booked a ten-day holiday to Lanzarote, leaving on Tuesday.
The trip has been booked since December.
"We were supposed to go the whole family, my wife Amanda and daughter Bethany, but to be honest, after this announcement I don't know what will happen.
I work as an engineer and I don't think my employer will accept that I will be quarantined for two weeks after returning from holiday," Metro quoted Hunter as saying.
Concerning Spain, there are fears that the country is at the beginning of the second wave of the epidemic.
Over 900 new infections have been added there every 24 hours in the last two days.
Authorities are already tightening coronavirus measures in some areas, for example Catalonia is trying to limit all night life and prevent people from gathering in large numbers.
The Czech Foreign Ministry has newly drawn attention to the increased risk of infection in Catalonia, Aragon, the Basque Country and the Madrid region.
Czechs or children denied entry. CTI revealed discrimination in restaurants
These included, for example, erroneous information about prices and non-compliance with the principles of fairness of sales.
In one case of discrimination, a restaurant in Prague refuses to allow smaller children into the business. According to CTI, it writes on its website that the facility is not suitable for children under the age of eight. "When asked electronically by a consumer whether it is possible to order a table for four adults and one child at the age of four in the restaurant, the restaurant employee replied electronically that they do not accept the presence of children under the age of eight in the restaurant," Fröhlich added.
In the second case, another Prague establishment did not want to allow Czech-speaking people to sit at the table, while English-speaking people allowed it. "Czech-speaking inspectors, in their capacity as consumers, were not allowed to sit at the table and place an order in the restaurant. English-speaking consumers were allowed to do so," a spokesperson for CTI described the situation.
Both cases are now being dealt with in administrative proceedings. As they have not yet been finalized, the spokesperson for the inspection was unable to provide further information on the restaurants in question.
However, discrimination occurred only in a very small part of the restaurants inspected in the second quarter. In total, the CTI carried out 139 inspections. In addition to the two cases of discrimination, it found other errors in 64 cases. Most of these were deficiencies in compliance with the principles of fair sales and failure to inform consumers about the prices of products and services in accordance with the regulations.
Already on Wednesday, the inspection reported cases of discrimination against foreigners in two Prague restaurants, Clock Caffé and Café Restaurant. In both establishments, foreigners were charged higher amounts than Czech-speaking clients. In these cases, final fines of CZK 60,000 have already been imposed.
Dukovany power purchase model to be discussed by the government
The government will discuss on Monday the model for the purchase of electricity from the planned new Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant unit.
The bill foresees that if the purchase price is higher than the price of power electricity on the market, the difference will be paid by all consumers through tariffs.
In the second case, if the purchase price is lower than the price on the market, the impact on consumers will be the opposite.
Power electricity is an unregulated part of the final price of electricity for customers.
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry Karel Havlíček (for ANO) as well as the energy company ČEZ have previously stated that the more likely option is that people will save on electricity thanks to the construction.
Analysts, on the other hand, point out that the long-term outlook for electricity prices on the markets is always uncertain, which has been shown several times in the past.
The intention has been criticized by environmental organizations before.
"The purchase price can be both below and above the market price of power electricity.
The final impact at the time of application of the rule can thus be both negative and positive.
The impact will be distributed among customers according to the size of the circuit breaker - at lower consumption or electricity consumption - at higher consumption of electricity," the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MPO) said in the material materials.
Havlíček said in May that he anticipates that the wholesale price of electricity will rise and people on the Dukovan construction will make a profit.
Otherwise, the impact will be in the tens of crowns per year per family, which he says is far less than people pay annually in electricity invoices to support so-called supported sources.
He has previously estimated that the purchase price could be between 50 and 60 euros (about 1320 to 1600 CZK) per megawatt hour (MWh).
The submitted material does not contain any proposal for the amount, it is to be included in the purchase contract.
The price of electricity on the Prague Energy Exchange for 2021, for which traders will now stock the most, is currently around 45 euros (about 1190 CZK) per MWh.
"With a difference between the purchase price and the market price of power electricity of ten euros, the supplement could amount to an average household with consumption of 3.3 MWh per year - it can correspond to a household of four, equipped with electrical appliances, including an electric hob and oven, but which does not use electricity for heating and hot water heating - less than 100 CZK/year," the MIT wrote in its government documents.
"We are living in extremely turbulent times.
The coronavirus pandemic has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term prediction of market prices to be a speculative matter," Tomáš Voltr, executive director of the Energy financial group investment group, told the Czech News Agency earlier.
The proposed law envisages that the purchase would be carried out by the MIT, or by a legal entity authorised by it, owned by the state, at a predetermined price.
A contract between the investor and the state, guaranteeing the conditions for the purchase of electricity, would be concluded for a minimum of 30 years, with a possible extension of ten years, even repeated, but at the latest until the operation of low-carbon production is terminated.
The proposal defines a low-carbon production plant as an electricity production plant with a nuclear reactor connected to the electricity system with an installed capacity of at least 100 megawatts (MW) after 2030.
Havlíček previously stated that the new Dukovany unit should have an output of 1,200 MW and produce nine terawatt-hours of electricity annually, which would correspond to a tenth of the expected Czech consumption.
The unit should be put into operation in 2036.
The financing model for the new Dukovany unit was approved by the government on Monday.
The state should finance the facility interest-free when it is built, while operating it is expected to incur 2% interest.
The opposition disagrees with the financing model, and is also concerned about the possibility that Russian or Chinese companies would build Dukovany.
The state should participate in the construction 70%.
The rest should be paid by ČEZ, which will also cover all possible additional costs.
ČEZ CEO Daniel Beneš told ČTK in May that the expected sum for the construction of the block at current prices is about six billion euros (approximately 162 billion crowns).
Contracts between the state and ČEZ for the construction of the new Dukovany block will be signed on Tuesday.
There was a fire in the underground of the ČSA mine in Karviná, no one was injured
There was a fire in the underground of the ČSA mine in Karviná this morning. The cause of the fire is not yet known. However, no one was injured, mining company spokesperson Ivo Čelechovský told ČTK.
The fire broke out at 04:25 in a disturbance at a depth of about 1,200 metres. "No employees were hurt, no one was injured. Mining rescuers immediately intervened on the scene, who eliminated the fire by direct intervention and also carried out a field inspection. The workplace was immediately closed and inaccessible," said the spokesperson. The exact cause of the fire will now be determined by a special commission.
In the former Ostrava-Karviná district, coal is mined only in the Karviná part, namely in the ČSA, Lazy, Darkov, ČSM-Sever and ČSM-Jih mines. In Dole Lazy, the mining should end this year, and other mines will be gradually phased out as well. The mining company OKD is the only producer of black coal in the Czech Republic, its production last year amounted to 4.62 million tonnes. About 9,000 people work in the mines.
Brno Grand Prix? Ticket price increases imminent
The most expensive item each year before the Grand Prix is the listing fee. This year it was about one hundred and fifteen million crowns. "The mass of people who come to Brno at the Grand Prix will spend money there on accommodation, food or entertainment, which should more or less offset the costs associated with organizing the event, including the listing fee," evaluated the economist Petr Pelc.
According to him, the importance of the race is also in attracting tourists to the city. "Brno does not have so many world tourist attractions. The Grand Prix attracts visitors from abroad as well. For Brno it is as important as, for example, the Turin airport or the fairgrounds. And these are projects that are supported with public money," added the economist.
Brno Grand Prix
- costs for the past five editions: 686 million crowns
- profits from the past five editions: 682 million crowns
- problem: lack of money for organizing, increasing the listing fee for the promoter company Dorna
- possible solutions: more money from the state, use of the advertising space, increase in the price of tickets
- current state: negotiations on a new contract for organizing the races for the next five years
According to the director of the Institute of Public Administration, Filip Hrůza, organizers must now evaluate whether the race is advantageous for Brno. "The Grand Prix sucks money from public budgets for other matters. To some extent, however, it is a political issue and not an economic one," he thinks.
In the future, the costs of the motorsport event may be even higher. The option of increasing the registration fee to almost double is in play.
"The situation is not closed, we must try to negotiate the best possible conditions with Dorna. It also depends on the extent to which the state is prepared to contribute to organizing the race. If the worst scenarios were fulfilled, I am afraid that it is not realistic for the city and the region to pay the price," admitted Brno Mayor Markéta Vaňková.
As Deník Rovnost has already reported, representatives of both the South Moravian Region and Brno are also discussing the possibility of using advertising due to the difficulties of raising money for the Grand Prix. "Dorna's condition is that the advertising must be placed in places that are not covered by cameras. The choice of companies is also limited, because if Dorna has a general sponsor, then the second sponsor cannot be a company from the same area," explained Vaňková.
The organizers can also raise more money from tickets in the coming years. "We have to sit down and say what the costs will actually be. And we have to adjust the revaluation of tickets to that," said Brno opposition representative for the ANO movement and former Mayor Petr Vokřál.
The Ministry of Regional Development withdrew two billion crowns of material on tourism support in the media
The Ministry of Regional Development (MMR) planned to spend two billion crowns on advertisements for holidays in the Czech Republic in the media, on the internet and on billboards, the office withdrew the material from the comment procedure.
Minister Klára Dostálová (for ANO) told the server SeznamZprávy.cz that the material is still being worked on.
The document in eKlep (the electronic library of the legislative process) was pointed out by the server Zdopravy.cz on Friday.
The Ministry justified the plan by the fall in tourism due to the coronavirus.
During the coronavirus crisis, the media also experienced a drop in revenue.
The proposal drew criticism from the opposition and from tourism representatives.
According to the proposal, which is now available on the website hlidacstatu.cz, the MMR planned to give money through the state tourism support agency CzechTourism to advertise in television, radio, press, on the internet, billboards or areas in railway stations.
The largest part of the money, namely CZK 700 million, would go to television stations.
Most of it would go to private TV stations Nova and Prima.
Printed dailies and weeklies would receive CZK 400 million and the same part would go to the MMR for PR articles, advertising banners and videos on websites.
Radio stations would receive CZK 350 million for the media campaign, most of it again to private stations.
The remaining CZK 150 million would be used for outdoor advertisements on billboards, LED screens and areas in railway stations or in the metro.
The campaign to promote tourism in the Czech Republic was to start in mid-August and last a year.
"The material is still being worked on, it is certainly not in the form that should be presented yet," Dostálová told news server SeznamZprávy without further details.
The material was criticized by the opposition, according to TOP 09 head Markéta Pekarová Adamová, the media would benefit from the advertising from the trust funds of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO).
"I firmly believe that this ostentatious disdain will get a punch in the eye at the elections in the autumn," she wrote on twitter.
Dostálová rejects that it is really about helping the media hit by the crisis.
"It can also be a coincidence, I don't know anything about supporting the media," she told Deník N on Friday.
According to her, the budget of two billion is indicative.
"Of course, we are still counting it, it can be less or more.
It is a working material," she added.
The Save Tourism initiative does not make sense for a media campaign to support domestic tourism.
"We want two billion for companies in the tourism industry, not an unnecessary advertising campaign," the chairman of the initiative, Tomáš Barčík, told the daily on Sunday.
If the two billion crowns are in the state budget, they should be directed to companies, not the media, the initiative writes in an open letter to the government.
The end of political traffics? The new law won't help anyway, according to critics!
But according to some opposition MPs, the law is more conducive to ministers being relieved of their responsibility for the election while continuing to choose their candidates.
Greater transparency in the selection procedures for posts in state-owned companies - this is one of the goals of the nomination law. 119 MPs voted in favour. The law passed thanks to the votes of ANO, KSČM, Social Democrats and even Pirates, for example.
Candidates for state-owned companies will have to go through the selection procedure before the government committee. For example, Pirates sought to make the recommendation to the minister binding. In the end, this failed.
Civic Democrats and the SPD movement fear that the nomination law will play into the hands of ministers. "The minister will newly be able to hide behind a decision of the commission and will not have a clear transparent responsibility," thinks SPD chairman Tomio Okamura. ODS deputy chairman Martin Kupka speaks similarly.
The government committee should completely reject candidates who do not meet the conditions. These will include criminal integrity, debt-free status, a minimum age of 25 years and the main selection criterion should also be expertise.
The law will still have to pass the Senate and will then be signed by the president.
The car tuner has brought the voice of the digital soul
Everything you know about obesity is wrong, says the headline of a long text written for the Huffington Post by Michael Hobbes and photographed by Finlay Mackay. In a provocative twist, it says that for decades the medical community ignored the facts about obesity and waged a fierce (and also unnecessary) war against overweight people that not only tainted public opinion but also destroyed many lives. But now is the time for a new paradigm.
What Hobbes says right from the start is that there is often a very long and tedious journey from knowing and knowing facts to putting them into practice. He mentions the case of scurvy, with some captains as far back as the seventeenth century handing out lemons, limes, and oranges to their crew in the belief that they would prevent the disease. But the British Navy abandoned the practice because of fears of increased costs. The clear influence of fruit in preventing and treating the disease was then demonstrated in the mid-18th century, but it took another fifty years for the Navy to take this into account. Seat belts also existed long before the invention of the car, but they only became mandatory in the sixties, and the first confirmed asbestos-related death dates back to 1906, yet its first ban came in 1973.
"Every public health discovery - no matter how significant - has always had to compete with traditions, prejudices, and financial incentives within the society into which it was to be implemented," Hobbes writes. In American society today, nearly 80 percent of the adult population, and about one-third of children, meet the definition of overweight or obesity. More Americans now live with obesity than with breast cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and HIV combined.
Obesity is seen as an eminently personal failure of the individual, which is claimed to burden health care and reduce GDP. The fear of fat is so great in the population that Americans now spend more money on diets than they spend on computer games and movies. But the truth is that diets don't work. Back in 1959, research showed that 95% to 98% of attempts to lose weight ended in failure, and two-thirds of people on diets subsequently gained more than they lost.
Armed with statistics, Hobbes goes on to describe the lifestyles and traumas of overweight people. The personal meets the systemic, with, for example, only 19 hours of study time devoted to nutrition in faculty teaching future doctors. Which, at a time when 60% of the calorie process Americans take comes from ultra-processed food - that is, too much processed food.
How obesity is stigmatized is illustrated by reports from surgeries, where overweight people tend to experience shorter checkups, with doctors approaching them with less empathy and viewing them as more problematic patients.
But, far from being an American problem, Hobbes writes, since 1980, obesity rates have doubled in 73 countries around the world, and increased in 113. And in that time, no country has been able to reduce and stop this increase. Absolutely none.
Simona Krainová: Fuck the Age! Then she kissed Lucie Bílá!
The day before the christening of the Fuck The Age calendar, Simona Krainová posted her last pictures of herself completely naked! "I was a bit worried about people judging me for taking naked pictures at my age. I'm a rather shy person. But so far I've only had positive reactions. I wanted to show women that when they want to, it's possible to have a solid figure at 46. Of course there's hard work and self-denial behind it, but there's no other way."
"Lukáš Dvořák and I took about three thousand pictures, they chose about a hundred and there are twelve in the calendar, so the rest are still waiting for their moment. It's definitely not the last time I'm naked," the model, who also came to her christening very naked, told Lightning.
She wore an extended jacket by Bernhardt and underneath shorts, which were not visible, so it looked like she had forgotten the bottom. Everyday running has strengthened her legs, so she can afford similar models.
Simone was so pleased with her success that she kissed everyone she met at her christening. Her husband, her friends, even Nightingale Lucy the White.
The broth of life, the rooster of beers and death as a blade of grass
The posthumous is also the third album titled A Death is a blade of grass by the Brno poet, tireless organizer of cultural activities and publisher Jaroslav Erik Frič, who also left a year ago, on May 24.
In Frič's discography it is the fifth item and, like previous titles, the main emphasis here is on Frič's poetry, of which he is himself an excellent performer.
Frič, 1949, was understandably influenced by the American beat generation, but he passed this inspiration through his own, personalised experiences and also through very visceral expressions of faith.
He was, however, far from any agitation, when he spoke or wrote about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, non-aggressive, totally tolerant.
I can think of Bohuslav Reynek in that context (in contrast to Jan Zahradníček, for example), masters forgive.
Frič's album offers recordings of the author's reading from 2006, but also performances with musicians who have always accompanied him very sensitively, whether it was the cellist Josef Klíč, or Honza Bartoň and Vítězslav Holata.
I will help myself - gladly - with the words of the Ostrava poet Petr Hruška about Frič's long poetic compositions.
"They radiated a proud and endless bitterness," writes Hruška, "over the state of our world threatened by extinction.
The world, which is sinking more and more into numb consumerist futility and avarice, is moving further and further away from what its soul was made of - the mystery of faith, humility and human closeness.
There was the sadness of one who knows that few people are interested in the values for which he was created, but who also knows that they cannot be renounced just because of general disinterest.
The poems reminded us that one may have to lose everything expensive, but it is not immaterial how one loses it.
If one sells himself to general decadence, he resigns sceptically, shuts up fearfully, or remains until the last moment in a calm and proud insistence on what he believes and loves."

Paroubek is not my adviser, said Hamáček
Former Prime Minister and ČSSD leader Jiří Paroubek is not a paid adviser to the Social Democrats.
Party chairman and Interior Minister Jan Hamáček only communicates with him and reads his opinions and articles.
Hamáček said this on the Prima Partie television program today.
News server SeznamZprávy.cz reported on Friday that Paroubek should be Hamáček's adviser.
"From time to time we write a text, he sends me some material from time to time and I read it," Hamáček said today.
He added that, however, it is not an official and paid cooperation.
ČSSD, he said, does not have the resources to waste them for similar purposes.
"The fact that I read his opinion from time to time, there are a lot of such people," he said.
In a subsequent discussion with ODS deputy Jana Černochová, the minister said that many members of the ODS still "openly listen to the opinions of Václav Klaus."
This is okay, he said, because he is an experienced politician and a former party chairman, which is also the case with Paroubek.
He called the fact that the media is making an affair of it a sign of this year's cucumber season.
Seznamy.cz wrote on Friday that Paroubek is fulfilling the role of Hamáček's unofficial consultant.
He also wrote that the fourth place of the party's candidate in the Ústí Region is headed by the former chairman of the local cell, Petr Benda, who is linked to Paroubek and served as the vice-chairman of his party LEV 21.
Hamáček said today that he will not comment on the composition of the candidate until it is ready and approved.

Duplantis has a mile-long lead, it's a kick in the ass, laments Swede's challenger
The 22-year-old American pole vaulter has the ambition and potential to be one of the new ruler's most serious competitors.
He already knows what it's like to beat the two-year-old Duplantis, defeating him last year at the NCAA Universities Association meeting.
"We had a battle the year before, he won and I was second, then we switched places.
It was a very good fight both times," describes Nilsen, who secured the victory with 5.95 meters.
But Duplantis has since shot up sharply and currently finds himself alone in the highest pole-vaulting spheres.
At just 20 years old, he became the world record holder, breaking the 6.17 meter bar in Torun on February 8 this year, adding an inch a week later in Glasgow.
"He was jumping six meters at the age of 18 when he graduated from high school," recalls his peer Nilsen for the World Athletics website.
"It was clear that once he matured from boy to man, he would increase his potential and talent tenfold.
Twenty years is a pretty good age to jump a world record," he believes.
While Nilsen's list of accomplishments is noticeably thinner than that of Duplantis, the American has similar goals.
He has hinted at his options so far at NCAA races, which he has won regularly, improving his indoor personal best to 5.93 metres at one in February this year. He won a gold medal at the Pan American Games in Lima last August, having already fought his way into America's quest for the World Championships in 2017, where he finished 13th.
The next milestone for him is to get his first taste of the Diamond League.
"It's definitely my priority to get on the professional circuit and compete as much as possible in the Diamond League, because you can make a name for yourself there," he realizes.
"If you can succeed at this level, you can undoubtedly do the same at events like the Olympic Games, the World Championships or the Pan American Games."
But the pandemic has delayed these peak holidays, giving Nilsen and the other pole vaulters time to improve.
But will that be enough to catch up with Duplantis, who can easily turn a race under five rings into a mere silver match?
"Everyone's trying to catch up, but I don't think that's going to be possible anytime soon," Nilsen muses.
"The kid's been jumping for 16 years, and he's a mile ahead of everyone else in practice."
And he'll want to increase it even more before Tokyo 2021 begins.
Scientists are looking for toddlers with a birth defect called ankle valgozita for their study
The ankle valgozita is a birth defect that affects five to ten percent of children. It is normally treated with intensive exercise. Scientists are trying to help these children even more, so they have developed a special shoe that should significantly speed up the treatment.
"We have two prototype shoes that will be worn by healthy children and children with a diagnosis to map the effect in both groups. Participation in the research will have no risks for the children and the measurement will be completely painless," explains Marta Gimunová, head of research at the Faculty of Sports Studies at MU.
Parents of both groups of children can apply for the study via the web, where a registration form and all information is available.
Scientists are looking for fifty children with a diagnosis and fifty healthy children. Of each group, half will always wear health shoes and half will not.
"The moment when parents should enroll their child is when they start taking the first separate steps, typically letting go of the furniture they hold when trying to walk. Participation in the research involves three measurements within seven months of the child's first steps, each lasting about 20 minutes, and for half of the participants it also includes wearing the tested shoes," Gimun points out.
The opening of Pumpkin World delayed the ripening of pumpkins
Nová Ves u Leštiny (Havlíčkobrodsko) - A farmhouse in Nová Ves u Leštiny in Havlíčkobrodsko opened Pumpkin World for more than a month today. Decorations consisting of thousands of freshly harvested pumpkins are dominated by massive orange pyramids in the garden. The autumn event, which is becoming a tradition, starts one week later this year because the pumpkins ripened longer in the surrounding seven hectares of fields belonging to the Pipkova family. Even now there are many of them in the field, Jaroslava Pipková told ČTK today.
The Pipkos grow many types of pumpkins, but the weather has not favoured them for the last two years. This year's harvest was delayed and some types did not work out. "As usual, we have enough orange pumpkins for Halloween, but some types for fine people have failed," said Pipková. Nevertheless, there are more types to choose from on the farm, from the already mentioned large pumpkins suitable for carving and digging decorations, through pumpkins for cooking hokaido or elongated "spaghetti" to ornamental pumpkins of various colours and shapes.
Pumpkins are laborious to grow. Farmers manually hoe the plants and harvest the fruit, cutting the pumpkin from the stem with scissors. Pumpkin World The Pipkos have been opening regularly since 2010, and previous years have attracted thousands of people. Pumpkin decorations are complemented by attractions made of straw or a maze of logs. Visitors will also see animals raised on the farm. It will be open daily until November 3.
Details of the event are available on the farm's website, where growers also offer some recipes for pumpkin dishes, including pumpkin muffins or juice. Visitors themselves tell them about other options for pumpkin preparation in the kitchen. "A lot of cooks have tried their recipes, and we will be inspired as well," Pipková said. She noted that some housekeepers also put pumpkins on sour like cucumbers.
We are looking for motivated immigrants. The head of a children's clinic is building an international team of doctors, we bring their stories
An Albanian woman, Ledjona Toni, studied medicine in Czech and today few people recognize that she is a foreigner.
In the Czech Republic, hundreds of doctors from abroad are studying who could stay and work here. A pediatric clinic in Motol, Prague, tried to recruit some of them.
To arrive at Motol Hospital in Prague around 5 p.m., Tara Hussein Tayeb had to get up early. A Kurdish woman with close-cropped hair was flying to the Czech Republic from Suleimania, a city in northeastern Iraq, where she works as a pediatrician in a hospital and in the afternoon still treats small patients in private practice. She also teaches at a university.
Strawberry, plum and invisible. Choose the right shade of lipstick: Not just one red
When choosing a red lipstick, you should first determine whether you are the warm or the cold type. Try a simple test - look at the veins on your wrist. If they are blue, you are the cold type, if they are green, then you are the warm type. When choosing a new red lipstick, first of all, look at the classification based on the undertone. Then look at the texture in the next one.
If you are one of the women with cold undertones, then purple, plum, cherry or mauve lipsticks are suitable for you.
If you fall into the category of warm undertones, choose those as well. You can tell them by the fact that they tend to have orange, coral, gold or brown reflections.
It may happen that some veins look green and others blue. In that case, congratulate yourself - you don't need to look at the undertone and can only focus on your colour preferences.

Uncombed wants 45 million from the state
According to the spokesperson of the office Vladimír Řepka, the Ministry of Justice has received six applications in this connection so far and is now analysing them. The young man was in jail for two years for assaulting a woman, but the judiciary eventually acquitted him.
The appeal in the case was not lodged by the Attorney General Pavel Zeman or by the Minister of Justice Marie Benešová.
The attempted murder of the hairdresser in Hořice happened in February 2013. The Hradec Public Prosecutor's Office indicted the then 20-year-old high school student, Nečesaný. The prosecution alleged that he hit the woman several times in the head with a log and then took over ten thousand crowns from her. The seriously injured woman was found by her son and her life was saved by the doctors of the Hradec hospital.
Nečesaný denied any wrongdoing from the beginning. "I am innocent and I swear to it. I am sincerely sorry about what happened to the victim, but I am not the perpetrator," the young man, who did not deny that he was at the hairdresser's on the fateful day, said earlier in court. He said he wanted to get a haircut. But he left after his wife told him that he was already closing. He then turned himself in as a witness to the police.
The hairdresser did not recognize him as the aggressor during questioning at first, but later identified Nečesaný as the attacker. According to forensic experts, she suffered from memory lapses after the attack.
The Hradec Regional Court handed down five sentences in succession in the case. At first, Nečesaný was convicted twice and sentenced to 16 years in prison, while the High Court of Appeal reduced his sentence to 13 years. Nečesaný gradually headed for prison twice, but each time he was freed after the Supreme Court intervened. After the ordered replacement of the Judicial Chamber, acquittals were eventually handed down repeatedly, the last one being upheld by the High Court in March this year.
However, the Chairman of the Appeal Chamber, Jiří Lněnička, also stated in the grounds of his conclusions that this decision was wrong, but due to the procedural situation, he said he did not have a better option. He said that he rejected the prosecutor's appeal against the acquittal verdict, even though her appeals were justified.
"The problem with this case is not that there is a lack of evidence, but its evaluation. We believe that sufficient evidence was gathered in the preliminary proceedings, which in another criminal case would have been more than sufficient for an admission of guilt," said Lněnička.
However, both the Hradec and the Supreme Court viewed the case differently and said their opinion would probably not be changed by further annulment of the acquittal.

Woman spends hundreds of thousands on disabled son's disability pension
Court awaits
The 33-year-old man's state disability pension is intended primarily to improve his quality of life.
The woman faces up to eight years in prison for embezzlement.
Due to ill health, the court deprived the sick man of his rights and appointed his mother as guardian to manage his son's money, among other things.
"From mid-November 2013 to this January, the woman used part of the funds from her son's disability pension for her own use, depriving him of CZK 440,000," police spokesperson Dana Ladmanová said, adding that the accused woman was aggravated by the fact that as guardian she had a special obligation to defend the interests of the injured person.
The woman had set up an account for her son, according to the court's instructions, but had his pension sent to her own account.
"After paying for the costs associated with her son's stay in the medical facility and paying for the necessary medication, she used the remaining funds for the purchase of a vehicle, electrical appliances and for the running of the household," according to the indictment.
The woman admitted that she could not use her son's money for her own use.
However, she defended herself by saying that she helped them pay for the family's expenses.
"We had problems with our income to tighten the household.
We never bought anything above standard.
It was always for things that my son would have approved.
I thought it was family money.
I had no idea that I was committing a crime," the woman explained to the police.
She promised to give the money back to her son.
North America has been inhabited for 30,000 years, scientists say after tool discovery
Findings from the Chiquihuite cave in the Mexican state of Zacatecas include 1930 tools made of limestone, including fine blades that could have been used to slice meat, and pointed objects that could have served as spearheads or spears.
Scientists have found that the oldest of the tools date from 33,000 to 31,000 years ago.
"There are only a few products of this age.
But there are," said archaeologist Ciprian Ardelean of the University of Zacatecas and lead author of one of two studies published on the subject in the journal Nature.
The youngest tools reach 12,500 years old.
Experts say humans have been inhabiting the Chiquihuite cave, located at high altitudes, for a long 20,000 years.
A widely accepted theory to date has suggested that the first representatives of Homo sapiens crossed the land bridge from what is now Russia to Alaska some 13,500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including unique spear points used to kill mammoths and other prehistoric animals, has shown that this Clovis culture subsequently spread throughout much of North America.
But this model has been given a break in recent decades, with the discovery of several ancient settlements that were two to three thousand years older.
A second study published in the journal Nature reports 42 different sites across North America, proving human presence on the continent as early as 26,000 to 19,000 years ago.
Scientists believe that a small number of humans may have arrived on the North American mainland earlier than previously thought.
Some may have reached America by boat.
"It is obvious that humans were in America long before the development of the so-called Clovis culture," said anthropologist Ruth Gruhn of the University of Alberta, Canada, on the new findings.
So far, the interest in tickets is fulfilling an optimistic scenario, the sellers say.
Prices are also gradually decreasing
Ticket sales in the Czech Republic are growing every week.
Compared to last summer, the interest is still about half, but the demand is growing by up to 20 percent every week.
According to the sellers, the development after the crisis is fulfilling the most optimistic scenarios.
Ticket prices are also gradually decreasing.
The most sought-after destinations, according to the sellers, are mainly southern European countries.
According to Kiwi.com data, Spain, Italy and Greece lead the way.
Flights to Split, Croatia, are the most sold at Letuška.cz.
Of the other countries, the most sought-after is the United Kingdom, which has always been one of the busiest destinations.
The average ticket price is also decreasing.
At Letuška.cz, it was around 6250 crowns in the middle of the month, down by 3000 crowns year-on-year.
This is mainly due to an increase in demand for European destinations, which now account for about 85 percent of sales.
However, prices to some European destinations, such as Spain or Italy, have also fallen by about a fifth in the past weeks.
The crisis has also affected the behaviour of customers, who are now buying tickets far less in advance than before because they are worried about the further development of the coronavirus situation.
According to earlier information from Kiwi.com, the time to buy a ticket before departure has decreased by about ten days year-on-year.
"This confirms the future trend, where people will order tickets far less in advance, require more flexibility, take less risks," said Michal Šindelář, Vice President of Products at Kiwi.com.
Currently, the average time to book before departure is 21 days.
Along with the growth in sales, the number of renewed flights from the Czech Republic is also increasing.
At the Prague airport, there are currently regular flights to more than 60 destinations.
Compared to last summer's season, it is about half the destinations.
The hunter was injured in a fall from his perch, he was carried to the ambulance for three hours
The unfortunate accident occurred before 7:30 p.m. in the peak areas at Čertova mlýn.
"It was a very complex and inaccessible terrain, so we sent five of our rescuers with the appropriate equipment to the injured man. At the same time, we asked for the cooperation of the Moravian-Silesian Region Medical Rescue Service. The paramedics then dispatched an ambulance to the accident," Libor Kluz, dispatcher of the Beskydy Mountain Service, described the circumstances of the intervention.
Rescuers found the hunter in a designated location with multiple injuries. They treated him immediately and then gently, but with difficulty, transported him on a so-called Austrian cart across the impassable terrain.
"The transport in the route of about one and a half kilometers was slow and difficult. The injured nimrod was therefore handed over to the ambulance crew after approximately three hours," added Libor Kluz.
Luckily, according to Radan Jaškovský, the authorized chief of the Beskydy Mountain Service and also the rescue worker involved, a fellow hunter was able to describe in detail where the injured person was.
"We found him relatively quickly. However, if he had the Ambulance app on his phone, our rescuers would have been there earlier and at the same time the 155 dispatch would have known about the accident and its situation immediately," commented Radan Jaškovský.
He added that a charged mobile phone with the Ambulance app activated should be a matter of course in the mountains today.
The grand final tonight!
Watch the darts battle live on Nova Sport
The second most prestigious tournament within the PDC has reached the grand final.
It features the experienced 46-year-old Scottish darts player Gary Anderson and the surprise of the tournament, 26-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh.
Gary Anderson knocked out Justin Pip in the first round, then ran into his next-door neighbour in the table.
However, he also managed to cope with James Wade, and in the quarter-finals he had a good fight with Simon Whitlock, who had earlier sent home the world's No.1.
The "Flying Scot" had a close call in the semi-finals, when he faced Michael Smith.
But at the last moment he escaped the gravedigger's clutches, dominated in overtime, and after a result of 18:16 he won a place in the final of the tournament, which he dominated earlier in 2018, beating Mensur Suljovic 21:19 in an amazing battle.
The biggest surprise of World Matchplay is Dimitri van den Bergh.
The Belgian talent is enjoying the tournament, and it is perhaps the knowledge that he has nothing to lose that has helped him to play on an absolutely fantastic wave.
The 26-year-old darter first surprisingly knocked out world number six Nathan Aspinall, was outclassed in a dramatic battle by Joe Cullen, and in the quarter-finals, after a sharp start, he also beat Adrian Lewis.
The semi-finals were the big test.
Glen Durrant showed his strength at the outset, but the calmly playing Belgian then took an excellent series lead, which he then more or less held to the end.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in the high scoring, which made up for the occasional uncertainty on doubles.
Coronavirus cases have increased at least since the beginning of the week, the number of tests has decreased
Since the beginning of March, when the new coronavirus was discovered in the Czech Republic for the first time, it has been proven that 15,212 people have been infected with it.
Almost 9,600 of them have been cured, 368 patients have died.
At present, 5,254 people are sick.
This is according to data on the website of the Ministry of Health.
The daily number of newly confirmed cases this week has exceeded two hundred four times in a row.
The maximum was 281 cases on Friday.
On Thursday, there were positive 235 tested, 246 the day before, and 206 on Tuesday.
On the first working day of this week, there were 169 infected.
Of the covid-19, 9,590 people have been cured in the Czech Republic, or 63 percent of all those infected so far.
Most of them had a mild course of the disease.
There are 151 people in hospital with coronavirus, according to the latest data from the Ministry of Health, 19 of whom are assessed by doctors as serious.
There are several outbreaks of covid-19 in the Czech Republic.
Karvinsko still has the most infections in the last seven days per 100,000 inhabitants, at almost 59.
It is followed by the district of Jihlava with 56 and Frýdecko-Místecko with 36 infections per 100,000 inhabitants in the last week.
Due to the increased number of infections, new measures against the spread of the coronavirus have been in force in the Czech Republic since Saturday.
People have to wear masks at internal mass events of over 100 people, such as cultural and sporting events, but also weddings and funerals inside buildings.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be halved from the current 1,000 people.
In the world, the number of people who have been proven infected with the new coronavirus has already exceeded 16 million.
This was reported by the American Johns Hopkins University, which monitors the development of the pandemic globally.
According to this source, the balance of victims who died with covid-19 is close to 645,000.
The latest million infected have been added to the statistics in just three days; the 15 million mark fell on July 22.
The United States, which already registers over 4.1 million infections, Brazil, with 2.4 million, and India, where authorities say nearly 1.4 million people have been infected, have accounted for the largest increase in recent days.
The number of infections is now increasing at a record rate.
The World Health Organization reported this week that more than 284,000 new cases have been added worldwide from Thursday to Friday, the highest daily rate since the pandemic began.
This development can be attributed to the fact that the spread of the disease is at its peak in populous nations such as the US, Brazil, and India, but according to Reuters, the number of new cases has been growing in nearly 40 countries around the world over the past week.
These include Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium, and Israel.
The disease has already appeared in almost every country in the world, with the first case officially announced today by the DPRK.

If the tenant, in accordance with the law and this contract, allows a third party to use the item, he is liable to the landlord for the conduct of that person as if he were using the item himself.
VII. Termination of the lease
When the item is handed over, the tenant is entitled to separate and take everything he has put into the item or brought into it at his own expense, if possible and if this does not impair the substance of the item or make it excessively difficult to use it.
If the apartment ceases to exist during the period of the lease, the lease shall end.
If the apartment ceases to exist in part during the period of the lease, the tenant is entitled either to an appropriate discount on the rent or to terminate the lease without notice.
Termination of the lease requires a written form and must be given to the other party.
The notice period runs from the first day of the calendar month following receipt of the notice by the other party.
In the event of termination by the landlord, the latter is obliged to inform the tenant of his right to object to the termination and to propose a review of the validity of the termination by the court.
The landlord may terminate the lease by giving three months' notice only for the reasons stated in Section 2288 of the Civil Code, he is obliged to state the reason for the termination in the notice.
The lessee has the right to apply to the court to examine whether the termination is justified within two months from the date on which the termination was received.
The landlord has the right to terminate the lease without notice in accordance with Section 2291 of the Civil Code.
and require the tenant to surrender the apartment to him without undue delay, but not later than one month after the end of the lease, if the tenant breaches his obligation in a particularly serious manner, namely in particular:
a. if he has not paid rent and service costs for a period of at least three months,
b. if it damages the apartment or house in a serious or irreparable manner,
c. if it causes otherwise serious damage or inconvenience to the landlord or persons living in the house; or
d. if the unauthorised use of the dwelling is otherwise or for a purpose other than that agreed.
If the landlord does not state in the notice what he sees as a particularly serious breach of the tenant's obligation, or if he does not call upon the tenant, before the notice is served, to remedy his defective behaviour within a reasonable time or to remedy the unlawful condition, the notice shall be disregarded.
The tenant is obliged to hand the apartment over to the landlord on the day when the lease ends.
The apartment is handed over if the landlord receives the keys and otherwise nothing prevents him from accessing and using the apartment.
If the tenant leaves the apartment in such a manner that the lease can be considered to have ended without any doubt, the apartment is to be deemed to have been handed over immediately.
The tenant is obliged to hand over the apartment in the condition in which he took it over, notwithstanding the normal wear and tear during normal use and the defects which the landlord is obliged to remedy.
The tenant is obliged to remedy changes in the apartment which he has made with the landlord's consent, if the parties have agreed to restore the apartment to its original condition at the end of the lease.
The tenant is obliged to remedy the changes he has made to the apartment without the landlord's consent, unless the landlord informs the tenant that he does not request the removal of the changes; nevertheless, the tenant cannot claim compensation even if the changes increase the value of the apartment.
The landlord may claim compensation in the amount of the reduction in the value of the apartment caused by the changes made by the tenant without the landlord's consent.
Fixtures and objects fixed to the walls, floor and ceiling of the apartment which cannot be removed without a disproportionate reduction in value or without damage to the apartment or house are transferred by affixing or insertion into the owner's ownership of the apartment.
The tenant has the right to demand that the landlord settle with him without undue delay; this does not apply to what the tenant has done without the landlord's consent.
The compensation is payable at the latest on the date of termination of the tenancy.
The landlord is entitled to compensation in the amount of the agreed rent if the tenant does not surrender the apartment to the landlord on the day of termination of the tenancy, until the day on which the tenant actually surrenders the apartment to the landlord.
If an item remains in the apartment that can be considered to belong to the tenant or to a member of his household, the landlord takes care of the item for the benefit of the tenant and on his behalf.
If the tenant does not take over the item without undue delay, the landlord has the right to sell the item in an appropriate manner after having given the tenant adequate additional reasonable time to take over the item, after giving notice to the tenant on his behalf.
This does not apply if the item is clearly abandoned by the tenant or a member of his household.
The tenant may terminate the lease if the circumstances on which the parties appear to have relied in incurring an obligation under the lease have changed to such an extent that the tenant cannot reasonably be required to continue the lease.
In the event of the tenant's death, the contract is governed by Section 2279 et seq. of the Civil Code.

Household air is up to five times worse than outdoor air.
Air fresheners and deodorants harm health
Health is threatened not only by poor outdoor air quality, but also at home.
This was pointed out by Israeli human health expert Carol Abraham, who was quoted by The Jerusalem Post.
According to Abraham, who helped create Israel's Ministry of Environmental Protection, household pollutants need to be targeted now, when many people spend more time working from home.
Abraham mentioned research by the U.S. Environmental Agency (EPA) that domestic air quality is up to five times worse than outdoor air quality.
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 3.8 million people die prematurely each year because of poor air quality in their homes.
"Because of the coronavirus epidemic, which has forced and continues to force many to work from home, people have to spend more hours in their homes than before, so it's time to focus on air quality in their homes," Abraham said.
In Israel, she said, almost no one is concerned about the quality of "home air."
Dangerous things that people normally come into contact with - paints, air fresheners, disinfectants, deodorants, or pesticides - can be dangerous.
"Clothes that we regularly bring to the cleaners also give off poison gas," Abraham said.
Children, old household members, and people with respiratory problems are the most at risk, she said.
Even otherwise healthy individuals can start to suffer from problems such as headaches, fainting, nasal irritation, nosebleeds, vomiting, or skin allergies.
Long-term exposure to unhealthy substances can damage internal organs and the central nervous system.
But not all of the pollutants come from objects inside homes, and the material that houses are built from can also be a source.
Tough competition for the Skoda Kamiq. Kia XCeed is betting on a lot of equipment, at what price?
The Kia XCeed is a relatively difficult model to classify. It is clearly a compact SUV, but it does not offer all-wheel drive. It leaves this item to the larger Sportage sibling, which is such a direct answer to cars like the Skoda Karoq, the Opel Grandland X or the Volkswagen Tiguan. In comparison, XCeed is also betting on more dynamic body shapes, which, by sloping the rear, can vaguely remind you of the SUV-coupe world, especially popular in this part of the market among premium brands such as Audi, BMW or Mercedes-Benz.
On the other hand, the XCeed cannot be classified just alongside padded versions of classic compacts, such as the Ford Focus Active. In contrast, the Koreans have made a lot more changes to the body, so anyone who does not want to see the Ceed in the shapes of the novelty may not even see it.
Unlike the compact hatchback or the Ceed estate, the XCeed is also offered exclusively with supercharged engines, so do not expect the basic atmospheric 1400. The XCeed starts with a supercharged liter and also offers a supercharged sixteen hundred with 150 kW, reserved for the siblings version of the GT. Don't expect a sporty degree here. The Turbodiesely 1.6 CRDi is offered only in mild-hybrid version, which means that the internal combustion engine is assisted by an electrical system that helps reduce consumption and emissions. From 100 kW it is also possible to pay extra for a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic in addition to the manual.
Soon the offer will be expanded with a plug-in hybrid, a variant that will travel roughly six dozen kilometers on electricity only. The batteries can then be charged from a normal socket.
Václav Havel quiz: How long he spent in prison and what prompted him to draw up Charter 77
Fuenlabrada has lost its chance of promotion to Spain's top football league due to a coronavirus outbreak in the team.
The competition management cancelled the originally postponed duel of the last round of the second league, in which the team could have secured a place in the play-offs.
Fuenlabrada announced 12 more infected people on Saturday, bringing the club's total number of positive tests for covid-19 to 28.
Due to the outbreak in the team, Monday's duel against La Coruni was postponed, in which a point was enough for Fuenlabrada to reach the play-offs.
The competition management said today that the duel against La Coruni was definitely called off due to force majeure due to the fact that it was never played again.
Fuenlabrada accepted the decision.
On the other hand, La Coruňa is rebelling against not playing the match.
In the end, given the results of their rivals, even a victory over Fuenlabrada would not have been enough to save them, but they consider it unfair that the last round did not take place according to custom, complete on a single date.
The management of a former elite Spanish club is threatened with court due to their fall to the third league.
The top two teams of the table, Huesca and Cadiz, are guaranteed promotion to the elite.
Zaragoza, Almería, Girona and Elche will compete for the remaining third place in the play-offs.
Karel Gott didn't like Václav Havel?!
Dominik's daughter revealed it
"Dad didn't like him for many years," Gott Dominik's eldest daughter told Aha! , saying that the Master couldn't come up with Havel's name and that whenever he came up, Karel was always annoyed.
It's hard to say what they did to each other, but according to Dominika, the feud began sometime in the mid-1990s.
"Dad said in an article after the revolution that he had it easier than he did.
That Havel could write in a drawer in the dark ages, but if he somehow resisted, his career would be over," Gottová says.
But then she adds that in the end the Czech greats found their way to each other.
"I know that Havel couldn't hear the word at all until he was sixty.
But then the President congratulated him in a letter on his birthday and suddenly his father's relationship with him began to change," Dominika recalls.
Indeed, ten years later, Gott even invited the then former President to celebrate his seventieth birthday at the Ambassador Hotel on Wenceslas Square.
"And that's where the new era of their relationship began, because then Mr. Havel's father regularly invited him to his home for Bertramka," said the blonde, whose father died last October.
Slavík was also said to be sorry that he never received a state medal from Václav Havel.
However, he did receive it in 2009, even though it was already at the hands of his successor Václav Klaus (79).
He will receive another honour in memoriam, the current president Miloš Zeman (75) is supposed to award him the Order of the White Lion and honor his memory.
Heat threat in the Czech Republic as of Tuesday, meteorologists warn of fires
Weather warnings of high temperatures are valid for Tuesday afternoon for the whole of Bohemia, with the exception of the Karlovy Vary Region, as well as for southern and central Moravia.
"Exceptionally, temperatures may exceed 34 degrees Celsius, especially in central Bohemia," they state.
They recommend people to follow a drinking regime in the heat and limit their body load in the noon and afternoon hours.
Due to the warm weather with a minimum of rainfall, there will be a risk of fires starting on Tuesday morning.
Windy weather could contribute to their rapid spread.
Weather warnings about the risk of fires apply to central Bohemia, including Prague, Liberec, Ústí nad Labem, Karlovy Vary and the Pilsen Region.
Fire warnings will be in force until further notice.
"We do not expect significant rainfall that would alleviate the danger in the northwest and west of Bohemia until at least the end of the week," says ČHMÚ.
The Prague Municipality responded to the weather warnings by banning the setting of fires in risky places, which should apply from Tuesday.
People in the capital will not be allowed to set open fires in parks, gardens or forests, for example, up to 50 meters from the edge of the forest growth.
Smoking and the use of pyrotechnics are also prohibited in these places.
The measures will apply until further notice, Prague Municipality spokesperson Vít Hofman informed.
French chef sues Michelin over star removal I'm depressed, he says
The renowned French chef Marc Veyrat lost his third Michelin star this January, a year after winning it. He plans to sue the publisher of the Red Guide to obtain the exact reasons for the demotion. Veyrat also questions the competence of Michelin inspectors, who, he says, mistook saffron for cheddar. The first trial is scheduled to take place in November.
The chef of the famous La Maison de Bois restaurant in the Alpine region of Upper Savoy lost one of his three Michelin stars in January this year. He will sue the publisher of the prestigious Le Guide Michelin because, he says, the commissioners' conclusion was not properly substantiated. Moreover, the removal of the star, he says, took place without any notice. "I've been depressed for six months. How dare you mess with the health of the chefs?" Veyrat told the commissioners.
Michelin only gave the chef vague reasons, such as that the chef put cheddar in the souffle, which the inspection did not like. "I put saffron in it and the gentlemen thought it was cheddar because it was yellow. I have been lovingly working with Savoy ingredients from the beginning," he said, protesting against the decision of Veyrat. He is convinced of the strong incompetence of the Michelin commissioners: "You are frauds who only cause controversy for commercial reasons." Outraged, Veyrat cannot understand "how they could dare say that we put cheddar in our souffle." "They insulted our region as well, my employees were mad about it. We have eggs from our hens, milk from our own cows, gardeners gather fresh herbs every morning," he said.
The distinctive chef, always wearing a black hat and dark glasses, is opposed to the new generation of Michelin commissioners and therefore asks for his restaurant to be excluded from the red guide. But the publisher refuses to do so. "If the business remains open and our inspectors re-select it, we will continue to recommend it," says Gwendal Poullennec, Michelin's international director.
According to Michelin, the chef's lawsuit shows that he has no meaningful accusation yet and a lawyer is yet to help him formulate it. "We regret that Mr. Veyrat communicates rudely with us. But we will examine his comments carefully," he said.
In addition to La Maison de Bois, Marc Veyart owns two other three-star restaurants.
