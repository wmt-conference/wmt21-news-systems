Women basketball players failed to win a medal at the Under-17 World Championship, finishing fourth
The third World Cup of the seventeenth century was also won by the Americans, who defeated Spain in the final by a narrow 77:75 despite 40 points from the Spaniard Angela Salvadores.
"We really wanted to win and not be potato chips, but maybe we wanted it too much. We caught the beginning, but we didn't manage to keep it, because they rolled us under the basket," regretted captain Karolína Malečková. "But playing in front of such an audience was an incredible experience," she praised the fans in Klatovy and Pilsen.
The Czechs started very well, taking an 8-0 lead thanks to two three-pointers and dominating the field throughout the first quarter. At that moment, it seemed that they would repay their opponents for the 85-88 defeat from the basic group after extra time. However, the referees whistled 15 fouls at half-time and helped Hungary return to the game with a 12-2 streak.
"I am convinced that it would have been enough to score another two or three baskets, run to 20 points and we would not have let it go. But instead, our mistakes came. I am not interested in the referees, but in what we did wrong, and there were mistakes that helped the opponent to catch up," said coach Richard Fousek.
"It wasn't the first time we had a lapse in concentration. But the girls are fighters, they didn't let anything go and fought to the end. But the opponent was very good," he added.
The Czechs were kept in the game mainly by Petr Holešínská's accurate shooting from distance and the pivot Tereza Šípová. However, the best Czech shooter had a problem with fouls and missed a large part of the third quarter on the court. The Hungarians took advantage of this and gained a slight lead, which they kept, even though the Czechs fought until the last seconds.
"For us, the first five games were very demanding, we rotated the games in a tight rotation and it cost us a lot of effort. Already against Spain, it was clear that the girls were tired and there was nowhere to take them. Because of the physicality, we were not consistent in defense. We did not play a quick counterattack, we lacked a rebound. And the Hungarians are so good that if you do not put everything together, it is difficult to win," added Fousek.
He believes that his charges have a promising future ahead of them. "In two years, the girls have managed to win the Youth Olympics, come second at the European Championship for 16-year-olds and are now fourth in the world. By our standards, they are a quality team with a good character and it is necessary to continue working with them and developing their talent. Now it is up to the federation to decide which coach they will assign to them in the higher categories," added Fousek.
Thomas Cook: Czechs thrown out of hotel in Mallorca. Guarantees were not enough
The Austrian, German and Polish divisions of the group also filed for insolvency during the week. The future of the Czech branch is currently being discussed and a decision should be made by the end of September.
According to the vice-chairman of the Association of Travel Agencies of the Czech Republic, Jan Papež, there are three possible solutions in play - liquidation will be announced, or the company will be sold, or a team from the Czech branch will establish a new travel agency. "Which one it will be, however, cannot be predicted, it will depend on the German owner," he told the Czech News Agency today.
In addition to the two prematurely terminated trips, the travel agency is also dealing with cases where clients had to pay for their stay on their own, although the company is trying to provide guarantees to hoteliers. The travel agency has promised to reimburse its clients, according to the Pope, the company has sufficient security for this.
The problems in the hotels arose primarily in Mallorca, where the company also asked the Czech consulate for help. In this context, the Pope described to ČTK one of the cases where the local hotel threw out all the tourists of the office. "The hotelier could not determine who belongs to the German company and who belongs to the Czech company. Therefore, he threw everyone out of the hotel, even though the domestic Neckermann provided a guarantee," he said. According to Šrámek, the situation was eventually resolved.
The Czech branch of the bankrupt British group Thomas Cook increased its sales to 995 million crowns last year, an increase of almost 21 percent year-on-year, according to the company's annual report. It covers the accounting period from October 2017 to the end of September 2018. The company's net profit, on the other hand, decreased by about seven million to 15.3 million crowns. However, the company had an unpaid loss of almost 103 million crowns from previous years. The branch includes two basic divisions - in addition to CK Neckermann, it is also the company Global Travel Lufthansa City Center.
Novák helped Trabzonspor to second place, Škoda also hit the target
Defender Filip Novák helped Trabzonspor to the vice-championship title with a goal in the last round of the Turkish football league.
His side won 2-1 at Kayserispor to keep third-placed Besiktas at bay.
After his transfer from Slavia in January, striker Milan Škoda scored his tenth goal for Rizespor, which saved itself even though it lost 1:3 to Fenerbahce.
Novák confirmed his excellent productivity for a defender with his seventh goal in this league season.
In the 63rd minute, the goalkeeper of Kayserispor just launched a fierce shot and the Czech footballer hit the ball into the net from an angle.
The home side managed to equalise with five minutes to go, but Trabzonspor snatched victory in the sixth minute of stoppage time when they successfully completed a four-on-one break.
Škoda in the beginning of the second half of the match with Fenerbahce equalized after a solo at 1:1.
Although Rizespor did not hold the tie for a long time, it did not have to regret it, because thanks to the results of its rivals, it remained three points above the relegation zone.
The competition will end with a Sunday duel of the champion Basaksehir on the Kasimpasa pitch.
The well-hidden Cave of the Hermit in the woods near Nový Bor was in fact not habitable
In the north of Bohemia, in the foothills of the Lusatian Mountains, not far from Nový Bor in Českolipsko, in the forests through which the Count's Road ran, there are several sandstone rock formations.
Both natural and artificially created.
And we will go after the man-made one.
The place is called the Cave of the Hermit.
In reality, however, no hermit ever lived here and the cave served as a shelter, or more precisely a shelter chamber, probably for grain.
The cave is carved into the side of a rocky promontory and is accessible by stairs from above.
At the same time, it is practically invisible until the last moment.
It is only revealed by the narrow steps leading to a kind of rock gallery, from where you first enter the rock.
Although the chamber appears to be a considerable distance from human habitation, at the time of its construction there may have been fields on the plateau, where there is now forest.
"The fact that the building does not have a window and there is no fireplace in the traditional place clearly proves that no hermit could ever survive the winter here," explains historian Kamil Podroužek from the Faculty of Arts of Jan Evangelista Purkyně in Ústí nad Labem.
The one-room building has only a stone bench at the back, which is probably used for storing containers.
"I see it as a chamber for storing some food or products from the field," adds Kamil Podroužek.
Tool marks can be seen on the walls of the cave.
Breaking off the sandstone with a pickaxe was quite simple and quick for the initiated.
It was enough to make appropriate use of the joints and gradually break off the sandstone.
According to the length of the track left by the pickaxe and the method of cutting in general, it is possible to determine the period of formation of the cave.
According to the historian, it is probably the end of the 18th century.
The cave is freely accessible and, judging by the mess that appears in it, someone occasionally sleeps there these days.
If you approach the cave from above from one of the forest paths and you are interested in the stream flowing under the cave and the nearby count's path, then you will definitely find the path down.
And on the way out of the forest, you may still be captivated by the nearby Raven Rocks.
Someone killed a non-confrontational homeless woman under a bridge. Police are looking for witnesses
According to the Prague police, the murder took place sometime during the early evening to the night of Tuesday to Wednesday. It is to this time that the police appeal for possible testimony relates.
"One of the drivers who passed on the bridge connecting Libeň and Žižkov or on the street Pod Krejcárkem could have filmed the murderer, for example, on a dashboard camera. A witness could perhaps only have seen him and could describe him. In short, we welcome any testimony to this case and will accept it on line 158," said Jan Daněk, spokesman for the regional police headquarters.
According to spokesman Daněk, the murdered homeless woman was non-confrontational, did not drink alcohol and did not seek the company of other people. The woman lived at the crime scene. "She was most often in the vicinity of Krejcárk, Palmovka and Holešovice, when she had large blue shopping bags with her," Daněk added a description of the victim, which could also help potential witnesses.

Nokia has filed an objection to the application of the Lokia brand to the Industrial Property Office. However, according to the CCV, product substitution is not likely.
The Brno-based company developing the CCV software is facing legal action from the Finnish telecommunications equipment manufacturer Nokia. The Finns do not like the fact that the Brno-based company's warehouse management program is called Lokia WMS, wrote the E15 daily. Nokia has therefore filed an objection against the application of the Lokia brand to the Industrial Property Office. CCV believes that confusion is not likely.
Marketing Director Petr Ondrášek said that the program is already being used by two dozen customers and has been on the market since last September.
"The Nokia brand is recognized and trusted around the world, and when someone attempts to register a mark that we believe is likely to cause confusion or dilute our brand, we take action to protect our valuable asset," Nokia spokesman Mark Durrant said.
The Brno developers claim that they did not think about the brand, famous in the past for its mobile phones, when creating the warehouse program. According to the CCV, the name Lokia is based on the Latin name for a type of dragonfly, whose rapid movement is supposed to be an analogy of the movement of warehouse workers around the warehouse.
"On the Czech market, the possibility of confusion is unlikely. We sell modern cloud software that companies use to equip their warehouse operations, and we are not really heading into the field of mobile phone production. And we do not want to be compared to a brand that may be missing the train in its field," CCV manager Tomáš Kormaňák responded in E15.
CCV applied for trademark protection at the Industrial Property Office in August, before the program was launched on the market. "It applied for protection for products and services belonging to classes 9, 35 and 42, since the software belongs to class 9, the related business management services in the warehouse belong to class 35 and the development of computer software to class 42 according to the international classification," said Ondrášek.
Nokia's objection is based on the fact that the earlier Nokia trademark is valid in all classes of goods and services, and thus covers the widest possible range of goods and services, and therefore, of course, also overlaps in classes 9, 35 and 42. "CCV does not dispute the opponent's assertion as far as the conformity of these classes of goods and services is concerned. In reality, however, they are completely different brands aimed at different target groups," said Ondrášek.
According to E15, the dispute over the brand may last for months and it may complicate the company's activities.
Coal will give way to gas and nuclear. Renewables will not cover the increased demand, says the head of ExxonMobil in Europe
Renewable sources will not be enough for the Czech Republic to meet future energy demand. Due to the unsuitable climate, wind and solar power plants need to be supplemented with other alternatives, such as those using natural gas.
In an interview with HN, Philippe Ducom, president of the European branch of the American concern ExxonMobil, one of the largest global oil producers, says this. At the same time, he mentions that large storage facilities, in which unused energy from the days when there is enough sun and wind can be stored for later, are still too expensive.
Ducom visited the ExxonMobil center in Prague, where 1,200 people work and whose task is to support the company's business activities and provide logistics and other services necessary for the functioning of the company.
Sydney to London in four hours? A possible reality in 2030
The Sabre combines a conventional aircraft engine with a rocket engine. It is designed to propel the aircraft at twice the speed of the Concorde. "When the Sabre engine is put into operation, it could allow us to fly to Australia in about four hours," said Turnock. For example, the distance between London and New York could be covered by the aircraft in one hour.
The Independent notes that so-called hypersonic flights, in which the speed of sound is exceeded five times, are complicated by overheating of the engine. However, Sabre (Synergetic Air Breathing Rocket Engine) should cope with this problem thanks to the use of super cold helium, which should prevent the temperature from rising.
"The most important thing about the Sabre is that it's a hybrid of a rocket engine and an aircraft engine, which is powered by a stream of exhaust gases generated from the air," says Shaun Driscoll from Reaction Engines. "Rockets haven't evolved that much in the last 70 years, whereas aircraft engines have. So when you combine the engines, you can have a very light and efficient propulsion system and essentially create a space plane," he added.
The engine is currently being tested, with test flights expected to begin around the middle of next year, followed by commercial flights around 2030.
I still see myself as a boy who is just getting to know himself, says Jan Cina
"It was a great school for everyone who worked on it. I fell in love with Afro dance there. Since I have something Romani in me from my father, I was completely enchanted by it," said Jan Cina, who considers himself primarily a musical actor.
Cina revealed that director Štěpán Altrichter must have tempted him a lot. "The work was demanding, but the result is worth it. The film was made a year ago. Hard and honest, but at the same time fun. It was shot on Národní třída, where I drove a car as a non-driver. A lot of it was also shot in Prague's South Town," he said of the Czech-German co-production.
Even though he is nominated for the Thalia Award for his role in the production of The Little Prince, he does not consider it to be the peak of his career. "I don't feel that way. I still see myself as a boy who is just getting to know himself. But the nomination is very pleasant and surprising. I can see the peak far ahead of me," he revealed, adding that he had not even thought about the acceptance speech in case of victory. "Not at all, but as a child, when I listened to discussion programmes on the radio, I always imagined myself speaking to people."
Jan Cina has been living with his colleague Petr Vančura for thirteen years. What is his recipe for a happy relationship? "To love each other and to see problems as a challenge and a good thing to solve," he revealed, recalling the awarding of the Czech Lions, when his friend fell on the stairs.
"Yes, it really happened. He had new slippery shoes and the red carpet was also slippery. So it didn't take long before he was lying on the ground. He was able to turn it into an advantage. He had a Vančura Stairs workshop, where he taught how to safely fall down the stairs at VIP events."
Germans elect Keller as head of football association
As expected, the current head of Bundesliga club Freiburg, Fritz Keller, has become the new president of the German Football Association. The 62-year-old winemaker, restaurateur and hotelier was elected unanimously for a three-year term, and there was no opposing candidate.
Keller replaced Reinhard Grindel, who resigned in April over an affair involving undeclared income, while his predecessors Theo Zwanziger and Wolfgang Niersbach are to stand trial over possible bribery in the awarding of the 2006 World Cup.
Keller said that one of the main goals will be to restore confidence in the union and lead it out of the crisis. "It will not be a one-man show, many people will be responsible. The union is better than its reputation," said Keller, who presented all his tasks under the motto: Together we can do it.
After his election as head of the union, Keller left his post in Freiburg.
Jockey Minařík is in an induced coma after a heavy fall in Germany
"Filip is now in the best of hands.
The institute is equipped for such cases, and fortunately we have a part of our family in Hanover.
This makes the situation much easier for me and also the care of my daughter Finja," news server Jezdci.cz quoted Minařík's wife Katja as saying.
"Everyone is doing their best, Filip now needs time to recover.
There is no point in making any predictions.
Anyone who has ever encountered the issue of head trauma and patients in artificial sleep knows that the situation can change.
Filip is a great fighter.
We all have to be patient now and give him time," said the wife of the 45-year-old jockey.
The star Frankie Dettori, who won the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes for the seventh time at Ascot on Saturday, equalling the legend of Lester Piggott, also called for financial support for the injured Minarik on Twitter.
As of today, almost 70 thousand euros have been raised on the Gofundme server.
The goal is 100 thousand euros (2.6 million crowns).
The video assistant referee took away four goals from Sassuolo, they lost 0:2
The Sassuolo players got the ball into the opponent's goal four times in Saturday's match in Naples, but in the end they had to accept a 2-0 defeat.
Neither of their goals was disallowed for offside by the referee after consulting the video.
According to the Italian media, this is a record adversity of the technology, so many interventions have never been thwarted by VAR to one team.
"VAR was tougher on Sassuolo than roadside radar and punished them like no team has ever been punished before.
The new technology breaks records," wrote Gazzetta dello Sport in a commentary.
"A festival of disallowed goals by Sassuolo.
Never before has VAR been so strict on one team," added the Corriere dello Sport.
Napoli took the lead in the 8th minute on Saturday, but after half an hour of play it seemed that Sassuolo had equalized.
However, Filip Djuricic's goal was disallowed for offside after the intervention of the video assistant referee.
For the same reason, Djuricic's next shot, as well as those of Francesco Caputo and Domenico Berardi, were also ruled out.
On the other hand, the home team added one more goal.
Electric vehicles are reporting a new record.
The highest number of recharges in history in the Czech Republic
"The growth was driven both by a 30 percent increase in the number of stations in our network and the trend of more frequent charging at public stations, as well as by the accelerated development of registrations of new e-cars," said Tomáš Chmelík, Head of the Clean Technologies Department at ČEZ.
Other major players, such as PRE and E.ON, the electric car manufacturer Tesla, as well as the supermarkets Billa and Lidl, are also claiming their share of the market.
The operators of conventional petrol stations are represented by the company MOL.
But it does not yet have the numbers.
"We started building our network for electromobility only last year," explained company spokeswoman Jana Jusková.
However, the editorial staff of Deník exclusively obtained data from all 216 electric stands operated by ČEZ.
They show that drivers took an average of 13.5 kWh from the stations.
This corresponds to a range of around one hundred kilometres for a smaller electric car.
Leaving aside minor drawdowns of up to 1 kWh, the average charging time is two and a half hours.
The vast majority of refueling then took place in the free tariff.
If motorists had already paid for the subscription, their typical spend was around 330 crowns.
Electromobility is particularly popular in the capital.
All five of ČEZ's busiest charging stations are located in Prague, and their popularity eclipses that of entire regional cities.
Olomouc is the leader among the regions.
On the other hand, there is the least interest in remote stations in the border area, for example in Bohumín or Prachatice, which often remain unused throughout the day.
More than four thousand electric cars are currently registered in the Czech Republic.
In the first half of this year alone, 1274 new e-cars were added.
In an extensive poll by the daily "Czechs on the Move," eight percent of readers said they were considering buying an electric car for their family.
However, only a third of respondents know where to find the nearest charging station in their area.
Epilepsy complicated his love for sports, but thanks to the operation he has new hope
Honzík's parents first noticed that something was wrong with him when he was a year and a half old. He always stared into space for a few minutes, became immobile and did not respond to anyone. The paediatrician therefore sent him to a children's neurological clinic, where, after a series of examinations, the doctors diagnosed him with epilepsy and immediately put him on medication, which did not work immediately.
It took almost a year for the doctors to find the ideal combination of drugs, thanks to which he completely stopped having seizures. At the age of five, the doctors stopped the medication, and because the seizures did not return, the parents thought that Honza was healthy and began to encourage him to do more sports. He rode a bike, skied, played tennis and floorball, and spent his free time playing games with his sister and friends. At the age of eleven, however, he had another seizure and everything started again.
Doctors again tried various combinations of drugs, but this time nothing worked, seizures in the form of absences were constantly repeated. Since Honza always lost consciousness during a seizure, his parents were terrified that he would get it during sports and get injured. Gradually, Honza stopped riding a bike and exchanged downhill skis for cross-country skis and a snowboard. Although the sport caused him a seizure from time to time, he never gave it up completely. He even fulfilled his dream and ran the Spartan Race, but together with a friend who kept an eye on him to help in case of emergency.
When Honza was 15 years old, his parents decided to try to change doctors and turned to specialists at the University Hospital in Motol. After a series of examinations, the doctors there decided that Honza was a candidate for surgery to remove a lesion from his brain - the source of epileptic seizures. "I had to undergo two operations in a row. First, the doctors implanted probes into my brain that monitored its activity, and only then were they able to remove the lesion. It was hell for me for several weeks. I just had to lie there and hardly move, with wires sticking out of my head that were connected to a computer," recalls Honza.
The operation was successful and the doctors removed the relatively large lesion. "The first days after the operation were very mentally demanding, Honza was apathetic, confused, sad and hardly spoke. Compared to how lively and communicative he normally is, it was a frightening change, but fortunately everything returned to normal after a few days," describes his mother and adds: "A month and a half after the operation he had 1 seizure, but according to the doctors it happens. Since then he has been seizure-free for 3 months."
In this school year, Honza will graduate. In addition to sports, he enjoys languages and has begun to cooperate with the E Society, with which he goes to schools for discussions about epilepsy. Honza is not yet fully engaged in sports activities, he is starting to return to sports gradually. "I am learning how to play sports properly, how to breathe well so that I do not expose my body to sudden stress, which is quite a challenge with my competitive nature," explains Honza.
This year, therefore, he will not yet actively participate in the traditional EPPI boating triathlon, which brings together patients with epilepsy and healthy athletes and which takes place this weekend on 28 September 2019 at the Veselská sand pit. But maybe next year.

Not only for better water retention.
Environmental activists protested in Prague
According to the organizers, the steps taken so far by the government in terms of protecting and restoring the Czech landscape and addressing the climate crisis are insufficient, and the speakers called on the state to take a more vigorous approach.
The event, called The Last Drop, was attended by representatives of large organisations such as the Rainbow Movement, Greenpeace and the Green Party, as well as smaller local associations.
"For example, we have people who have been speaking out against the expansion of the Turów mine for a long time, there are people who are speaking out against the extraction of gravel at Uherské Ostroh, there are people who are speaking out against the construction of senseless dams," said Marika Volfová on behalf of the organizers.
She said that the main demands of the protesters are the creation of a plan for water retention in the landscape, a radical change in agricultural policy and the system of subsidies towards the promotion of sustainable agriculture and the fastest possible transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.
"The government is supposed to defend the interests of the people, not a ruthless and devastating business," she said.
A stand with a petition calling on the representatives of the Czech state to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and restore the Czech soil and landscape was placed on the Lesser Town Square.
The people present were equipped with banners with slogans such as "The end of the rape depression" or "Less coal, more newts."
Jan Škoda from the association For Water for People, which is protesting against the plan to mine gravel in the Hodonín region, has come to Prague from southern Moravia.
"It threatens the source of drinking water for 140,000 people," he said.
He added that boreholes represent the fifth most abundant source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
According to him, the planned extraction of gravel is located only about 500 meters from the wells and, according to assessments, it is certain that the quality of the water will be compromised.
Vojtěch Veselý came from the village of Valeč in the Karlovy Vary region to represent the so-called agroecological farmers.
He drew attention to the advantages of small farms that do not chase yields and profits and supply the population directly on the spot.
"Small agro-ecological farms are able to feed the entire population in a completely normal way, on top of which they do not cause such damage to the appearance of the countryside and the environment," he said.
Kovosvit is selling the administrative building and other halls. It expects worse times
Due to the restructuring, Kovosvit ended last year with a consolidated loss of 100 million crowns, the consolidated turnover was 1.3 billion. Among the main problems last year, Kuchař ranks the shortage of workers and shifts of subcontractors. This year, the demand for machine tools fell by 10 to 20 percent year-on-year. "This is also related to the expected decline in turnover by about ten percent," said the CEO. In 2017, Kovosvit had sales of 1.3 billion crowns and profit after tax of 40.1 million. The loss for 2016 was 719 million.
Kovosvit is now offering for sale several properties, halls and land that it either does not use or uses only minimally. This also applies to the office building, where it uses two of the five floors, and not yet completely. "Part of the long-term restructuring plan is to slim down Kovosvit, to make its activities more efficient. The sale of assets is not part of a momentary solution, whether it is, for example, cash flow, but part of a long-term plan, when we want to devote all resources to investment development," said the CEO.
About half of Kovosvit's production is exported. Its standard markets are the EU and Russia, last year to a lesser extent Asia. This year, Kuchař ranks India among the most interesting, where Kovosvit won an order for machines enabling five-axis machining worth 100 million crowns. This year, the company also exported two five-axis machines worth 30 million crowns to China. "Another order of the same volume has been negotiated, which we would like to fulfill by the end of the year," said Kuchař. On the Russian market and elsewhere, Kovosvit is facing restrictions due to sanctions.
Last year, the company sold two five-axis machining centers to France, a company that is a subcontractor of Airbus. This May, it delivered another machine, and it should deliver another one at the end of the year or at the beginning of 2020.
The company's main investment this year was the transfer of heating from steam to hot water for 20 million crowns. Kovosvit employs 500 people, the average worker's wage is 28,500 crowns. The company is looking for casting grinders for the foundry, machinists, lathe operators and electricians.
The company has been owned by industrialist and arms manufacturer Jaroslav Strnad since September 2016. The company has a tradition in the production of machine tools. It was founded in 1939 by Tomáš Baťa. At one time, the company had up to three thousand employees.
Three killed as plane crashes into house in Germany
Three people died and two others were injured today when an ultralight aircraft crashed into an apartment building in western Germany.
This was reported by the local rescue services, according to which two crew members and one resident of the house are probably among the dead.
The plane crashed on the roof of a building in the town of Wesel in North Rhine-Westphalia.
The attic apartment, which was one of five residential units in the building, subsequently caught fire.
Firefighters have already managed to bring the flames under control.
The deputy chief of the local fire brigade, Robert Meyboom, said that both crew members of the aircraft had apparently died.
The third victim is a woman who lived in the house, according to police.
The Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ) newspaper, citing the mayor of Wesel, reported that the woman was a single mother whose two-year-old daughter was rescued from the apartment with minor injuries.
An emergency parachute was found in the vicinity of the accident, which probably served as a brake during landing.
Police are working on the assumption that it came from the crashed plane.
There was room for two people in the aircraft.
The plane took off from the airport in the nearby town of Marl.
The Rheinische Post newspaper, citing eyewitnesses, reported that the plane had collided with a hot air balloon before crashing.
However, this information has not yet been confirmed.
WAZ, citing other witnesses, wrote that the plane broke up in the air before hitting the ground.
Accident on the D5: Motorway closed by a truck collision
The incident was reported at around 08:00 at the 22nd kilometre in the direction of Prague. "The motorway is closed, at least for freight traffic. Passenger cars can drive through the petrol station," said police spokeswoman Michaela Richterová in the morning. Traffic was restored at around 14:30. According to Richterová, the preliminary damage is at least two million crowns, and the cause of the accident is being investigated by police.
A spokesman for the Central Bohemian fire brigade, Petr Svoboda, said that one truck was transporting passenger vehicles and the other plastic granulate. "Due to the large impact, the transported vehicles were displaced, which the fire brigade had to first secure against a possible fall," he added.
One of the cars had a damaged fuel tank, from which about 200 liters of diesel leaked. The firefighters managed to pump out another 200 liters. Employees of the environmental department of the Beroun town hall were called to the accident because of the fuel leak. The recovery of the crashed vehicles and the opening of the highway was ensured by a private company, which also extracted the contaminated soil.
Microplastics have reached the human gut, study confirms for the first time
A team led by Professor Philipp Schwabl of the University of Vienna has published a study that for the first time proves the presence of microplastics in human faeces. The study is small, with eight participants from Europe, Japan and Russia - however, tiny plastic particles measuring between 50 and 500 micrometres were found in the samples of all examined persons. None of the eight subjects was a vegetarian, six of them did not avoid sea fish, all of them drank water from plastic bottles and food packaged in plastic.
And it would actually be a bit of a miracle if nothing was found. We already know that microplastics - which are either produced directly, for example for the needs of the cosmetics industry, or are formed by the disintegration of larger pieces - are present in marine animals, insects, tap water and soft drinks; in short, everywhere on the planet. Their entry into the human digestive tract has therefore only been officially confirmed. There were about 20 particles of microplastics per ten grams of stool, and scientists estimate that more than half of the world's population will have them.
However, mankind still does not know how bad it is - and what effect microplastics have on the "host" organisms. Small particles can get into the bloodstream or the lymphatic system and end up in the liver, for example. "This is the first study of its kind and has confirmed what we have long thought. Now that we have the first evidence of the occurrence of microplastics in the human body, we must continue to investigate what exactly this means for human health," says Schwabl.
So far, it is known that microplastics in the intestines can negatively affect the immune reactions of the digestive system, thereby facilitating the absorption of toxic chemicals and other pathogens into the body. And so far, there is no known solution other than to limit the use of plastics, especially polypropylene. However, this will be difficult - the first task facing governments and authorities will be to at least stop its steep increase. As far as plastic bottles are concerned, experts estimate that in three years humanity will consume a fifth more than today. The current rate is a staggering one million bottles bought per minute. Every year, about eight million tons of plastic end up in the seas and oceans. Waste threatens marine ecosystems and contaminates the digestive systems of marine animals.
Some countries have already introduced restrictions and other measures, Kenya, for example, has banned plastic bags - under the threat of draconian penalties. The European Commission is considering small bans (the well-known straws), and the Czech Ministry of the Environment is heading in the same direction. Critics, however, argue that such measures are nice, but completely insufficient.
The repair of the Krkonoše Museum will be delayed by a year
The administration of the Krkonoše National Park (KRNAP) has postponed the deadline for submitting bids for the second tender for the repair of the Krkonoše Museum in Vrchlabí by three weeks. The original deadline for opening the envelopes was September 20, said Radek Drahný, spokesman for the national park. The reason for the postponement of the deadline for submitting bids is the reduction of the budget from 110 million crowns to 83 million crowns.
"We are currently working with the prices that are on the market. There has been a change in the budget, it is the price that we expect to be offered. If someone makes an offer that is acceptable, the work will begin as soon as possible," said Drahný.
Compared to the original plans, the start of the repair of the museum is about a year late. KRNAP wanted to have a selected contractor for the construction part by the end of last year and to start construction work this spring. According to the management of the national park administration, the European subsidies of 123 million crowns for the project are not at risk.
The KRNAP administration has not been able to select a construction company for the repairs of the museum. It announced a second tender this summer, because in the previous tender all the offers of companies significantly exceeded the then expected price of 65 million. The offers exceeded 100 million crowns.
The museum, which is located in a former Augustinian monastery and belongs to the KRNAP Administration, has been closed since the autumn of 2017. The selected company should provide the construction part of the project. The total costs, including the construction of a new exhibition, are estimated at 210 million crowns. The KRNAP visitor centre should be built in the now vacated building by the end of 2021 after the transformation of the exhibitions.
The renovated museum with a new interactive exhibition, which should be a story of nature and people settled in the mountains and build on the successful Stone and Life exhibition, should serve as a representative gateway to the Giant Mountains for visitors. The visitor centre should provide information about the past and present of the Giant Mountains in the most understandable form and motivate people to discover the mountains and protect them. It should also take on the role of a traditional museum. The centre will also offer opportunities to organise concerts, festivals, theatre performances or lectures in the open air. The plans include the construction of a new entrance to the building, the creation of a research room and a café.
On Saturday, Česká spořitelna erroneously charged some card payments twice.
It has already corrected the error
Česká spořitelna erroneously charged its clients twice for some card payments on Saturday afternoon.
According to the bank's spokesman, Lukas Kropik, the problem could have affected thousands of transactions.
The savings bank has already rectified the error and returned the money to the clients.
The savings bank noticed problems with the double charging of card payments on Saturday afternoon.
"Yesterday (Saturday) night, we updated the system and all these duplicate payments were immediately returned to the clients.
At the moment everything is working without any problems," said Kropík on Sunday afternoon.
A spokesman for the bank does not know the exact number of clients to whom the bank deducted money from card payments twice; according to his estimate, there were fewer than a thousand transactions.
The savings bank is investigating the causes of the problems.
"It could have been a combination of several factors," Kropík said.
Česká spořitelna is the largest bank in the Czech Republic in terms of the number of clients.
At the end of March, it had 4.6 million.
The owner of the savings bank is the Austrian financial group Erste Group Bank, which is a key player in the banking market of Central and Eastern Europe.
Vojtěch will present a system of three emergency levels against the coronavirus on Monday
"They will be graded according to the strength of community spread at the regional level.
We are working on it together with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics," Vojtěch told Czech Television.
It will be a so-called traffic light, individual regions will be marked with green, orange or red according to the risk of coronavirus.
The minister added that he would discuss the classification of individual regions with epidemiologists.
He admitted that currently only the Moravian-Silesian Region would have an orange color and Prague would be close to it.
The map will also include individual measures for regional hygiene stations, hospitals, social facilities and employers.
"We want to solve this at the level of the regions, because the situation there is not uniform," Vojtěch said.
"A frightening result of the study." Islam does not belong in the West, the vast majority of Austrians think
1,200 respondents were questioned, and the survey shows a considerable distrust of Islam in Austrian society.
Almost 60 percent of Austrians fear that some Muslims are terrorists, and 48 percent would call for a ban on the construction of mosques. 80 percent of respondents are in favour of greater surveillance of Islamic centres.
A majority of Austrians also want Muslims to be restricted in their religious practices and say they sometimes feel like foreigners in their own country because of the presence of Muslims.
"The result of the study is frightening," says the author of the study, Wolfgang Aschauer, adding: "Such a tendency towards ethnocentrism could eventually lead to the adoption of discriminatory attitudes. There is a risk that the religious freedoms granted to Muslims will be narrowed."
Among believers, the critical attitude is less pronounced. Aschauer argues that in Austria it is not a conflict between religions, but between cultures. According to the sociologist, dialogue and education could help blunt polarization.
According to the study, the most hostile attitudes towards Muslims are held by extreme right-wing voters, people without a university degree and senior citizens over the age of 75. On the other hand, Green voters, people under the age of 30 and university students are the most welcoming.
According to estimates by the Austrian Ministry of the Interior, about 700,000 Muslims live in Austria, which has a population of about 8.7 million. The vast majority have Turkish roots. There are more than 400 Muslim places of worship and mosques in the country, and Islam has been officially recognized as a religion here since 1912.
Which cities will disappear under the sea?
The vote of the upper house of the Canadian Parliament confirmed a well-known rumor for several days: Canada is revoking the honorary citizenship of the former legend of the struggle for human rights, Nobel Peace Prize winner Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. The current leader of Myanmar (Burma), who spent years under house arrest for trying to bring freedom to her country, lost her honorary title because of her participation in the genocide against the minority Rohingya people.
The decision to strip Suu Kyi of her honorary citizenship was approved by the lower legislative body a week ago, and senators have now unanimously supported it. "This is the right message for her, for Myanmar and for the whole world," independent senator Ratna Omidvar commented on the decision of her colleagues. "We must make it clear that accomplices to genocide are not welcome here in Canada - especially as honorary citizens."
The verdict of the Canadian parliament does not technically change anything for Suu Kyi, it is only an honorary title, but on a symbolic level it is a strong message for her. The silence of the long-time human rights campaigner on the atrocities that the army of Buddhist-majority Myanmar has been committing for endless months against the Rohingya Muslim minority is unbearable.
The fact that an officially organized genocide is taking place in Myanmar and that Suu Kyi - the de facto prime minister of the government there - has completely failed in her duty to protect her citizens was recently brought to light by a UN report. Specifically, it mentions the names of several army commanders who, according to the investigation team, should stand trial for crimes against humanity committed in actions that - as the report says - "shock both by the horror of their actions and by their enormous scale." Suu Kyi and her administration, according to the UN, committed complicity primarily by covering up the actions of the soldiers and releasing a protective fog of lies around them - for example, that it was an "anti-terrorist operation."
After the removal of Suu Kyi, five personalities remain on the list of honorary citizens of Canada: the Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, Nelson Mandela, Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, Karim Aga Khan IV, the 49th Imam of Shia Muslims and Malala Yousafzai.
The development around the former icon of the struggle for freedom and democracy was also reflected by the Canadian Museum for Human Rights, where information about the atrocities against the Rohingya and the parliamentary decision to strip her of the title of honorary citizen were added to Suu Kyi's profile. "We have also dimmed the lighting of her photo on the board depicting the timeline of the struggle for human rights and we are thinking about replacing her face with a portrait of a member of the Rohingya minority," Canadian media quoted museum spokesman Rory McLeod as saying.
The only thing that will remain in Suu Kyi's current turmoil - at least for the time being - is the Nobel Peace Prize, awarded to her at the suggestion of Václav Havel in 1991 for her enormous contribution to the struggle for democracy. "Even though Ms Suu Kyi's current actions are regrettable, her award will not be annulled," the head of the Nobel Foundation, Lars Heikensten, told the Canadian CBS.

Tech companies want to rule our cities
In 1992, at the height of the wave of liberalism that followed the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Iron Curtain, the political scientist Francis Fukuyama wrote in his most famous book, The End of History and the Last Man: "What we may be witnessing ... is the end point of mankind's ideological evolution and the universal acceptance of Western liberal democracy as the final form of government."
Twenty-six years later, from the United States to Russia, from Turkey to Poland and from Hungary to Italy, we are witnessing the triumph of illiberal models and the rise of various forms of nationalism and radicalism. Fukuyama's current ninth book, Identity: The Demand for Dignity and the Politics of Resentment, attempts to come to terms with the emergence of these forces. As his interview with George Eaton for the New Statesman shows, he is rethinking many of his former positions: he claims that the ideas of socialism should return to the public space and that Marx was right in many respects. At the same time, he insists that his intellectual development is still in line with the position of the 1990s and that the critics of The End of History and the Last Man have not understood correctly.
"What I was saying back then was that one of the problems with modern democracy is that it provides peace and prosperity, but people want more than that... Liberal democracy doesn't even try to define what a good life is. It leaves it up to individuals who feel alienated, don't see the point, and therefore group themselves into identity groups that give them a sense of belonging."
At the time, The End of History and the Last Man was written as a powerful argument against Marxists who saw communism as the final stage of history. When Fukuyama is asked how he now perceives the rise of socialists in Britain and the US, he replies: "It all depends on what you mean by socialism. If we are talking about ownership of the means of production, then I don't think it will work, except when clear public services are in demand. But if you mean redistributive programs that try to solve the huge imbalances in income and wealth that we are witnessing, then yes. I think not only could it come back, it should come back. The long period that President Reagan and Prime Minister Thatcher started, in which certain types of ideas about the benefits of an unregulated market came into play, had a disastrous effect in many ways."
Finally, Fukuyama tries to calm down the current situation and warns all liberals that even the emergence of new regimes that are not entirely democratic will not mean the end of history.
Civilization on Borrowed Time
Recently, I remembered a beautiful "order" from one of the great stories by Šimek and Grossmann, set partly in a cemetery, which reads as follows: "I warned her that she was crying well, but on someone else's grave!" It occurred to me that many world politicians engaged in the senseless fight against climate change are now behaving in a very similar way.
They behave as if humans ruled the planet Earth. In reality, we are just a speck on its surface, which it can blow out with its enormous forces like a candle flame. Probably few of them watch the famous British and American natural science documentaries dealing with the destructive capabilities of our blue marble. After all, it would be enough for one of the larger active volcanoes to "blow up" and our advanced civilization would be ruined.
And it is highly likely that this will happen in the near future. According to leading volcanologists, a number of large volcanoes are "locked and loaded" (for example, Katla in Iceland).
In a way, it would be ideal if the eruption, if it has to happen, happened as soon as possible, before trillions of dollars are wasted on measures aimed at reducing the production of carbon dioxide, because any really angry volcano can release it, along with dust and poisonous volcanic gases, into the atmosphere at least a hundred times more than was saved at the expense of the people of Europe.
Forcibly limiting the production of CO2 therefore makes no sense. In addition, it has been scientifically proven that with a significantly higher proportion of CO2 in the air, plants produce more biological matter and are also more resistant to drought. For humanity, a possible warming is significantly more favourable than, for example, a rapid return of the ice age.
If we realize the still insufficiently studied influence of solar cycles on the Earth's climate, we must come to only one reasonable conclusion: Let's try hard to keep the Earth as clean as possible, and let's try to adapt to other changes, with which we cannot compete, with the least possible cost!
The Water Sprite and Caroline
When the water sprite Jonáš and the miller's daughter Karolínka fall in love with each other, it is not easy at all.
Jonas is prevented from falling in love by his father, the grumpy water sprite Hastrbuch, while Caroline has no idea that her beloved Jonas is not human.
Fortunately, there is a young man, Libor, who will do everything in his power to protect the whole village, and especially Karolína, from the villain of Vodnice.
What does it matter if he schemes and lies?
Especially if he can get Karolína to reject Jonáš in favour of him, the valiant Libor.
Soon it becomes clear to everyone in the village who is to blame for the drowning of the night watchman Konvička, the spoiled flour, the fire in the mill and other villainy.
The angry villagers organize a hunt for the water sprite, and on top of that an implacable water sprite curse falls on Jonah's head.
And now, Konvička's little soul, advise Karolína!
How to soften old Hastrbuch, to convince the neighbors of Jonah's innocence, to find Jonah and free him from the spell?
The fairy tale was filmed in September 2010 in the Czech Television studios and on location at the Brzina pond, in Obděnice in the Sedlčany region and in the beautiful surroundings of the historic mill in Hoslovice.

Plíšek's environment in Tashkent was a testimony, in 2016 she won her first tournament on the WTA circuit and this year she acted very confidently.
After wins with Paolini, Kawa and Kužmová, she fought her way into the top four players.
But the match with Alison Van Uytvanck did not go well for Kristýna. The Belgian held her serve and broke Plíšková's serve twice in the first set. In the second set, Van Uytvanck took an early 3-0 lead and Kristýna did not manage to turn the tide, although she managed to convert one break point in the end. In the last one, she turned away one match point, but the second one came to an end.

Purposeful slander? Usti Zoo is looking for a new veterinarian, no one is interested
The last time was at the end of this month. The city administration attributes this to the rumors that swirled around the former director of the zoo and veterinarian Václav Poživil that he purposefully killed the exotic animals he cared for. For example, it was a female rhino Zamba, an elephant Kalu or an orangutan Ňuňák.
The city council has therefore announced a new contract. "For veterinary care for the zoo with an estimated value of 3.5 million crowns excluding VAT and for the city's Centre for Animals in Need with an estimated value of 2.8 million crowns excluding VAT," said city spokeswoman Romana Macová.
Deputy Mayor Věra Nechybová (UFO) explained that this is the third time the city has announced a competition for veterinary services in this way. "Doctor Poživil had to explain these unfounded suspicions. I consider this to be a blatant defamation of such a high-quality expert," she noted.
According to her, there are very few experts specializing in exotic animals. "It's definitely not pleasant. So far, the zoo provides veterinary care in the form of orders," she said. Orders and contracts cost the same amount of money. "However, the garden must comply with the Public Procurement Act in terms of financing," explained zoo spokeswoman Nikola Roštejnská.
Václav Poživil himself is one of the recognized experts. For example, he participated in a unique operation in which the Ústí cheetah Jane was the first cheetah in the world to receive a total endoprosthesis. He served as director of the zoo from 2009 to 2012. He did not comment on anonymous slander against his person. Yesterday, he did not accept phone calls or respond to SMS text messages.
As far as the contract for the zoo is concerned, some veterinarians believe that the lack of interest in it is not necessarily due to fears of similar purposeful accusations, as in his case, but simply a lack of information. For example, Jiří Král, a veterinarian from Ústí nad Labem, has not heard about it yet. "This is the first time I've heard about it from you. No one has approached us. I think this kind of thing will spread quickly," he added.
Most Autodrom is launching a new e-shop
Customers of the Most circuit can use a new e-shop on its website.
They will also be able to buy coupons for free and test drives by car or motorcycle on a large racing circuit, which was previously only possible in person at the autodrome employee in the starting tower.
"We have taken steps to improve the e-shop so that it is user-friendly, and at the same time we have expanded the portfolio of products and services that can be purchased through it.
At the same time, we have prepared a bonus for our customers on this occasion in the form of a discount of CZK 1,000 on all safe driving courses from our offer.
The discount coupon can be found on the website www.autodrom-most.cz," explained Jana Svobodová, Sales and Marketing Director of AUTODROM MOST.
According to her, the website of the e-shop is now clear, the customer can easily navigate through it.
"The visitor to the e-shop selects the focus they are aiming for on the bar.
For example, sports, safe or sporty driving courses, training, experience programs, gift items, gift vouchers, activities for children and others," said the director.
The novelties in the products and services offered by the e-shop include, for example, a T-shirt of the Racing Legends collection with a surprise, a race track, a course on safe driving in reduced visibility, advertising and gift items of the domestic professional racing team Buggyra Racing or Engelmuller gloves from the limited edition of the BOHEMATIC watch manufactory, created on the occasion of the historic victory in the prestigious 24 Hours of Le Mans race in 1949.
"The offer is very varied, the customer can choose from more than 200 items," said Jana Svobodová.
When paying for the selected product or service, the customer can choose one of four options.
Payment by deposit (bank transfer), cash on delivery, cash in person or online via a payment gateway.
Plane crash near Žinkov in the Pilsen region: Two people did not survive the accident
Two people were travelling in the plane, a man (†63) and a woman (†38). "The plane asked for permission to land at Chaloupky airport near Klatovy at half past eight in the evening," said police spokeswoman Dana Ladmanová. This was also the last record, at that time, according to GPS coordinates, it should have been located near Vojovice near Žinkov.
However, it did not reach the Klatovy airport. A search immediately began for the lost aircraft, which sent a distress signal. "In addition to the police helicopter, a military helicopter was also involved," said police spokeswoman Martina Korandová. But the search did not have a happy ending.
In the forest near Petrovice near Měčín, which is about six kilometers from the place where the plane was last reported, the crew of the helicopter noticed the wreckage before nine o'clock in the morning. "We found the plane and two bodies without signs of life," confirmed Korandová.
The crashed aircraft remained partially wedged in the branches of trees, and pieces also fell to the ground in the vicinity. "We will investigate the cause of the accident in cooperation with experts and employees of the Institute for the Expert Investigation of the Causes of Aviation Accidents," Korandová added.
The course of the disease of the majority is mild, only three percent of those infected have to go to the hospital
Either a milder form of the coronavirus is spreading through the Czech Republic, or our summer dose of sunshine has significantly improved our immunity.
Infectious disease wards in hospitals are half-empty, even though the number of infected people is on the rise.
"The situation today and in April is completely different and this is mainly due to the number of people hospitalized," confirms the Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch.
It is worth recalling that on April 11, when the first wave of the epidemic peaked in our country, everyone wore masks, the army carried out the sampling, the republic was closed and the Czechs consumed disinfectant for a year in advance.
In spite of this, ten people died every day.
Now the daily increases in the number of infections are higher, but at most two people die every day with covid-19.
Karviná still has the highest number of infected people per capita, and Jihlava already has similar numbers due to an outbreak in the local Alzheimer's centre, where there are already 57 infected people - 40 clients and 17 employees.
Another home for the elderly was closed by sanitary inspectors in Černožice in Hradec Králové.
The disease was confirmed by tests on one of the nurses.
"We are tracing, we have restricted movement, we have all the hygienic measures," says the director of the retirement home, Martin Scháněl.
According to him, none of the clients of the home have symptoms of the disease so far.
The hygienists will begin to carry out comprehensive testing tomorrow and will then decide on further measures.
Hospitals are also responding to the increased number of infected people.
The Institute of Oncology in Brno today launched an automatic camera system at the entrance, which detects whether people are wearing a mask when they enter.
The record is reported by the South Bohemian hygienists, who have recorded twenty-five cases of coronavirus - most of them are foreign employees of the Prachatice company.
A total of 131 people were infected on Saturday - half of the number on Friday - but fewer tests are carried out at the weekend.
Only children. We do not have a certain reproduction, but we do not have to scare
Some words have ominous connotations, even though they only convey a state of affairs. One of them is the word "one-child." It refers to a child growing up without siblings, but it does not sound neutral. "You know, an only child," is said without the need to add anything. It is interesting that "one-child" has had this feature for a long time, even from the times when expressions such as the demographic crisis were not widely used.
Today, even people outside the scientific community know that a fertility rate of 2.1 children per woman is necessary to ensure the simple reproduction of the population. It is also widely known that no state in Europe today reaches this value. At most, France or Sweden are close to it, but the simple reproduction rate of the population is not ensured by European states. (In the West, only Israel stands out with a total fertility of 3.1 children per woman.) It is a situation made for alarmism. Therefore, it is not surprising that the Minister of Labor and Social Affairs Maláčová also falls for it: "There are almost as many one-child families as two-child families," she said in an interview with LN. But she forgot the devil hidden in the detail.
Yes, it is good to draw attention to the problem, instead of downplaying or ideologizing it, as in Germany, where the campaign for more children easily gets the label of fascism (in the style of "even Hitler supported it"). It is good to be reminded that many couples directly plan to have only children. It is good if politicians show the will to remove the obstacles that lead to these decisions (for example, the weak spread of work from home discourages women from further pregnancies). But despite all this, let us point out one thing.
When Minister Maláčová says that "there are almost as many single children," there is a drop of demagogy in it. That statement was appropriate twenty years ago. Let us recall that fertility in the Czech Republic last ensured simple reproduction in 1980 ("Husák's children"). Then it fell to a terrible 1.14 in 2000. But since then it has risen by almost fifty percent, to the current 1.70 children per woman, which is above the European average. It is still not enough for simple reproduction, so the activity of politicians is appropriate. Only with this alarmism can they reduce a little.
Neckermann cancels all flights, affecting five hundred Czech clients
Neckermann is cancelling the flights in connection with the insolvency of the British Thomas Cook and its German subsidiary.
"The Czech company Thomas Cook, s. r. o., trading under the name Neckermann Travel Agency, has not filed for insolvency," Šrámek said in a press release.
"However, CK Neckermann is forced to continue to cancel the planned departures of its clients," he added, adding that this currently applies to all departures from 26 September to 6 October.
According to Šrámek, about 500 clients will be affected by the cancellation of flights. According to him, 800 clients of Neckermann, who are currently abroad, "will be taken care of and their safe return to the Czech Republic on their scheduled flight is ensured."
The travel agency admitted that some clients were asked to pay for their stay. "In such a case, it is necessary for clients to immediately contact the SOS line of the Neckermann travel agency," Šrámek added.
The collapse of Thomas Cook took place on Monday. In August of this year, the travel agency entered into an agreement on the basis of which creditors were to invest 900 million pounds in the company.
Half of the sum was to be obtained from the Chinese company Fosun Tourism, which was to become the majority owner. The other half was to be provided by bondholders and creditor banks. However, on September 20, it was reported that the creditors had demanded that the travel agency obtain a reserve of 200 million pounds, otherwise the deal would fall through. On Monday, the company announced that it had gone bankrupt.
Jaromír Soukup spoke about Gott: He wishes him peace and quiet
Presenter and entrepreneur Jaromír Soukup (50) is not afraid of any questions. In his show Call and write to the boss, he publicly comments on various topics. And he is no stranger to tabloid cases, which he comments on in a sparkling and humorous way. Although this time he did not feel like laughing.
Jaromír Soukup commented on the sad news, which is the very serious illness of Karel Gott. He promised the singer one very considerate thing for himself.
"You know, Karel fell ill and he said it fairly, without tabloid journalists having to dig it up somewhere. I don't want to comment on it, it's a serious illness, we all respect Karel Gott immensely. And I would like to wish him, of course, a successful treatment and, above all, peace! Peace, which he needs now," said the owner of Barrandov TV.
"I wish the media would leave him alone. And wait for the news that the Master himself decides to give to the media. I don't even like the various expressions of what his old friends and various celebrities think about his health. And for our media, I can say that we will only pay attention to his illness and his person if he shows interest in it. In my opinion, other media should consider a similar approach."
Mahulena Bočanová has interrupted her annual detox and is sinning again!
More than a year ago, Mahulena Bočanová confided to Blesk that she had quit alcohol. "During the holidays, I said to myself that I would give my old, exhausted fifty-year-old body a breather. I gave myself a deadline forever. I feel terribly rested, I have a lot of energy and, most importantly, my psyche has improved. Recently, I have not been in a good place mentally. I wake up better, I do not have a headache, I have more energy and money."
A year of abstinence was enough and the actress found her way back to alcohol. "Sometimes I have bubbles or quality wine, but I don't drink what I used to. I have one glass and I have fun until the morning. I have a bottle of wine in the fridge for a week. I also enjoyed non-alcoholic beer, which I can drink at any time," said Mahulena, who is still a couple with Brno businessman Petr.
Bočanová also returned to the theatre season after the holidays and will now join the series Ordinace v růžové zahrady. "I'm ashamed of the first two performances, I was really bad, I was slurring my words. But it's getting better," smiles the actress critically.
The pair wrapped the bitch with tape and drowned her in the river, the children found the bag
The case took place at the end of July in the village around Valašské Klobouk. A 27-year-old woman brought home a one to two-year-old dog, which she wanted to take care of. However, her partner, who is ten years older, did not like the fact that it was a female dog, so he decided to get rid of it.
"He wrapped the animal with adhesive tape and rope and significantly eliminated its vocal expression. He put the dog in a jute bag, which he tied up. Then they took the animal together to the river, where they threw it in a bag. At the moment when the dog was thrown into the water, the dog was demonstrably alive," said Zlín police spokeswoman Monika Kozumplíková.
The next day, children who were playing by the river found a jute bag on the bank. When they opened it, they discovered the body of a dead dog inside. They called a woman who was passing by and ran away. The woman reported the incident to the police emergency number 158.
"Thanks to the knowledge of the inhabitants of the town, the police found out who was probably the perpetrator of this incredible act. And they were not mistaken. Both the man and the woman confessed to the crime and described how the event took place," the police spokeswoman added.
An expert opinion from the field of veterinary medicine confirmed that the dog died in a clearly agonizing way as a result of suffocation, where the animal suffered for several minutes before death.
"The actions of the perpetrators undoubtedly show a clear intention to get rid of the animal at all costs in this despicable way, even though they could have donated or sold the dog. The commissioner of the criminal police from Zlín accused the pair of committing a crime of animal cruelty committed in complicity. Both of the charges, which have not yet been punished, could spend up to three years behind bars if convicted," Kozumplíková noted.
Declaration of the end of the right in the Chamber of Deputies, or what kind of "right-wing" coalition of ODS, TOP 09, STAN and KDU?
Recently, there have been reports in the media and in commentaries about an upcoming coalition of the aforementioned parties. Many are applauding the fact that the "right" is finally coming together, but I rather wonder why these parties are still calling themselves right-wing.
If I ignore the new Trikolora movement, the Czech Chamber of Deputies no longer has a real right-wing party. And it does not matter at all how the subjects label themselves or what label is parroted by the mainstream media. ODS is hardly centrist in its average of top politicians of this party, TOP 09 is clearly a party of the urban pseudo-liberal left (which is ashamed of its leftism and thus hypocritically describes itself as conservative or even right-wing). STAN is a party that basically merges with TOP 09 in its concept, ideology and voter targeting (the reason for its existence is simply not clear to me). And KDU even labels itself as centrist for a long time - but their political compass is much more to the left than they say.
If I consider myself a classically liberal right-wing voter, the highest value for me is the freedom of the individual, the free market and minimal state interference in the lives of individuals and the economy. How do these parties fulfil this general assumption of right-wingness? How many laws cutting people's freedoms by the salami method, increasing taxes, confirming new regulations and increasing surveillance, increasing ties to the socialist EU or supporting environmental and gender madness have they supported in recent years? A lot, really a lot. Not their own labels, but actions identify them. These parties, despite all kinds of declarations or partial concessions, want to strengthen the role of the state in our lives. And that has nothing to do with right-wingness.
I would not be at all surprised by the coalition cooperation of TOP 09, STAN and KDU, they simply belong together on the political map and, except for Christian or, on the contrary, homosexual and gender aspects, I basically do not see any obvious difference in them for voters in terms of the influence of the state on their lives. However, ODS has long portrayed itself as "the only right-wing party" and, by associating with these three entities, it no longer openly reveals its true political classification.
By the way, when I briefly mentioned the labels, have you noticed how often all these parties quite consistently and cheaply label the critics of dirigisme and socialism coming from the European Union as pro-Russian agents? Are they unable or just unwilling to understand that there are many people for whom Euro-socialism and the growing lack of freedom do not smell as strongly as the authoritarian regime in Russia? Are they not concealing their complete inability to argue and their groundless or blind adoration of Euro-EU conditions?
In short, it is possible that in the Czech Republic, politics other than the center no longer has a chance of greater success. Maybe voters really want such a combination. Maybe they want left-of-center politics under the guise of the "right," because they are ashamed of their political beliefs (or they can't even identify them). I don't know. But I am definitely not one of those voters.
Debutant to champion!
Van den Bergh completes fairytale, sweeps aside Anderson
The big surprise of the tournament, Dimitri van den Bergh, also showed an excellent performance against the player who won the second most prestigious event in the PDC in 2018.
The beginning of the match was evenly balanced on both sides, the turning point came at 8:7 for the Belgian darts player.
Van den Bergh took the break with a 13-dart leg and had the upper hand from then on.
He literally crushed his opponent with his game and the significantly more experienced "Flying Scotsman" had a hard time getting to the doubles.
The way the "Dream Maker" had him in the palm of his hand is evidenced by the fact that the distracted Anderson played his first maximum only in the 24th leg.
On top of that, the young Belgian handled the high checkouts perfectly.
The last time he lost was in the eleventh leg, but under unfavorable conditions he "caught a big fish" and closed 170.
At the end of the match, Anderson was visibly frustrated.
Rather, he just threw the darts and his opponent, who was going for the triumph, behaved in an absolutely masterful manner.
Van den Bergh converted the first of three match darts and lived up to his name - he wrote his big dream.
Winning the trophy named after Phil Taylor is all the more valuable for the Belgian darts player as it is his first major win.
It remains true that the last player who managed to beat van den Bergh is Karel Sedláček.
Babiš calls for security cooperation at memorial for victims of terror
On 27 September 2019, Prime Minister Andrej Babiš and his wife Monika visited the Ground Zero memorial to the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 in New York.
Terrorism is the main enemy against which all countries of the world should fight together. At the end of a five-day visit to the United States, Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš said this today at the New York memorial to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. On this occasion, the Prime Minister paid tribute to the memory of two victims of Czech origin.
"This is a very moving place," said the prime minister, accompanied by his wife Monika, as he laid a white rose next to the names of Lukáš Rambousek and the Czechoslovak emigrant Alena Sešínová. Both were among the more than 2,750 people killed in the attack by hijacked planes on the former twin skyscrapers of the World Trade Center (WTC). The WTC towers collapsed after the impact, and in their place there is now a memorial with a list of names of victims.
"It is necessary to remember what happened here, the horror," said Babiš. The attack on the USA on 11 September 2001 was described by the Prime Minister as a reason why the United Nations should cooperate in a united campaign against international terrorism. In addition to the destruction of the WTC skyscrapers, the terrorists crashed a hijacked plane into the building of the Ministry of Defence in Washington and were planning another strike on a target in Washington, probably the White House or Congress. However, this plane crashed when the passengers stood up to the hijackers.
"This is our main enemy, where all the countries of the world should unite and fight against international terrorism in a coordinated manner," the Czech Prime Minister added.

Czechs in Europe by Ondřej Houska: Should Czechoslovakia have rejected the Munich Agreement in 1938 and gone to war with Germany? Three times NO
An undated photo shows Adolf Hitler during a visit to the Czechoslovak border fortifications. The purpose of the fortifications was never to stop the German army, but to slow down its advance until the Allies got involved.
If, almost exactly 81 years ago, Czechoslovakia had rejected the Munich Agreement and subsequently faced a German attack, what would have knocked the most Czechoslovak soldiers out of the fight? German tanks, air force, or perhaps artillery? Quite possibly it would not have been any of these weapons, even though the Germans had an overwhelming advantage over the Czechoslovaks in them. The Czechoslovak army would probably have suffered the greatest losses - due to blisters.
Charges dropped in Nantes cathedral fire, man confesses
The Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul in the heart of Nantes caught fire last Saturday, severely damaging the original 16th century stained glass windows and destroying the organ.
Investigators investigated the suspicion of arson due to the fact that the fire advanced through the temple from three different places.
At the same time, the police found no signs at the entrances that anyone had forced their way into the cathedral.
The accused is a volunteer with the local diocese, a 39-year-old Rwandan refugee.
Police arrested him shortly after the fire, but then released him without pursuing criminal charges.
Now the prosecutor's office has reported that, on the basis of new evidence, the man was arrested again on Saturday, confessed and is facing charges of arson.
If found guilty, he faces up to ten years in prison and a hefty fine.
According to his lawyer, the man regrets the act and has decided to fully cooperate with the investigators, Le Monde wrote.
Zeman the preservationist - The man stretching the constitution calls for the enforcement of the law
Those who move in a society divided into camps and do not want to go completely mad will welcome situations where they do not have to cheer only for their own. When they can admit the pluses to those whom they otherwise criticize. If only so that they do not have the feeling that they are orienting themselves only according to pre-assigned labels. Such situations include the list of heavily damaged monuments that President Zeman fences with during his favorite trips to the regions.
Everyone knows what is going on. And anyone who occasionally travels through the Czech Republic sees many of the devastated monuments - from the centres of historic towns to individual castles, monasteries, old houses, churches or farms - with their own eyes. Everyone suspects that demagogy may also come into play here. That if we accuse the town hall of not caring about monuments or some horror in the zoning plan, it may be the work of former administrations. Or a privatised object whose owner is not traceable. The head of state calls on local politicians: "The section of the Heritage Act allows you to fine the owners of objects who do not take care of their property." But even if the owner is untraceable, it must be admitted that the president calls for the enforcement of the law. Which even critics of his bending of the constitution should recognise as a plus.
Of course, Miloš Zeman would not be Miloš Zeman if he considered all the details and formalities of a complex problem. But he stands up for a good cause, just like the squatters, whom he himself does not recognize. Two years ago, we wrote: "Despite all the abuse, the squatters draw attention to a problem that is beyond the current interest. To the fact that this or that building is in a state of disrepair." And let's admit that the president is de facto doing the same thing.
If you come to the historic center of Jáchymov, you will be amazed at how devastated it is - including the houses with Renaissance cores. At a time when Jáchymov is celebrating 500 years of silver mining and the minting of thalers (for Americans, dollars). Why? Apparently because of the quick sale of houses in the 1990s, local officials say. But why is it that seven kilometers away, Ostrov, the seat of the Šliks, who minted the Jáchymov thalers, has a nicely repaired historical core? It is good if the president draws attention to these things.
Vojtěch: On Monday we will present a "traffic light" for epidemiological measures
The new system is intended to fulfil the role of a pandemic plan, the absence of which has led to criticism of the government and the Ministry of Health.
"The levels will be according to the strength of community spread," the minister explained.
He added that at present, for example, the Moravian-Silesian Region or Prague would reach the middle, orange level.
The system is designed as a regional one, because the situation in individual regions varies significantly, he added.
The ministry worked with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (IHIS) on the system.
According to the minister, specific measures will be linked to the individual levels, whether it is the obligation to wear masks or the organization of special departments in hospitals.
Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) called for the creation of an epidemiological plan in the Prima Partie television programme, according to which people should have clear information about what measures they can expect if the epidemiological situation worsens.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has been growing in recent days, although the number of people hospitalized remains low.
Vojtěch commented that nothing major was happening and that it was not appropriate to talk about declaring a state of emergency or reconvening the crisis management team.
In view of the growing number of infected people, the government has reintroduced the obligation to wear masks at indoor events of more than 100 people throughout the Czech Republic from Saturday.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be limited to 500 people, now it is 1000 people.
The government's approach, where it was not clear until the last minute what measures and when they would come into force or when they would be announced, was criticised.
"I think that in a situation that is quite tense, the main actors should, on the contrary, create a sense of security and, on the contrary, straighten out the confusion," Senator Marek Hilšer said in Questions.
The measures can already vary according to the region, for example, in Prague from Sunday it is mandatory to wear masks even in non-residential medical facilities, for example in pharmacies or in doctor's waiting rooms.
The obligation to wear masks when visiting health and social care facilities or pharmacies has also been introduced in the Liberec and Ústí regions since Friday.
In the Vysočina region in the Jihlava region, it has been necessary to wear masks in indoor public spaces, on public transport and in healthcare facilities since 14 July.
On the other hand, anti-epidemic measures have been relaxed in the Moravian-Silesian Region, as well as in the Central Bohemian Region in the Kutná Hora region.
At the beginning of June, the Czech government also approved the so-called traffic light for Europe, which distinguishes the level of risk of infection in individual European countries and accordingly adjusts the rules applicable to entry into the Czech Republic from these countries.
For countries with a low and medium risk, the authorities have not required Czech citizens to test negative for the coronavirus since 15 June or have not ordered quarantine instead.
These are mandatory for the return of Czechs from high-risk countries.
At the moment, all EU member states are now in the low risk category.
Costa Rica is a champion in the fight against climate change
Costa Rica received the title for several reasons. For starters, for the plan to be carbon neutral by 2050 - however, many countries have committed to this under the Paris Agreement. The Central American state with a population of about five million produces only 0.4 percent of global emissions. Costa Rica has also committed to fully switch to renewable energy sources by 2030, with 70 percent of buses or taxis running on electricity.
The official tourism organization reports that about 95 percent of the energy already comes from renewable sources - in 2017, Costa Rica ran on them for a total of 300 days.
Costa Rica boasts almost thirty national parks.
Rainforests with diverse fauna and flora, which cover more than half of the country's territory, are also one of the main tourist attractions. "Costa Rica is a pioneer in the field of nature conservation and sets an example for other countries in the region and around the world. Climate change requires urgent action from all of us," the UN said in a statement.
Costa Rica can boast of almost thirty national parks, which is really a lot considering the small size of the country (51,100 square kilometers). Rain or cloud forests, coral reefs or mangrove swamps are home to five percent of the world's biodiversity. The country also has volcanoes, picturesque waterfalls and you can also find several rescue stations for sloths.
Be kind to the planet. The Night of Scientists begins in Prague
"In Prague, I would definitely visit the Czech Technical University and take a look at the model of what smart cities will look like. At Charles University, I would visit the Institute of Anatomy at the Faculty of Medicine, which is not open to the public at other times," advises Jitřenka Navrátilová, national coordinator of the Night of Scientists.
The Institute of Anatomy offers a tour of the dissecting room and the opportunity to try working with surgical instruments.
"Then I would go to the Czech University of Life Sciences and watch the film The Green Desert," adds Navrátilová. Nine laboratories will also offer guided tours. The motto of this year's Night of Scientists is "friendly to the planet."
Wife swap: Ondra was cruelly abused by his parents and ended up in an institution
It was nerve-wracking. The allegedly troubled son Ondřej (9) was severely punished by his father at every moment. "He came home from school and lied about having a snack. Lukáš looked at me and said that he would kneel as punishment," Lucie described in Exchange. Dad Lukáš forced little Ondřej to kneel in a corner for several hours! In addition, away from the cameras, he had to suffer like this on a wooden mat to massage his feet! "Ondřej came to me after the shooting and told me - aunt, I am making these troubles and notes just so that I am not here, because I want to go to an institution," Lucie described the moment when she fully understood what was happening behind the door of the studio. And the boy's wish finally came true...
His condition was so serious that he was taken away from his family after the shooting and placed in the Centre for Educational Care in České Budějovice for a month. He returned to his father and surrogate mother Aneta (28) for a short time, but then went to a diagnostic institute for troubled children. "When I arrived home, Aneta immediately added me on Facebook, we wrote to each other for a while. She was most interested in whether we had received money. I almost did not respond to that. But then she wrote to me that the little one was in the institute, that he was then returned to them, now he is in the diagnostic centre. They are both out of work," says mother Lucie from Pilsen.
Of course, Blesk also reached out to the other party, but received only a vague response. "I'm not in the mood, I'm sick, call back later," Aneta said and hung up the phone.
Přindiš, Prskavec and Fišerová safely advanced to the semi-finals of the World Championship
Kayakers Vít Přindiš and Jiří Prskavec and canoeist Tereza Fišerová safely advanced to the semi-finals of the ICF Canoe Slalom World Championships in Seu d'Urgell. Přindiš was fourth in Friday's qualification, Prskavec fifth and Fišerová eighth. Three other Czech representatives will be aiming for a semi-final start in Spain in the afternoon corrective qualifying race.
From the strong representative group of kayakers, Vavřinec Hradilek did not succeed, who received a fifty-second penalty right at the beginning of the ride for incorrectly passing the gate. Přindiš and Prskavec, on the other hand, can now rest and concentrate on Sunday's semi-final.
"I set myself the goal of making it into the top 30 in the first run, which I managed to do. Not that I didn't care how I did, because on Sunday the start is very early in the morning, so I was hoping to be a little higher to have a better starting position," said Přindiš, praising his well-being in Seo. "Before the patrol race I felt the worst in the 14 days we've been here. Then during the race it was good and today it was better again. It's been beautiful here all the time, nice races, the spectators came, so it's fine," he smiled.
Prskavec was also satisfied. "In qualifying, you don't want to make an unnecessary mistake. In the first gates, I didn't quite get it. Then I drove the middle perfectly, without any problems and I knew I had the mileage, so the second mistake came when I wanted to go straight down and I turned the erka. Overall, I can't be dissatisfied. The form is there, we'll see how it goes," said this year's overall World Cup winner.
Both representatives praised the fact that they will go to the start on Sunday only at the end of the semi-final block. "I'm not an early bird, it's also cold here in the morning, and when you're here at eight, you want to have a jacket and a sweatshirt," said Přindiš. "Overall, the semi-final takes an hour and a half, which is quite a good difference in terms of sleep," agreed Prskavec.
Of the three Czech canoeists, only Fišerová succeeded, Eva Říhová finished two places behind the top twenty, Kateřina Havlíčková was 35th. "I skied the upper part according to my expectations, in the middle passage it seemed to me that I couldn't keep up and I wasn't going according to plan, but I managed to get into the comfortable track that I wanted to go. I made two shots and I'm just behind the winner with a clean time. I have a good starting position for the semifinals," Fišerová praised.

Thank you for the dance! Leonard Cohen's final album to be released posthumously
Thanks for the Dance will feature unreleased material and various musical collaborations put together by the singer's son, and will be released on 22 November.
In October 2016, the album You Want it Darker was released, on which Cohen collaborated with his son Adam. He asked him to help him finish the individual songs. On the intimate recording, Cohen symbolically comes to terms with his impending death. He died a month after the release of the album at the age of 82.
Seven months later, Adam Cohen began to work on the material left to him by his father. He invited a number of musicians to work with him - Damien Rice, Bryce Dessner, Javier Mas and the singer Beck.
"When we came up with the music for my father's words, we used his own characteristic musical techniques. So he is still with us," said Adam Cohen about the album. "What impresses me most about it are the reactions of those who have already heard it. One after the other, they say that Leonard is still alive," he added.
The first swallow of the album is the short song The Goal. "I'm almost alive, I'm almost home," Cohen sings in his characteristic honeyed voice. He sang about death, he suspected that he would not live to see the release of new material. He even admitted it in an interview with The New Yorker magazine a month before his death. "I'm ready to die. I hope it won't be too unpleasant," he said.
In September 2018, Adam Cohen published a collection of his father's poetry called The Flame, which will be published by Argo on 31 December.
Going on holiday with just a credit card? The NEO account offers free withdrawals from ATMs all over the world!
According to surveys, about half of all Czechs who travel abroad have already got used to paying directly by card. The main reasons include convenience, security, but also the possibility of using travel insurance, which is often associated with a payment card.
The convenience of paying by card can be appreciated by travellers in almost every corner of the world. This is especially true in popular tourist destinations, but nowadays payment cards are accepted almost everywhere. "People who travel more often, for example for work, do not have time to repeatedly go to exchange offices to exchange cash. And even "holidaymakers" do not want to rely on the fact that cash is enough for them. In addition, Czech banks or exchange offices do not even have some foreign currencies. For the NEO account, we have therefore solved this so that its users can withdraw cash from all ATMs free of charge, wherever they are," says Kateřina Petko, Director of Marketing and Communications and Spokesperson of Expobank CZ.
In addition, a payment card is a much more reliable way of not losing your money than cash. If you lose a full wallet, its owner may not be able to wait for the money he carried in it. However, if he only loses his payment card, he can easily block it immediately over the phone or via online banking. If he acts quickly, he may not suffer any financial loss at all. "In addition to their reliable protection, keeping money in a bank account has other advantages. For example, the NEO account has an interest rate of 1.6% per year, which is one of the highest among current and savings accounts. Its establishment and management takes place completely online without the need to visit a branch. In addition, the money in the bank account is insured up to 100 thousand euros and account management is completely free," adds Kateřina Petko.
For anyone who is going to travel abroad, travel insurance should be a matter of course. Thanks to the possibility of arranging it and paying by card online, it can be done even at the last minute. However, the mere possession of a payment card often means insurance protection when traveling. "For example, with embossed MasterCard Gold and MasterCard Business cards, travel insurance is an integral part of foreign travel to all countries of the world. Holders of these cards can also insure their family with whom they are traveling. They often do not need any further arrangements," adds Kateřina Petko from Expobank CZ. However, it is always advisable to check the scope of the insurance, i.e. whether it covers all activities that travelers plan to undertake.
The Ministry is planning a meal plan from 2021. Nothing will change in terms of tax
The Ministry of Finance is preparing an amendment to the Income Tax Act, according to which the employee would receive money for meals directly. According to the Ministry of Finance, a quarter of the employees, i.e. about a million people who do not yet receive meal vouchers, will also receive support for meals.
According to the chairman of the Association of Operators of Voucher Systems, David Rýc, even a number of small companies that do not have a canteen or meal vouchers provide their employees with meals, for example by importing food or by making agreements with restaurants.
"The essence of the intention is that we are not changing anything about the tax advantage. In addition, health and social insurance will not be paid from it," Schillerová said on Friday. She added that the limit for the maximum employer contribution applicable as a tax credit would also be maintained.
The law on income tax allows companies to pay a maximum of 55 percent of the meal voucher price. The remaining part is paid by employees, in some cases also by the employer, but without a tax discount. The most advantageous value of the meal voucher for employees and employers this year is 123 CZK.
Bloomberg: Venezuela has hidden bitcoins and does not know what to do with them
Venezuela's central bank is conducting internal tests to determine whether it can hold cryptocurrencies, responding to a request from state-run Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), which wants to be able to send bitcoins and ethers to the central bank and then have the bank pay the oil company's suppliers in cryptocurrencies. Employees are also studying a proposal to allow the central bank to count cryptocurrencies in foreign exchange reserves, which are now near a 30-year low, Bloomberg reported, citing four sources.
Sanctions imposed by the United States on the authoritarian regime of President Nicolás Maduro have largely cut Venezuela off from the global financial system, deepening the country's economic crisis - one of the most severe in the world - and forcing officials to use a patchwork of different ways to move money. While Maduro's efforts to launch the world's first state cryptocurrency have failed, continued efforts to use digital currencies show how desperate the government is to find ways around the restrictions.
Venezuela's central bank and PDVSA did not respond to requests for comment.
It is not clear how PDVSA came to own bitcoins and ethers, or how much value it holds in those currencies. The company has had trouble getting payments from customers through conventional channels because major banks are unwilling to do business with entities that are subject to sanctions. Last month, the company received most of a $700 million payment in Chinese yuan because the parties were unable to find financial institutions that would facilitate the transaction.
PDVSA may not want to sell cryptocurrencies on the open market, as this would require it to register on the stock exchange and undergo due diligence. Instead, it wants the cryptocurrency to be used by the central bank to pay the entities to which PDVSA owes money. The oil company's representatives believe that the central bank is less exposed to any obstacles that may arise when paying with cryptocurrencies.
Bitcoins and ethers use a decentralized online ledger known as a blockchain to verify and record transactions, in some cases allowing for relatively anonymous transfers without the need for a middleman. Few banks are involved in digital currencies because of the money laundering and customer information issues that come with them and complicate compliance.
After the debacle of 2018, cryptocurrencies are experiencing a return to the limelight this year thanks to expectations of their greater acceptance by institutions and Facebook's plan to come up with its own cryptocurrency. Even so, they remain unstable. Bitcoin has fallen by almost 20 percent in the last four days, but it has gained about 130 percent since the beginning of the year.
Commentary by Jan Šindelář: Managing the railways as a company
The heavenly election, although it may not have been completely smooth, is the culmination of a sad story about the inability of the state to give a clear direction to the railways. The board has been incomplete for over a year and even after Wednesday evening this does not change because one of the members resigned. The provisional period continues.
The selection process itself was a farce from the beginning, if only because the requirements for candidates, especially in the field of practice, were significantly relaxed. Compared to last year's selection, the requirements for the size of the company in which the candidate was to work in the past were reduced. First, the members of the selection committee and then the supervisory board only played the role of pimps.
Nebeský submitted probably the weakest professional CV of the five finalists, yet without experience from a large company, he beat experienced players from the management of logistics giants and transport companies. It was the participation of interesting managers from the private sector that was probably the brightest side (and the greatest hope) of the whole process. Today, those concerned know that they only played the role of narrative backdrops in a political game.
Perhaps Nebeský will surprise, show great talent and ultimately prove to be the best railway boss of all time. At least in the beginning, however, he will be accompanied by the aftertaste of political smoke and mirrors. Czech Railways does not expect an easy period, they have to cope with competition in the liberalization of the market and with a shortage of employees in operation. Train drivers, shunters and mechanics are missing. What motivation should they have for further work and respect for management, when the state behaves in top management like an elephant in a china shop?
The second important group is the creditors. We will see how they interpret the games at the head of the railways next spring, when the railways will defend the rating. It is certain that the creditors perceive the instability. The sad thing is that someone else goes to Moody's every year to defend the rating for Czech Railways. The agency has not missed the frequent changes in the management of the railways and the political influence on the company, it has already criticized them this summer.
The ANO movement promotes, among other things, the slogan that the state should be managed as a company. For a start, it would be enough if one large state-owned company was managed as a company and not as a state. Czech Railways is still one of the largest companies in the country and it would be good if they were led by the best. They applied, but the state scorned them. It can certainly be argued that the post at the head of the railways has always been a political matter. But then we can forgive the antics with the selection process.
An unusually open and unique image of Karel Gott in the feature documentary film by Olga Špátová
This unique film project by Olga Špátová will premiere in Czech cinemas in the spring of next year.
"In the middle of September last year, Ivanka and Karel Gott called me and asked me if I would make a documentary about his life with Karel again after ten years. I did not hesitate for a minute! It was and is a great honour for me to film with a person who has remained in the limelight of Czech culture for more than half a century thanks to his exceptional singing talent, artistic humility and immeasurable hard work. I accepted the challenge to make a feature-length documentary film about Karel Gott, who has been bringing joy to three generations of listeners with his art, as a commitment to this legendary singer," director Olga Špátová describes her feelings.
Thanks to a quick arrangement and agreement, the first day of shooting took place on October 22 last year and the last shots with Karel Gott were shot a few days ago. The goal was and is absolutely clear - to authentically capture Karel Gott as a phenomenal singer who gives himself to his fans, as a painter, but at the same time a loving husband and father of his children. A man who has been giving joy to several generations with his songs for sixty years, not only in our country, but also in Europe, and in fact all over the world. A man who has written himself into the hearts and souls of his listeners by simply being.
The film is not intended to be a showcase of the indisputable fame of Karel Gott and his achievements. "That's why it's not even possible to compare my previous film, The Gott Phenomenon, with this current one. Everyone is different. At least because we filmed them in a different stage of Karel Gott's life, and this is very evident in his personal, almost intimate confession, which he gave us and which confirmed for all of us what a legend we have the opportunity to work with and spend time with, which is truly indescribable," adds Olga Špátová.
The filmmakers captured Karel Gott during his performances, during meetings with his fans here and in Hamburg, but especially in his home environment, whether in Prague, at the cottage in Bohemian Switzerland, in the village where he spent his childhood, and in other places that played an important role in his life. Thanks to Karel Gott's sincere openness, the film will be completely authentic and unique.
"Olga has the great gift of filming with her close team in such a way that we often let ourselves be carried away by the spontaneous atmosphere and naturally let her into our privacy, thanks to which I talked about relatively confidential topics. With her husband, cameraman Jan Malíř, they actually became part of our family. Originally, we wanted to release the film in 2019, when I celebrated my life anniversary. But because I still had a beautiful summer with my family, I wanted us to shoot for as long as possible. Well, and because there were a lot of me everywhere in 2019, my wish was that it would be released in cinemas in the spring of next year. This documentary film is a thank you to my supporters and all those who supported and accompanied me in my profession," says Karel Gott himself about the film.

Managers of state-owned companies are to undergo a new selection process. It will be possible to circumvent the law, says the opposition
"This is a typical draft law that is unnecessary," said the chairman of the ODS parliamentary group, Zbyněk Stanjura.
After several unsuccessful attempts, the Chamber of Deputies approved changes that are intended to prevent the opaque distribution of functions - critics speak of tobacconists - in state-owned companies in the future. Applicants should now go through a selection process at the ministry in question and will also be assessed by the government committee for personnel nominations.
However, it is a compromise solution that, for example, the Civic Democratic Party (ODS) does not like, because it will allegedly allow ministers to use the excuse that the selection committees are to blame for any poor selection of state managers. Moreover, the opinion of the said committee will not be binding on the minister. The amendment still has to be approved by the Senate and signed by President Miloš Zeman.

The library commemorates the anniversary of the death of Wenceslas IV with an exhibition of manuscripts
Six rare historical manuscripts from the turn of the 14th and 15th centuries, i.e. from the time of the Roman and Czech king Wenceslas IV, can be viewed by people in Prague's Klementinum today and on Saturday. The National Library has released them from its vaults to commemorate this year's 600th anniversary of Wenceslas's death. This morning, librarians and restorers placed the rare originals in display cases in the Mirror Chapel. Admission to the exhibition is free and it is open on both days from 10:00 to 18:00.
The exhibition of documents entitled Ad mandatum domini Regis: From the Royal Office and Library of Wenceslas IV was prepared by the library together with the National Archives. The National Archives looks at the written heritage from the reign of Wenceslas IV from the point of view of official documents and the National Library from the point of view of literary works, said its author Jan Vojtíšek.
"Visitors can look forward, for example, to the work on agriculture by Petr de Crescentiis, which is essentially a kind of encyclopedia of agriculture, or to the breviary, i.e. the prayer book of one of the Benedictine nuns of the monastery of St. George at Prague Castle, from the beginning of the 15th century," he listed the reasons why people should, in his opinion, look at the exhibition.
The Epistles of Peter of Blois will also be on display, where the introductory miniature H (enrico) depicts the half-figure of the English king Henry II. The author of the decoration is most likely the Master of Samson's History, who, in addition to the two volumes of the Bible of Wenceslas IV, also participated in the decoration of a number of other manuscripts. Visitors will also see the Latin collection of treatises by John Wycliffe from the period around 1411 to 1414.
Not a single book from the library of Wenceslas IV has been preserved on Czech territory. According to experts, this library belonged to the most extensive and also the most beautiful book collections in Central Europe at that time, because the young king longed to build a representative library that would match the book collections of his French relatives. However, the library disappeared soon after Wenceslas's death. Apparently, it was stolen or destroyed during the conquest of the castle by the Hussites. However, several codices were saved. Most of them are now owned by the Austrian National Library.
"We have a number of treasures in our collections and I am glad that they are in a condition that allows them to be exhibited and made available to the public so-called live and not only in the form of the Manuscriptorium digital library," said the director of the National Library, Martin Kocanda.
On the day of Saturday's national holiday, an exhibition entitled What is hidden under the floor, which presents local archaeological discoveries, will also be open free of charge in Klementinum.
The techno party in the Benešov region continues.
Playing at a third of its capacity, it was due to finish at noon
Hlaváčkova Lhota (Benešov region) The techno party at Hlaváčkova Lhota in the Benešov region continues on Sunday evening.
A third of the original 12 music systems are still playing.
According to the evening estimates of the police, about 500 people remain here after 20:00, the original rough estimates spoke of three hundred, in the morning there were 900, said police spokeswoman Lucie Nováková.
Originally, the techno party was supposed to end at noon on Sunday, at which time some of the music systems did indeed go silent.
"Some have already left and others are preparing to leave.
Part of the musical production is still ongoing.
We expect that the music systems will gradually be disconnected and dismantled," Nováková said.
"Police officers are still consistently checking departing visitors in order to prevent drivers under the influence of alcohol or addictive substances from driving.
Drivers have the option of taking a precautionary breath test before setting off," she added.
Dozens of riot police officers are supervising the event, foreign police, traffic police and riot police are on the scene, and dog handlers with service dogs are also on standby.
"During the course of today, police officers checked 470 people moving around the venue of the event and 485 vehicles, 270 drivers were subjected to a breath test, of which six got behind the wheel under the influence of alcohol," Nováková said.
A total of 95 drivers were tested by the police for the presence of narcotic and psychotropic substances, of which one was positive.
Officers also dealt with 14 traffic offences.
At the request of the participants of the techno party, the police carried out 300 preventive breath tests and four preventive tests for the presence of narcotic and psychotropic substances.
About 2,000 people were at the event on Saturday morning.
If the number of participants did not decrease, the police would intervene there.
This was said by the Minister of the Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) in the Prima Partie television programme.
However, the number of participants fell below 1,000, so the police assessed that there was no need for intervention, nor was it requested by the sanitary station or the Ministry of Health.
Czech Television (CT) reported on Sunday that the techno parties had spread to surrounding properties whose owners did not agree to their use for the techno parties.
It is possible that the owners of the surrounding land will demand compensation for damages.
The techno fans arrived at the meadow near Hlavackova Lhota on Friday evening.
The police initially guarded a meadow in Blažim in the Benešov region on Friday, where the techno party was held last year.
Blažim is located about 30 kilometers from Hlavackova Lhota, where the technicians finally arrived.
According to Nováková, no one came to Blažim.
Viper bite: Little girl ends up in hospital!
"The first case this year was recorded in the region of Zeleznorud.
A girl, born in 2010, was bitten on the leg by an adder there, and her parents took her to the local rescue service base themselves," regional spokeswoman for the emergency medical service, Mária Svobodová, told the daily, adding that the child was then taken to a hospital in Klatovy.
The adder is the only venomous snake in the Czech Republic and it is in the Bohemian Forest that these animals are found in higher numbers, so it is good to be careful when walking.
However, there is no great danger from these animals.
The chance that the viper will bite you is not very high, it is afraid of itself during normal contact.
And if she has the space to do so, she likes to crawl away with a loud hiss.
It will only attack if it feels very threatened - for example, if you accidentally step on it.
However, even its bite is not a tragedy, its venom is very effective against small mammals, but it does not kill people.
This can only happen if a person has a particularly weakened organism or suffers from an allergy.
The risk of danger is therefore primarily for children, the elderly and allergy sufferers.
"After being bitten, a person often feels nauseous, sweats, has an elevated temperature, thirst, abdominal pain and diarrhea, and in weakened individuals and especially allergy sufferers, anaphylactic shock can occur," Miriam Gredová from the Klatovy Hospital described for Deník.
The man threatened to throw the infant out of the window.
He poured wine and threw dishes at the policewoman
After 11 p.m., an intervention unit entered the apartment and detained the man.
The infants were immediately taken into the care of medical staff, regional police spokeswoman Markéta Janovská said in a press release.
The man did not want to cooperate with the police, he threw dishes, knives at the police negotiator or poured wine on her from the window.
He amplified his threats several times during the negotiations by leaning out of the window with the child in his arms.
On one occasion he even climbed onto the window sill himself, where he staggered.
Police are continuing to investigate the man.
He does not want to disclose any further information yet.
Stosur opts for daughter over tennis season
Australian tennis player Samantha Stosur will not take part in the season affected by the coronavirus this year.
The 36-year-old 2011 US Open champion, who became a mother in June, does not want to end her career just yet.
She plans to return to the courts next year and believes that thanks to her family and daughter, she will enjoy tennis even more than before.
Stosur announced on social media two weeks ago that her partner Liz Astling had given birth to a daughter, Genevieve, in mid-June.
"I'm going to stay at home, spend time with my family, be there for all the little milestones that our Evie will experience over the next six months and just enjoy it," the former world number one in doubles said on the website of the Australian federation.
The WTA Tour will resume its season, which has been suspended since March, on August 3 with a clay tournament in Palermo.
Sapa market: Raid reveals meat, fish and eggs of unknown origin
"One of the vehicles entering the premises was transporting 1,320 pieces of quail eggs of unknown origin, and in unsuitable conditions.
These eggs will also be disposed of at the rendering plant," the State Veterinary Administration said.
During the inspection of the stall with live fish, it was found that the seller did not have documents on the origin of the goods and was not registered for the sale of live fish.
The market has long been considered problematic from a veterinary point of view.
For example, last autumn, veterinarians discovered an illegal food store, which contained almost half a ton of unmarked food without documents of origin.
It was not possible to determine the expiration date for most of them, and some of the products had expired and were spoiled.
In the case of five kilograms of cuttlefish, the expiration date was exceeded by three years.
Last May, veterinarians and police officers seized 80 kilograms of food without proof of origin in the market area, including dried fish, squid and frozen ducks, some of which were moldy.
Spilkova in par. She is on the verge of advancing after the first round in Indianapolis
Golfer Klára Spilková is on the verge of advancing to the final rounds after the first round of the Tech Championship in Indianapolis. On Thursday, she played two birdies, two bogeys at the LPGA series and finished the opening day in par. With a score of 72, she is tied for 69th place, which is the expected cut.
The 24-year-old Spilková returned to the circuit a month ago after a two-month medical break and did not make it through to the second half of the tournament in Portland. She took a break due to tiredness and exhaustion after a previous illness.
The first Czech winner of a professional tournament on the European LET series is a member of the LPGA Tour for the first year and so far she has not been very successful. She has made the cut three times out of twelve tournaments, the best was 32nd in Hawaii. She is fighting to keep her card for the next season.
The tournament in Indianapolis was best played by the Korean Hor Mi-chung. After the first round, she has a score of -9 and a lead of two shots over three opponents.
Police charge CzechTourism manager Aleš Pangrác over promotion contracts
The police have charged the former manager of the state agency CzechTourism, Aleš Pangrác, over contracts for promotion. Pangrác confirmed to the SeznamZprávy server that he took over the charges this week. Czech Television (CT) reported last year that the police were investigating contracts worth 38 million crowns in the case. According to the police, part of the money was returned to Pangrác, the server writes. In the case, the detectives were also interested in the Minister for Regional Development, Klára Dostálová (for ANO), to whose department CzechTourism belongs. The investigation into the case continues, according to the server.
Detectives from the National Center against Organized Crime secured evidence in this case in the second half of last November. They were, for example, at the headquarters of the Ministry for Regional Development, at the headquarters of CzechTourism, at the autodrome in Most or at the Sport Invest agency. The office computer was also taken from the minister's apartment. The court order for the search of Dostálová's house, which was previously quoted by ČT, stated that in 2016, when she was a deputy, the minister decided on the expenses of CzechTourism for the benefit of selected persons indirectly and outside the standard official procedure. Dostálová then declared that she felt absolutely innocent, she did not make a mistake, she could document everything and was fully cooperating with the police.
According to the agency, it was the fault of an individual. The media had previously reported that it was the former director of the regional partnership department in CzechTourism, Aleš Pangrác, who was dismissed due to the results of the audit. It turned out that the CzechTourism agency had concluded 48 problematic contracts.
"Yes, they have accused me, but I don't want to comment on it any further," Pangrác told Seznam Zprávy.

Destroyed shops, fires in the streets, the memorial parade was accompanied by riots
Five years ago, 43 students from a high school in Ayotzinapa disappeared, and despite an extensive investigation, the case has not yet been solved. The students were allegedly detained by the police in the Mexican state of Guerrero. It is not clear exactly what happened next, but according to the investigation, the students apparently ended up in the hands of a local syndicate and were subsequently killed and burned, reports APTN.
A memorial procession was held in the Mexican capital on Thursday, with families expressing their frustration at the lack of answers and explanations for their children's disappearance.
The mostly peaceful march, however, was disrupted by smaller groups of vandals who destroyed everything in their path. The vandals destroyed shops and hotels, they did not shy away from destroying monuments, they set fires around the city and blew out windows.
Even before the march, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said he would do everything possible to catch them and asked the public for any information that would lead to the clarification of the case.
More than 142 people were detained as part of the investigation, but not a single one of them was convicted. Many of them had to be released because their human rights were violated, the investigators allegedly tortured the suspects, APTN adds.
Putin calls Zelensky before start of ceasefire in Donbass, Kremlin criticizes planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke on the phone with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky about the situation in Donbass, where a new ceasefire is due to come into effect at midnight.
According to a Kremlin statement, Putin, among other things, criticized the decision of the Ukrainian parliament to hold local elections; Kiev reported that Zelensky called for the release of detained Ukrainians.
A new ceasefire was agreed on Wednesday evening by negotiators from Ukraine and Russia with the support of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
The ceasefire is to begin after midnight on Monday night, is to be "complete and general" and is to pave the way for the fulfilment of other provisions of the peace agreements.
Putin told Zelensky in an interview that the decision of the Ukrainian parliament to hold local elections contradicts the Minsk peace agreement and threatens the prospects for settling the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
Last week, the Ukrainian parliament decided that the upcoming local elections would not be held in the territories controlled by pro-Russian rebels.
The Minsk agreement envisages that Kiev will regain control of the border of the Ukrainian territories occupied by separatists with Russia after granting broad autonomy to these regions and holding local elections there.
According to the Unian agency, Zelensky's office said that the two statesmen agreed on the benefits of the upcoming ceasefire in Donbass and on the need to carry out other measures to promote peace in the region, such as demining the areas of fighting or withdrawing part of the troops from the front.
Zelensky also called on Putin to release Ukrainians detained in the east of Ukraine, in the occupied Crimean peninsula and in Russia itself.
The Minsk agreement has helped to stop the fighting, but people continue to die on both sides of the front line in occasional gun battles and artillery attacks.
The conflict in Donbass has claimed more than 14,000 lives since the spring of 2014.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of providing military support to the separatists, which Moscow denies.
Zelensky has made ending the war in Donbass a priority, but so far there has been no major breakthrough in the negotiations.
And where are the spectators? Doha cannot be London
At the same time, however, it is a step back, because by making the pilgrimage to Doha, athletics has voluntarily and consciously renounced the thrilling atmosphere that prevailed at the sold-out stadium in London in 2017 and last year at the European Championships in Berlin.
Giant banners on the walls of Doha's skyscrapers invite people to the "biggest sporting event of 2019." However, concerns are growing about how dignified its backdrop will be.
"Tickets for the finish are sold out for all evenings," say the organisers.
But this is too little.
The upper gallery of the Khalifa Stadium, with a total capacity of 40 thousand spectators, is already covered with brightly colored sails, on which the flags of the 209 participating countries are also depicted. Athletics in Qatar has gone to a territory where, despite the annual Diamond League meeting, it has no roots.
It is therefore not surprising that last week only 50 thousand tickets were sold for the ten days of the championship, although their price started at 60 Qatari riyals, which is equivalent to less than 400 crowns.
The organizers have now set themselves the goal of filling at least half of the uncovered parts of the stands. Therefore, according to sources of the British newspaper Giuardian, they are allegedly (although the organizers themselves deny it) handing out free tickets to migrants who work here as workers, as well as to children. Sebastian Coe, head of the IAAF athletics association, can also comment positively: "This is how we can inspire the next generation."
Rich Qatar has won world championships in handball and cycling in the past, and after athletics comes football in 2022. The financial offers of the oil superpower will always be lucrative even for rich sports federations. This is the reality of today's sports world.
But even if we accept it and ignore the absence of fans in the stadium, we cannot avoid a purely sporting sigh that the leaders of the IAAF should have timed the experiment with the first outdoor world championship of athletes on the Arabian Peninsula better - and for another year. The extremely late deadline, forced by the climate, disrupts the entire scheme of the season in the pre-Olympic year and thus the preparation for the key Olympic season, which would normally begin for athletes in October.
Perhaps Qatar will at least make up for this with technological innovations, with the help of which it promises an ultra-modern and attractive championship. Isn't it 37 degrees right now? Even now, the area of the stadium is artificially air-conditioned to twenty-four. And advanced cameras, built directly into the blocks, are also supposed to give television viewers a detailed look at what is happening in the athletes in the hundredths of a second before the starter's shot and just after it.

Rykl is the unexpected champion in the decathlon, Novotná has dominated the heptathlon
Dolezal, the defender of the last two titles, did not finish the 400m at the end of Saturday's program, and Kopecký did not jump the pole vault on Sunday.
The decathlon was dominated for a long time by Latvian representative Reinis Kregers, who is preparing in the group of coach Josef Karas, but he withdrew after the discus.
Rykl had two bronze medals from the outdoor championship of the Czech Republic so far, this time he was the only decathlete who got over the seven-thousand mark.
Other medals behind him were won by Vilém Stráský and Petr Urbánek.
After the competition, Rykl mentioned the absence of Adam Sebastian Helcelet and Jiří Sýkora.
"It's a pity that the boys weren't here and Kope didn't start, because then the results would have looked completely different.
But the title tastes very good, I especially appreciate the fact that I got a personal best by 30 centimeters in the distance.
Then I was pleased with the pole and the most disappointing was probably the discus, where I was below average," he acknowledged on the union's Facebook page.
On the first day of the heptathlon, Kateřina Cachová won by more than a hundred points, even though she was suffering from an injured ankle on her springboard leg.
In the long-distance sector, however, she recorded only 570 cm, did not throw the javelin 40 meters and did not enter the final eight hundred meters.
Novotná collected 5878 points and won by 241 points ahead of Kateřina Dvořáková.
She was particularly successful in the long jump, with 631 cm being the best Czech performance of the year.
"I really wanted it to be around 630.
Yesterday my calf started to pull, but I am very glad that I did not feel it at all and that it did not limit me at all," Novotná said on the union's Facebook page.
Bio LPG has arrived in the Czech Republic, promising an environmentally friendly operation
Liquefied petroleum gas, or LPG for short, is a very well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
It is particularly popular for its fundamentally lower price compared to petrol or diesel, given the significantly lower excise duty, but its benefit is also in the lower CO2 emissions per kilometre travelled.
Like petrol and diesel, it also has its environmentally friendly variant - "bio LPG."
However, it is quite new - it first appeared on the European market two years ago and, according to a press release from the Czech LPG Association, it arrived in the Czech Republic a few days ago.
"These days we have received the first fifteen tonnes of bio LPG, which will be mixed with conventional fossil LPG and distributed to our filling stations," the association quotes Jiří Karlík from Primagas as saying.
Bio LPG, however, cannot be taken as bioethanol or biodiesel.
According to the association, it is chemically identical to the classic petroleum LPG that many motorists are currently filling their cars with.
Therefore, it is also possible to mix both versions at will.
"The only difference compared to conventional LPG is the method of production," says Ivan Indráček, chairman of the association, about bio LPG.
This is also one of the great advantages of bio LPG compared to other alternative fuels.
It is easy to transport and store, and the distribution infrastructure is also quite good, compared to hydrogen or electricity, for example.
Currently, this gas is obtained as a by-product of the production of bioethanol from food scraps and sugar cane.
In the future, it should also be produced in a targeted manner, for example from cellulosic biomass, i.e. from wood waste.
In contrast, conventional petroleum LPG is produced partly as a by-product of oil refining and partly by separation during the extraction of natural gas.
As a result, depending on the production technology and the source, running a car on bio LPG is 40-70% more environmentally friendly in terms of carbon footprint than running on petroleum LPG and up to 90% compared to diesel.
However, it is not about CO2 emissions from the car's exhaust, but about the ecology of fuel production, i.e. the so-called "well-to-tank" part.
Petrochemical companies Eni, Total and Neste are currently among the largest producers of bio LPG.
According to a recent update of the National Action Plan for Clean Mobility (NAP CM), Unipetrol is also exploring the possibility of production at its Litvínov refinery.
According to the association's estimates, there are about 170 thousand LPG vehicles in the Czech Republic; the Ministry of the Environment states a slightly higher number, about 200 thousand, in the NAP ČM.
According to statistics from the Ministry of Transport, almost 6 thousand conversions of cars to LPG were carried out last year alone.
It is possible to refuel with LPG in the Czech Republic at about 950 stations of various operators.
Vojtěch revised the number of infected, the number fell by 1775 cases
Czech Health Minister Adam Vojtěch (for ANO) has ordered the ministry to revise the number of people infected with the coronavirus.
The new statistics were published by the Ministry of Health on its website on Sunday.
The number of cases fell from 5,254 on Saturday to 3,479 on Sunday afternoon, a decrease of 1,775 cases.
At present, there are 3422 patients in the Czech Republic.
"The jump in the number of people cured is due to the revision of data, which health officials have not been able to update recently," said the head of health statistics, Jaroslav Dušek.
By Sunday afternoon, 15,212 people in the Czech Republic had been infected with the coronavirus, 11,419 had recovered and 371 had unfortunately succumbed to the Covid-19 disease.
The Slovaks succeeded, they will only pay a fine for racist insults
The Slovak Football Association has been successful in its appeal against the closure of a stadium for fans' racism. The national team was originally supposed to play a European Championship qualifying match against Wales without spectators, but now the association will only pay a fine of 15,000 euros (about 387,000 crowns).
The UEFA Disciplinary Committee punished Slovakia and Hungary for the behaviour of their fans during the recent mutual qualifying match in Budapest, which the visiting players of the Czech coach Pavel Hapal won 2:1. It closed the stadium to both associations for one match and fined Slovakia 20 thousand euros and Hungary 67 thousand euros.
After an appeal, the Slovaks were only fined 15 thousand euros for offensive political chants. The next match of the national team in the qualification for the European Championship with Wales on October 10 in Trnava will be made available to fans.

Overview of bank accounts for children on the Czech market
Children's accounts are provided by banks free of charge. However, it is necessary to consider the offer, because some other services for accounts are already charged. "The motivation of banks to offer accounts for children, whose basic management is usually free, is straightforward. Financial houses count on the fact that the waived fees will be returned to them one day. With a small migration of Czechs between banks, they are probably not wrong," says Kristýna Kuncová from dTest.
According to her, "small accounts" can do almost everything that accounts for adults can do. The child gets his or her own payment card, can enter payments, track movements on the account, and somewhere has his or her own electronic banking available. Banks will set up the account, but it is up to the parents to teach the children how to handle them and also to check their payments.
"Relatively flexibly, a parent can set weekly or monthly limits, turn on and off individual services, and so on. Above all, however, they can monitor what is happening on the account, whether by viewing it over the Internet or thanks to informational SMS. Beware, these may no longer be free," adds Kuncová, adding: "If a parent is considering an account for their child, they should consider their abilities and options."
The Museum in Semily returns to the Velvet Revolution with an exhibition
An imitation of a normalization room with a television showing footage of the brutal police intervention against students on 17 November 1989 in Prague. This is also in the new exhibition of the museum in Semily, which is dedicated to the Velvet Revolution. "The basis is to present what happened in Semily after the events on Národní třída," said the curator of the exhibition, Tomáš Chvátal.
"I would say that the atmosphere was basically the same everywhere, with the fact that the first demonstration was in Semily on 22 November, and then more people gradually gathered every day," he said. Among the most active at the beginning was a group of local dissidents around Miroslav Matěcha, who was the only one from the city and the immediate vicinity to sign Charter 77, and the Dědečková couple, who distributed the petition Several Sentences. According to Chvátal, the Civic Forum was also formed relatively quickly at that time. "One specific feature is that there was a very strong group of local doctors in the Civic Forum," said the curator.
Visitors should be drawn into the events in the city at that time by about 50 photographs, taken 30 years ago by Karel Bárta. A video from the general strike on 27 November 1989, shot by František Tomíček, has also been preserved and will be played on a loop for the entire duration of the exhibition. Ivan Hlas also spoke and sang at the demonstration. The Semily archive also lent a number of preserved banners from that time to the exhibition. "They said: Let's not get drunk with a roll, From trough to trough, We don't want violence," said Chvátal. Some changes in the city were very rapid at that time, for example, in December, people decided in a nationwide vote that the square would be Riegrovo and abolished the previous name Gottwaldovo.
The exhibition also captures the events before the November events. "In the first part, we present to witnesses and students what was before, such a late normalization. I think we managed to collect unique documents from Semily, whether they are banners with various communist slogans or a bronze plaque from the former museum of the workers' movement," said Chvátal. One room is intended to evoke the feeling of what it might have looked like in the living room of an ordinary household at that time.
The last part of the exhibition is dedicated to what happened after the Velvet Revolution. It is focused on the first free elections. "We wallpapered one room with election posters. Anyone who has experienced it will remember the posters With us to Europe or Václav Klaus is still there under the heading of the OF with the beautiful motto Everyone for their community," added the curator.
A pike in a pond or a relatively affluent open-air museum?
Babiš chose statistics for his optimistic view, such as good security (the Czech Republic is seventh in the world), a low unemployment rate, low national debt, or the fact that, according to a recent study, our country is twenty-fourth in quality of life out of 140 countries evaluated.
In a television interview on the occasion of the Summit of Architecture and Development, the developer Dušan Kunovský and the architect Josef Pleskot, however, cited other, far less "rosy" data. For example, the Czech Republic is in 154th place in the world in terms of the speed of construction procedures. It may happen that the current economic "boom" will not leave behind any significant building heritage as it did in the past.
The biggest obstacle is not only the existing legislation, but also the slow, inefficient bureaucracy. This is also documented by comparative studies, in which the Czech Republic lags significantly behind developed countries in the overall quality and performance of public administration.
Our country has simply not yet been able to make good use of the potential of the good economic situation of recent years to invest in the future. Although it is nice that salaries and pensions are increasing, people with an improving standard of living will also want to have a place to live, to travel in a modern and fast way, to have quality cultural stands, to live without an unbearable environmental burden.
But in the capital city of Prague, for example, it has not been possible for years to complete the inner and outer ring road or to build a high-speed railway or a metro to the airport. And Prague does not even have a modern, architecturally daring national library, a concert hall or a national gallery. The reason for this is not only the absurd scramble for architectural competitions, zoning plans and building permits, but also a kind of specifically Czech conservatism that adheres to the motto "every bolder change is for the worse."
And when it seems that something more daring might succeed, it will almost certainly be thwarted by preservationists or other rather determined associations, or by politicians. In the absurd drama surrounding the "blob" of Jan Kaplický designed for the new building of the National Library, even President Václav Klaus wanted to tie himself to the excavators.
However, the list does not end with Prague. The Czech Republic is not able to complete its backbone motorway network, nor to start building high-speed train lines, so Germany finally decided to run its tracks for super-fast trains from Berlin to Vienna by "detouring" through Bavaria. In addition, repairs to existing infrastructure are sometimes drowned in slush. Getting quickly from Prague to Brno is now a puzzle.
Babiš came into politics with a promise to "fix things." However, when it comes to meaningful investments and speeding up cumbersome bureaucratic procedures, not much has happened so far. Although an amendment to the law on accelerating the construction of transport infrastructure has been in force since 2018, we will have to wait for more extensive positive effects, such as easier expropriation of land. And the new construction law, approved by the government, which is said to reduce the current average length of construction proceedings from 5.4 years to one year, will, if we are lucky, come into force in 2021. However, many people would probably not bet on it.

Mobile polling units or postal voting.
A political scientist and a sociologist looked for options for the time of the pandemic
According to Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD), a change in the law is needed to allow people in quarantine due to the coronavirus to vote in the October regional and senate elections.
Parliament could debate it in August or September on a fast-track basis.
He said this on Sunday in the Prima TV game show.
On Tuesday, he wants to discuss possible solutions with representatives of parliamentary parties at the ministry.
"Whatever we do, it will have to mean a change in the electoral law," Hamáček said.
On Wednesday, the Senate called on the government to find a solution within the framework of the applicable legal rules.
However, the minister said that it will be necessary to amend the provisions of the law, according to which people in quarantine due to their health condition cannot vote.
The ban on voting should remain in place, for example, for patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop said on the OVM programme that the possibility of postal voting has been postponed since 2004.
Even the current bill, which is in the Chamber of Deputies, then provides for its introduction for voting abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
At the same time, Prokop considers the concerns of ANO or ČSSD (because, according to experience from abroad, it would rather play into the hands of other types of parties) about the postal vote to be overestimated.
Personally, he is against the possibility of electronic voting, where there is a significant possibility of abuse.
Michal Klíma said that it is now necessary to devise ad hoc mechanisms (elections) that could be carried out this year and with the least possible health risk.
He considers the main thing to be to be ready for 2021, when parliamentary elections are to be held in the Czech Republic.
He considers the correspondence option (whether only abroad or also in the Czech Republic) to be one of the functional methods.
They see the aforementioned electoral units or the possibility of proxy voting within the family as the next step.
He added that there is an opportunity to learn how similar situations - "elections in the time of coronavirus" - were dealt with in Croatia, Poland or France.
Various types of elections in 67 countries around the world have already been postponed this year due to the spread of the coronavirus.
The Prague Stock Exchange grew slightly, Czech banks, O2 and Avast did well
The Prague Stock Exchange closed the trading week with moderate growth. The PX index rose by 0.13 percent to 1038.45 points. It was driven up by Czech banks, the telecommunications company O2 and the technology company Avast. On the other hand, Austrian titles and the media company CME did not do well. This is evident from the results of trading on the stock exchange's website.
For most of Friday's session, the Prague Stock Exchange traded in slightly positive territory and eventually ended with a small profit. "However, for the whole week, it (the PX index) lost slightly more than one percent," said Josef Dudek from Fio banka.
Domestic banks partially corrected the declines of the past few days. Komerční banka improved by 0.82 percent to 803 crowns and Moneta Money Bank by 0.41 percent to 72.80 crowns. Avast shares appreciated by 0.89 percent to 113 crowns and the O2 operator gained 0.46 percent to 216.50 crowns.
Kofola's securities rose the most, by 1.38 percent to 294 crowns. Tobacco company Philip Morris gained less than a percent, with its shares rising to 13,640 crowns.
The securities of the energy company CEZ stagnated at Thursday's value of 520 crowns.
There were three loss-making titles - Erste Bank wrote off 0.87 percent to 779.20 crowns, CME 0.73 percent to 109 crowns and the insurance company VIG 0.40 percent to 618 crowns.
The crown weakened slightly against both major world currencies. It lost four pennies against the euro to 25.85 CZK/EUR and three pennies against the dollar to 23.62 CZK/USD, according to data on the Patria Online server.
Protests in Buhari: Pig's ears thrown by demonstrators at government building
Participants in a demonstration against Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov and his cabinet have thrown pigs' ears at the government building.
It was the latest in a series of protests against the "mafia style of governance" that have been taking place in Sofia and other cities for almost three weeks.
Organizers are planning a nationwide blockade on Wednesday, the DPA news agency reported.
Today's protest, which took place for the 18th day in a row, had a weaker turnout than the previous one, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.
About 300 people had gathered by 8 p.m., and some streets had to be closed to traffic.
Demonstrators in front of the government building staged a theatrical scene in which they symbolically locked up Prime Minister Borissov and Prosecutor General Ivan Geshev in a prison cell in connection with the arrest of two advisers to President Rumen Radev, who is a strong political opponent of the Prime Minister.
The resignation of both is one of the basic demands of the protesters.
They also demanded the cancellation of the announced health care reform and an end to corruption in construction on the Black Sea coast.
Protest organizer Nikolai Hadzhigenov said on public radio today that a "peak of escalation" is being prepared for Wednesday in the form of a "nationwide demonstration in Sofia and blockades throughout the country."
He reiterated the demand for the resignation of Borisov and his government, as well as the calling of early elections.
The regular ones should take place in March 2021.
Borisov has previously stated that he does not intend to resign.
He justified this, among other things, by the need to lead Bulgaria through the covid-19 pandemic and the resulting economic crisis.
On Friday, however, he replaced five members of his government team, although the concession did not appease the demonstrators.
Earlier this week, Borisov's government survived a vote of confidence in parliament.
The Attorney General has resumed the prosecution of a mother who manipulated her daughter against her father
The Supreme Public Prosecutor Pavel Zeman does not agree with the acquittal of the mother, who manipulated her daughter for a long time and disrupted her relationship with her father. She faced charges of abuse and endangering her upbringing. The Regional Court acquitted her of the charges, but Zeman does not agree with this. According to his appeal to the Supreme Court, such behaviour can be seen as a criminal offence.
The decision of the Supreme Court could have a wider impact on other cases. "A more specific definition of such a specific form of abuse can be considered necessary from the point of view of regulating further application practice," Zeman's appeal states.
Last year, the District Court in Svitavy initially found the woman guilty of mistreating a person entrusted to her and endangering the upbringing of a child. She created a strong, almost symbiotic bond with her daughter, even in a situation where she was supposed to be entrusted to her father.
The result was a pathological fixation on the mother and a markedly negative relationship with the father. The situation affected the emotional development of the daughter, who was even hospitalized because she threatened to harm herself if she was placed in the care of the father.
The Svitavy court sentenced the mother to two years in prison with a two-year suspended sentence. However, the Pardubice branch of the regional court acquitted the woman on appeal, saying it was not a criminal offence. The regional court repeated the same verdict even after the Supreme Court had already ordered it to decide again.
The Regional Court stated that situations where one of the parents manipulates the child against the other are by no means exceptional. They are dealt with in custody proceedings, possibly with the help of psychologists or youth welfare authorities. Only in exceptional cases is criminal law the solution.
According to the Supreme Public Prosecutor, however, the woman committed both abuse and endangerment of upbringing. "The accused acted quite purposefully when she aroused negative feelings in her daughter towards her father and purposefully reinforced these negative emotions. By acting in this way, she not only pursued the unlawful intention of limiting or excluding the father's contact with the minor, but she must necessarily have been aware that this would cause negative consequences in the psychosocial sphere of the minor," the appeal states.
Zeman asked the Supreme Court to return the case once again to the regional court. It follows from the appeal that the child is now in the care of the father.
Let the fans be positive, wishes Hasek. Sparta awaits a hit in Pilsen
"We will play to the limit, we will do everything in our power to succeed, to manage the game and the result," promised Sparta player Martin Hašek in an interview for the club television.
In the week, a goal decided the cup duel in Jihlava (2:1). Sparta advanced to the next round, which was an obligation for her. She was relieved, but she continues to struggle in the game.
Even though the season is slowly moving into the second third, football Sparta is still looking for the face that coach Václav Jílek spoke about at the beginning of his engagement.
"But it is still Sparta, who have very good players. We are in for a difficult match," warns Roman Procházka from Plzeň.
When the Spartans arrived in Štruncovy sady for the last time, in the middle of May, it was a clear affair in the superstructure. The guests left after a soulless performance with a 0-4 thrashing, the largest in the history of the independent Czech league.
While at that time the difference between the clubs in the table was eight points before the match, Sparta is now losing nine points after ten games of the new season. It is experiencing one of the worst starts to the season ever.
"It's not an easy situation either for us or for the fans, who would like to see their beloved club completely different from what it is at the moment," says Hašek. "But we would be happy if they continue to support us, stay positive and stand behind us."
Sparta does not know if it will be able to use Tetteh in Pilsen, who received a two-match suspension for being sent off in Pilsen, but appealed against it on Friday.
Costa, Dočkal, Drchal, Panák, Pulkrab, Zahustel, Krejčí and Kadlec, who is the only one of the squad who remembers the last Spartan victory in Pilsen in 2011, remain on the numerous sick list.
The home team, who have won their last five matches, including Wednesday's cup in Hlučín, should only be missing midfielder Čermák. And defender Jakub Brabec, a Spartan, should lead them into the match as captain.
Milan Jakubů: The army stole the funeral for itself! Says Andor Šándor
There are still uncertainties surrounding the funeral of Brigadier General Milan Jakubů. The media speculated this week that the army planned the last farewell to the Deputy Director of Military Intelligence, despite the wishes of the family, as bombastic as only soldiers can. There were also discrepancies regarding the date of the funeral. The spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, Jan Pejšek, denied this.
"It's nonsense! We have been in contact with the family from the beginning, the Friday date of the funeral has been agreed from the beginning, no one has changed it. The same applies to military honours. We will just deal with the possible participation of the media with regard to the family," Pejšek told Blesk on Wednesday. The funeral will finally take place on Friday and all military honours, including a flyover of fighter jets, will not be missing.
Even so, there is a tense atmosphere around the last farewell to the popular general. The organizers have decided that people who worked with the general in the past will not take part in the funeral ceremony!
One example is the former head of military intelligence, Andor Šándor (62), who met Milan Jakubů 17 years ago. Šándor remembers his former colleague as hard-working, intelligent and a "good guy."
In addition, in recent years he regularly met him at the celebrations of the anniversary of the founding of the Military Intelligence. That is why he would like to say goodbye to Milan Jakubů. "I personally would go to the funeral of Milan Jakubů," Šándor told Blesk. But he can't.
"I know of other people from the organization who would like to go, but they are out of luck, because the potentates are usurping the funeral for themselves. I think that it is not right to privatize the funeral in this way," said the security expert. He is also not amused by the allegedly considered closure of the ceremony to the public for reasons of secrecy of the military top brass.
"The leadership of the army is not classified and neither are the leaders of military intelligence, because they need to be promoted at Prague Castle, we can see them there. If the media information is true and the family really allowed themselves to be sidelined by the army, it is of course a matter for the family. Personally, I would never allow the army to override the family and its wishes," Šándor concluded.
Milan Jakubů died in a car accident near Špindlerův Mlýn on Saturday. The head-on collision between the Milan Rapid and a Ford Mustang was allegedly caused by the driver of the sports car, Vojtěch Ch. (31).
Milan Jakubů apparently had no chance to avoid the collision. His wife (47) suffered serious injuries in the accident and it is possible that she will bear the consequences for the rest of her life. The police questioned the culprit of the accident on Thursday.
Bologna coach Mihajlovic does not want any more games without spectators
Bologna football coach Sinisa Mihajlovic has had enough of Italian league matches without spectators.
The Serbian coach hopes that the fans will return to the stadiums from the new season.
"What we are doing here at the moment is not football.
I am fed up with games without spectators.
It is a sexless football, it does not bring me any emotion, any joy.
The games are worse than the training.
It's terrible to play like that and I think I'm not the only one who thinks so," said Mihajlovic ahead of today's game against Lecce.
After the coronavirus break, the Serie A matches follow in quick succession, and although they are played in the evening, their players are exposed to the heat.
"We play every three days in terrible heat.
In such conditions you can't even tell how the teams are doing.
I just want this season to end.
These measures had to be taken in order to finish the competition, but I hope that the fans will be back from September," said the coach, who has also managed Fiorentina and AC Milan in the past.
For Mihajlovic, this season is also unusual because he missed four months on the bench due to treatment for leukemia.
"Despite my illness, the suspension of the league and everything else, we managed to take our team to the next level.
We want to continue to grow and to do that we need the players to be mentally stronger," he said.

The launch of the new toll is not in jeopardy, reports Kremlík. However, a change of operator is in play.
On Friday, the Ministry of Transport began preparations for a new tender for the operation of a new toll system. This is a backup plan that the state would use in the event that the current toll contract is legally cancelled. In addition, the state is preparing other provisional solutions if the tender is not completed on time. This was announced on Facebook by the Minister of Transport Vladimír Kremlík (for ANO).
On Thursday, the Office for the Protection of Competition (UOHS) prohibited the performance of the toll contract between the state and the CzechToll/SkyToll consortium, with a one-year delay. The ministry will file an appeal against this.
"The launch of the new toll collection system is not in jeopardy. Starting today, we are launching the preparation of a new transparent tender procedure, the subject of which will be the services of operating the new toll system, which is now being completed by the CzechToll and SkyToll consortium," said the minister.
In the tender, the state would be looking for the operator of the currently prepared toll, which will be launched from this December. It would not be a competition for a completely new toll system, as was the case with the last tender, nor for the use of the old system, which is now operated by Kapsch.
However, according to Kremlík, the Ministry is also preparing for the fact that it would not be able to prepare the new tender in time. "Based on the current experience with the course of the toll tender, I am deeply convinced that the OPC is wrong and that it is objectively impossible to prepare and implement such a complex tender procedure and hand over the operation of the toll system to a new operator within the 12-month period set by the OPC," he said.
In addition to the new tender procedure, the resort will also prepare a provisional solution that would solve the toll collection for a transitional period until the state finds a full-fledged form of solution.
The state will probably not yet make use of the offer made to it in recent days by the current toll administrator Kapsch. The Austrian company has offered the state the operation of the existing system in the event that the toll contract is cancelled.
At the same time, Kremlík reiterated that he believes that the backup plan will not be needed. Therefore, the ministry will file an appeal against the decision of the antitrust authority.
On Thursday, the Office for the Protection of Competition issued a decision prohibiting the performance of the toll contract. However, the ban will not come into force until one year after the authority's decision comes into force. This is not final and can be appealed to the chairman of the authority. The ministry and CzechToll are therefore continuing to prepare a new toll, which should be launched in December.
The CzechToll/SkyToll consortium won last year's tender for the new toll system and its operator. It succeeded in the toll tender with an offer of 10.75 billion crowns for ten years of operation. The current operator Kapsch protested against the course of the tender and the validity of the toll contract, which failed in the competition with an offer of over 13 billion crowns.
I have a heart like a bell and the lungs of a non-smoker. I'll just take a few infusions, Zeman joked.
The head of state underwent a medical examination lasting several hours at the Central Military Hospital (CMH) on Tuesday. According to the director of the hospital, Miroslav Zavoral, the doctors did not find any "diseases" in the president. The president will celebrate his 75th birthday on Saturday.
During the check-up, the president's doctors detected slight signs of dehydration. His problems with low blood pressure were caused by insufficient hydration. "In order to fix the dehydration of the body, I will take several infusions that will get minerals into my body," Zeman said.
Otherwise, however, according to him, the director of the Central Military Hospital stated that "the Czech state has a healthy president." In this context, the president mentioned that Zavoral had received several hateful messages because of the health check.
According to the president, the doctors examined him thoroughly and did not miss a single place on his body. "So a brief recap: the heart beats like a bell, the lungs are clean, as if he were not a smoker, the liver works as if I were a teetotaler, the kidneys are also in order, and I can go on and on," Zeman said.
The editorial staff of iDNES.cz contacted the military hospital to comment on Zeman's statement about his health.
The question of Zeman's health became a topic mainly during last year's presidential election or during some public appearances, during which Zeman has obvious problems with walking. According to the Prague Castle, the president walks badly due to diabetic polyfunctional neuropathy. He also has problems with low blood pressure and his hearing is worse. Due to his health, he has reduced his smoking.

Sparta do not want to lose Tetteh in Pilsen. They have appealed against the two-match ban
Sparta football club has appealed against the two-match ban for striker Benjamin Tetteh, which the player received from the disciplinary committee for being sent off in Sunday's derby with Slavia (0-3).
The airline club reported this on its Twitter account and is now waiting for the verdict of the appeal committee.
Tetteh has already served half of his sentence in Wednesday's home cup match in Jihlava. Sparta is now trying to ensure that the 22-year-old Ghanaian striker can play in Sunday's 11th round of the first league in Pilsen.
There could be a repeat of the situation from last October, when Olomouc appealed against the punishment for Šimon Falta, who on Thursday was given a one-match suspension by the disciplinary committee for being sent off against Liberec.
The appeal committee did not have time to discuss the case, so the effectiveness of the punishment was postponed and Falta was able to play on Saturday, paradoxically against Sparta.
The commission finally confirmed the one-match ban for the Olomouc midfielder the following week and Falta missed the following match against Zlín.
Tetteh was suspended by the disciplinary committee for a foul on David Hovorka, for which he received a straight red card from referee Miroslav Zelinka in the 82nd minute.
The alleged spitting of the Ghanaian player at the captain of the opponent, Tomáš Souček, has not been proven.
We have become the target of a cyber attack by foreign states, says Iran
Since the end of June, fires and explosions have been reported from a number of Iranian military, industrial and nuclear facilities, as well as oil refineries, power plants, factories and businesses.
Some Iranian officials have said that cyber sabotage may have caused the fire that broke out this month at the underground nuclear facility in Natanz.
The cause of a number of other incidents has not yet been explained.
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi told reporters, according to Iranian media, that the Islamic Republic's infrastructure faces "thousands of cyber attacks" on a daily basis.
He added that this is not a new phenomenon and that most of them will be repelled.
In recent months, according to Mousavi, several large-scale cyber attacks have been recorded, which, according to analyses, were carried out by "certain governments and groups."
However, he did not provide further details about the possible perpetrators, according to Reuters.
Mousavi also added that fires in forests, refineries and other places are frequent in the summer.
An article by Iran's state-run IRNA news agency this month suggested that Iran's enemies, such as Israel and the United States, may have been behind the recent incidents.
However, none of these countries were directly accused of specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States broke off diplomatic relations shortly after the 1979 revolution, when Iranian militant students stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
Long-strained relations between the two countries escalated in 2018 after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers and imposed sanctions on Iran that have had a harsh impact on its economy.
Another major escalation came this year after the US military killed Iranian General Qasem Soleimani and Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis on January 3.
Iran then fired a number of missiles at bases in Iraq, where the Americans operate, on 8 January.
It was only later that the US admitted that dozens of American soldiers had been injured.
Israel considers Iran to be its arch-enemy, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a leading opponent of the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran.
According to the Israeli prime minister, Iran is trying to develop an atomic bomb, which Iran denies.
Harry in the footsteps of Princess Diana (36)! Where is Meghan?
Diana was exceptional in that she knew how to touch people's hearts. In January 1997, she caused a stir when she visited Africa and, in particular, a minefield. The pictures of her wearing a protective suit and a shield on her face became iconic. And even then, no one could have guessed that a few months later, the princess of people's hearts would breathe her last in a tragic car accident in Paris.
Now her younger son Harry has also scored a point when, after 22 years, he went to the same place as her. He went to the mine clearance site in Dirico, Angola, also put on a special protective suit and looked very thoughtful. He certainly could not help remembering his beloved mother, whom he lost when he was only 13 years old.
Harry gave a speech on the spot, where he praised the efforts of the Halo Trust, which works to defuse minefields and other explosives in countries where war has taken place. "Minefields are the unhealed wounds of war. By clearing them, we can help the community to find the peace that comes with opportunity," he said, and also appealed to save and maintain the wildlife and the local river as a source of water. After this visit, the Duke of Sussex moved to Huambo to rename the local orthopedic center after his famous mother, Princess Diana.
He did not forget to mention it on the official Instagram account: "The Duke is honoured to be able to visit a place and community that was so important to his mother, to get to know their tireless mission and to speak for all those who she (Diana) felt most needed to be heard, even if the issue was not popular worldwide," the Sussex Royal Instagram post said.
However, royal fans may be disappointed that he did not take his wife Meghan (38) and their son Archie (4 months) on such a trip to remember Diana. Both of them have been on a separate schedule to Harry since Wednesday, probably for their protection. After all, taking a small baby to a minefield does not sound very safe, and Harry does not want to endanger his beloved family at any cost.
Car manufacturer TPCA has extended its production shutdown, now until 25 May
The Cologne-based car manufacturer Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile (TPCA) has once again extended its production shutdown due to the coronavirus.
The production lines are expected to restart on the morning of Monday 25 May.
The launch will be accompanied by dozens of hygienic measures, said Tomáš Paroubek, a spokesman for the car manufacturer.
Production has been halted since the evening of 18 March due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Originally, the company intended to resume it on Monday, May 18.
According to Paroubek, the reason for the extension of the shutdown is the closed borders and closed dealerships, so there is no one to sell cars.
According to Paroubek, the company will be producing at 100 percent from the start, i.e. in two shifts.
The company's key markets, such as Italy, the United Kingdom and Spain, have been affected by the coronavirus.
Mayor Michael Kašpar (Change for Kolín) said that the shutdown of production at TPCA does not affect life in the city.
"At the beginning it was noticeable, the city was empty.
But gradually the streets are filling up, especially now since Monday, when things have eased up a lot.
So the city is full," said Kaspar.
According to him, there are no complications with the foreign workers who stayed in the residential hotels.
"In these two months, we have hardly had to deal with any problems," said Kašpar.
For example, Škoda Auto in Mladá Boleslav, which also suspended production due to the coronavirus crisis, resumed production on Monday 27 April at all three of its production plants in the Czech Republic.
None of the plants are operating at 100 percent capacity.
The resumption of production at Škoda was accompanied by more than 80 hygiene measures.
In the night from Monday to Tuesday, the third, i.e. night shift, took place in Mladá Boleslav and Kvasiny for the first time after the resumption of production.
TPCA currently employs around 2,500 people and the company is one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and also an employer in the Kolín region.
A new subway architect will oversee the D line, bringing experience from the London Underground
The Prague Transport Company has chosen an architect to oversee the design of the metropolitan metro. Anna Švarc will take over in October. Her primary task will be the design of the new line D, but she will also be in charge of the existing stations. According to her, the metro cannot be viewed only as a transport structure, travelling by underground should also bring an aesthetic experience.
The Czech architect, who participated, for example, in the reconstruction of three stations of the London Underground, won the tender announced by the Prague Public Transport Company (DPP).
In addition to her, 14 other applicants took part in the tender. "The selection process included a letter of motivation and a CV. My previous experience from London, where I created a kind of aesthetic manual for the local metro in a team of three people, was probably the deciding factor," explains the new metro architect. According to her, her experience from the Institute of Planning and Development of the City of Prague could also have been the deciding factor.
He doesn't just see the metro as a functional transport structure. The stations should also have an aesthetic value.
"I have ideas about how the metro will change, how the space will be improved, but I will only find out how it will actually work in the coming weeks, when the transport company fills me in on their ideas," says Švarc.
"It is not a series of dogmas, but rather recommendations aimed primarily at maintaining the context of all stations in the event that they are reconstructed," the design manual explains.
Whether a similar tool is also a way to improve the public space in the Prague metro is a question. The Prague metro is specific. "Whether the manual is ideal, or whether it can be covered by a personality, I really do not know yet," concludes Švarc.
Cancer killed the bride shortly after the wedding: She left a note to her family
Gemma Sisson had been battling cancer for more than two years, and just when it seemed she had beaten it, the disease struck again.
The 39-year-old, who loved bodybuilding, eventually ended up in a hospice bed, where she was still able to marry the love of her life.
Unfortunately, she succumbed to the disease.
A few hours after her death, a shocking message appeared on her Facebook account for those closest to her.
Gemma Sisson, from Leeds, England, loved bodybuilding.
With her boyfriend Ricky Moore, with whom she lived for more than 16 years, they traveled to competitions held all over the world.
The 39-year-old woman played sports and lived a healthy life, but was diagnosed with cancer in April 2018.
Gemma began gruelling treatment, radiotherapy, in the hope that she would recover.
After months of treatment, it seemed that Gemma had beaten the cancer, but in August 2019, the cancer returned and this time it attacked her spine.
According to the British newspaper the Daily Mirror, the bodybuilder and personal trainer underwent a ten-hour operation on her spine and then began drastic treatment again.
But it was all in vain.
Earlier this year, on her 39th birthday, doctors told her she had a few months to live.
In April, the pretty blonde finally decided to join a hospice in Leeds, where she was constantly visited by her family, who even arranged a wedding for her with her love Ricky.
The marriage lasted two months.
The last time Ricky took Gemma to a restaurant was on their two-month anniversary.
Four days later, Gemma died in his arms.
Just a few hours after her death, a post Gema had written for her family appeared on her social media account.
"If this has been published, it means that I have finally died after weeks of fighting for too long.
Although I will be heartbroken to leave my loved ones behind, I will be so glad to be rid of what this terrible disease has done to me.
I can't thank Ricky enough for being by my side the whole time and giving me an enormous amount of love and support during that terrible time," she wrote on the social network, adding that the pain and suffering had finally stopped and she had found peace.
"I am also grateful for all the support I have received from all my followers on the social network," she wrote, adding that everyone should appreciate their life and live it to the fullest.
The first Miss Christ finally came to her senses: She lost a few kilos and immediately saw the light
The first modern Miss from 1989, Ivana Christová (49) had problems with excess weight for many years, which caused her not only physical problems, but mainly psychological ones. She suffered because she had changed a lot since the time of Miss Czechoslovakia. Now, however, it seems that she took the criticism to heart and went into battle with the excess pounds. Even if it is a long-distance run.
She used to be a first-class beauty who conquered even Paris. But thirty years have passed since then and Ivana Christová can only remember the beauty contest. Not only because of the fame, but also because of how thin she was.
Over time, she decided not to submit to the strict modeling rules, which ordered her to be as slim as possible and often not to eat. She decided to stop listening and began to indulge in what she wanted.
But she went from hunger strikes to overeating, which immediately affected her figure. She tried to disguise the extra pounds with various loose clothing, which, however, added dimension to the plump shapes.
Now it seems that Ivana has really come into her own. She has visibly lost weight, and has begun to dress tastefully and appropriately for her fuller figure.
All those present at the launch of the book by Miloš Zapletal (75) were surprised to see that she has regained the features of the charming brunette, who in 1989 went down in history not only as the first winner of Miss after the revolution, but also because of the controversy her victory caused.
Christová will always be the first beauty winner, but also the very first to whom the spectators at the Palace of Culture and Sport in Ostrava whistled as if they were out of their minds when she put on her crown.
'A travesty of justice': Scientist who warned of cancer from pollution is jailed in Turkey
Between 2011 and 2015, Sik and other scientists took part in a study commissioned by the Turkish Ministry of Health, which concluded that the pollution of water, soil and food in some industrial areas in the west of the country was linked to an increased incidence of cancer among the local population.
The scientists mentioned in particular the industrial zone of Dilovasi, which is located about 80 kilometers from Istanbul and is home to a number of chemical and metallurgical plants. According to them, people living in its vicinity suffer from cancer much more often than the international average.
Erdogan is taking revenge for the coup, despite international criticism
Sik felt that the government was not taking any action despite the clear conclusions of the study, so he wrote several articles about the research in the opposition daily Cumhuriyet. The authorities then began to prosecute him for disclosing classified information.
"The study clearly showed the extent to which water sources were contaminated with toxic substances," Sik told reporters after the verdict. "The court's decision shows that the results of studies that are directly related to public health can be suppressed. This is unacceptable," the scientist added.
"Instead of pursuing whistleblowers through the courts, the Turkish authorities should be investigating this major public health issue," said Andrew Gardner of Amnesty International Turkey.
Environmental and human rights groups have long accused the Turkish government of failing to enforce environmental regulations despite rapid industrial development in certain regions.
Following the failed 2016 coup, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's regime launched a sweeping wave of arrests, with nearly 80,000 people now behind bars, including a number of employees of the Cumhuriyet newspaper. The authorities have also suspended or dismissed 150,000 civil servants and members of the armed forces.
The opposition and human rights groups accuse the government of using the coup attempt to persecute its opponents, but the authorities say the measures are necessary to ensure national security.
Art vending machines sell a sweat dating site, a mushroom amulet and a memory game
For a hundred crowns, a passer-by will get a pocket-sized work by mostly novice Czech artists.
They create pictures and other work directly for artmat, so they know in advance that they have to fit into a size of 8.5 by 5.5 centimeters.
Each piece is numbered and signed.
"In the package there is always a curatorial text about the artist and then the work itself," said Petra Widžová, the curator of the project.
Artmat works with the principle of chance.
The buyer can thus be surprised by what kind of work of art he will get.
Currently, he can become the new owner of the fantastic illustrations by Alexandra Štoplová or the mini-views by Tereza Bonaventura, which can also be sent.
The artist Punx 23, in cooperation with Dora Dutková, has prepared a memory game connected with a walk through Prague.
The cards need to be paired with house signs.
Ilona Polanski has created a collection of tattoos for Artmat.
Marie Ladrová and Juliána Chomová sell pocket packs of spirituality: the first of the artists offers a protective amulet made of tinder and fortune-telling cards, the second a series of illustrations based on her comic strip Spiritistky.
The Slovenians beat the Polish world champions and are in the final of the European Championship
The Slovenian volleyball players will sensationally play for the first title of European champions. With the support of almost 12 thousand rioting fans in Ljubljana, they beat the reigning two-time world champions, the Poles, 3:1 and are the first finalists.
Who they will challenge in Sunday's climax in Paris will be decided on Friday between France and Serbia.
In the semifinals, the Slovenian team was much more compact than the Polish world champions. They only owned the beginning of the opening set and, with luck, the end of the second set, but the home volleyball players outdid themselves in defense, and of the players in the red and white jersey, only the native of Cuba, León, actually scored.
On the other hand, in the home line-up, the two dunkers Čebulj and Urnaut, as well as the second all-rounder Štern, who soon replaced the unimpressive Gasparini, were in the form of their lives. The Poles paid for the fact that they had won all the previous matches at this Euro with aplomb, while the Slovenians gained confidence after tough battles in the playoffs with the Bulgarians and the Russians.
The Slovenians lost 1:3 to the Poles in the Olympic qualifier in Gdansk this August, but they avenged the defeat at home. Now, however, they will leave the sold-out Ljubljana Arena Stožica. After today, however, they have a certain second medal in history, in Paris they can improve the unexpected silver from the European Championship four years ago.
At the previous European Championship, the Slovenians finished eighth, behind the Czech national team.
Traveler Zikmund or General Boček. The Senate handed out commemorative medals
The 96-year-old Boček, who was a fighter pilot in the British Air Force during the Second World War, thanked for the awarded medals on behalf of all the awardees. "The Senate was one of the first that did not and does not forget war veterans," he said, among other things. "The award that I received today also belongs to my friends who are no longer with us," he added.
In his speech, Kubera warned against dividing society. "Let us not forget our roots, which unite and shape all of us, whether we like it or not. After all, our successful present is based on these values," said Kubera.
The awards were given to Renata Cífková, cardiologist and the most cited Czech scientist, Petr Sáha, long-time rector of Tomas Bata University in Zlín, Václav Cílek, geologist, writer, traveller and populariser of science, Jiří Hamza, chairman of the Czech Biathlon Union and vice-president of the World Biathlon Union, and František Paštěka. The upper chamber praised his heroism - in January this year he saved the lives of his neighbour and his two-year-old granddaughter by pulling them out of a burning car. Former chairmen of the upper chamber Libuše Benešová and Milan Štěch also received medals.
Together with Jiří Hanzelka, Zikmund undertook a number of travel expeditions around the world, during which they collected a range of documentary material. Fištejn was a commentator and director of broadcasting at Radio Free Europe, and now works with public service media. Steigerwald also works as a playwright and scriptwriter, and the musician Kocáb was the head of the parliamentary commission overseeing the withdrawal of Soviet troops.
The astronomer and emeritus head of the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs, Luboš Perek, received the medal in advance, on the occasion of his 100th birthday in July. By the end of the year, the Czech-born and first US Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, and the British philosopher and political scientist Roger Scruton, who, among other things, participated in the activities of the so-called underground university during the communist regime in the former Czechoslovakia, are to receive the same award.
There are up to 60 times fewer insects than 40 years ago
No other animal class is more represented in nature than insects. Beetles, butterflies and other species make up more than half of life on Earth. But there are increasing reports that the insect kingdom is radically shrinking. Another scientific study on this topic was published just this week, and the situation is even more serious than humanity has realized so far.
The study is based on field research in a tropical forest in Puerto Rico, in which American scientists copied a similar survey from 1976. As they write right at the beginning of the report, there are "ten to sixty times fewer insects" in the forest today. This is a decrease in the entire population, i.e. not in the number of species, and the research concerned not only insects, but all arthropods. Due to the extinction of insects, the population of other fauna that is dependent on insects in the food chain, such as birds, frogs or lizards, is also decreasing.
The authors of the research put their conclusions in direct connection with climate change. According to them, the average air temperature in the forest has risen by two degrees Celsius over the past thirty years and warming has become the driving force behind the collapse of the food chain. According to the team of authors, the study shows that the impact of climate change on tropical ecosystems may be much greater than previously assumed.
"It's one of the most disturbing articles I've ever read," said David Wagner, an entomologist at the University of Connecticut, who was quoted by the Post as an independent expert.
The extinction of insects also affects Europe. "In our country, the decline is also of an order of magnitude," points out Lukáš Čížek from the Institute of Entomology of the Academy of Sciences. According to him, in addition to climate change, it is also necessary to take into account the changes in the landscape, which play a significant role in Europe. "In our country, it just takes a significantly longer time than in Puerto Rico," adds Čížek to explain why scientists were able to measure such a rapid decline in the forest compared to the 1970s.
French Oscar nominee Les Misérables will open the Be2Can show
The Golden Bear and the two acting awards from this year's Berlinale, the director's award and the jury prize from Cannes and much more will be presented by the 6th year of the festival film from Berlin, Venice and Cannes. This year, the Be2Can festival will once again bring a selection of the most remarkable and inspiring films presented by the competitions of the three most important European film festivals.
The opening film of this year's festival will be the French drama Les Misérables, for which the author of the film Ladj Ly won the Jury Prize at this year's Cannes Film Festival. The film is a French candidate for the Oscar. The preview of the film in Prague will be personally introduced by the representatives of the two main roles of the police officers of the criminal unit, the actors Alexis Manenti and Djibril Zonga. Alexis Manenti is also the co-author of the script of the film.
This year, Be2Can will take place at the Lucerna and Edison Filmhub cinemas in Prague, as well as in Brno (Art cinema), Ostrava (Minikino) and Zlín (Golden Apple Cinema) from 2 to 8 October.
After its success at Cannes, Ladj Ly's directorial feature debut was screened and awarded at a number of other world festivals. It won the Best Film Award and the Best Screenplay Award at the Durban IFF, and was also screened at the IFF in Zurich, Shanghai, Munich, Melbourne, Sarajevo and will soon be screened in San Sebastian.
As part of the festival, viewers can also look forward to the films Synonyms, Young Ahmed, Disruptor of the System, Farewell, My Son, Sorry, We Missed You, Anthology of the City of Ghosts and At the Golden Glove. But they can also look forward to other fresh news from this year's Venice, which will be distributed in the Czech Republic: sci-fi Ad Astra, Joker, and the Czech triumph of The Painted Bird.

Police union president Stepanek resigns, wants to live as a free man
The chairman of the Independent Trade Union of Police, Milan Štěpánek, has decided to leave his post, Czech Radio - Radiožurnál reported on Friday. Štěpánek has led the union since 2005. He will be the chairman of the union for another two months. He will remain in the police even after leaving the head of the union.
"I can confirm that this week I handed in my written resignation to the board, after which I will continue to perform my duties in full for another two months," Štěpánek told Radiožurnál. "I made my decision as a free man who does not want to be tied to the trade union forever. And who wants to live a quieter life," he said, explaining his reasons for leaving.
The independent trade union of the Police of the Czech Republic associates members and employees of the security forces or employees of the Ministry of the Interior. Among other things, the union has participated in police protests against budget cuts or petitions for better conditions for the security forces. For example, in 2011 it got into a dispute with the then Minister of the Interior Radek John and organized a petition for his resignation. The leadership of the governing coalition later agreed on John's departure.
Salaries in the health sector will increase by a maximum of five percent next year.
According to Vojtěch, a larger increase is unrealistic
Salaries in the health sector could increase by a maximum of five percent next year, said the Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch (for ANO) in the Questions of Václav Moravec on Czech Television.
He considers the union's demand for an increase of up to 15 percent to be unrealistic.
He also said that the state should try to be self-sufficient in providing protective equipment.
According to him, the hospitals now have their supplies.
"I think that the increase (in salaries) can be somewhere up to five percent," the minister said.
According to him, it is necessary to reflect on the current situation, where the coronavirus pandemic and government regulations against its spread have affected the collection of insurance premiums since March.
The income of the insurance companies fell at that time.
"I think an increase of 15 percent is unrealistic at the moment," Vojtěch said.
The average monthly earnings of a doctor in acute inpatient care, according to data from the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (IHIS), will probably reach 88,312 crowns this year, and 47,498 crowns for nurses.
The difference between the salary of nurses in state hospitals and the salary of other founders will be up to seven thousand crowns.
The IHIS data also shows that the decline in the number of nurses in hospitals has stopped.
The average wage in the Czech Republic was 34,125 crowns in 2019, according to data from the Czech Statistical Office.
Trade union representatives said in June that they would demand a minimum increase of ten percent for 2021, ideally 15 percent.
They criticise the long-term significant difference between the earnings of doctors and nurses in state hospitals, which have to follow salary scales, and contractual wages in city, regional or private hospitals.
For this reason, they also demand that the salary scales for health care workers should be uniform.
For nurses this year, the difference will be up to seven thousand crowns a month.
In the case of doctors, for example, wages grew faster than salaries last year.
According to the President of the Czech Dental Chamber, Roman Šmukler, trade unionists should be aware of the current situation in the country.
Due to the impact of the COVID epidemic, the Chamber of Deputies recently approved an increase in this year's state budget deficit to a record 500 billion crowns, of which 1.75 billion is to go to the remuneration of health workers in hospitals and social services.
According to Smukler, the Council of Health Care Providers does not agree with the across-the-board increase in salaries next year.
According to him, the remuneration should be decided by the hospitals and health care facilities themselves and the extra money should go to them through the reimbursement decree.
Vojtěch also said that hospitals currently have enough protective equipment.
The chairman of the State Material Reserves Administration (SSHR), Pavel Švagr, said this week that the administration does not currently own a single piece of protective medical equipment.
He is waiting for the tenders to be completed.
According to Vojtěch, suppliers around the world are now able to deliver goods better than in March, when they were bought out.
According to him, the state should also try to be as self-sufficient as possible and buy from Czech companies.
Petra Černocká has changed her image and done the right thing! She has become younger with blonde hair
Film Saxana Petra Černocká (69) looks absolutely fantastic for her age. Even though she will celebrate her life anniversary in November, she has never looked like a pensioner. And now she has helped it. She changed her image until her colleagues did not recognize her.
The actress Petra Černocká has never looked like a typical grandmother, who would have her hair streaked with grey, wear staid things and go out sporadically. She has always taken care of herself and the older she gets, the more she is able to let go of her image.
Fortunately, she has not succumbed to the trend of plastic surgery and takes care of her skin with the help of good old indulona. And her anti-wrinkle recipe is paying off. But now she has changed her hair color and has completely seen through it.
When she came to a social event where celebrities were saying goodbye to the summer, no one could recognize Petra. Not only did she have lighter and shorter hair, but she was also dressed in a yellow jacket, which made her shine even more.
Ladies should learn from Saxana how not to underestimate themselves, that even on the threshold of their seventies they can take risks with their appearance. And it paid off for Petra, she looks no more than fifty.
Lucie Bílá's father was not a fan of her at all. You won't believe what she had to do for a living!
Who does not know that the national treasure Lucie Bílá (53) is originally a seamstress and her real name is Hana Zaňáková, probably does not live in the Czech Republic. But the singer herself has now revealed that she almost worked in a glass factory!
Lucie Bílá knew from a relatively early age that she wanted to be a singer. Her love for singing was born when, as a little girl, she performed in a cultural house in her native Otvovice, where the warbler still lives.
"And I remember exactly where my mother was sitting. At that time, a singer was born in me," she admitted to Impulsu radio.
Her father, however, was a little worried about his daughter's future and therefore advised her to follow the path of a craft that has a golden bottom.
"My dad always said: 'Craft girl, craft. Walk with your feet on the ground!' He even persuaded me to go to the local glassworks. The glassworks doesn't work anymore, but I do. I'm a trained seamstress and at home I make various rosaries and pendants from beads, which I then auction at auctions and use the money to buy wheelchairs," she added with a laugh.
The Děčín Zoo is delighted with the little macaque
"Our group currently has seven members. Its youngest member came into the world on 17 August, the female Buffy gave birth to him and he is her fifth cub, the father is the male Hitam. For the first few days after the birth, the female carried the cub tightly pressed to her body and for a long time she did not want to show the world whether she had given birth to a male or a female. However, at about three weeks of the cub's age, she gradually began to put it aside for a short while and the zookeepers have known for a few days that it is a male," said zoo spokeswoman Alena Houšková, adding that the Děčín Zoo has already successfully bred 12 cubs of this species.
Crested macaques are so-called endemic to the island of Sulawesi, which means that they do not live in the wild anywhere else in the world. A typical feature is black fur and a crest on the head, from which they get their name. Crested macaques live in rainforests, especially at lower altitudes.
Like most primates, it eats both plant and animal food. The diet is dominated by the fruits of forest trees, which complement the flowers and leaves. It solves the need for protein by eating small arthropods, larvae and, to a lesser extent, bird eggs and young.
"Apart from the natural enemies, which are pythons, everything else has been caused by humans. Locals hunt macaques as a popular prey with tasty meat and for fur. The burning and cutting down of the rainforest is also fatal for these animals," the spokeswoman added.
The unexplained death of a little girl (†8) in the Příbram region: The guilty party will not be punished
Unexplained cases are called "monuments" in criminal slang. However, they are also investigated if new information comes to light years later, especially when it comes to the death of a child. In 1980, criminalist Jiří Markovič was able to investigate the murder of two girls in Prague's Prokop Valley, which was 12 years old at the time. "A case from 1955? That will be difficult, very difficult. For a start, it would be necessary to find the file, it may no longer exist, to talk to those who investigated it. There is always hope, but it would be really difficult," says Markovič.
Under the previous regime, the public was not informed much about violent crimes, but according to Markovič, this certainly does not mean that they were investigated laxly. "It always depended on specific people," thinks the criminologist. The problem may be that materials from the 1950s may be destroyed, although unclosed cases should not be shredded.
Scrubbing smart quarantine could be taken over by soldiers.
We are ready, they say
"The smart quarantine is working, of course there is room for improvement.
We are going to discuss it with the army this evening.
The army is working perfectly and the question is whether they should run the whole thing again," the prime minister said on Sunday in his Facebook show "Ciao people."
According to him, it is not possible to sufficiently connect IT systems and sanitary stations, which gradually have to switch to more modern methods of operation.
According to the prime minister, there were problems in the Moravian-Silesian region, which is one of the current hot spots of the epidemic.
Defence Ministry spokesman Jan Pejsek told the Czech News Agency that he had no information about Sunday's meeting and that the government should discuss the matter on Monday.
According to him, the army is ready for this step.
The smart quarantine project was taken over by the Ministry of Health on 25 May.
Until then, the smart quarantine was led by a 90-member central management team set up under the army as an advisory body to the government, which was led by the former deputy minister Roman Prymula.
Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (Czech Social Democratic Party - ČSSD) criticized the controversial project on Sunday.
He also suggested that it could be taken over by the army again.
The government commissioner for IT and digitalisation, Vladimír Dzurilla, who is in charge of the project, has also previously admitted shortcomings in the project.
"The system is working, but it is still a work in progress.
For twenty years it was created independently and unsystematically, now we are trying to unify it in a few months.
It cannot be done at a gallop.
People are adapting to the new systems as they go along, the poor hygienists are adapting to the new systems as they go along, and they are actually catching the mistakes," he said.
Ostrava Mayor Macura won't run for re-election because he doesn't want to "make a fool of himself in politics"
The current mayor of Ostrava, Tomáš Macura (ANO), will not be a candidate in the next local elections.
The reason for this is an effort "not to fool around in politics," he told news server Respekt.cz.
Macura, who is also a member of the board of the ANO movement, has been mayor of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the local elections in 2018, the candidate of the ANO movement led by him won almost a third of the votes in Ostrava.
Macura originally wanted to be in office for only four years.
"I told myself that I would last one term and with my business experience I would be able to turn everything around and get it back on its feet," he told Respekt.
He added that he had to some extent allowed himself to be persuaded to run for a second term.
"But for me it is the maximum.
I don't want to fool around in politics," added Macura, who described himself in the interview as a heavy introvert who is not comfortable with frequent contact with people.
According to Respekt, there has been speculation for some time about Macur's possible end in the ANO movement.
The server recalls that Macura has criticized the ANO movement several times, for example for its alliance with the SPD movement or for supporting Miloš Zeman in the presidential elections.
He was one of the few ANO personalities to support Zeman's opponent, Jiří Drahoš, in the election.
Macura does not plan to leave the ANO movement, which he joined in 2017.
"As long as I have the feeling that I can make a difference in the movement, that it is not a completely futile struggle and that no one is interfering with me, I have no immediate motive to quit," he told Respekt.
Macura, 56, graduated from the University of Economics in Prague.
Before becoming the mayor of Ostrava in 2014, Macura worked, among other things, as the director of the pharmaceutical company Walmark.
He also sat on the boards of other companies.
Uber will return to Brno offering transport services
The company Uber, which offers transportation services, will return to Brno at the end of July.
This is the result of a change in the law, Brno City Councillor for Transport Petr Kratochvíl (ODS) said in a press statement on Thursday.
Taxi drivers protested against Uber in Brno, pointing out that Uber does not meet the conditions, such as the designation as a taxi or a taximeter.
However, a change in the law has changed the conditions for the operation of regular taxis and alternative ones since July.
Kratochvíl has had several meetings with representatives of Uber in recent weeks.
"Based on these, the company decided to return to Brno with its services at the end of July this year.
The move is the result of a change in the law that allows the company to operate legally.
The city has been made aware of this change and we believe that the company will operate its services within the given limits," Kratochvíl said.
Uber has operated in Brno in the past.
Taxi drivers protested against it because the vehicles were not marked as taxis or because they did not have a taximeter.
The court issued a preliminary injunction that banned Uber from operating in the city.
Brno originally supported taxi drivers, but at the end of last year, Mayor Markéta Vaňková (ODS) said that the city would like to take steps to make Uber work in Brno.
According to later court decisions, Uber was allowed to operate in Brno, but the company did not take advantage of this.
It will now return following a change in the law.
Since July, in addition to classic taxis with a lamp and a taximeter, it has been easier to operate a transport service ordered and paid for exclusively via mobile applications.
A too exuberant celebration in Brno: a flying chair landed a meter away from a person on the sidewalk
An office chair flew out of the fourth floor of a block of flats in Brno on Saturday evening and landed about a metre from the pavement.
A pedestrian was walking behind him at the time and immediately called the police.
Immediately after arriving at the address in the western part of the city, the patrol noticed an open window, under which a chair was still lying and next to it several cans and cigarette butts.
"The noise coming from the room on the fourth floor indicated that there was a rather noisy party going on inside.
The officers went up the corridor to the apartment and asked the three young men present, aged between 26 and 29, for an explanation," said Jakub Ghanem, a spokesman for the officers.
Young Czechs think they are good with money, but the survey does not confirm this
"It turns out that young Czechs are somewhat more confident in their knowledge of finance than is the reality. In this case, women and respondents without a high school diploma had a significantly higher proportion of wrong answers," said the director of KRUK, Jaroslava Palendalová.
Men and young high school or college students are more likely to trust their knowledge of financial products.
Young Czechs learn the most about the functioning of financial matters from their parents (37 percent), through self-study on the Internet (23 percent) and only in the third place from lessons at school (21 percent).
It is mainly women who consult their parents about financial issues, while men are more likely to search for information on the Internet. Obtaining financial information from parents prevails in all age categories of young people, regardless of their level of education or personal income. Brochures of financial institutions, professional magazines and publications have practically minimal influence.
"Once again, the importance of the upbringing of children by their parents, who represent authority in all major areas of life, is shown. Therefore, the level of financial literacy of parents who transfer their knowledge and experience to their offspring is crucial," said Palendalová.
Savings and investments are preferred by 94 percent of young people.
Young people clearly take a stand on the question of whether it is better to save and, for example, buy their own house or apartment, or to enjoy themselves and rather spend money, without saving and owning their own home.
The strategy of saving and investing in long-term tangible assets is followed by 94 percent of respondents. This is true across all age categories of young people, regardless of education, social status or current level of personal income.
People in a marriage with two or more children and employees in the public sector are 100% in favour of the saving strategy. On the other hand, people living alone and with an income of more than 30,000 crowns a month want to enjoy themselves.
Strict, but fair, we enjoy the lessons! This is how the high school students in Benešov see their favourite teacher, the writer
Humanism should be present in every good book, Pavel Hoza is convinced. The high school teacher of Czech language and history is at the same time a poet, a prose writer and a promoter of literary life in a small town.
Pavel Hoza's texts bring to mind Bohuslav Reynek. His poetry, his paintings. Bare trees, whitewashed country houses, quivering grass, shepherds, sheep and goats, old roads and the people who have walked them for centuries. Mourners, cursing, blessing. This contemporary follower of Reynek teaches Czech language, literature and history at the grammar school in Benešov, runs the equivalent of the Prague Viola in the local Café na slovíčko and organizes the Benešov Literary Festival every year.
Babiš to discuss demand for Rafaj's dismissal with ČSSD
On Monday, Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO) plans to discuss with the coalition Social Democrats the demand for a proposal to dismiss the head of the Antimonopoly Office (ÚOHS), Petr Rafaj.
Non-profit organizations called for the dismissal of Rafaj at a meeting of the government's anti-corruption council, as did the Ústí Region.
The Social Democrats say that a change at the head of the office is in order.
According to information from the Czech News Agency, Rafaj was not invited to the Office of the Government on Monday.
His second mandate will end in the middle of next year; according to the law, he cannot be appointed for a third time.
His dismissal is within the competence of President Milos Zeman.
In addition to the call of non-profit organizations, the Prime Minister also received a letter with a similar request from the Ústí nad Labem region.
The reason is said to be, among other things, Rafaj's recent cases.
Last week, the prime minister refused to comment on the request, saying that he would familiarize himself with the materials and that the government parties would take "some position" on it.
He also said that he had not yet discussed the challenges with the president and that he did not have a meeting scheduled with him in the near future.
According to the statement of the OPC, there is no reason for an appeal because Rafaj has not been charged with anything.
Servers IHNED.cz and Aktuálně.cz wrote in the past week that the police are interested in Rafaj's meetings with Governor Jiří Čunek.
The meetings were connected, among other things, with the decision on the competition for the project of a controversial new hospital in Zlín for eight billion, which Čunek is pushing hard.
Čunek admitted to the meetings, according to which they discussed his "Senate activities."
Rafaj says the same thing.
The council of the Ústí nad Labem region called on the government to dismiss Rafaje at the end of June.
It also calls for a reform of the decision-making mechanisms of the authority.
According to Deputy Governor for Transport Jaroslav Komínek, the decision-making of the Office for the Protection of Competition regarding public contracts is not transparent and has signs of arbitrariness.
Last March, the police intervened at the antimonopoly office because of a tender for toll collection.
In June this year, news server Aktuálně.cz drew attention to the fact that Rafaj was using flats registered in the name of the company of influential ČSSD backroom player Alexander Čuba.
However, the deposit of 3.5 million for the apartment in Brno was paid from Rafaj's account.
Rafaj has been the chairman of the Office for the Protection of Competition since 9 July 2009. The president appointed the former Social Democrat MP for a second term in June 2015.
In less than a year, Rafajov's second six-year mandate will expire.
The law on the anti-monopoly office states that the president can dismiss the head of the office on the proposal of the government.
He can only be dismissed if he does not perform his duties for more than six months, or if he seriously undermines the dignity of his office or the independence and impartiality of the office.

In the Blansko library, employees were collapsing from the heat.
Air conditioning will help
The new technology will cost 740 thousand and will be in operation in the second half of August.
"For me, this is good news.
My three children and I regularly go to the library in the centre of Blansko.
In the warm months, however, it was practically impossible to stay there.
It was very hot and the air was bad.
The ventilation did not help.
That is why I am happy about the air conditioning," said one of the Blansko readers, Petr Novotný.
According to the director of the library, Lukáš Dlapa, the temperature in the building often rose to over thirty degrees.
The south wall of the building is glazed and acts as a greenhouse on sunny days.
"In addition, thanks to the curvature of the building, the sun shines into it for a large part of the day.
At the same time, it is a big problem to ventilate the individual departments, because the windows have to be closed overnight for safety reasons.
It is often already thirty degrees in the library in the morning," said Dlapa.
The worst situation was in the study and reading room on the third floor.
And on the floor above are the exhibition rooms and the director's office.
There was also an unpleasant climate in the children's ward, which is located under the roof of the building.
"It has happened several times that librarians have collapsed at work and ended up on sick leave.
The problem also occurred regularly in the cultural room at lectures, which are attended by dozens of people.
After a few minutes it was no longer possible to breathe there," said Dlapa.
Originally, representatives of the city wanted to install air conditioning in all areas of the library this year.
In the end, there will only be three circuits out of five.
"Due to limited funding, only the most problematic areas will have air conditioning.
Study and reading room on the third floor.
There is also a cultural room and a children's department on the floor above," said Jiří Svoboda from the investment department in Blansko.
He added that in the first phase, the workers had already installed air conditioning and modified the electrical installation in the aforementioned premises last autumn.
For approximately 360 thousand crowns.
The Blansko Municipal Library has almost three thousand registered readers.
Of these, about 900 are under the age of 15.

The backbone of Chicago has been driven out by the coronavirus.
Crawford gets back in the game
Not every infected athlete comes out with the truth.
Especially when it comes to players from the NHL, which is as silent as the grave about the health of players and does not publish anything at all.
Crawford was one of the few to step out of line.
The 35-year-old native of Montreal was only present at the first training session and has been absent from the lineup since then.
"I would like to inform you all that I have tested positive for Covid-19 and as a result I have been confined to my home for the past two weeks," he said, revealing the reason for his absence.
Fans no longer have to worry about his health.
Crawford is ready to take on the full load again.
"It's amazing to be back.
I will do everything I can to get in shape as soon as possible," he added.
The experienced goalie has won two Stanley Cups with Chicago and has been an integral part of the crease for the tenth season in a row.
The Blackhawks will play a preseason game against St. Louis before facing Edmonton in the preliminary round.
Přerov: The driver crashed near the village of Kokory: He died trapped in his Fabia
The tragic traffic accident occurred on Friday on a straight section between Přerov and the village of Kokory. The 28-year-old driver of the Fabia lost control and drove off the road. The car flipped over onto its roof and he remained wedged under it. He did not survive the injuries he suffered.
"According to initial information found at the scene, a passenger vehicle travelling in the direction of Kokory went off the road, where it overturned onto its roof and the driver remained wedged under the vehicle," Přerov police spokesperson Miluše Zajícová told news server novinky.cz.
Thousands protest in Israel against prime minister
Thousands of Israelis have protested in several parts of the country against unemployment, corruption and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's handling of the coronavirus crisis.
The demonstrations took place, among others, in front of Netanyahu's private villa in the city of Caesarea, near his official residence and in a park in Tel Aviv.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, protests have been taking place regularly for several weeks.
The protesters are demanding Netanyahu's resignation over his trial on corruption and fraud charges, as well as the government's handling of the coronavirus outbreak.
"Bibi, go home," one protester wrote on his banner, referring to Netanyahu's popular nickname, according to the Associated Press.
"Everyone can see that the emperor has lost his clothes," read another.
Netanyahu, 70, is the first Israeli prime minister to be tried while in office.
He is accused in three cases of corruption, fraud and breach of trust.
He denies all the accusations and calls them a witch hunt.
According to local media, the trial could last up to three years, with more than 300 witnesses being called.
The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has been confirmed in nearly 60,500 people in Israel, which has a population of about nine million.
Some 455 people have died in connection with the outbreak.
The Israeli government introduced quarantine measures in March, which have helped to reduce the daily increases in infections.
However, after the gradual easing of restrictions from the end of April, the number of infected people began to grow significantly again, especially at the end of June.
Netanyahu's critics say the government has not done enough to help, for example, business owners affected by the quarantine measures.
The protesters are also bothered by the fact that the government sometimes issues contradictory instructions as part of the fight against the coronavirus.
Czernin calls on Schiller to step down for saying the opposition is dirty
"I consider it completely unacceptable for a member of the Czech government to use such totalitarian language anywhere, let alone on the floor of parliament," Czernin wrote in an open letter to Schiller.
Her words caused a stir during the discussion of the proposal for a constitutional complaint against President Milos Zeman. The opposition did not get enough votes and the proposal for a constitutional complaint, which came from the Senate, was thrown off the table by the deputies.
"I receive dozens of messages from people I do not know. There is not a single voice in support of this lawsuit. There are messages in support of the president and messages such as how taxpayers' money is being spent here, how empty straw is being beaten here. And I even dare, without using harsh terms, to quote one of them: It is opposition and senatorial filth," said the Minister of Finance.
"These expressions were used by the Nazis against citizens of Jewish origin and by the Communists against their political opponents. It is totalitarian rhetoric, without an ounce of respect for people and their opinions," TOP 09 deputy chairman Czernin, who will compete for the post of party chairman with the current first deputy chairwoman Markéta Pekarová Adamová in the autumn, wrote to the minister.
"I quoted one of the many messages that I received dozens of times during the proceedings of the Chamber of Deputies. Their common denominator was disgust at the constant personal defamation that we witness in domestic politics on a daily basis and which was also the main motive for Thursday's proceedings of the Chamber of Deputies. The fact that someone applies the term to themselves surprises me," Schillerová told the Czech News Agency.
The driver crashed the car into a tree and died.
The body had to be cut out of the wreck by firefighters
The tragic accident happened around 11 p.m. near Neveklov on a narrow county road leading from the Slapy Dam.
The driver apparently flew down into the forest at considerable speed and smashed the car into a tree.
He died at the scene.
The body had to be extricated from the wreckage by firefighters, who also cut off the roof.
Police are investigating the circumstances of the crash.
They have ordered an autopsy, which should clarify, among other things, whether the man was driving under the influence of alcohol or any other addictive substance.
No more waste and churning out one collection after another.
Pietro Filipi cancels discounts and bets on sustainability
The Czech clothing brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and is embarking on this with a fundamental change in strategy.
It is doing away with discounts and no longer wants to churn out one collection after another.
The fact that the fashion industry is one of the biggest polluters of the environment is nothing new.
Billions of pieces of clothing end up in incinerators and landfills every year.
However, the view of slow fashion, an often despised approach to dressing, has been changing quite rapidly in recent years.
Pietro Filipi sold about half of the goods at full price.
The other half, which was sold thanks to discounts, will not be bought so easily.
The company does not want to churn out one collection after another and at the end of each season discount the products below their production price.
In addition, according to the owner Michal Mička, the times of new and old collections and blindly following rapidly changing fashion trends are over.
"Most retailers already count on discounts when purchasing goods, so a much higher margin is included in the full price.
So it is actually a bit of a scam," says the owner of Pietro Filipi, Michal Mička.
In addition, the company wants to support local business with its approach.
"Each of our products is made from carefully selected quality fabrics and designed by local designers.
We put emphasis on the fact that a large part of our collection consists of so-called basic pieces - i.e. clothing that is timeless and out of season.
Globally, the segment of premium brands is characterized by the absence of any discounts, the price of the product simply corresponds to its quality and there is no need for a discount," adds Mička.
Giant graffiti features RAF airman Kurt Taussig
"The assignment was to create something for the anniversary of the end of the war.
And I remembered our fighter pilot who fought in the ranks of the British Royal Air Force in the Second World War.
The city administration liked the design," said Vacek, who completed his work after two weeks of intensive work.
He used around 300 litres of paint and 50 spray cans.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplice-Šanov.
He left the city when he was 15.
During the war, because of his Jewish origin, the Nazis took him to an internment camp, where he was held for several weeks.
However, he and his brother managed to avoid the concentration camp thanks to the organization of Nicholas Winton.
In 1939, Taussig made his way to Great Britain, where he voluntarily joined the Royal Air Force (RAF), and later underwent pilot training in the African Southern Rhodesia and Palestine.
He took part in combat operations at the beginning of 1945.
After the Velvet Revolution, he visited the Czech Republic several times, as well as his native Teplice, which granted him honorary citizenship.
Forty-six-year-old Kamil Vacek, whom people in the field of street graphic art know by the nickname Camo, has been working with spray cans on the streets of Teplice for more than 20 years.
He started with graffiti on areas that were set aside for this purpose by the then mayor Jaroslav Kubera (ODS).
Sparta is really busy this year, admits Hradec Králové defender Nedomlel
In his case, the increased motivation is more than understandable. Hradec Králové hockey defender Richard Nedomlel will play in Friday's game against the club where he recently played. However, the former Spartan is convinced that his teammates will be in a similar situation, even though they have never worn the jersey of the Prague club.
"Everyone wants to do well against Sparta," says the player from Hradec Králové before the match of the 5th extra league round.
Hradec Králové will try to extend its winning streak, which at the moment includes three three-point wins in a row. After Kladno and Pilsen, the most appreciated by the fans came on Sunday, Mountfield went to neighboring Pardubice.
"But we can't look at the games as they were. We need to focus on the games that await us now and play in them the same, if not better," the Hradec Králové defender points out.
The Hradec team should not even look back at last year's record against Sparta. They lost three out of four games, taking points only once after winning in Prague after extra time. In addition, the Sparta management brought in several significant reinforcements in the summer and expects the team to return to the top.
"Sparta has always had quality players, but let's face it, this year they are really loaded," admits Nedomlel ahead of the first game at the end of this week.
And the other one? Also a nice shift, waiting for Mountfield on Sunday afternoon in Třinec.
XXX Lutz can buy competitor Kik, the authority has allowed. But there is a catch
"The Office for the Protection of Competition has approved the merger of competitors - XLCEE-Holding GmbH, on the one hand, and Kika Nábytek and Lambda Properties Czechia, on the other hand, subject to the fulfilment of structural obligations set in favour of maintaining effective competition," said Martin Švanda, spokesperson for the Office for the Protection of Competition.
In addition to the XXX Lutz chain, XLCEE-Holding owns the Möbelix stores. If it were to absorb the Kika chain, it would occupy too large a share of the Czech furniture and accessories market. Therefore, it must sell off part of the acquired company.
XLCEE-Holding is also buying Kika branches in other countries where the chain operates, i.e. in Hungary, Slovakia and Romania. Even there, the transaction must be approved by the antitrust authorities. The purchase of 22 foreign branches of the Kika chain from the Signa holding was announced by XXX Lutz in May. Signa took over the bankrupt Kika last year for a symbolic price.
The Kika chain entered the Czech market in 2005 and is second only to the Swedish company IKEA. Before it was taken over by the Austrian company Signa, it belonged to the South African company Steinhoff International Holdings since 2013. The company faced problems when it discovered irregularities in its accounting. Kika has nine stores in the Czech Republic.
XXX Lutz has been operating in the Czech Republic since 2010. In addition to IKEA, Sconto, Jysk, Asko-Nábytek and Kika, it is one of the largest furniture retailers on the domestic market. The same owner owns the Möbelix brand. After taking over the foreign branches of Kika, XXX Lutz will operate more than 300 department stores in 12 countries. According to the company's website, its annual turnover is 4.4 billion euros (about 114 billion CZK).
Storm Hanna makes landfall on Texas coast
Hurricane Hanna made landfall on the southwest coast of the US state of Texas on Saturday afternoon local time (before midnight CEST last night).
It made landfall on Padre Island, Texas, about 15 miles north of Port Mansfield, and weakened to a tropical storm as it moved over land.
According to meteorologists, however, it still poses a great danger to the inhabitants of coastal areas.
It brought with it strong winds and intense rainfall; along with local flooding, according to the AP, there are reports of power outages and various material damage, including damaged boats.
On Saturday, Texas Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of natural disaster for 32 counties in southwest Texas and advised people to voluntarily evacuate.
The strongest warning was given to people in the coastal strip between Port Mansfield and Mesquite Bay, but in total the element is to affect an area of almost 500 kilometers before gradually moving over northeastern Mexico.
"Although Hanna is now a tropical storm, heavy rain and wind, storm surge, dangerous surf and isolated tornadoes could still pose a threat," the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) warned.
This morning local time (afternoon CEST), the storm was moving in the area of the US-Mexico border and was accompanied by winds of 85 kilometers per hour.
Hanna became the first hurricane of this year's Atlantic hurricane season on Saturday.
Over the Gulf of Mexico, it was accompanied by winds of up to 145 kilometers per hour, but as it moved towards the mainland, it gradually weakened to 112 kilometers per hour, which again excluded Hanna from the category of hurricanes.
The authorities urged local residents to wait out the storm at home and not to forget the hygiene measures associated with the prevention of the spread of the coronavirus.
Texas is one of the US states hardest hit by the covid-19 pandemic.
Given the existing security measures and the need to keep distances, possible evacuations are also a big challenge.
Makeshift shelters have been opened in hotels, schools and gyms.
In Hidalgo County, Texas, one of the buildings has also been set up as a shelter for evacuees who have tested positive for the coronavirus or have been exposed in other ways.
Local authorities have urged all evacuees to take masks and disinfectant gels with them to the shelter if possible.
"This is far from over.
We're expecting catastrophic flooding," the AP quoted Chris Birchfield, who works for the National Weather Service (NWS) in Brownsville, as saying.
Forecasts say that in some places up to 300 millimeters of rain could fall in just a few hours, in some cases almost 500 millimeters, which, together with the rise in sea level, could flood a number of coastal settlements.
Toyota still believes in hydrogen, prepares the second generation of the Mirai
The Toyota Mirai was never meant to be just a concept. Toyota was so serious about it that even though there was practically no infrastructure for pumping hydrogen in the world, they still put it on the menu. Not a completely standard one, the customer had to really go after this car, but no one else offered such an option at the time.
The head of Toyota, Takeshi Uchiyamada, confirmed at an international conference on hydrogen that a new generation will arrive next year. Toyota still believes that these cars have a future and will be comparable in price to hybrids within ten years. Of course, this is linked to the development of refueling networks. However, the future is linked to hydrogen as well as electricity.
At the conference, the word hydrogen was often mentioned with the needs of environmentally friendly operation not of passenger cars, but on the contrary of large tractors, ships, trains, etc. Simply those means of transport that need to cover long distances with one refueling. Pure battery versions cannot offer this. Toyota could thus find new markets thanks to its great experience and long development.
It remains to be recalled that, like Toyota, Hyundai also believes in hydrogen propulsion, which now also offers the hydrogen crossover Nexo.

Zeman to confer the rank of general on Colonel Lipka
President Miloš Zeman will confer the rank of general on Colonel Pavel Lipka on Wednesday.
This is stated in the overview of expected events of the Ministry of Defence.
The reason for the award of the rank of brigadier general is Lipka's appointment in August to the post of deputy commander of the Alliance's Multinational Division Northeast in Poland.
Lipka still serves as the deputy commander of the ground forces of the Czech Army.
The promotion to Zeman was proposed by the government at the end of June.
From the beginning of August, Lipka will replace Brigadier General Karel Rehka in the position of Deputy Commander of the Multinational Division Northeast in Elblag, Poland, which commands the units of the Alliance's forward presence in Poland and the Baltics.
Řehka became director of the National Cyber and Information Security Agency (NCISA) in March.
The government proposed to the president that Lipka be given the rank of brigadier general.
According to the law on professional soldiers, a higher rank may be conferred on a soldier for the duration of the performance of an elected office or for the duration of the performance of a service task that requires the conferral of a higher rank.
The rank of general corresponds to the post of deputy commander of an alliance division.
A soldier to whom a rank has been conferred has the same rights and obligations as if he had been appointed to that rank.
However, he is not entitled to a salary adjustment that would correspond to the given rank.
The conferral of a rank lasts until the reason for which it was granted ceases to exist.
"Colonel Lipka demonstrates a high level of professional readiness and is a role model for his subordinates.
He plays a significant role in fulfilling the tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic, including cooperation with foreign partners and ensuring the participation of the army in foreign operations," the Ministry of Defence said in June about the proposal for promotion.
Wednesday's promotion ceremony will take place at 12:30 at Prague Castle and will be attended by Defence Minister Lubomír Metnar and Chief of the General Staff Aleš Opata.
A technically perfect mess with a weak script. Gemini Man with Will Smith did not impress the critics
The dystopian sci-fi spectacle Gemini Man boasts an interesting premise - Will Smith will face his younger version in the film. According to critics, however, the story is the weakest part of the film. The film will be released in Czech cinemas on 10 October.
Henry Brogan (Will Smith) is the absolute top in his field. He kills efficiently and without unnecessary questions. But one day he decides to hang up his career. Of course, this does not please his employers, who send another killer to Henry. The catch is that the killer is Henry himself, or more precisely, his younger clone created from DNA. Can one determined person win the fight over himself? This time literally.
Three-time Oscar winner Ang Lee was supposed to be a certain guarantee of quality. Although this is his first sci-fi, he has a wealth of experience with dramatic action films, as he demonstrated, for example, in the aforementioned Tiger and the Dragon or the western Ride with the Devil. Six screenwriters collaborated on the script. The most famous is certainly David Benioff, one of the creators of the highly successful Game of Thrones. According to the first reviews, however, even all this was not enough for a good film.
"Even though Ang Lee is trying to do great things in technical filmmaking, the film itself doesn't have enough character to make it stand out," says Fionnuala Hannigan of Screen Daily.
"This disappointing film is less than the sum of the talents involved, with a weak script and plot held together only by the filmmakers' technological wizardry," said Stephen Dalton of The Hollywood Reporter.
"Gemini Man is a case in which a huge amount of work has resulted in an incredibly dull action film," Variety reviewer Peter Deburge does not hide his disappointment.
"A confused product born of a bizarre idea," was how IndieWire's Ella Kemp summed up the film in her review.
"It's hard to care about one man being the double of another when neither acts like a human being," wrote Nicholas Barber of The Wrap.

Hundreds of enslaved children freed from religious school in Nigeria
According to the BBC, there were nearly five hundred men and boys, Reuters, citing the police commissioner, reported that there were more than three hundred children from the age of five upwards. Some were chained together, others were chained to iron rings in the wall.
The police chief in Kaduna, Ali Janga, told the BBC that the school had been raided on a tip-off, describing it as a "house of horrors" where starving people were held against their will, tortured and sexually abused, unable to leave and with razor wire on the walls - a case of slavery.
Several people were detained in the raid, and police spokesman Jakub Sabo said they were local teachers.
The children told the police that they were taken to the school by their parents or relatives, saying that it was a religious school. "We have identified two children who come from Burkina Faso, but most of them were brought here by their parents from Nigerian states in the north," Sabo's spokesman said about the identity of the victims. Nigerian states in the north of the country are predominantly Muslim.
The Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal School purported to be a religious school dedicated to the study of the Koran.
Those freed have been taken to a stadium where they are being given aid and food, and some have already been reunited with relatives.
The fastest man on the planet missed the tests. I'm not taking anything, he defends himself
The traditionally high-profile battle for the fastest man on the planet will be a hunt for defending silver medalist Christian Coleman at the World Championships. The 23-year-old American is the world leader with a time of 9.81 seconds and has only lost once this year. However, his start at the top of the season was threatened due to a case of missed doping tests.
The United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) closed his case at the beginning of September without bringing charges due to formal reasons. Coleman did not take three doping tests last year and this year, but not within 12 months. His first offense was backdated by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to April 1, 2018, i.e. to the beginning of the second quarter, but he did not miss the test itself until June 6. And since the third omission occurred on April 29, 2019, Coleman did not commit an offense in the form of three failed tests within 12 months.
"I don't take drugs, I don't take anything legal. A lot of athletes take legal creatine or protein powder or various other supplements for faster recovery. And I don't take anything, I work hard and that's about it," he said before the start of the World Championships.
His only defeat in six starts in the 100m this year came right at the start of the season at the Diamond League in Shanghai, where he was beaten by just six thousandths of a second by his compatriot Noah Lyles. He took advantage of Coleman's absence to triumph in the Diamond League final, but will only run the 200m at the World Championships.
On paper, the second fastest competitor is 22-year-old Nigerian Divine Oduduru with a performance of 9.86, but so far he has only been successful at American university competitions.
The title will be defended by the 37-year-old American Justin Gatlin, who shone with a time of 9.87 at Stanford in June. However, he only ran the last 100m in Zagreb in 10.29 because he slightly injured his hamstring.
South African Akani Simbine, three-time Rio Olympic medallist Andre de Grasse and European champion Zharnel Hughes are also among the favourites, while 2011 world champion Yohan Blake is the fastest Jamaican with a time of 9.96.
The men's 100m will begin on Friday with the preliminary round and heats. The semi-finals and final are scheduled for Saturday. The medals will be awarded at 21:15 CEST.
EU countries have coronavirus standards for aviation
European Union countries have agreed on common hygiene standards for air travel to help limit the spread of the new coronavirus.
This was announced by the German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer.
Among the agreed standards is keeping a distance or wearing masks on the plane and at the airport, but middle seats on planes will not have to remain unoccupied.
This was reported by Reuters.
"I am glad that my colleagues have accepted the German proposal for Europe and that we have been able to agree on these uniform standards," said Scheuer at the European Aviation Conference.
The German transport ministry then added that the agreement had been concluded by officials and that it still had to be formally approved by ministers.
The agreed measures include the requirement to cover the mouth and nose for passengers from the age of six, to observe the recommended distance during security checks and check-in at the airport.
Fresh air must also be guaranteed on board and all information must be available in several languages.
Airlines will also be able to fill middle seats.
The common rules agreed by officials meet at least some of the airlines' demands.
The different standards were causing confusion.

The apartment consists of a kitchen, ... rooms, hallway, toilet and bathroom.
A description of the individual rooms, including equipment and floor space, is given in Annex No. 1 to this contract.
The condition of the apartment and its equipment are listed in the handover protocol, which forms Annex No. 2 to this contract.
The handover protocol will also include the status of media and energy meters such as: cold water, hot water, electricity, gas, as well as data from proportional heat counters on radiators, etc., as of the date of handover of the apartment.
The tenant is entitled to use the apartment only for residential purposes (ensuring the basic human need for housing).
By this contract, the Lessor lets the Lessee use the apartment under the conditions agreed below in this contract and the Lessee undertakes to use the apartment only for the agreed purpose (in accordance with this contract) and to pay the rent properly and on time.
In addition to the right to use the apartment, the tenant and persons who live with the tenant in a common household also have the right to use the common areas and facilities of the house and to properly enjoy the benefits that are associated with the use of the apartment.
Article III. Delivery and Acceptance
The Landlord is obliged to hand over the apartment to the Tenant on the date ... and the Tenant undertakes to take it over from the Landlord on that date.
The day of receipt of the apartment, marked on the handover protocol (see Annex No. 2), is the day of commencement of the lease.
The contracting parties will draw up a handover protocol for the handover of the apartment, in which, in addition to the requirements under point 2.3 of the contract, the number of keys, any obvious defects in the apartment or other facts about the condition of the apartment will be stated.
Article IV. Rent
The Lessee undertakes to pay the Lessor a rent of ... CZK (in words: ... Czech crowns) per month for the use of the apartment.
The rent does not include payment for services provided in conjunction with the use of the apartment, the deposit for which is itemised and set out in Annex 3.
If the duration of the lease (from the date of commencement of the lease to the end of the contract) is agreed for a period of more than one year, the landlord may unilaterally adjust the amount of the rent by the increase or decrease of the average annual consumer price index compared to the previous year (CPI - Consumer Price Index), according to the data published by the Czech Statistical Office for the previous calendar year.
The Landlord shall inform the Tenant in writing of any increase or decrease in the rent by 15 April of the relevant year at the latest.
The rent will be increased from 1 January of the relevant year, and the difference between the rent paid so far and the newly determined rent for the past months of the relevant year (usually January to March) will be payable with the rent for the month of May, if the contractual relationship continues at that time; otherwise, it will be payable on the day following the day on which the Lessee receives the Lessor's notice of the rent increase.
The agreement contained in the previous paragraph of this contract does not in any way affect the possibility of the Lessor to propose an increase in the rent under the conditions contained in the provisions of Section 2249 of the Civil Code.
Similarly, the possibility for the Tenant to propose a rent reduction under similar conditions arising from the same provision is not affected in any way.
The tenant has the right to a reasonable discount on the rent for a period of time during which the landlord, despite the tenant's warning, does not remove a defect in the apartment that significantly or for a longer period of time worsens its use.
The Tenant has the right to a reasonable discount on the rent even if the services associated with the use of the apartment have not been provided or have been provided defectively, and if the use of the apartment has deteriorated significantly as a result.
If the Tenant does not notify the Landlord in writing of the defect or faulty provision of the service associated with the use of the apartment, the right to a discount on the rent will not arise.
The right to a discount on the rent or payment for services provided with the use of the apartment shall be exercised without undue delay with the Lessor, in writing.
The right expires if it has not been exercised within one month of the removal of defects or the restoration of the proper provision of services associated with the use of the apartment.
Article V. Terms of Payment
The rent is payable monthly, always no later than the 15th (fifteenth) day of the calendar month for which the rent is paid.

The lessee shall, to the best of his ability, do what can be expected so that the damage or defect, which must be removed without delay, does not cause further damage.
The lessee is entitled to reimbursement of the costs reasonably incurred in preventing further damage, unless the damage or defect was caused by circumstances for which the lessee is responsible.
If the Lessor fails to fulfil his obligation to remove defects and obstacles that do not prevent normal living, or by which the exercise of the right to lease is endangered, the Lessee has the right, after prior notice to the Lessor, to remove the defects to the extent necessary and to demand compensation from him for the costs reasonably incurred.
They must exercise this right with the Lessor without undue delay; the right will lapse if it has not been exercised within one month of the removal of the defects.
If the Lessee does not notify the Lessor of the damage or defect without undue delay after he should have and could have discovered it with due care, he is not entitled to reimbursement of costs; if he removes the damage or defect himself, he is not entitled to a discount on the rent.
The Lessee is not entitled to carry out structural modifications or other substantial changes in the apartment without the consent of the Lessor, even at his own expense.
For the duration of the lease, the tenant undertakes to comply with the usual rules of behaviour in the house and the reasonable instructions of the landlord to maintain the proper order customary according to local conditions, and the House Rules may specify these rules in detail.

The tenant has the right to receive anyone in his household.
If the Tenant accepts a new member of his household, he shall notify the Landlord of the increase in the number of persons living in the apartment without undue delay; if the Tenant fails to do so within two months of the change occurring, he shall be deemed to have seriously breached his obligation.
The landlord reserves the right not to grant consent to the admission of another person to the apartment.
Visits of the same person or several persons successively lasting more than 30 days in total per year, the Lessee is obliged to report to the Lessor.

delivery), without undue delay notify the Lessor of the address for the delivery of letters, even for a period of 12 months after the end of this contract, unless the Lessor has waived this obligation to the Lessee.
It applies that the residential address (delivery address) is the address of the apartment for the duration of this contract, or the use of the apartment; the same applies if the Lessee breaches his obligation referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph.
Article VII. Services provided with the lease

The landlord is not obliged to provide ...
The Lessee undertakes to pay the Lessor advance payments for the services listed above, at monthly intervals, in the amount specified by the Lessor in Annex No. 3 when signing this contract.
The lessee agrees to such an advance payment.
The deposit for the services is payable together with the rent.
The Lessor is entitled to unilaterally set a new amount of advances for services to the Lessee, taking into account the services received by him in the past period, so that the amount of advances corresponds to the approximate monthly subscription of services by the Lessee according to the past period; similarly, he may do so in the event of a change in price regulations or circumstances decisive for determining the amount of payments for the use of the apartment or the price of the services received.
The change in the amount of advance payments shall be effective from the 1st day of the month following the month in which the notice of the increase in advance payments was delivered to the Lessee.
The Lessee agrees with such a method of determining the advance payments.
The Lessor undertakes, no later than 3 (three) months after receipt of the final bill from the suppliers of the individual services, to bill the Lessee for the advances paid for the services and for the services actually received.
Any overpayment or underpayment of the fee for services is due on the 15th day after the delivery of the bill to the Lessee, unless the Lessee objects to the bill.

The lease may be terminated at any time if the parties so agree.

Both the Landlord and the Tenant shall state the reason for the termination and whether it is a termination without a notice period; in addition, the Landlord shall inform the Tenant of his right to object to the termination and to propose a review of the legitimacy of the termination by the court.
The notice period begins on the first day of the month following the month in which the notice was delivered to the other party, unless it is a notice without a notice period.
The tenant is in gross breach of his obligation arising from the lease if
a. sublets the apartment or a part of it to a third party without obtaining the prior written consent of the Lessor,
b. carries out structural modifications or other substantial changes without the consent of the Lessor,
c. fails to notify the Lessor of the need for repairs beyond normal maintenance and does not allow him to carry out these repairs, resulting in damage to the property of the Lessor or third parties in the amount of ten times the monthly rent,
d. if he takes in another member of his household, thereby exceeding the limit laid down in Article VI.
the last sentence,
e. animals or other organisms kept by the Tenant repeatedly cause serious nuisance to other residents of the building or the Tenant repeatedly fails to remove any contamination of the building caused by an animal kept by the Tenant and, despite warnings, fails to remedy the situation,
f. repeatedly violates the usual rules for behavior in the house and the reasonable instructions of the Landlord for maintaining proper order and, despite warnings, fails to remedy the situation.
The lessee will breach his obligation arising from the lease in a particularly serious manner, in particular, if the debt for unpaid rent or advance payments for services with which the lessee will be in arrears exceeds the amount corresponding to three times the rent, or the arrears for billing will not be fully paid within three months from the date of its maturity.
Article IX. Return of the apartment
The lessee is obliged, at the latest on the day of termination of the lease, to vacate the apartment at his own expense, remove all equipment and accessories that he has installed in the rented premises, and hand over the apartment to the lessor in the condition in which he took it over from him, taking into account normal wear and tear.
If there has been damage or excessive wear and tear to the apartment or its equipment, the Tenant is liable for the damage caused by him or caused by persons to whom he has allowed access to the apartment out of unconscious negligence.
In the event of the Lessee's delay in vacating or handing over the apartment, the Lessor has the right to vacate the apartment itself at any time at the expense of the Lessee, with which the Lessee expressly agrees.
The parties have agreed that if the Lessee does not collect the items left in the apartment within 30 (thirty) days of the end of the lease, the Lessor is entitled to dispose of these items in an appropriate manner and use the proceeds to satisfy its claims against the Lessee.
Any cash surplus will be sent by the Lessor to the Lessee to the account provided by the Lessee.
Minor repairs and costs associated with the normal maintenance of the apartment, the need for which arose until the end of the lease, will be provided by the Tenant no later than the date of handover of the apartment (end of the lease).
If the Lessee fails to do so, the Lessor will arrange for the necessary repairs and routine maintenance at the expense of the Lessee.
The Tenant agrees to this.
Article X. Final Provisions
This Agreement shall enter into force upon its conclusion.
The contracting parties declare that the contract was drawn up according to their true and free will, certainly, seriously and comprehensibly, not in distress and under conspicuously disadvantageous conditions.
Before signing this contract, the contracting parties familiarized themselves with its content and agree to it without reservation, which they confirm with their handwritten signatures.

The contracting parties undertake to replace the invalid or ineffective provision of this contract with another, valid and effective provision, which by its content and meaning best corresponds to the content and meaning of the original provision.

4. Minor repairs are also considered to be the replacement of small parts of the items mentioned in the previous paragraphs.
5. According to the amount of the cost, other repairs of the apartment and its equipment and replacement of parts of individual items of this equipment, which are not listed in paragraphs 2 and 3, are considered minor repairs if the cost of one repair does not exceed the amount of CZK 500.
If several repairs are carried out on the same thing, which are related and follow each other in time, the sum of the costs of the related repairs is decisive.
Transport costs and other costs associated with the repair, if they are included in the tax document for the repair, are not included in the cost of this repair, but they are part of the annual limit below.
6. The sum of the costs for minor repairs referred to in paragraphs 2 to 5 may not exceed the amount of 70 CZK/m2 of the floor area of the apartment per calendar year, including transport costs and other costs associated with the repair, if they are specified in the tax document on the repair.
7. For the purposes of this annex, the floor area of an apartment is the sum of the floor areas of the apartment and its accessories, even outside the apartment, if they are used exclusively by the tenant of the apartment; the floor area of cellars, which are not rooms, and the floor area of balconies, loggias and terraces is counted only by one half.
COSTS RELATED TO THE REGULAR MAINTENANCE OF THE APARTMENT
The costs associated with the normal maintenance of the apartment are the costs of maintaining and cleaning the apartment, which are usually carried out when the apartment is used for a longer period.
These are, in particular, regular inspections and cleaning of the items listed above (gas appliances, etc.), painting, including the repair of plasters, wallpapering and cleaning of floors, including floor coverings, wall coverings, cleaning of clogged waste up to the vertical distribution and interior painting.
Soldiers rehearse, pull down the curtains. China prepares celebrations at the site of the massacre
The military rehearsed the parade on recent weekends, with shops in central Beijing forced to close and residents near the square ordered to close their curtains as military vehicles rolled down empty streets toward the square and fighter jets circled the sky.
Several Chinese told Reuters they were proud that their country would be showing off its military might, but one woman said it was hard to deny that the celebrations would make other countries uneasy.
She appeared to be referring to Taiwan, which China claims and where elections are coming up, but there may also be concern in the semi-autonomous city of Hong Kong, where thousands of people have repeatedly demonstrated against the Chinese-appointed leader.
Celebrations are also being prepared outside of Beijing. The southern Chinese port of Xiamen already presented a special light show on Thursday night. Xiamen is located opposite the island of Taiwan and is one of the ten most innovative Chinese cities.
Ahead of the anniversary, the list of banned items is growing and already includes drones, balloons, kites, alcohol, walkie-talkies and devices that use radio waves, The Guardian reported, adding that China's popular social network Weibo is deleting "harmful political information."
"It's another milestone, another opportunity to show that the Chinese Communist Party remains (at the helm) despite all the predictions," said China historian Maura Cunningham. "It's a moment when the party can demonstrate order, control and power," she added.
The People's Republic of China was formed in 1949 when the Communists, led by Mao Zedong, won a battle with Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists, who retreated to Taiwan.
In the second half of the 1960s, China went through a disastrous communist experiment in the form of the so-called Cultural Revolution. In June 1989, the regime massacred thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators, both students and workers, with tanks in Tiananmen Square.
Since the late 1970s, China has increasingly taken on elements of a capitalist economy; critics say it is now a mixture of the worst of both communism (one-party monopoly and persecution of the opposition) and (Dickensian) capitalism (exploitation of workers).

Trump is considering canceling the registration of Chinese stocks in the US
The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump is considering revoking the permission of Chinese companies to trade on stock markets in the United States, an informed source told Reuters today. Such a move would be a radical escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Shares of the companies concerned on the New York Stock Exchange immediately headed down after the report, dragging the entire market down with them.
The pullback would be part of a broader effort to limit U.S. investment in China, the source added, confirming a Bloomberg report that had sent shockwaves through financial markets earlier in the day, with shares of Chinese firms Alibaba Group Holding, JD.com, Pinduoduo, Baidu, Vipshop Holdings, Baozun and IQIYI falling between 2 percent and 4 percent.
According to government data from February, 156 Chinese companies are traded on the US stock exchanges Nasdaq and NYSE, including at least 11 state-owned enterprises.
Bloomberg pointed out that a precise mechanism has not yet been worked out to ensure the withdrawal of shares of Chinese companies from US stock exchanges. A possible plan would have to be approved by Trump, who, however, gave the green light to negotiations on this matter.
China and the United States have been waging a trade war for more than a year, imposing tariffs on each other. The dispute between the two countries has a negative impact on the world economy and raises fears of a global economic recession. Washington is trying to use tariffs to force Beijing to change its trade practices and reduce China's trade surplus with the United States.
According to CNBC, trade negotiations between the U.S. and China are expected to resume on October 10, with the aim of ending the trade war.
Former French President Chirac to be buried on Monday, public memorial on Sunday
The funeral of former French President Jacques Chirac, who died on Thursday at the age of 86, will take place on Monday evening at the Montparnasse cemetery in Paris, French media report, citing the Chirac family. The ceremony will be private.
The public will be able to say goodbye to the former head of state on Sunday afternoon at a memorial service at the Invalides in Paris, where a coffin with Chirac's remains will be displayed, the Elysée Palace announced.
According to the AFP news agency, crowds of people have been flocking to the presidential residence since Thursday evening to sign the book of condolences. This will be possible until Sunday. President Emmanuel Macron has declared a national day of mourning on Monday.
From the world and from France, meanwhile, come more reactions to the death of the former mayor of Paris and president from 1995 to 2007, whom Prime Minister Édouard Philippe today described as "French in the true sense of the word."
Chirac was remembered, for example, by the Japanese, since the politician was known for his love of their country and the sport of sumo. The news of the death of the former French president appeared on the front pages of all Japanese newspapers, including sports ones, the French press notes.
The Museum of Tribal Art on the Quai Branly in Paris, which Chirac founded, will not charge admission for ten days in honour of the former head of state.
A temperature record was set in the Arctic Svalbard, where it was almost 22 degrees
"A 41-year-old record has been broken in Longyearbyen," the Norwegian Meteorological Institute said on Twitter.
In the early evening, the temperature there rose to 21.7 degrees Celsius, beating the record set in 1979 by 0.4 degrees, he added.
Longyearbyen, with a population of around 2,000, is the largest town in Svalbard and is located about 1,300 kilometres from the North Pole.
Svalbard is warming faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This highlights the dangers posed by the warming of other parts of the Arctic - from Alaska to Siberia, according to a report last year by the Norwegian Centre for Climate Studies.
According to him, the average temperature in Svalbard has risen by three to five degrees since the 1970s.
It could rise by as much as ten degrees by 2100 if greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere are not reduced.
The rise in temperature may result in the melting of the permafrost in Svalbard, which will threaten the stability of many buildings, roads or airports and may also cause more avalanches and landslides.
The warming of the climate also threatens Arctic fauna, such as polar bears and seals, which depend on the ice cover of the ocean.
Unsuccessful qualification. Czech athletes are not doing well in Doha so far
The World Championships in Doha began with qualification failures for Czech athletics. Diana Mezuliáníková was eliminated in the heats of the 800 metres and neither pole vaulter Romana Maláčová nor hammer thrower Kateřina Šafránková, who was defending the eighth place with which she surprised in London two years ago, qualified.
The start on Friday will be completed by hurdler Vít Müller and the night marathon race will be run by Marcela Joglová.
Šafránková threw 65.46 meters on her third attempt and fell almost six meters short of her maximum this year, which she would have to improve to advance. Maláčová jumped 435 cm, 450 cm was already beyond her strength. To participate in the final, it was necessary to overcome the limit of 460 cm.
Mezuliáníková, who got to the championship at the last minute thanks to an invitation from the international federation IAAF, finished in the fourth heat on the penultimate sixth place and even the time of 2:03.48 minutes was not enough for her to advance to the semi-finals. She was one and a half seconds behind her maximum this year. "It was quite fast for me, unfortunately I was fighting with my opponent in the corner, which took quite a lot of my strength. I felt that I still had strength, but it slowed me down there. I almost stopped and had to start running again, so it was a bit uncomfortable in this. I can't be completely satisfied," said the Czech representative.
She was glad that she overtook at least one opponent in the finishing straight. "She was really not in a good condition, so every defeated opponent was good. But I think it was for the fifth place. Unfortunately," she added. The fastest half marathon runner in the heats was Winnie Nanyondo from Uganda in 2:00.36.
The best 800m runner in recent years, Caster Semenya from South Africa, is missing in Doha. She has too high a level of testosterone in her body, but like some other runners, she refuses treatment, which has been mandated by IAAF rules since this year.
In the heats of the 100 meters, the role of the number one favorite was confirmed by the American Christian Coleman, who with a time of 9.98 was the only one to get under ten seconds. His compatriot Justin Gatlin, who at the age of 37 is trying to defend his title, also advanced to the semifinals. The Nigerian Divine Oduduru, who is second in this year's tables with a performance of 9.86, did not start and his duel with Coleman, who has a performance of 9.81 this season, was expected.
Cuban Juan Miguel Echevarría already showed great form in the long jump qualification, reaching a distance of 840 cm with his first jump. No athlete has jumped so far in the qualification of the World Championships in the last 20 years. The 21-year-old Cuban leads this year's tables with a performance of 865 cm.
Berlin responds to public pressure and solves the housing crisis by buying 6,000 apartments from a private company
Berlin will buy from the private Luxembourg company ADO Properties SA for 920 million euros (23.8 billion CZK) 6,000 former social housing units that the city sold 15 years ago. It is responding to public pressure, which is rebelling against skyrocketing rent prices. According to Berlin Senator Katrin Lompscher of the Left Party (Die Linke), this is the largest such purchase in the history of the German capital. The opposition is criticizing the move.
"The intention is to keep rents stable in Berlin and give tenants security," said Berlin's mayor Michael Müller (SPD) in a statement. "At the same time, we will continue to build new apartments and legally handle the rent freeze," he added. The municipal company Gewobag will take over the thousands of apartments located in the Spandau and Reinickendorf districts in the western part of the city this December.
According to Jefferies analyst Thomas Rothäusler, the city bought at too high a price. Rothäusler told Bloomberg that, according to his estimate, the housing units were overpaid by about ten percent above their book value.
According to the German opposition party Liberals (FDP), the Berlin authorities are contributing to real estate speculation with their actions. The FDP said this on Twitter on Friday. The protest party Alternative for Germany (AfD) called the move a "waste of money."
In mid-July, Gewobag won back 670 apartments in Berlin's Karl-Marx-Allee, the weekly Der Spiegel recalled on its website. The council did not publish the price at the time. The dispute over the apartments on the former exhibition avenue from the time of the GDR was accompanied by protests and filled the front pages of the German press. It became a symbol of the difficult situation of tenants in large German cities, the paper wrote.
The German capital used to be famous for its low cost of living and low rents, but in recent years it has become more attractive. According to the AFP agency, rental prices have doubled over the past ten years, making it difficult for some residents to find affordable housing.
Britons returning from Spain face mandatory two-week quarantine
The British Cabinet also urged citizens to avoid all non-essential travel to mainland Spain due to the risk of the spread of the covid-19 disease.
The Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands are therefore not mentioned, but even after returning from them, people have to be isolated for two weeks.
The new rules come into force at midnight.
"The protection of public health is our absolute priority.
We have taken this decision in order to prevent the possible spread of the virus in the UK," the British Foreign Office said in a statement.
"We have always made it clear that if the need arises, we will immediately remove a country from the safe list," she added.
As noted by the British newspaper Metro, the latest announcement will affect the travel plans of thousands of Britons.
Spain is one of the most popular holiday destinations.
Among other things, Britons are concerned about whether they will be paid sick leave if they have to go into isolation for 14 days after returning from their holidays.
Neil Hunter from Sittingbourne, for example, had booked a 10-day holiday to Lanzarote, due to depart on Tuesday.
The trip has been booked since December.
"We were going to go as a family, my wife Amanda and my daughter Bethany, but to be honest I don't know what's going to happen after this announcement.
I work as a train driver and I don't think my employer will agree to me being quarantined for two weeks when I return from holiday," the Metro newspaper quoted Hunter as saying.
In relation to Spain, there are fears that the country is at the beginning of a second wave of the epidemic.
Over the past two days, there have been more than 900 new infections every 24 hours.
Authorities in some areas are already tightening coronavirus measures, for example Catalonia is trying to restrict all nightlife and prevent people from gathering in large numbers.
The Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recently warned of an increased risk of infection in Catalonia, Aragon, the Basque Country and the Madrid region.
Czechs or children are not allowed to enter. CTIA reveals discrimination in restaurants
These included, for example, incorrect information about prices and failure to comply with the principles of fair sales.
In one case of discrimination, a restaurant in Prague refuses to allow smaller children into the establishment. According to the CTIA, it writes on its website that the facility is not suitable for children under the age of eight. "In response to an electronic inquiry from a consumer as to whether it is possible to order a table for four adults and one child under the age of four in the restaurant, the restaurant employee replied electronically that they do not accept the presence of children under the age of eight in the restaurant," added Fröhlich.
In the second case, another Prague business did not want to allow Czech-speaking people to sit at the table, while it allowed English-speaking people to do so. "Czech-speaking inspectors, in the position of consumers, were not allowed to sit at the table in the restaurant and place an order. English-speaking consumers were allowed to do so," a CTIA spokesman described the situation.
Both cases are currently being dealt with in administrative proceedings. As they have not yet been finalised, the spokesman for the inspectorate was unable to provide further information on the restaurants in question.
However, discrimination occurred only in a very small part of the restaurants inspected in the second quarter. In total, the CTIA carried out 139 inspections. In addition to the two cases of discrimination mentioned above, it revealed other errors in 64 cases. Most of these were shortcomings in compliance with the principles of fair sales and failure to inform consumers about the prices of products and services in accordance with the regulations.
Already on Wednesday, the Inspectorate reported on cases of discrimination against foreigners in two Prague restaurants, Clock Caffé and Café Restaurant. In both establishments, foreigners were charged higher amounts than Czech-speaking clients. In these cases, final fines of 60,000 crowns have already been imposed.
The government will discuss the model of purchasing electricity from Dukovany
On Monday, the government will discuss the model for the purchase of electricity from the planned new unit of the Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant.
The bill assumes that if the purchase price is higher than the price of electricity on the market, the difference will be paid by all consumers through tariffs.
In the second case, when the purchase price is lower than the market price, the impact on consumers will be the opposite.
Power electricity is an unregulated part of the final price of electricity for consumers.
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry Karel Havlíček (for ANO) and the energy company ČEZ have previously stated that the more likely option is that people will save money on electricity thanks to the construction.
Analysts, on the other hand, point out that the long-term outlook for electricity prices on the markets is always uncertain, which has been demonstrated several times in the past.
The plan has already been criticised by environmental organisations.
"The purchase price can be either below the market price of electricity or above it.
Thus, the final impact at the time of applicability of the rule can be both negative and positive.
The impact will be distributed among customers according to the size of the circuit breaker - with lower consumption or according to the consumption of electricity - with higher consumption of electricity," the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MIT) said in the documentation for the material.
Havlíček said in May that he expected the wholesale price of electricity to rise and that people on the Dukovany construction site would make money.
Otherwise, the impact will be in the tens of crowns per year per family, which, according to him, is far less than people pay annually in electricity bills to support the so-called supported sources.
He has previously estimated that the purchase price could be between 50 and 60 euros (about 1320 to 1600 CZK) per megawatt hour (MWh).
The submitted material does not contain any proposal for the amount, it is to be included in the purchase agreement.
The price of electricity on the Prague Energy Exchange for 2021, for which traders are now stocking up the most, is currently around 45 euros (about 1190 CZK) per MWh.
"Given the difference between the purchase price and the market price of electricity in the amount of ten euros, the surcharge for an average household with a consumption of 3.3 MWh per year - can correspond to a four-member household, standardly equipped with electrical appliances including an electric hob and oven, but which does not use electricity for heating and hot water - could amount to less than 100 CZK / year," the MIT wrote in the documents for the government.
"We are living in extremely turbulent times.
The coronavirus pandemic has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term prediction of market prices to be an explicitly speculative matter," Tomáš Voltr, executive director of the Energy Financial Group investment group, previously told the Czech News Agency.
The proposed law envisages that the purchase would be carried out by the Ministry of Industry and Trade, or a legal entity owned by the state authorized by it, at a predetermined price.
The contract between the investor and the state, guaranteeing the conditions for the purchase of electricity, would be concluded for a minimum of 30 years, with a possible extension of ten years, even repeated, but no longer than until the end of the operation of low-carbon production.
The proposal defines a low-carbon power plant as a power plant with a nuclear reactor connected to the electricity grid with an installed capacity of a minimum electrical output of 100 megawatts (MW) after 2030.
Havlíček previously said that the new Dukovany unit should have a capacity of 1,200 MW and produce nine terawatt hours of electricity per year, which would correspond to one tenth of the expected Czech consumption.
The unit should be put into operation in 2036.
The financing model for the new Dukovany block was approved by the government on Monday.
The facility should be financed by the state without interest during construction, while a two-percent interest rate is expected during operation.
The opposition does not agree with the financing model, it is also bothered by the possibility that Dukovany would be built by Russian or Chinese companies.
The state should participate in the construction of 70 percent.
The rest should be paid by ČEZ, which will also cover all possible additional costs.
The CEO of ČEZ, Daniel Beneš, told the Czech News Agency in May that the expected sum for the construction of the block in current prices is about six billion euros (approximately 162 billion crowns).
The contracts between the state and CEZ for the construction of the new Dukovany unit will be signed on Tuesday.
There was a fire in the underground mine of CSA in Karviná, no one was injured
A fire broke out in the underground of the CSA Mine in Karviná this morning. The cause of the fire is not yet known, but no one was injured, Ivo Čelechovský, a spokesman for the mining company, told the Czech News Agency.
The fire broke out at 04:25 in the mine at a depth of about 1200 meters. "Nothing happened to any of the employees, no one was injured. Bán rescuers immediately intervened on the spot, who extinguished the fire by direct intervention and also inspected the terrain. The workplace was immediately closed and made inaccessible," said the spokesman. The exact cause of the fire will now be determined by a special commission.
In the former Ostrava-Karviná district, coal is already being mined only in the Karviná part, namely in the CSA, Lazy, Darkov, ČSM-Sever and ČSM-Jih mines. In the Lazy mine, mining should end this year, and other mines are also facing a gradual decline. The mining company OKD is the only producer of hard coal in the Czech Republic, its last year's production amounted to 4.62 million tonnes. About 9,000 people work in the mines.
Brno Grand Prix? Ticket prices are about to rise
The most expensive item every year before the Grand Prix is the listing fee. This year it was about one hundred and fifteen million crowns. "The mass of people who come to Brno during the Grand Prix will spend money on accommodation, food or entertainment, which should more or less balance out the costs associated with organizing the event, including the listing fee," said economist Petr Pelc.
According to him, the importance of the race is also in attracting tourists to the city. "Brno does not have so many world tourist attractions. The Grand Prix attracts visitors from abroad. It is just as important for Brno as, for example, the Tuřany airport or the exhibition centre. And these are projects that are supported by public money," the economist added.
Grand Prix in Brno
- costs for the past five years: 686 million crowns
- Profits from the past five years: 682 million crowns
- problem: lack of money for the event, increasing listing fee for the promoter Dorna
- possible solutions: more money from the state, use of advertising space, increase in ticket prices
- current status: negotiations on a new contract for the organization of races for the next five years
According to the director of the Institute of Public Administration, Filip Hrůza, the organizers now have to evaluate whether the race is advantageous for Brno. "The Grand Prix siphons off money from public budgets for other matters. To a certain extent, however, this is a political and not an economic question," he thinks.
In the future, the cost of the motoring event may be even higher, as the option of increasing the listing fee to almost double is in play.
"The situation is not closed, we must try to negotiate the best possible conditions with Dorna. It also depends on the extent to which the state is prepared to contribute to the organization of the race. If the worst scenarios come true, I am afraid that it is not realistic for the city and the region to pay the amount," admitted the mayor of Brno, Markéta Vaňková.
As Deník Rovnost has already reported, representatives of the South Moravian Region and Brno are also discussing the possibility of using advertising due to the difficulties in raising money for the Grand Prix. "Dorna's condition is that advertising must be placed in places that are not covered by cameras. The choice of companies is also limited, because if Dorna has a general sponsor, then the second sponsor cannot be a company from the same area," explained Vaňková.
The organizers can also get more money from tickets in the coming years. "We have to sit down and say what the costs will actually be. And we have to adjust the revaluation of tickets," said Brno opposition representative for the ANO movement and former mayor Petr Vokřál.
The Ministry of Regional Development has withdrawn the material on the promotion of tourism in the media for two billion
The material, according to which the Ministry for Regional Development (MRD) planned to spend two billion crowns on advertising holidays in the Czech Republic in the media, on the Internet and on billboards, has been withdrawn by the authority from the comment procedure.
Minister Klára Dostálová (for ANO) told SeznamZprávy.cz that the material is still being worked on.
The server Zdopravy.cz drew attention to the document in eKlep (the electronic library of the legislative process) on Friday.
The ministry justified the plan by the drop in tourism due to the coronavirus.
During the coronavirus crisis, the media also experienced a drop in revenue.
The proposal has drawn criticism from the opposition and representatives of the tourism industry.
According to the proposal, which can now be viewed on the hlidacstatu.cz website, the Ministry of Regional Development planned to give money through the state agency for the promotion of tourism, CzechTourism, for advertising on television, radio, in the press, on the Internet, on billboards and on surfaces at railway stations.
The largest share of the money, 700 million crowns, would go to television.
The majority would go to the private TV stations Nova and Prima.
The printed dailies and weeklies would receive 400 million and the same share would be given by the Ministry of Regional Development for PR articles, advertising banners and videos on websites.
Radio stations would receive 350 million for the media campaign, most of which would again go to private stations.
The remaining 150 million would be used for outdoor advertising on billboards, LED screens and surfaces at railway stations or in the metro.
The campaign to promote tourism in the Czech Republic was to begin in mid-August and last for a year.
"The material is still being worked on, it is definitely not yet in a form that should be presented," Dostálová told SeznamZprávy without giving further details.
The material was criticized by the opposition, according to the head of TOP 09, Markéta Pekarová Adamová, the media from the trust funds of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO) would benefit from the advertising.
"I firmly believe that this blatant contempt will backfire at the polls in the fall," she wrote on Twitter.
Dostálová denies that this is really about helping the media affected by the crisis.
"It could be a coincidence, I don't know anything about the support of the media," she told Deník N on Friday.
According to her, the budget of two billion is indicative.
"Of course, we are still calculating it, it could be less or more.
It is a working material," she added.
A media campaign to promote domestic tourism does not make sense for the Let's Save Tourism initiative.
"We want two billion for companies in the tourism industry, not an unnecessary advertising campaign," said the chairman of the initiative, Tomáš Barčík, on Sunday.
If the two billion crowns are in the state budget, they should be directed to companies, not to the media, the initiative writes in an open letter to the government.
The end of political newsagents? According to critics, the new law will not help anyway!
However, according to some opposition MPs, the law is more likely to allow ministers to absolve themselves of responsibility for the election while continuing to choose their own candidates.
Greater transparency in selection procedures for posts in state-owned companies - this is one of the objectives of the nomination law. 119 deputies voted in favour. The law passed, for example, thanks to the votes of ANO, KSČM, the Social Democrats and even the Pirates.
Candidates for state-owned companies will have to go through a selection process in front of a government committee. For example, it was the Pirates who tried to make the recommendation to the minister binding. This ultimately failed.
The Civic Democrats and the SPD movement fear that the nomination law will play into the hands of ministers. "The minister will now be able to hide behind some decision of the commission and will therefore not have a clear transparent responsibility," thinks SPD chairman Tomio Okamura. ODS vice-chairman Martin Kupka speaks similarly.
The government committee should completely reject candidates who do not meet the conditions, which will include a clean criminal record, no debt, a minimum age of 25, and expertise should be the main criterion for selection.
The law will still have to pass through the Senate and then be signed by the president.
The car tuner brought the voice of the digital soul
Everything you know about obesity is wrong, declares the headline of a long text written for the Huffington Post by Michael Hobbes and photographed by Finlay Mackay. In a provocative explanation, it says that the medical community has ignored the facts about obesity for decades and waged a ruthless (and also unnecessary) war against overweight people, which has not only affected public opinion, but also destroyed a lot of lives. But now it is time for a new paradigm.
What Hobbes mentions right at the beginning is the fact that there is often a very long and tedious path from knowledge and knowledge of the facts to putting it into practice. He mentions the case of scurvy, when some captains in the seventeenth century distributed lemons, limes and oranges to their crew in the belief that they would prevent the disease. However, the British Navy withdrew from this practice due to fears of increased costs. The clear influence of the fruit in the prevention and treatment of the disease was then proven in the middle of the 18th century, but it took another fifty years for the Navy to take it into account. Seat belts also existed long before the invention of the car, but they became mandatory only in the 1960s, as well as the first confirmed death in connection with asbestos dates back to 1906, but its first ban came in 1973.
In American society today, nearly 80 percent of the adult population and about one-third of children meet the definition of being overweight or obese. More Americans now live with obesity than with breast cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and HIV combined.
Obesity is seen as a highly personal failure of the individual, which is said to burden health care and reduce GDP. The fear of fatness is so great in the population that Americans now spend more money on diets than they spend on computer games and films. But the truth is that diets do not work. As early as 1959, research showed that 95 to 98% of attempts to lose weight end in failure, and two-thirds of people on a diet subsequently gain more weight than they lost.
Armed with statistics, Hobbes goes on to describe the lifestyles and traumas of overweight people. Here, the personal meets the systemic, where, for example, in faculties teaching future doctors, only 19 hours of the entire course are devoted to the issue of nutrition. This at a time when 60% of the calories that Americans consume come from ultra-processed food.
The way obesity is stigmatised is illustrated by reports from surgeries, where overweight people tend to have shorter check-ups, are treated with less empathy by doctors and are seen as more problematic patients.
But being overweight is far from just an American problem, as Hobbes writes. Since 1980, the rate of obesity has doubled in 73 countries and increased in 113, and no country has been able to slow or stop the increase. Absolutely none.
Simona Krainová: Fuck the Age! Then she kissed Lucie Bílá!
The day before the launch of the Fuck The Age calendar, Simona Krainová published her latest photos, in which she is completely naked! "I was a little afraid that people would judge me for taking naked photos at my age. I'm quite a shy person. But so far I've only had positive reactions. I wanted to show women that if you want to, you can have a solid figure even at the age of 46. Of course, there's hard work and self-denial behind it, but there's no other way."
"We shot about three thousand photos with Lukáš Dvořák, we chose about a hundred and there are twelve in the calendar, so the rest is still waiting for its moment. It's definitely not the last time I'm naked," the model, who also came to her baptism very exposed, confided to Blesk.
She had an elongated jacket by Bernhardt and shorts underneath, but they were not visible, so it looked like she had forgotten her bottoms. Her daily running has strengthened her legs, so she can afford similar models.
Simona was so happy about her success that she kissed everyone she met at the christening: her husband, her friends, even Slavica Lucie Bílá.
The broth of life, the cock of beers and death as a blade of grass
The third album is also posthumous, entitled And Death Is a Blade of Grass by the Brno poet, tireless organiser of cultural activities and publisher Jaroslav Erik Frič, who also passed away a year ago, on 24 May.
It is the fifth item in Frič's discography, and as with the previous titles, the main emphasis here is on Frič's poetry, of which he himself is an excellent interpreter.
Frič, born in 1949, was, of course, influenced by the American beat generation, but he channeled this inspiration through his own, uniquely presented experiences and also through very intimate expressions of faith.
However, he was far from any agitation, when he spoke or wrote about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, non-aggressive, completely tolerant.
Bohuslav Reynek comes to mind in this context (in contrast to Jan Zahradníček, for example), the masters will forgive.
Frič's album offers recordings of the author's reading from 2006, as well as performances with musicians who have always accompanied him very sensitively, whether it was the cellist Josef Klíč or Honza Bartoň and Vítězslav Holata.
I will help myself - with pleasure - with the words of the Ostrava poet Petr Hruška about Frič's long poetic compositions.
"They were filled with a proud and never-ending bitterness," writes Hruška, "over the state of our world threatened with extinction.
A world that is sinking more and more into a stupor of consumerist vanity and greed, moving further and further away from what its soul was made of - the mystery of faith, humility and human closeness.
They echoed the longing of one who knows that the values for which he was created are of little interest to anyone, but who also knows that they cannot be abandoned just because of a general lack of interest.
The poems were a reminder that one may have to lose everything dear, but it is not unimportant how one loses it.
Whether he sells out to the general decline, skeptically resigns, fearfully shuts up, or remains until the last moment in a calm and proud insistence on what he believes and what he loves."

Paroubek is not my adviser, says Hamáček
The former prime minister and chairman of the Czech Social Democratic Party Jiří Paroubek is not a paid adviser to the Social Democrats.
The chairman of the party and Minister of the Interior Jan Hamáček only communicates with him and reads his opinions and articles.
Hamáček said this today on the Prima Partie television show.
The news server SeznamZprávy.cz reported on Friday that Paroubek was to be Hamáček's adviser.
"From time to time we write a text message, he sometimes sends me some material and I read it," Hamáček said today.
He added, however, that this is not an official and paid cooperation.
According to him, the CSSD does not have the resources to waste them on such purposes.
"The fact that I sometimes read his opinion, there are a lot of people like that," he said.
In a subsequent discussion with ODS MP Jana Černochová, the minister said that many ODS members still "openly listen to the opinions of Václav Klaus."
According to him, it is all right, because he is an experienced politician and a former party chairman, which is also the case with Paroubek.
He called the fact that the media is making an issue out of it a sign of this year's cucumber season.
The server SeznamZprávy.cz wrote on Friday that Paroubek is fulfilling the role of Hamáček's unofficial consultant.
He also wrote that the former chairman of the local cell, Petr Benda, who is associated with Paroubek and served as deputy chairman of his LEV 21 party, is heading for the fourth place on the party's candidate list in the Ústí nad Labem region.
Hamáček said today that he would not comment on the composition of the list of candidates until it had been completed and approved.

Duplantis is miles ahead, it's a kick in the ass, laments the Swede's challenger
It is the 22-year-old American pole vaulter who has the ambition and potential to be among the most serious competitors of the new ruler.
He already knows what it's like to beat Duplantis, who is two years younger; he beat him at the NCAA meeting last year.
"We had a battle the year before, when he won and I was second, and then we switched.
In both cases, it was a very good fight," describes Nilsen, who secured the victory with a performance of 5.95 meters.
But Duplantis has shot up since then and is currently alone at the top of the pole vaulting world.
At just 20 years of age, he became a world record holder, breaking the bar of 6.17 metres in Torun on 8 February this year, and adding another centimetre in Glasgow a week later.
"He was already jumping six meters at the age of 18 when he finished high school," recalls his peer Nilsen for the World Athletics website.
"It was clear that once he matured from a boy into a man, all his potential and talent would be multiplied tenfold.
Twenty years old is a pretty good age to jump a world record," he said.
Although Nilsen's list of achievements is considerably thinner than that boasted by Duplantis, the American has similar goals.
So far, he has hinted at his potential at NCAA competitions, which he has regularly won. In February of this year, he improved his indoor personal best to 5.93 m at one of them. Last August, he won a gold medal at the Pan American Games in Lima, and in 2017 he made it to the American team for the World Championships, where he finished 13th.
The next milestone for him is to taste the Diamond League for the first time.
"Definitely my priority is to get on the professional circuit and race as much as I can in the Diamond League because that's where you can make a name for yourself," he realises.
"If you can succeed at this level, there is no doubt that you can do the same at events like the Olympic Games, the World Championships or the Pan American Games."
Due to the pandemic, however, these top holidays are being postponed, which gives Nilsen and the other pole vaulters time to improve.
But will it be enough to catch Duplantis, who can easily turn the race below the five rings into a mere battle for silver?
"Everyone is trying to catch up with him, but I don't think it will be possible in the near future," Nilsen said.
"This kid has been jumping for 16 years and he's miles ahead of everyone else in training."
And before Tokyo 2021 begins, he will want to increase it even more.
For their study, the researchers are looking for toddlers with a congenital defect known as ankle valgus.
Valgosity of the ankles is a congenital defect that affects five to ten percent of children. It is normally treated with intensive exercise. Scientists are trying to help these children even more, so they have developed special shoes that should significantly speed up the treatment.
"We have two prototypes of shoes that will be worn by healthy children and children with a diagnosis in order to map the effect in both groups. Participation in the research will not have any risks for the children and the measurement will be completely painless," explains Marta Gimunová, head of research from the Faculty of Sports Studies at MU.
Parents of both groups of children can register for the study via the website, where the registration form and all information is available.
The researchers are looking for fifty children with a diagnosis and fifty healthy children. Of each group, half will always wear medical shoes and half will not.
"The moment when parents should register their child is when they take their first independent steps, typically letting go of furniture, for example, which they hold on to when trying to walk. Participation in the research involves three measurements over the course of seven months from the child's first steps, each of which takes about 20 minutes, and for half of the participants it also includes wearing the tested shoes," Gimunová points out.
The opening of Pumpkin World has delayed the ripening of pumpkins
Nová Ves u Leština (Havlíčkobrodsko) - A farm in Nová Ves u Leština in the Havlíčkobrodsko region opened the Pumpkin World today for more than a month. Decorations made up of thousands of freshly harvested pumpkins are dominated by massive orange pyramids in the garden. The autumn event, which is becoming a tradition, starts a week later this year because the pumpkins on the surrounding seven hectares of the Pipkova family's fields have matured longer. There are still a lot of them in the field, Jaroslava Pipková told ČTK today.
The Pipkas grow many types of pumpkins, but the weather has not been good for the last two years. This year's harvest was delayed and some types did not work out. "As usual, we have enough orange pumpkins for Halloween, but some types for connoisseurs did not work out," said Pipková. Nevertheless, there are more types to choose from on the farm, from the already mentioned large pumpkins suitable for carving and chiseling decorations to pumpkins for cooking hokaido or elongated "spaghetti" to ornamental gourds of various colors and shapes.
Growing pumpkins is laborious. Farmers manually hoe the plants and harvest their fruits, and cut the pumpkins from the stem with scissors. Pipka's Pumpkin World has been open regularly since 2010, and past years have attracted thousands of people. The pumpkin decorations are complemented by attractions made of straw or a maze made of logs. Visitors will also see animals kept on the farm. It will be open daily until November 3.
Details of the event are on the farm's website, where growers also offer some recipes for pumpkin dishes, such as pumpkin muffins or juice. Visitors themselves tell them about other ways to prepare pumpkin in the kitchen. "A lot of cooks have tried their recipes, and we will be inspired," said Pipková. She noted that some housewives also pickle pumpkins like cucumbers.
We are looking for motivated immigrants. The head of the children's clinic is building an international team of doctors, we bring their stories
Albanian Ledjona Toni studied medicine in the Czech Republic, and today only a few people recognize that she is a foreigner.
Hundreds of medical students from abroad are studying in the Czech Republic and could stay and work here. A paediatric clinic in Motol, Prague, has tried to recruit some of them.
Tara Hussein Tayeb had to get up very early to arrive at the Motol hospital in Prague at around five o'clock in the afternoon. The Kurdish woman with close-cropped hair was flying to the Czech Republic from Sulaymaniyah, a city in the north-east of Iraq, where she works as a paediatrician in a hospital and in the afternoon still treats small patients as part of her private practice. She also teaches at a university.
Strawberry, plum and invisible. Choose the right shade of lipstick: There is not just one red
When choosing a red lipstick, you should first determine whether you are a warm or cold type. Try a simple test - look at the veins on your wrist. If they are blue, you are a cold type, if they are green, then you are a warm type. When choosing a new red lipstick, first of all, put it on the distribution based on the undertone. Only in the next one, look at the texture.
If you are a woman with a cold undertone, then lipsticks in purple, plum, cherry or mauve are suitable for you.
If you fall into the category of warm skin undertone, choose such lipsticks. You can recognize them by the fact that they tend to have orange, coral, gold or brown reflections.
It may happen to you that some veins look green and others blue. In that case, congratulate yourself - you do not have to look at the undertone and you can focus only on your color preferences.

Unkempt man wants 45 million from the state
According to the spokesman of the office, Vladimír Řepka, the Ministry of Justice has so far received six requests in this regard and is now analysing them. The young man was in prison for two years for assaulting a woman, but the judiciary finally acquitted him.
Neither the Supreme Public Prosecutor Pavel Zeman nor the Minister of Justice Marie Benešová filed an appeal in the case.
The attempted murder of a hairdresser in Hořice happened in February 2013. The Hradec Králové Public Prosecutor's Office charged the then 20-year-old grammar school student Nečesaný. The prosecution claimed that he hit the woman several times in the head with a log and then took over ten thousand crowns from her. The seriously injured woman was found by her son, and her life was saved by doctors at the Hradec Králové hospital.
"I am innocent and I swear to it. I am sincerely sorry for what happened to the victim, but I am not the perpetrator," the young man said earlier in court, who did not deny that he was in the hairdresser's on the fateful day. He said he wanted to get a haircut. But he left after the woman told him that she was already closing. He then turned himself in to the police as a witness.
At first, the hairdresser did not recognize him as the aggressor during the interrogation, but later she identified Nečesaný as the attacker. According to court experts, she suffered from memory loss after the attack.
The Hradec Králové Regional Court handed down five verdicts in the case. First, it found Nečesaný guilty twice and sentenced him to 16 years in prison, while the High Court of Appeal reduced his sentence to 13 years. Nečesaný was sent to prison twice, but each time he was released after the intervention of the Supreme Court. After the ordered replacement of the court panel, there were repeated acquittals, the last of which was confirmed by the High Court in March this year.
At the same time, however, the Chairman of the Board of Appeal, Jiří Lněnička, stated in the reasoning of his conclusions that this decision was wrong, but due to the procedural situation, he did not have a better option. He said that he rejected the appeal of the public prosecutor against the acquittal verdict, even though her appeal objections were justified.
"The problem of this case is not that there is a lack of evidence, but their evaluation. We believe that a sufficient amount of evidence was collected in the pre-trial proceedings, which would be more than sufficient in another criminal case for the recognition of guilt," said Lněnička.
However, the Hradec Králové Court, as well as the Supreme Court, looked at the case differently and their opinion would probably not change if the acquittal were to be overturned.

The woman spent hundreds of thousands from the disability pension of her disabled son.
She is awaiting trial
The money that the 33-year-old man receives from the state as a disability pension is primarily intended to improve his quality of life.
The woman faces up to eight years in prison for embezzlement.
Due to his poor health, the court deprived the sick man of his legal capacity and appointed his mother as his guardian, who was to manage his son's money, among other things.
"From mid-November 2013 to January of this year, the woman used part of the funds from her son's disability pension for her own needs, depriving him of 440,000 crowns," said police spokesperson Dana Ladmanová, adding that the accused woman was aggravated by the fact that, as a guardian, she had a special duty to defend the interests of the victim.
According to the court's instructions, the woman did set up an account for her son, but she had his pension sent to her account.
"After paying the costs associated with her son's stay in a medical facility and paying for the necessary medications, she used the remaining funds to purchase a vehicle, electrical appliances and to run the household," the indictment says.
The woman admitted that she could not use her son's money for her own needs.
However, she defended herself by saying that she used them to help pay for family expenses.
"We had problems using our income to keep the household running.
We have never bought anything above standard.
It was always for things my son would approve of buying.
I thought of it as family money.
I had no idea that I was committing a crime," the woman explained to the police.
She promised to return the money to her son.
North America has been inhabited for 30,000 years, scientists say after finding tools
The finds from the Chiquihuite cave in the Mexican state of Zacatecas include 1,930 limestone tools, including fine blades that could have been used to cut meat and pointed objects that could have served as spear points or lances.
The researchers found that the oldest of the tools date back to 33,000 to 31,000 years ago.
"There are only a few products of this age.
But they are there," said archaeologist Ciprian Ardelean of the University of Zacatecas and lead author of one of two studies on the subject published in the journal Nature.
The youngest instruments are 12,500 years old.
According to experts, people have inhabited the Chiquihuite cave, located at a high altitude, for as long as 20,000 years.
Until now, the generally accepted theory was that the first representatives of the Homo sapiens species crossed the land bridge from the area of today's Russia to Alaska about 13,500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including unique spear points used to kill mammoths and other prehistoric animals, has shown that this Clovis culture subsequently spread across much of North America.
In recent decades, however, cracks have appeared in this model, with the discovery of several ancient settlements that were two to three thousand years older.
The second study, published in the journal Nature, reports on 42 different sites across North America that show evidence of human presence on the continent between 26,000 and 19,000 years ago.
Scientists believe that a small number of people may have arrived on the North American mainland earlier than previously thought.
Some may have made it to America by boat.
"It is clear that humans were in the Americas long before the development of the so-called Clovis culture," anthropologist Ruth Gruhn of the University of Alberta in Canada said of the new findings.
So far, the interest in air tickets is in line with the optimistic scenario, say sellers.
Prices are also gradually coming down
Sales of airline tickets in the Czech Republic are growing every week.
Compared to last summer, the interest is still about half, but the demand is growing by up to 20 percent every week.
According to dealers, the development after the crisis thus fulfils the most optimistic scenarios.
Ticket prices are gradually coming down as well.
According to sellers, southern European countries are among the most sought-after destinations.
According to data from Kiwi.com, Spain, Italy and Greece are in the lead.
The portal Letuška.cz sells the most flights to the Croatian city of Split.
Of the other countries, the United Kingdom is the most sought after, but it has always been one of the busiest destinations.
The average price of airline tickets is also falling.
At the Letuška.cz portal, it was around 6,250 crowns in the middle of the month, down by 3,000 crowns year on year.
This is mainly due to an increase in demand for European destinations, which now account for about 85 percent of sales.
However, the prices to some European destinations are also falling, for example to Spain or Italy they have fallen by about a fifth in recent weeks.
The crisis has also affected the behaviour of customers, who are now buying tickets much less in advance than before, because they are worried about the further development of the coronavirus situation.
According to earlier information from Kiwi.com, the time to purchase a ticket before departure has decreased by about ten days year-on-year.
"This confirms the future trend, when people will order tickets much less in advance, they will require more flexibility, less risk," said Michal Šindelář, vice president for products at Kiwi.com.
Currently, the average booking time before departure is 21 days.
Along with the growth in sales, the number of renewed air routes from the Czech Republic is also increasing.
Prague Airport currently operates regular flights to more than 60 destinations.
This is approximately half the number of destinations compared to last year's summer season.
The hunter was injured in a fall from his perch and was carried to the ambulance for three hours
The unfortunate accident occurred before half past seven in the evening in the top parts of the Devil's Mill.
"It was a very difficult and inaccessible terrain, so we sent five of our rescuers with the appropriate equipment to the injured man. At the same time, we asked for the cooperation of the Emergency Medical Service of the Moravian-Silesian Region. The medics then sent an ambulance to the accident," Libor Kluz, dispatcher of the Beskydy Mountain Rescue Service, described the circumstances of the intervention.
The rescuers found the hunter in the selected location with multiple injuries. They immediately treated him and then gently, but with difficulty, transported him on a so-called Austrian wheelchair across the impassable terrain.
"The transport along the route of about one and a half kilometres was slow and difficult. The injured nimrod was therefore handed over to the ambulance crew after approximately three hours," added Libor Kluz.
According to Radan Jaškovský, the authorized chief of the Beskydy Mountain Rescue Service and also the intervening rescuer, the colleague of the hunter was fortunately able to describe in detail where the injured person was.
"That's why we found him relatively quickly. However, if he had the Záchranka app on his phone, our rescuers would certainly have been with him sooner, and at the same time, the dispatching of line 155 would have immediately known about the accident and his situation," Radan Jaškovský noted.
He added that a charged mobile phone with the Záchranka app activated should be a matter of course in the mountains.
The grand finale is tonight!
Watch the darts battle live on Nova Sport
The second most prestigious tournament within the PDC organization has reached the grand final.
It will feature the experienced 49-year-old Scottish darts player Gary Anderson and the surprise of the tournament, the 26-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh.
Gary Anderson knocked out Justin Pip in the first round, then ran into his neighbor in the table rankings.
However, he also managed to deal with James Wade and in the quarter-finals he had a good fight with Simon Whitlock, who had previously sent home the world number one.
The "Flying Scotsman" came close in the semi-finals when he faced Michale Smith.
At the last minute, however, he escaped the gravedigger's shovel, dominated in overtime and, after a score of 18:16, won a place in the final of the tournament, which he had already won in 2018, when he defeated Mensur Suljovic 21:19 in an amazing battle.
The biggest surprise of the World Matchplay is Dimitri van den Bergh.
The Belgian talent is enjoying the tournament and perhaps the knowledge that he has nothing to lose has helped him to play on an absolutely fantastic wave.
The 26-year-old darts player first surprisingly knocked out world number six Nathan Aspinall, in a dramatic battle they also pushed Joe Cullen and in the quarter-finals, after a sharp start, he also defeated Adrian Lewis.
The big test was the semi-final.
Glen Durrant showed his strength right at the beginning, but the calmly playing Belgian then gained a lead with an excellent series, which he then held more or less without any problems until the end.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in high scoring, which he countered with occasional uncertainty on doubles.
Coronavirus cases have increased at least since the beginning of the week, the number of tests has decreased
Since the beginning of March, when the new coronavirus was first discovered in the Czech Republic, 15,212 people have been proven to have been infected with it.
Almost 9,600 of them have already been cured, 368 patients have died.
A total of 5,254 people are currently ill.
This is according to data on the website of the Ministry of Health.
The daily number of newly confirmed cases has exceeded two hundred for four consecutive days this week.
The maximum was 281 cases on Friday.
There were 235 positive tests on Thursday, 246 the day before and 206 on Tuesday.
On the first working day of this week, 169 more people were infected.
A total of 9,590 people have recovered from COVID-19 in the Czech Republic, or 63 percent of all those infected so far.
Most had a mild form of the disease.
According to the latest data from the Ministry of Health, there are 151 people with coronavirus in the hospital, the condition of 19 of them is assessed by doctors as serious.
There are several outbreaks of the Covid-19 disease in the Czech Republic.
Karviná still has the highest number of people infected in the last seven days per 100,000 inhabitants, with almost 59.
It is followed by the district of Jihlava with 56 and Frýdek-Místek with 36 infected per 100 thousand inhabitants in the last week.
Due to the increased number of infected people, new measures against the spread of the coronavirus have been in force in the Czech Republic since Saturday.
People must wear masks at indoor mass events of more than 100 people, these are cultural and sporting events, but also weddings and funerals inside buildings.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be reduced from the current one thousand people to half.
In the world, the number of people who have been proven to be infected with the new coronavirus has already exceeded 16 million.
This was stated by the American Johns Hopkins University, which is monitoring the development of the pandemic globally.
According to this source, the number of victims who have died from Covid-19 is close to 645,000.
The latest million infections were added to the statistics in just three days; the 15 million mark fell on 22 July.
The largest contribution to the rapid increase in the number of cases in recent days has been made by the United States, which has already registered more than 4.1 million infected, Brazil with 2.4 million and India, where, according to the authorities, almost 1.4 million people have been infected.
The number of infected people is now increasing at a record pace.
The World Health Organization reported this week that there were more than 284,000 new cases worldwide from Thursday to Friday, the highest daily total since the pandemic began.
This development can be attributed to the fact that the spread of the infection is at its peak in populous countries such as the USA, Brazil and India, but according to Reuters, the number of new cases has been growing in almost 40 countries around the world in the past week.
This applies to countries such as Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium and Israel.
The infection has already appeared in almost all countries of the world, and the first case was officially announced by the DPRK today.

The air in homes is up to five times worse than the air outside.
Air fresheners and deodorants are bad for your health
Health is threatened not only by poor air quality in outdoor areas, but also at home.
This was pointed out by an Israeli expert on human health, Carol Abraham, quoted by The Jerusalem Post.
According to Abraham, who was responsible for the creation of the Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection, it is necessary to focus on pollutants in homes right now, when many people spend more time working from home.
Abraham mentioned research by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), according to which the quality of indoor air is up to five times worse than outdoor air.
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 3.8 million people die prematurely each year due to poor air quality in their homes.
"Due to the coronavirus epidemic, which has forced and continues to force many to work from home, people have to spend more hours in their homes than before, so it's time to focus on the quality of air in homes," Abraham said.
In Israel, according to her, almost no one is concerned with the quality of "domestic air."
The things that people normally come into contact with - paints, air fresheners, disinfectants, deodorants or pesticides - can be dangerous.
"Even the clothes that we regularly take to the dry cleaners emit poisonous gas," Abrahamová said.
According to her, children, elderly members of the household and people with respiratory problems are most at risk.
Even otherwise healthy individuals can begin to suffer from problems such as headaches, fainting, irritation of the nasal passages, nosebleeds, vomiting or skin allergies.
Long-term exposure to unhealthy substances can damage internal organs and the central nervous system.
However, not all pollutants come from objects inside the home, the source can also be the material from which the houses are built.
Tough competition for the Skoda Kamiq. The Kia XCeed bets on rich equipment, but at what price?
The Kia XCeed is a relatively difficult model to classify. It is clearly a compact SUV, but it does not offer all-wheel drive. It leaves this item to its bigger sibling, the Sportage, which is a direct response to cars such as the Skoda Karoq, Opel Grandland X or Volkswagen Tiguan. Compared to them, the XCeed also relies on more dynamic body shapes, which, by sloping the rear part, can remotely remind the world of an SUV coupe, popular in this part of the market, especially among premium brands Audi, BMW or Mercedes-Benz.
On the other hand, the XCeed can not be classified only alongside the plasticized versions of classic compacts, which include, for example, the Ford Focus Active. Compared to it, the Koreans have made a much larger number of changes to the body, so if you do not want, you may not even see the Ceed in the shapes of the novelty.
Unlike the compact hatchback or the Ceed station wagon, the XCeed is also offered exclusively with turbocharged engines, so do not expect a basic atmospheric fourteen hundred. The XCeed starts with a turbocharged liter and also offers a turbocharged sixteen hundred with 150 kW, reserved for the GT version of the siblings. Do not expect a sports grade here. The 1.6 CRDi turbodiesels are only offered in a mild-hybrid version, which means that the internal combustion engine is assisted by an electric system that helps to reduce consumption and emissions. From 100 kW, it is also possible to pay extra for a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic in addition to the manual.
The range will soon be expanded to include a plug-in hybrid, i.e. a variant that can travel around sixty kilometres on electric power alone. The battery can then also be charged from a normal socket.
Václav Havel quiz: How long did he spend in prison and what made him write Charter 77
Fuenlabrada lost the chance to advance to the top Spanish football league due to the coronavirus infection in the team.
The management of the competition cancelled the originally postponed duel of the last round of the second league, in which the team could secure participation in the playoffs.
Fuenlabrada reported another 12 infected people on Saturday, bringing the total number of positive tests for covid-19 at the club to 28.
Monday's match against La Coruna, in which Fuenlabrada needed only a point to qualify for the playoffs, was postponed due to an infection in the team.
The management of the competition said today that the duel against La Coruna was definitively called off due to force majeure due to the fact that it was no longer possible to play.
Fuenlabrada has accepted the decision.
La Coruña, on the other hand, is up in arms about the match not being played.
In the end, given the results of their rivals, even a victory over Fuenlabrada would not have been enough to save them, but they consider it unfair that the last round did not take place according to the usual complete in a single date.
The management of the former elite Spanish club is threatening to go to court over its relegation to the third league.
The top two teams in the table, Huesca and Cadiz, are assured of a place among the elite.
Zaragoza, Almeria, Girona and Elche will compete for the remaining third place in the playoffs.
Karel Gott did not like Václav Havel?!
The daughter of Dominic revealed it
"My father didn't like him for many years," Gott's eldest daughter Dominika revealed to Aha!, adding that the Master couldn't remember Havel's name and whenever he was mentioned, Karel was always annoyed.
It's hard to say what they did to each other, but according to Dominika, the dispute began sometime in the mid-1990s.
"My father said in an article after the revolution that he had it easier than he did.
That Havel could write in a drawer during the dark times, but if he resisted in any way, his career would be over," says Gottová.
But then he adds that in the end, the Czech giants did find a way to each other.
"I know that Havel could not have heard the word until he was in his sixties.
But then the president congratulated him with a letter on his birthday, and suddenly my father's relationship with him began to change," Dominika recalls.
Indeed, ten years later, Gott even invited the then former president to celebrate his seventieth birthday at the Ambassador Hotel on Wenceslas Square.
"And that was the beginning of a new era in their relationship, because my father then regularly invited Mr. Havel to his home in Bertramka," added the blonde, whose father died last October.
Slavík was also said to be sorry that he never received a state decoration from Václav Havel.
However, he finally received it in 2009, even though it was already in the hands of his successor in office, Václav Klaus (79).
He will receive another honour in memoriam, as the current president Miloš Zeman (75) is to award him the Order of the White Lion and thus honour his memory.
Heat wave threatens the Czech Republic from Tuesday, meteorologists warn of wildfires
The meteorologists' warning of high temperatures is valid for Tuesday afternoon for the whole of Bohemia, with the exception of the Karlovy Vary region, as well as for southern and central Moravia.
"Exceptionally, temperatures may exceed 34 degrees Celsius, especially in Central Bohemia," they say.
People are advised to follow a drinking regime in the heat and to limit physical activity in the midday and afternoon hours.
Due to the warm weather with a minimum of rainfall, there will be a risk of fires from Tuesday morning.
Windy weather could contribute to their rapid spread.
The warning of meteorologists about the risk of fires applies to Central Bohemia, including Prague, Liberec, Ústí nad Labem, Karlovy Vary and Plzeň regions.
The fire warning will remain in effect until further notice.
"We do not expect significant rainfall, which would mitigate the danger, in the northwest and west of Bohemia until at least the end of the week," says the CHMI.
Prague City Hall responded to the meteorologists' warning with a ban on lighting fires in high-risk areas, which is due to come into force on Tuesday.
People in the capital will not be allowed to light open fires in parks, gardens or forests, for example, up to a distance of 50 metres from the edge of the forest cover.
Smoking and the use of pyrotechnics are also prohibited in these areas.
The measure will be in effect until further notice, Prague City Hall spokesman Vít Hofman said.
French chef sues Michelin for taking away his star: I suffer from depression, he says
The famous French chef Marc Veyrat lost his third Michelin star in January this year, a year after he received it. He intends to sue the publisher of the red guide to obtain the exact reasons for the demotion. Veyrat also doubts the competence of the Michelin inspectors who, according to him, mistook saffron for cheddar. The first court hearing is to take place in November.
The chef of the famous restaurant La Maison de Bois in the Alpine region of Haute-Savoie lost one of his three Michelin stars in January of this year. He will sue the publisher of the prestigious guide Le Guide Michelin because, according to him, the conclusion of the commissioners was not properly justified. Moreover, according to him, the removal of the star took place without any notice. "I have been suffering from depression for six months. How dare you play with the health of chefs?" Veyrat sent a message to the commissioners.
Michelin allegedly gave the chef only vague reasons, such as the fact that the chef put cheddar in the soufflé, which the inspectorate did not like. "I put saffron in it and the gentlemen thought it was cheddar because it was yellow. I have been working with Savoyard ingredients with love from the beginning," Veyrat objected to the decision. He is convinced of the strong incompetence of the Michelin commissioners: "You are frauds who only cause disputes for commercial reasons." An indignant Veyrat does not understand "how they could dare to say that we put cheddar in our soufflé." "They also insulted our region, my employees were crazy about it. We have eggs from our hens, milk from our own cows, gardeners collect fresh herbs every morning," he got angry.
The flamboyant chef, who always wears a black hat and dark glasses, is opposed to the new generation of Michelin inspectors and has therefore asked for his restaurant to be removed from the red guide, but the publisher has refused. "If the restaurant remains open and our inspectors choose it again, we will continue to recommend it," says Gwendal Poullennec, international director of Michelin.
According to Michelin, the chef's complaint shows that he does not yet have any meaningful accusation and the lawyer will help him to formulate it. "We regret that Mr. Veyrat communicates with us roughly, but we will carefully examine his comments," he said.
In addition to La Maison de Bois, Marc Veyart owns two other three-star restaurants.
