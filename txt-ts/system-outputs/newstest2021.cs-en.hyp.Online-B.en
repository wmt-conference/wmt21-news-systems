The basketball players did not reach the medal from the U17 World Championships, they finished fourth
The third World Cup of seventeen was also won by the Americans, who defeated Spain in the final by just 77:75, despite over 40 points from the Spanish Angela Salvadores.
"We really wanted to win and not be potato, but maybe we wanted it too much. We caught the beginning, but we couldn't keep it, because we were rolled under the basket," said Captain Karolína Malečková. "Playing in front of such an audience was an incredible experience," she praised the fans in Klatovy and Pilsen.
The Czechs started very well, thanks to two threes they took the lead 8: 0 and dominated the field for the entire first quarter. At that moment, it seemed that the opponents would repay the defeat from the basic group 85:88 after extra time. However, the referees whistled 15 fouls in the half and helped Hungary return to the game with a 12: 2 draw.
"I am convinced that it was enough to put two or three more baskets, run for 20 points and we would not let go. But instead our mistakes came. I am not interested in the judges, but what we did wrong, and there were mistakes that helped the opponent to catch, "said coach Richard Fousek.
"It wasn't the first time we had a loss of concentration. But the girls are fighters, they didn't release anything and fought to the end. But the opponent was very good," he added.
The Czechs kept Petra Holešínská in the game, especially by shooting from a distance, and Tereza Šípová, a pivot. However, the best Czech shooter had a problem with fouls and a large part of the third quarter was missing on the field. The Hungarians took advantage of this and gained a slight lead, which they have already maintained, even though the Czechs fought until the last seconds.
"For us, the first five matches were very demanding, we turned the matches in a narrow rotation and it cost us a lot of strength. Against Spain it was clear that the girls were tired and there was nowhere to take. "We missed the landing. And the Hungarians are so good that if you don't put everything together, you will have a hard time winning," added Fousek.
He believes that his trustee has a promising future. "In two years, the girls have been able to win the Youth Olympics, be second to the 16-year-old European Championships and now they are fourth in the world. they will assign a coach to them in higher categories, "Fousek added.
Thomas Cook: The Czechs were thrown out of a hotel in Mallorca. Guarantees were not enough
The Austrian, German and Polish divisions of the group also filed for insolvency during the week. The future of the Czech branch is currently being discussed, and a decision should be made by the end of September.
According to the vice-president of the Association of Travel Agencies of the Czech Republic, Jan Papež, there are three variants of possible solutions at stake - liquidation will be announced, or the company will be sold, or a team from the Czech branch will set up a new travel agency. "Which of them it will be, but it cannot be predicted, will depend on the German owner," he told ČTK today.
In addition to two prematurely terminated tours, the travel agency also solves cases where clients had to pay for their stay from their own, although the company tries to provide guarantees to hoteliers. TA promised its clients to make payments, according to the Pope, the company has sufficient security for this.
Problems in hotels arose mainly in Mallorca, where the company also asked the Czech consulate for help. In this context, the Pope described to ČTK one of the cases where the local hotel fired all the tourists from the office. "The hotelier could not determine who belongs to the German and who belongs to the Czech company. Therefore, he expelled everyone from the hotel, even though the domestic Neckermann provided guarantees," he said. According to Šrámek, the situation was finally resolved.
The Czech branch of the bankrupt British group Thomas Cook last year increased its sales to 995 million crowns, a year-on-year increase of almost 21 percent, according to the company's annual report. It covers the accounting period from October 2017 to the end of September 2018. On the other hand, the company's net profit decreased by approximately seven million to 15.3 million crowns. From previous years, however, the company was left with an unpaid loss of almost 103 million crowns. The branch includes two basic divisions - in addition to CK Neckermann, it is also the company Global Travel Lufthansa City Center.
Novák helped Trabzonspora to second place, Škoda also scored
Defender Filip Novák helped the Trabzonspor to score the vice-champion with a goal in the last round of the Turkish Football League.
His team won 2: 1 on the Kayserispor field and kept the third Besiktas behind.
After the January transfer from Slavia, the striker Milan Škoda scored the tenth goal for Rizespor, who escaped, even though he lost 1: 3 on the field of Fenerbahce.
Novák confirmed excellent productivity on the defender with the seventh goal in this league year.
63 minutes into the match, Kayserisporu came through the middle and almost added to his team's lead, but the shot went wide.
The home team managed to equalize five minutes before the end, but Trabzonspor pulled the victory to his side in the sixth minute of the setting, when he successfully finished a four-on-one break.
The damage in the beginning of the second half of the match with Fenerbahce equalized after the solo to 1: 1.
Rizespor did not keep the tie for a long time, but he did not have to regret it, because thanks to the results of the opponents, he remained three points above the descent zone.
The competition will end with Sunday's duel of the champion Basaksehir on the Kasimpasy field.
The well-hidden Hermit's Cave in the forests near Nový Bor was not really habitable
In the north of Bohemia, in the foothills of the Lusatian Mountains, near Nový Bor in the Českolipsko region, in the forests through which the Hraběcí cesta led, several sandstone rock formations are hidden.
Natural and artificial.
And we will go after that human hand created.
The place is called Hermit Cave.
In reality, however, no hermit had ever lived here, and the cave served as a shelter, more precisely a shelter chamber probably for grain.
The cave is carved from the side into a rock watchtower and is accessible by stairs from above.
At the same time, it is practically invisible until the last moment.
It is revealed by narrow stairs leading to a kind of rock gallery, from where you can just enter the rock.
Although the chamber appears to be quite far from human dwellings, at the time of its creation there may have been a field on the plateau where the forest is today.
"The fact that the building does not have a window and even a fireplace located in a traditional place clearly proves that no hermit could ever survive the winter here," explains historian Kamil Podroužek from the Jan Evangelista Purkyně Faculty of Arts in Ústí nad Labem.
The one-room building has only a stone bench at the back, which is probably used for storing containers.
"I see it as a chamber for storing some food or products from the field," adds Kamil Podroužek.
Traces of tools are visible on the walls of the cave.
Breaking the sandstone with a canine was quite simple and fast for the insiders.
It was enough to make good use of the joints and gradually break off the sandstone.
Depending on the length of the canine trail and the method of mowing in general, the period of cave formation can be determined in general.
According to the historian, it is probably the end of the 18th century.
The cave is freely accessible and according to the mess that appears in it, nowadays someone sleeps there from time to time.
If you approach the cave from above from one of the forest paths and you are fascinated by a flowing stream and a nearby count's path under the cave, then you will definitely find a path down as well.
And on the way out of the forest, you may be captivated by the nearby Raven Rocks.
Under the bridge, someone killed a non-conflicting homeless woman. Police are looking for witnesses
According to the Prague police, the murder took place sometime during the early evening until the night from Tuesday to Wednesday. It is to this time that the police call for possible testimony relates.
"One of the drivers, who was crossing the bridge connecting Libeň and Žižkov or along Pod Krejcárkem Street, could have filmed the killer on the on-board camera, for example. him on line 158, "said Jan Daněk, a spokesman for the regional police directorate.
According to Danek's spokesperson, the murdered homeless woman was non-conflicting, did not drink alcohol and did not seek the company of other people. The woman lived at the scene. "She most often moved around Krejcárek, Palmovka and Holešovice, when she had big blue shopping bags with her," Daněk added a description of the victim, which could also help potential witnesses.

Nokia is suing the Brno company for the name Lokia. People do not confuse us, the Moravians believe
Nokia has filed an opposition against Lokia's application to the Industrial Property Office. However, according to the CCV, product substitution is unlikely.
The Brno-based company developing CCV software is facing legal action from the Finnish telecommunications equipment manufacturer Nokia. Finns do not like the fact that the program of the Brno company for warehouse management is called Lokia WMS, wrote the daily E15. Nokia therefore objected to the Lokia brand's application to the Industrial Property Office. CCV considers that confusion is unlikely.
Marketing Director Petr Ondrášek stated that the program is already used by two dozen customers, it has been on the market since last September.
"The Nokia brand enjoys recognition and trust around the world. When someone tries to register a brand that we believe may lead to confusion or weakening of our brand, we take steps to protect our valuable asset," said Nokia spokesman Mark Durrant.
The Brno developers claim that they did not think of a brand famous in the past for mobile phones when creating the stock program. The designation Lokia according to CCV is based on the Latin name for one species of dragonfly, the rapid movement of which is supposed to be analogous to the movement of storekeepers around a warehouse.
"On the Czech market, the possibility of confusion is unlikely. We sell modern cloud software, with which companies equip their warehouses, and we really do not aim for mobile phone production. CCV manager Tomáš Kormaňák.
CCV applied for trademark protection in August before the program was launched at the Industrial Property Office. "It applied for protection for products and services in Classes 9, 35 and 42, as the software belongs to Class 9, the related warehouse management services belong to Class 35 and the development of computer software in Class 42 according to the international classification," said Ondrášek.
Nokia's opposition is based on the fact that the earlier Nokia mark is valid in all classes of goods and services and thus covers the widest possible range of goods and services and therefore, of course, also overlaps in classes 9, 35 and 42. "CCV does not dispute the opponent in terms of agreement on these classes of products and services, but in reality they are completely different brands aimed at other target groups, "said Ondrášek.
According to E15, a brand dispute can take months and can complicate the company's activities.
Coal gives way to gas and core. Renewable sources will not cover the increased demand, says the head of the European ExxonMobil
Renewable resources will not be enough for the Czech Republic to satisfy future energy demand. Due to the unsuitable climate, wind and solar power plants need to be supplemented with other alternatives, such as those using natural gas.
In an interview with HN, this is stated by Philippe Ducom, president of the European branch of the American concern ExxonMobil, one of the largest global oil miners. At the same time, he mentions that large repositories, which could later store unused energy from days when the sun and wind are enough, are still too expensive.
Ducom visited the ExxonMobil center in Prague, which employs 1,200 people and whose task is to support the company's business activities and provide logistics and other services needed for the company's operations.
From Sydney to London in four hours? In 2030, a possible reality
Saber combines a classic aircraft engine with a rocket. It is designed to propel the aircraft at twice the speed of the Concordes. "Once the Saber engine is up and running, it could allow us to reach Australia in about four hours," Turnock said. And, for example, the distance between London and New York could be flown in one hour.
The Independent server notes that so-called hypersonic flights, which exceed the speed of sound five times, are complicated by engine overheating. However, Saber (Synergetic Air Breathing Rocket Engine) should deal with this problem thanks to the use of super-cold helium, which should prevent temperatures from rising.
"The most important thing about the Saber is that it is a hybrid of a rocket and an aircraft engine that is powered by a stream of exhaust gases generated from the air," says Shaun Driscoll of Reaction Engines. "Rockets haven't undergone such a major development in the last 70 years, while aircraft rockets have. So when you combine engines, you can have a very light and efficient propulsion system and basically create a spacecraft," he added.
The engine is currently being tested, with test flights expected to begin around mid-next year. Commercial flights around 2030.
I still see myself as a boy who is just looking around, says Jan Cina
"It was a big school for everyone who worked on it. I fell in love with Afro dance there. The fact that I have something Romani in me after my dad, it completely enchanted me," said Jan Cina, who considers himself mainly a musical actor.
He has much fresher memories than the series První krok has the role of a painter in the new film Národní třída. Cina revealed that director Štěpán Altrichter must have attracted him a lot. "The work was difficult, but the result is worth it. The film was made a year ago. Hard and honest, but also fun. It was shot on Národní třída, where I drove as a non-driver. It was also shot a lot in the South City of Prague," he said. to the Czech-German co-production film.
Although he is nominated for a Thalia Award for his role in the production of The Little Prince, he does not consider it the peak of his career. "I don't feel that way. I still see myself as a boy who is just looking around. But the nomination is very pleasant and surprising. I see the peak far ahead of me," he said, not even thinking about the thank-you speech in case of victory. "Not at all, but as a child, listening to talk shows on the radio, I always imagined talking to people."
Jan Cina has been living with his colleague Petr Vančura for thirteen years. What is his recipe for a happy relationship? "To like each other and to perceive problems as a challenge and a good thing to solve," he revealed, recalling the awarding of the Czech Lions when his friend fell on the steps.
"Yes, it really happened. He had new slippery shoes and the red carpet was slippery, too. So it didn't take long and he was lying on the ground. He could make it a priority. "
The Germans elected Keller to head the football association
As expected, the current head of Freiburg's Bundesliga, Fritz Keller, has become the new chairman of the German Football Association. The 62-year-old winemaker, gastronom and hotelier was elected unanimously for three years, he had no opponent.
Keller replaced Reinhard Grindel, who resigned in April due to an unrecognized income scandal. His other predecessors, Theo Zwanziger and Wolfgang Niersbach, will be sued again for possible bribery in the 2006 World Cup.
Keller said that one of the main goals would be to restore confidence to the union and bring it out of the crisis. "It will not be a One Man Show, many people will take responsibility. The union is better than its reputation," said Keller, who presented all his tasks under the slogan: Together we can do it.
After being elected head of the union, Keller left office in Freiburg.
Jockey Minařík is in artificial sleep after a severe fall in Germany
"Philip is in the best of hands now.
The institute is equipped for similar cases, moreover, fortunately we have part of the family in Hanover.
This makes the situation much easier for me and also the care for my daughter Finja, "the Jezdci.cz server quoted Minařík's wife Katja as saying.
"Everyone is doing their best, Filip now needs time to recover.
There is no point in making any predictions.
Anyone who has ever encountered the problem of head trauma and patients in artificial sleep knows that the situation can change.
Philip is a great warrior.
We all have to be patient now and give him time, "said the woman of the 45-year-old jockey.
The star Frankie Dettori, who won the seventh King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes race in Ascot on Saturday on Saturday, also called on the injured Minařík on Twitter, thus equaling the legend of Lester Piggott.
To date, almost 70,000 euros have been collected on the Gofundme server.
The goal is the amount of 100 thousand euros (2.6 million crowns).
The video referee took the Sassuola footballers four goals, losing 0: 2
Although the Sassuola footballers got the ball four times in the opponent's goal in Saturday's match in Naples, in the end they had to accept a 0: 2 defeat.
None of their goals were recognized by the referee after consultation with the video due to offside.
According to the Italian media, this is a record adversity of technology, so many interventions have never been thwarted by VAR to one team.
"VAR was stricter on Sassuolo than road radar and punished him like no team yet.
New technology breaks records, "Gazzetta dello Sport wrote in a commentary.
"Festival of unrecognized goals Sassuola.
VAR has never been so strict with one team, "added Corriere dello Sport.
Naples took the lead on Saturday in the 8th minute, but after half an hour of play, Sassuolo seemed to equalize.
However, Filip Djuričič's goal was not recognized after the intervention of the video referee due to the offside.
For the same reason, Djuričič's other intervention and hits by Francesco Caput and Domenico Berardi gradually did not apply.
The home team, on the other hand, added another goal.
Electric cars set a new record.
In the Czech Republic, they were the most recharged in history
"The growth was driven by both a 30 percent increase in the number of stations in our network and the trend of more frequent charging at public stations, as well as the accelerated development of new e-car registrations," said Tomáš Chmelík, ČEZ's head of clean technology.
Other large players, such as PRE and E.ON, the manufacturer of electric cars Tesla, as well as supermarkets Billa and Lidl, are also applying for their share on the market.
The operator of classic filling stations is represented by the company MOL.
But she doesn't have numbers yet.
"We only started building our network for electromobility last year," explained company spokeswoman Jana Jusková.
However, the Deník editorial staff exclusively obtained data from all 216 electric racks operated by ČEZ.
It follows that the drivers took an average of 13.5 kWh from the stations.
This corresponds to the range of about a hundred kilometers of a smaller electric car.
Leaving aside small pumps up to 1 kWh, the average charging takes two and a half hours.
The vast majority of refueling then took place in a free tariff.
If motorists had already paid for the collection, their typical expenditure was around 330 crowns.
Electromobility pulls mainly in the capital.
On the territory of Prague, there are all five of CEZ's busiest chargers, which, with their popularity, overshadow entire regional cities.
Olomouc then leads between the regions.
On the contrary, the least interest is in remote stations on the border, for example in Bohumín or Prachatice, which often remain unused throughout the day.
More than four thousand electric cars are currently registered in the Czech Republic.
In the first half of this year alone, 1,274 new e-cars were added.
In an extensive poll by the daily "Czechs on the Move", eight percent of readers said they were considering buying an electric car for the family.
However, only a third of respondents know where to look for the nearest charging station in their area.
Epilepsy has complicated his love of sports, thanks to the operation he has new hope
For the first time, Honzík's parents noticed that something was wrong with him, in a year and a half. He always stared into space for a few minutes, motionless and unresponsive to anyone. The pediatrician therefore sent him to the pediatric neurology clinic, where the doctors diagnosed him with epilepsy after a series of examinations and immediately gave him medication, which did not work immediately.
It took almost a year for doctors to find the ideal combination of drugs that completely stopped having seizures. At the age of five, doctors stopped his medication, and because the seizures did not return, his parents thought that Honza was healthy and began to lead him more into sports. He rode a bike, skied, played tennis and floorball, and spent his free time playing games with his sister and friends. At the age of eleven, however, he had another seizure and it all started again.
Doctors tried different combinations of drugs again, but this time nothing worked, seizures in the form of absences kept recurring. Since Honza always lost sight of it during the attack, his parents were terrified that he would get it during sports and get injured. Gradually, Honza stopped riding his bike and exchanged downhill skis for cross-country skiing and snowboarding. Although the sport caused him a seizure from time to time, he never gave it up completely. He even fulfilled his dream and finished the Spartan Race, but together with a friend who was always in sight to help him in case of emergency.
When Honza was 15 years old, his parents decided to try to change doctors and turned to experts at the University Hospital in Motol. After a series of examinations, local doctors decided that Honza was a candidate for surgery to remove a lesion from his brain - a source of epileptic seizures. "I had to have 2 surgeries in a row, first the doctors operated into my brain probes that sensed his activity, then they could remove my bearing. It was a hell of a few weeks for me. I just had to lie down and hardly move, wires stuck out of my head that were connected to a computer, "recalls Honza.
The operation was successful and the doctors removed a relatively large deposit. "The first days after the operation it was very mentally demanding, Honza was apathetic, confused, sad and almost did not speak. Unlike how normally he is alive and communicative, it was a scary change, but fortunately everything returned to normal after a few days," he describes. mother and adds: "A month and a half after the operation he had 1 seizure, but according to doctors it happens. Since then he has been without a seizure for 3 months."
This school year, Honza will graduate, in addition to sports, he enjoys languages and has started cooperating with Company E, with which he travels around schools to discuss epilepsy. Honza is not yet fully engaged in sports activities, he is starting to return to sports gradually. "I'm learning how to play sports properly, how to breathe well so that I don't expose my body to sudden stress, which is quite a problem with my competitive nature," explains Honza.
This year, therefore, they will not yet actively participate in the traditional EPPI boating triathlon, where patients with epilepsy and healthy athletes meet and which takes place this weekend on September 28, 2019 at Veselská pískovna. But maybe next year.

Not just for better water retention.
Environmental activists protested in Prague
According to the organizers, the current steps of the government in the issues of protection and recovery of the Czech landscape and the solution to the climate crisis are insufficient, the speakers called on the state to take a more drastic approach.
The event called The Last Drop was attended by representatives of large organizations such as the Rainbow Movement, Greenpeace or the Green Party, as well as smaller local associations.
"For example, we have people here who have been opposed to expansion at the Turów mine for a long time, there are people who are opposing gravel mining at Uherský Ostroh, there are people who are opposing the construction of meaningless dams," said Marika Volfová on behalf of the organizers.
She said the main demands of the protesters were the creation of a plan for water retention in the landscape, a drastic change in agricultural policy and a system of subsidies to support sustainable agriculture and the fastest possible transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.
"The government has to defend the interests of the people, not the ruthless and devastating business," she said.
A stand with a petition was placed on Malostranské náměstí calling on the representatives of the Czech state to work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and restore Czech soil and landscape.
The people present were equipped with banners with slogans such as "The end of the rapeseed soup" or "Less coal, more newts".
Jan Škoda from the For Water for People association came to Prague from South Moravia to protest against the plan to extract gravel in the Hodonín region.
"It threatens a source of drinking water for 140,000 people," he said.
He added that wells represent the fifth most abundant source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
According to him, the planned gravel mining is located only about 500 meters from the wells, and according to assessments, it is certain that the water quality will be endangered.
Vojtěch Veselý came from the village of Valeč in the Karlovy Vary region on behalf of the so-called agroecological farmers.
He pointed out the advantages of small farms, which do not pursue income and profit and supply the inhabitants on the spot.
"Small agroecological farms are able to feed the entire population in a completely normal way, and on top of that they will not do such a ruin on the shape of the countryside and the environment," he said.
Kovosvit sells an office building and other halls. He expects worse times
Due to restructuring, Kovosvit ended last year with a consolidated loss of 100 million crowns, consolidated turnover was 1.3 billion. Last year's main problems include Kuchař's lack of staff and shifts in subcontractors. This year, the demand for machine tools fell, by 10 to 20 percent year on year. "Related to this is the expected decline in turnover of the order of ten percent," said the CEO. In 2017, Kovosvit had revenues of 1.3 billion crowns and a profit after tax of 40.1 million. The loss for 2016 was 719 million.
Kovosvit now offers for sale several properties, halls and land, which it either does not use or only minimally. This also applies to the administrative building, where it uses two of the five floors, and not yet completely. "Part of the long-term restructuring plan is to streamline Kovosvit, streamline its operations. The sale of assets is not part of any current solution, such as cash flow, but part of a long-term plan where we want to devote all resources to investment development," said the CEO.
Kovosvit exports about half of its production. Its standard markets are the EU and Russia, to a lesser extent Asia last year. This year, Kuchař ranks among the most interesting in India, where Kovosvit won an order for machines enabling five-axis machining worth 100 million crowns. This year, the company also exported two five-axis machines for 30 million crowns to China. "Another order in the same volume is being negotiated, which we would like to fulfill by the end of the year," Kuchař said. In the Russian market and elsewhere, Kovosvit is facing restrictions due to sanctions.
Last year, the company sold two five-axis machining centers to France, a company that is a subcontractor of Airbus. In May this year, it delivered another machine, another one should be delivered at the end of the year or the beginning of 2020.
The main corporate investment this year was the transition of heating from steam to hot water for 20 million crowns. Kovosvit employs 500 people, the average working wage is 28,500 crowns. The company is looking for casting grinders for the foundry, machine tools, lathes and electricians.
The company has been owned since September 2016 by industrialist and armourer Jaroslav Strnad. The company has a tradition in the production of machine tools. It was founded in 1939 by Tomáš Baťa. The company once had up to three thousand employees.
Three people died in a plane crash on a house in Germany
Three people died and two others were injured in an ultralight plane crashing into an apartment building in West Germany.
The local rescue services informed about it, according to which there are probably two crew members and one inhabitant of the house among the dead.
The plane crashed on the roof of a building in the town of Wesel in North Rhine-Westphalia.
The attic apartment, which was one of the five residential units in the house, was subsequently engulfed in fire.
Firefighters have already managed to bring the flames under control.
Deputy Commander of the local fire brigade Robert Meyboom said that both members of the plane's crew had probably died.
According to the police, the third victim is a woman who lived in the house.
The daily Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ) wrote, referring to the mayor of Wesel, that she was a single mother whose two-year-old daughter was rescued from the apartment with minor injuries.
An emergency parachute was found near the accident, which apparently served as a landing brake.
The police assume that he comes from a crashed plane.
There was room for two people in the plane.
The machine took off from the airport in the nearby town of Marl.
The Rheinische Post reported, referring to eyewitnesses, that the plane collided with a hot air balloon before crashing.
However, this information has not yet been confirmed.
Referring to other witnesses, WAZ wrote that the plane crashed in the air before hitting the ground.
Accident on D5: A motorway crash closed the highway
The event was reported around 08:00 at the 22nd kilometer in the direction of Prague. "The highway is closed, at least for freight transport. Cars can go through petrol," said police spokeswoman Michaela Richterová in the morning. The operation was resumed around 2:30 p.m. According to Richter, the preliminary damage is at least two million crowns, and the police are investigating the cause of the accident.
A spokesman for the Central Bohemian fire brigade, Petr Svoboda, stated that one truck was transporting passenger cars and the other plastic granulate. "Due to the large impact, the transported vehicles were shifted, which the firefighters first had to secure against a possible fall," he added.
One of the cars had a damaged fuel tank, from which about 200 liters of diesel leaked. Another 200 liters were drained by firefighters. Employees of the Department of the Environment of Beroun Town Hall were called to the accident due to fuel leaks. The rescue of crashed vehicles and the passage of the highway was provided by a private company, which also extracted contaminated soil.
Microplasts reached the human gut, the study confirmed for the first time
Scientists have been confirmed for several years. A team led by Professor Philipp Schwabl, a professor at the University of Vienna, published a study that for the first time proves the presence of microplastics in human stool. Although the study is small, with eight participants from Europe, Japan and Russia - however, in the samples of all subjects, small particles of plastic with dimensions between 50 and 500 micrometers were found. None of the eight subjects were vegetarians, six of them did not avoid sea fish, all drank water from plastic bottles and food packed in plastic.
And it would actually be a bit of a miracle if nothing was found. We already know that microplastics - which are either produced directly, for example for the cosmetics industry, or are formed by the disintegration of larger pieces - are present in marine animals, insects, tap water and lemonades; in short, everywhere on the planet. Thus, their entry into the human digestive tract has only been officially confirmed. There were about 20 microplast particles per ten grams of stool, and scientists estimate that more than half of the world's population will have them.
Lay and scientific awareness, of course, suspects that it is not good. However, humanity still does not know how bad it is - and what effect microplastics have on "host" organisms. Small particles can enter the bloodstream or lymphatic system and end up in the liver, for example. "This is the first study of its kind to confirm what we have thought for a long time. Now that we have the first evidence of microplastics in the human body, we must continue to investigate what exactly this means for human health," says Schwabl.
So far, it is known that microplastics in the intestines can negatively affect the immune reactions of the digestive system, and thus facilitate the absorption of toxic chemicals and other pathogens into the body. And so far no other known solution is to limit the use of plastics, especially polypropylene. However, this will be difficult - the first task facing governments and authorities will at least stop its sharp rise. As for plastic bottles alone, experts estimate that in three years, humanity will consume a fifth more than they do today. The current rate is captivating one million bottles bought per minute. About eight million tons of plastic end up in the seas and oceans every year. Waste threatens marine ecosystems and infects the digestive systems of marine animals.
Some states have already adopted restrictions and other measures, for example, Kenya has banned plastic bags under the threat of draconian penalties. The European Commission is considering minor bans (well-known straws), and the domestic Ministry of the Environment is heading in the same direction. However, critics claim that such measures are nice, but completely inadequate.
The repair of the Krkonoše Museum will be a year late
The administration of the Krkonoše National Park (KRNAP) postponed by three weeks the deadline for submitting bids to the second tender for the repair of the Krkonoše Museum in Vrchlabí. The original date for opening the envelopes was September 20, said national park spokesman Radek Drahný. The reason for postponing the deadline for submission of bids is the reduction of the budget from 110 million crowns to 83 million crowns.
"We are currently working with prices that are on the market. There has been a change in the budget, this is the price we expect to be offered. If someone submits an offer that will be acceptable, then the work will start as soon as possible," said Drahný .
Compared to the original plans, the start of repairs to the museum is about a year late. KRNAP wanted to have a selected supplier of the construction part by the end of last year and to start construction work this spring. According to the management of the national park administration, European subsidies of 123 million crowns for the project are not endangered.
The KRNAP administration is unable to select a construction company for the museum's repairs. The second competition was announced this summer, because in the previous tender all the companies' offers significantly exceeded the then estimated price of 65 million. The bids exceeded 100 million crowns.
The museum, which is housed in a former Augustinian monastery and belongs to the KRNAP Administration, has been closed since autumn 2017. The selected company should provide the construction part of the project. The total costs, including the construction of a new exhibition, are estimated at 210 million crowns. The KRNAP visitor center should be established in the now vacated building by the end of 2021 after the transformation of the expositions.
The renovated museum with a new interactive exhibition, which should be a story of nature and people settled in the mountains and build on the successful exhibition Stone and Life, should serve as a representative entrance gate for the Giant Mountains. The visitor center should provide information about the past and present of the Giant Mountains in the most understandable form possible and motivate people to discover the mountains and protect them. It should also take on the role of a traditional museum. The center will also offer opportunities for concerts, festivals, theater performances or open-air lectures. The plans are to build a new entrance to the building, create a research room or cafe.
On Saturday, Česká spořitelna incorrectly charged some card payments twice.
She has already fixed the error
On Saturday afternoon, Česká spořitelna incorrectly charged some card payments to its clients twice.
According to bank spokesman Lukáš Kropík, the problem could have affected thousands of transactions.
The savings bank has already eliminated the error and returned the money to the clients.
The savings bank noted problems with double billing of card payments on Saturday afternoon.
"Last night (Saturday) we updated the system and immediately returned all these duplicate payments to clients.
At the moment, everything works without problems, "said Kropík on Sunday afternoon.
The exact number of clients to whom the bank deducted money from card payments twice is not known to the bank's spokesman, according to his estimate it was lower than thousands of transactions.
The savings bank is investigating the causes of the problems.
"It could have been a combination of several factors," Kropík said.
Česká spořitelna is the largest bank in the Czech Republic in terms of the number of clients.
At the end of March, it had 4.6 million.
The savings bank is owned by the Austrian financial group Erste Group Bank, which is a key player in the banking market of Central and Eastern Europe.
On Monday, Vojtěch will present a system of three emergency levels against coronavirus
"Degrees will be according to the strength of community dissemination at the regional level.
We are working on it together with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics, "Vojtěch told ČT.
It will be a so-called traffic light, individual regions will be marked in green, orange or red according to the risk of coronavirus.
The minister added that he would still talk to epidemiologists about the inclusion of individual regions.
He admitted that currently only the Moravian-Silesian Region would have an orange color and that Prague would be approaching it.
The map will also include individual measures for regional hygiene stations, hospitals, sanitary facilities and employers.
"We want to solve it at the level of regions, because the situation in them is not uniform," said Vojtěch.
"A terrifying result of the study." Islam does not belong in the West, the vast majority of Austrians think
1200 respondents were interviewed, the survey shows considerable distrust of Islam in Austrian society.
Nearly 60 percent of Austria's population fear that some Muslims are terrorists, and 48 percent would call for a ban on mosques. 80 percent of respondents are in favor of more observation of Islamic centers.
Most Austrians also want Muslims to be restricted in their religious practices, arguing that because of the presence of Muslims, they sometimes feel foreign in their own country.
"The result of the study is frightening," says study author Wolfgang Aschauer, adding: "Such a tendency towards ethnocentrism could eventually lead to the adoption of discriminatory attitudes. There is a risk that the religious freedoms granted to Muslims will narrow."
For believers, the critical attitude is less pronounced. Aschauer argues that in Austria this is not a conflict between religions, but between cultures. According to the sociologist, dialogue and education could help blunt polarization.
According to the study, extreme right-wing voters, people without a university degree or seniors over the age of 75 have the most hostile attitudes towards Muslims. On the other hand, the most friendly are the Green voters, people under the age of 30 and university students.
According to estimates by the Austrian Ministry of the Interior, approximately 700,000 Muslims live in Austria, which has a population of around 8.7 million. The vast majority have Turkish roots. There are more than 400 Muslim prayer houses and mosques in the country, and Islam has been officially recognized as a religion since 1912.
Which cities will disappear under the sea?
A vote by the upper house of the Canadian parliament has confirmed a rumor for several days now: Canada is depriving honorary citizenship of the former human rights legend, Nobel Peace Prize winner Do Aung San Suu Kyi. The current leader of Myanmar (Burma), who spent years under house arrest in an effort to bring freedom to her country, lost her honorary title because of her part in the genocide against the Rohingya minority.
The decision to take Suu Kyi's honorary citizenship was approved a week ago by the lower legislature, and the senators have now unanimously supported it. "This is the right message for her, for Myanmar and for the whole world," commented the decision of her colleagues by Independent Senator Ratna Omidvar. "We must make it clear that the accomplices to the genocide are not welcome here in Canada - all the more so as honorary citizens."
Technically, the verdict of the Canadian parliament does not change anything for Suu Kyi, it is just an honorary title, but on a symbolic level it is a strong message for her. The silence of a long-time human rights activist against the atrocities perpetrated by the army of mostly Buddhist Myanmar on endless months for the Rohingya Muslim minority is unbearable.
The fact that there is an officially organized genocide in Myanmar and that Suu Kyi - the de facto prime minister of the local government - has completely failed in its duty to protect its citizens, a UN report recently said. In particular, it mentions the names of several army commanders who, according to the investigation team, should stand trial for crimes against humanity committed in actions which, as the report says, "shock both with the horror of their actions and the enormous scale". According to the United Nations, Suu Kyi and its leadership committed complicity mainly by covering up the actions of soldiers and releasing a fog of lies around them - for example, that it was an "anti-terrorist operation".
After the deletion of Suu Kyi, five personalities remain on the list of honorary citizens of Canada: Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, Nelson Mandela, Tenzin Gyamtso, the 14th Dalai Lama, Karim Aga Khan IV, the 49th Imam of Shiite Muslims and Malala Yousufzai.
Developments around the former icon of the struggle for freedom and democracy were also reflected in the Canadian Museum of Human Rights, where information about atrocities against the Rohings and the parliamentary decision to take her the title of honorary citizen were added to Suu Kyi's profile. "We have also dimmed the brightening of her photo on a human rights timeline board and are considering replacing her face with a portrait of a member of the Rohingya minority," Museum spokesman Rorie McLeod was quoted as saying by Canadian media.
The only thing that will remain so in the current upheavals of Suu Kyi - at least for now - is the Nobel Peace Prize, awarded to her at the suggestion of Václav Havel in 1991 for a huge contribution to the struggle for democracy. "While Ms. Suu Kyi's current actions are regrettable, her award will not be overturned," said Nobel Foundation chief Lars Heikensten of Canada's CBS.

Technology companies want to rule our cities
Francis Fukuyama's history is somewhat baked. In 1992, at the height of the wave of liberalism that followed the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Iron Curtain, this political scientist wrote in his most famous book, The End of History and the Last Man: the universal acceptance of Western liberal democracy as the final form of government. "
Twenty-six years later, we are witnessing more illiberal models from the United States to Russia, from Turkey to Poland, and from Hungary to Italy, and various forms of nationalism and radicalism thrive. Fukuyama's current ninth book, Identity: The Demand for Dignity and the Politics of Resentment, attempts to cope with the rise of these forces. As his interview with George Eaton shows for the New Statesman, he reconsiders many of his former views: he argues that the ideas of socialism should return to public space, and Marx was right in many ways. At the same time, he insists that his mental development is still in line with the position of the 1990s, and that critics have not understood the end of history and the last man correctly.
"What I said then was that one of the problems of modern democracy is that while it provides peace and prosperity, people want more than that ... Liberal democracy does not even try to define what the good life is. It leaves it they do not see the point in individuals who feel alienated and therefore group themselves into identity groups that give them a sense of belonging. "
At the time, the book The End of History and the Last Man was written as a strong argument against Marxists who saw communism as the final stage of history. When asked about how he now perceives the rise of socialists in Britain and the United States, Fukuyama replies: "It all depends on what you mean by socialism. If we are talking about ownership of the means of production, then except when clear services to the public are in demand, I don't think it will work, but if you mean redistribution programs that are trying to solve the huge income and wealth imbalances we're already witnessing, then yes, I don't just think he could come back, he should come back. the period started by President Reagan and Prime Minister Thatcher, in which certain types of ideas on the benefits of an unregulated market were discussed, had a catastrophic effect in many ways. "
In the end, Fukuyama is trying to calm the current situation and warns all liberals that even the advent of new, not entirely democratic regimes will not mean the end of history.
Civilization in the best time
Recently, I remembered a beautiful "message" from one of Šimek's great stories with Grossmann, which takes place partly in the cemetery, which reads as follows: "I warned her that she was crying well, but on a foreign grave!" It occurred to me that many of the world's politicians now engaged in a senseless fight against climate change are behaving very similarly now.
They act as if people are ruling the planet Earth. In fact, we are just a speck on her surface that she can blow away with her giant forces like a gust of wind, the flame of a candle. Probably few of them look at the famous British and American science documents dealing with the destructive abilities of our blue ball. After all, it would be enough for some of the larger active volcanoes to "slip" properly and our advanced civilization will regret it.
And it is highly likely that this will happen in the near future. According to leading volcanologists, many large volcanoes are "charged and unlocked" (for example, Katla in Iceland).
In a way, it would be ideal if the eruption, if it had to happen once, happened as soon as possible. Even before trillions of dollars are completely wasted on measures to reduce carbon dioxide production, because any really angry volcano, along with dust and poisonous volcanic gases, can release it into the atmosphere at least a hundred times more than has been saved at the expense of Europe's population.
Thus, there is no point in forcibly reducing CO2 production. In addition, it has been scientifically proven that with its significantly higher proportion in the air, plants form more biological matter and are also more resistant to drought. For humanity, possible warming is much more favorable than, for example, the rapid return of the ice age.
If we realize the hitherto insufficiently researched effect of solar cycles on the Earth's climate, we must come to only one reasonable conclusion: Let us strive to keep the Earth as clean as possible, and let us adapt to other changes with which we cannot compete with the least possible costs!
Vodník and Karolínka
When the waterman Jonas and the miller's daughter Karolínka peek into each other, it's not easy at all.
Jonas is loved in love by his father, the clumsy waterman Hastrbuch, Karolínka has no idea that her dear Jonas is not human.
There is still a young man Libor, who will do everything to protect the whole village, and especially Karolínka, from the water villain.
What about intriguing and lying?
Especially when she can get Karolínka to reject Jonáš and give preference to him, the brave Libor.
It soon becomes clear to everyone in the village who can blame the drowning of the midnight Teapot, rotten flour, the fire of the mill and other thieves.
Angry villagers organize a hunt for a waterman, and an irreconcilable watery curse falls on Jonas's head.
And now please Konviček's soulmother Karolína!
How to soften old Hastrbuch, convince neighbors of Jonah's innocence, find Jonah, and free him from the curse?
The fairy tale was filmed in September 2010 in the studios of the Czech Television and in the exteriors by the Brzina pond, in Obděnice in the Sedlčany region and in the beautiful surroundings of the historic mill in Hoslovice.
Kristýna Plíšková did not make it to the finals, she is still missing the second title
The plush environment in Tashkent testified, in 2016 she won her first tournament on the WTA circuit and this year she was very confident.
After winning with Paolini, Kawa and Kužmová, she fought her way into the top four players.
But the match with Alison Van Uytvanck did not go well for Kristýna. The Belgian woman kept her serve and broke Plíšková's service twice in the first set. In the second set, Van Uytvanck soon took the lead 3: 0 and Kristýna did not succeed in the reversal, even though she finally managed to change one breakball. In the last, she averted one more match, but the other came to an end.

Purposeful slander? The Ústí Zoo is looking for a new veterinarian, no one is interested
Last at the end of this month. The city administration attributes this to the slander that erupted around the former director of the zoo and at the same time veterinarian Václav Poživil, that he purposefully killed the exotic animals he took care of. For example, it was a female rhino Zambu, an elephant Kalu or an orangutan Ňuňák.
The city council therefore announced a new contract. "For veterinary care for a zoo with an estimated value of 3.5 million crowns without VAT and for the city Center for Animals in Need with an estimated value of 2.8 million crowns without VAT," said city spokeswoman Romana Macová.
Deputy Mayor Věra Nechybová (UFO) explained that the city is announcing a competition for veterinary services for the third time. "Dr.
According to her, there are very few experts specializing in exotic animals. "It is definitely not pleasant. The zoo currently provides veterinary care in the form of orders," she said. Orders and a contract cost the same money. "But the garden must comply with the Public Procurement Act in terms of financing," explained zoo spokeswoman Nikola Roštejnská.
Václav Poživil himself is one of the recognized experts. For example, he took part in a unique operation in which the Ústí cheetah Jane was the first cheetah in the world to receive a total endoprosthesis. He held the position of zoo director from 2009 to 2012. He did not comment on anonymous slander against himself. He did not receive phone calls or respond to SMS text messages yesterday.
As for the contract for the zoo, some veterinarians think that the zero interest in it does not necessarily have to be worries about similar purposeful accusations as in his case, but simply little information. For example, the Ústí veterinarian Jiří Král has not heard of her yet. "I hear it from you for the first time. No one has contacted us. I think such a thing will spread quickly," he added.

Customers of the Most autodrome can use the new e-shop on its website.
He will also buy coupons for free and test rides by car or motorcycle on a large racing circuit, which was previously only possible in person at an autodrome employee in the starting tower.

At the same time, on this occasion, we have prepared a bonus for our customers in the form of a discount of CZK 1,000 for all safe driving courses from our offer.

For example, sports, safe or sports driving courses, training, experience programs, gift items, gift vouchers, activities for children and more, "the director named.

Plane crash near Žinkov in the Plzeň region: Two people did not survive the accident
There were two people on the plane, a man († 63) and a woman († 38). "At half past eight in the evening, the plane applied for permission to land at Chaloupky Airport near Klatovy," said police spokeswoman Dana Ladmanová. This was also the last record, at that time according to GPS coordinates it was supposed to be located near Vojovice near Žinkov.
However, it did not reach Klatovy Airport anymore. The lost plane, which sent out an emergency signal, was immediately searched. "In addition to the police, a military helicopter also took part," said police spokeswoman Martina Korandová. But the search operation did not have a happy ending.
In the forest near Petrovice near Měčín, which is about six kilometers from the place where the plane last reported, the helicopter crew noticed the wreckage before nine o'clock in the morning. "We found a plane and two bodies with no signs of life," Korand confirmed.
The crashed machine remained partially wedged in the branches of trees, the pieces fell to the ground in the vicinity. "We will find out the cause of the accident in cooperation with experts and employees of the Institute for the Professional Investigation of the Causes of Aircraft Accidents," Korandová added.
The course of the disease of the majority is mild, only three percent of those infected need to go to the hospital
Either a milder form of coronavirus is spreading through the Czech Republic, or the summer dose of sunshine significantly improved our immunity.
Hospital infection departments are half-empty, although infection numbers are rising.
"The situation today and in April is completely different and it is mainly due to the number of hospitalized," confirms the Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch.
It is worth remembering that on April 11, when the first wave of the epidemic culminated in our country, everyone wore drapes, the army took samples, the republic was closed and the Czechs used up disinfection for a year ahead.
Yet ten people died a day.
Now the daily increases in the number of people infected are higher, but a maximum of two people die every day with covid-19.
The Karviná region still has the highest number of people infected, Jihlava already has similar numbers due to the outbreak in the local Alzheimer's Center, where 57 people are already infected - 40 clients and 17 employees.
Another home for the elderly was closed by a hygienist in Černožice in the Hradec Králové region.
The disease was confirmed by tests at one of the nurses.
"We are tracing, we have restricted movement, we have all the hygienic measures," says Martin Scháněl, director of the retirement home.
According to him, none of the clients of the home yet have symptoms of the disease.
The hygienists will start the area testing tomorrow and then decide on further measures.
Hospitals are also responding to the increased number of infections.
The Institute of Oncology in Brno today launched an automatic camera system at the entrance, which recognizes whether people are wearing a veil at the entrance.
The record is reported by South Bohemian hygienists, who recorded twenty-five cases of coronavirus - most of them are foreign employees of the Prachatice company.
A total of 131 infections were added on Saturday - half of Friday's number - but less is tested at the weekend.
The only ones. We are not sure of reproduction, but we do not have to scare
Some words have unfortunate connotations, even if they only state the state of affairs. They include the word only one. Indicates a child growing up without siblings, but does not sound neutral. "You know, the only one," they say, without the need to add anything. Interestingly, this feature has been worn by the "only child" for a long time, even from times when terms such as the demographic crisis were not widely used.
Today, even people outside the scientific community know that a fertility rate of 2.1 children per woman is necessary to ensure simple reproduction of the population. It is also widely known that no state in Europe today achieves this value. France and Sweden are the closest to it, but European countries do not have a simple level of population reproduction. (Within the West, only Israel stands out with a total fertility rate of 3.1 children per woman.) This is a situation made for alarmism. That's why it's no wonder that the Minister of Labor and Social Affairs, Maláčová, also fails: "There are almost as many single women as there are two-child families," she told LN in an interview. But she forgot the devil hidden in detail.
Yes, it is good to point out a problem instead of downplaying or ideologizing it. For example, as in Germany, where the campaign for more children easily gets the label of fascism (in the style of "Hitler also supported it"). It is good to remember that many couples plan their only ones directly. It is good for politicians to show a willingness to remove the obstacles that lead to those decisions (for example, a slight increase in work from home discourages women from further pregnancies). But in spite of all this, let us point out one thing.
If Minister Maláčová says that "there are almost so many only ones", there is a drop in demagoguery. That statement was appropriate twenty years ago. Let us recall that fertility in the Czech Republic last ensured simple reproduction in 1980 ("Husák's children"). Then it fell to a terrible 1.14 in 2000. But since then it has risen by almost fifty percent, to the current 1.70 children per woman, which is above the European average. This is not enough for simple reproduction, so the activity of politicians is appropriate. Only with that alarmism can they take a little.
Neckermann cancels all flights, involving five hundred Czech clients
Neckermann cancels flights in connection with the insolvency of the British Thomas Cook and his German daughter.
"The Czech company Thomas Cook, sro, operating under the trade name Neckermann Cestovní kancelář, did not file an insolvency petition," Šrámek said in a press release.
"However, CK Neckermann is forced to continue to cancel the planned departures of its clients," he added, adding that this currently applies to all departures from September 26 to October 6.
According to Šrámek, the cancellation of flights will affect about 500 clients. According to him, the 800 Neckermann clients who are currently abroad "will be taken care of and their safe return to the Czech Republic by their planned flight will be ensured".
The travel agency admitted that some clients were asked to pay for their stay. "In such a case, it is necessary for clients to immediately contact the SOS line CK Neckermann," added Šrámek.
Thomas Cook crashed on Monday. In August of this year, the travel agency signed an agreement under which creditors were to invest £ 900 million in the company.
She was to receive half the amount from the Chinese company Fosun Tourism. Based on that, it was to become the majority owner. The other half was to be provided by bondholders and creditor banks. As early as September 20, however, information emerged that creditors had asked the travel agency to obtain a reserve of £ 200 million, otherwise the deal would fall. On Monday, the company announced that it had gone bankrupt.
Jaromír Soukup spoke about Gott: He mainly wants peace
Moderator and businessman Jaromír Soukup (50) is not afraid of any questions. In his program Call and Write to the Boss, he speaks publicly on various topics. And the tabloid cases, which he glosses with sparkling and humor, are no strangers to him. Although he didn't laugh this time.
Jaromír Soukup commented on the sad report, which is a very serious illness of Karel Gott. He promised the singer one very considerate thing for himself.
"You know, Karel got sick and said it fairly, without the tabloid journalists having to poke it somewhere. I don't want to comment on it, it's a serious illness, we all appreciate Karel Gott immensely. And of course I would like him a successful treatment and especially peace! The peace he needs now, "said TV owner Barrandov.
"I wish the media would let him be. And wait for the news that the Master himself decides to provide to the media. I don't like the different statements that his old acquaintances and various celebrities think about his health. And for I can tell our media that we will only address his illness and his person if he shows an interest in it. In my opinion, a similar approach should be considered by other media. "
Mahulena Bočanová interrupted the annual detox and is sinning again!
More than a year ago, Mahulena Bočanová confided to Bleska that she had cut with alcohol. "During the holidays, I thought I was going to give my old fifty-year-old body a breath. I took my time forever. I feel terribly rested, I have a lot of energy and, most importantly, my mentality has improved. he gets up, my head doesn't hurt, I have more energy, money. "
One year of abstinence was said to be enough and the actress again found her way to alcohol. "Sometimes I have bubbles or quality wine, but I don't drink what I used to. I'll have one glass and have fun until the morning. I have a bottle of wine in the fridge for maybe a week. I also enjoyed a non-alcoholic beer that I can drink at any time," she boasted. Mahulena, who is still a couple with Brno businessman Petr.
Bočanová has also returned to the theatrical season after the holidays and will be re-entering the series Surgery in the Rose Garden. "I'm ashamed of the first two performances, I was really bad, I was arguing. But it's getting better," the actress smiles critically.
The pair wrapped the bitch with tape and drowned in the river, the children found the bag
The case took place at the end of July in the village around Valašské Klobouky. The 27-year-old woman brought home a donated dog one to two years old, which she wanted to take care of. However, her ten-year-old partner did not like the fact that she was a bitch, so he decided to get rid of her.
"He wrapped the animal in duct tape and rope and greatly eliminated its vocal expression. He placed the dog in a jute bag, which he tied. Then they took the animal together to the river, where they threw it in a bag. said Zlín police spokeswoman Monika Kozumplíková.
The next day, the children playing by the river found a jute bag on the bank. When they opened it, they found the body of a dead dog inside. So they called to the woman who was passing by and ran away. The woman reported the incident to the police emergency call line 158.
"Thanks to the knowledge of the town's inhabitants, the police found out who was probably the perpetrator of this incredible act. And they were not wrong. Both the man and the woman confessed to the act and described how the incident took place," a police spokeswoman added.
Expert opinion from the field of veterinary medicine confirmed that the dog died in a clearly torturous way as a result of suffocation, when the animal suffered for several minutes before death.
"The conduct of the perpetrators undoubtedly shows a clear intention to get rid of the animal at all costs in this reprehensible way, even if they could donate or sell the dog. sentenced to spend up to three years behind bars, "Kozumplíková remarked.
Declaration of the end of the right in the Chamber of Deputies or How the "right-wing" coalition of ODS, TOP 09, STAN and KDU?
There have been recent reports in the media and comments about the upcoming coalition of these parties. Many applaud that the "right" is finally coming together, but I rather wonder why these parties still call themselves right-wing.
Leaving aside the new Tricolor movement, the Czech Chamber of Deputies no longer has a real right-wing party. And it doesn't matter how the subjects label themselves or what the label streams to the mainstream media. The ODS is hardly central in its average of the top politicians of this party, TOP 09 is clearly a party of the city's pseudoliberal left (which is ashamed of its leftism, and so is hypocritically referred to as conservative or even right-wing). STAN is a party that basically coincides with TOP 09 in its conception, ideology and electoral targeting (the reason for its existence is simply not clear to me). And KDU has even labeled itself as a centerpiece for a long time - but their political compass is much more to the left than they say.
Do you feel like I've taken them all out of one water? No, I am based on the real political steps of these parties. If I consider myself a classically liberal right-wing voter, the highest value for me is the freedom of the individual, the free market and minimal state intervention in the lives of individuals and the economy. How do these parties fulfill this general presumption of rightness? How many laws slashing people's freedoms by the salami method, raising taxes, confirming new regulations and growing surveillance, increasing the link to the socialist EU or promoting environmental and gender madness have supported it in recent years? A lot, a lot. Not custom stickers, but actions identify them. These parties, despite all sorts of declarations or partial concessions, want to strengthen the role of the state in our lives. And that has nothing to do with right-wingness.
I would not be surprised at all by the coalition cooperation between TOP 09, STAN and KDU; However, the ODS has long been portrayed as "the only right-wing" and, by merging with these three entities, it already reveals its true political position.
By the way, when I mentioned those stickers briefly. Have you noticed how often all these parties identically and cheaply label critics of dirigisme and socialism coming from the European Union as pro-Russian agents? Can't or just don't want to understand that there are many people who don't smell Eurosocialism and growing lack of freedom as strongly as the authoritarian regime in Russia? Do they not by any chance hide their utterly arguable incompetence and the unreasonable or blind adoration of Euro-EU conditions?
In short, it is possible that in the Czech Republic, non-central politics no longer have a chance of greater success. Maybe voters really want that kind of connection. Maybe they want a center-left policy under the guise of the "right," because they are ashamed (or can't even identify) of their political beliefs. I don't know. But I am definitely not one of those voters.
Debutant champion!
Van den Bergh finished the fairy tale, swept Anderson
The big surprise of the tournament, Dimitri van den Bergh, showed an excellent performance even in the duel with the player who won the second most prestigious event in the PDC in 2018.
The start of the match was evenly balanced, the break came at 8: 7 for the Belgian darts.
Van den Bergh took a break with a 13-arrow leg and has been on top ever since.
He literally crushed his opponent with his game and the much more experienced "Flying Cattle" had a hard time getting to the doubles.
The way in which the "Dream Maker" had him in hand is also evidenced by the fact that the thrown Anderson played his first maximum only in the 24th leg.
In addition, the young Belgian handled great high checkouts.
The last time he lost in the eleventh leg, but in an unfavorable condition, he "caught a big fish" and closed 170.
At the end of the match, Anderson was very frustrated.
He just threw the darts and his opponent, who was walking behind the triumph, acted with absolute sovereignty.
Van den Bergh turned the first of three match darts and got his name - he wrote his big dream.
Winning a trophy named after Phil Taylor is all the more valuable for the Belgian arrow dancer because it is his first major won.
It is still true that the last player to beat van den Bergh is Karel Sedláček.
In the memorial to the victims of terror, Babiš called for security cooperation
On September 27, 2019, Prime Minister Andrej Babiš and his wife Monika visited Ground Zero to commemorate the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.
Terrorism is the main enemy that all countries in the world should fight together. At the end of his five-day visit to the United States, the Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš announced this today at the New York Memorial to the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001. On this occasion, the Prime Minister honored the memory of two victims of Czech origin.
"It is a very moving place," said the prime minister when, accompanied by his wife Monika, he placed a white rose next to Lukáš Rambousek and the Czechoslovak emigrant Alena Sešínová. Both were among more than 2,750 dead who were attacked by a hijacked plane on a former pair of World Trade Center (WTC) skyscrapers. The WTC towers collapsed after the crash, in their place is now a memorial with a list of victims.
"It is necessary to remember what happened here, the horror," Babiš said. The Prime Minister identified the attack on the USA on September 11 as the reason why the UN should cooperate in a united campaign against international terrorism. At that time, in addition to destroying the WTC skyscrapers, the terrorists crashed into the building of the Ministry of Defense in Washington and planned another strike on a target in Washington, probably the White House or Congress. However, this plane crashed when passengers confronted the hijackers.
"This is our main enemy, there all the countries of the world should unite and fight international terrorism in a coordinated way," the Czech Prime Minister added.

Czechs in Europe by Ondřej Houska: Should Czechoslovakia reject the Munich Agreement in 1938 and go to war with Germany? NO three times
The undated film depicts Adolf Hitler visiting the Czechoslovak border fortifications. The task of the forts was never to stop the German army, but to slow down its progress before the Allies joined.
If, almost exactly 81 years ago, Czechoslovakia rejected the Munich Agreement and subsequently faced a German attack, what would exclude most Czechoslovak soldiers from the fight? German tanks, air force, or perhaps artillery? Quite possibly it would not be any of these weapons, even though the Germans had an overwhelming advantage over the Czechoslovaks. The Czechoslovak army would probably suffer the greatest losses - due to blisters.
In Nantes charges were made for a fire in the cathedral, the man confessed
The Cathedral of Saint Peter and Paul in the heart of Nantes started burning last Saturday and the fire seriously damaged the original 16th century stained glass windows and destroyed the organ.
Investigators were suspected of arson because the fire was advancing through the temple from three different locations.
At the same time, the police found no signs of anyone entering the cathedral by force at the entrances.
The accused is a volunteer at the local diocese, a 39-year-old Rwandan refugee.
Police arrested him shortly after the fire, but then released him without prosecuting him.
Now, the prosecutor's office has reported that, based on new evidence, the man was arrested again on Saturday, confessed and faced charges of arson.
If found guilty, he faces up to ten years in prison and a large fine.
According to his lawyer, the man regrets the crime and decided to cooperate fully with the investigators, Le Monde wrote.
Zeman Monumentist - A man stretching the constitution calls for law enforcement
Those who move in a camp-divided society and do not want to go completely crazy will welcome a situation where they do not have to cheer only for their own. When he can admit pluses to someone he criticizes otherwise. Just so that he doesn't feel that he or she is orientating himself only according to pre-assigned stickers. Such situations include a list of severely damaged monuments that President Zeman is fencing on during his favorite trips to the regions.
Everyone knows what's going on. And whoever occasionally travels through the Czech Republic, he sees many of those devastated monuments - from the centers of historic towns to individual castles, monasteries, old houses, churches or estates - with his own eyes. Everyone suspects that the word demagoguery can come up here as well. That if we blame the town hall for not taking care of monuments or some horror in the zoning plan, it may be the work of former administrations. Or a privatized building whose owner is not traceable. The head of state local politician calls: "Section of the Monument Act allows you to fine the owners of buildings who do not care about their property." But even if the owner is untouchable, it must be admitted that the president calls for law enforcement. Which even critics of his bending of the constitution should recognize as a plus.
Of course, Milos Zeman would not be Milos Zeman if he considered all the details and formalities of a complex problem. But he stands for a good cause, similar to squatters, which he does not recognize himself. Two years ago, we wrote: "Despite all the insults, the squatters point out a problem that is outside the current interest. That this or that building is in a state of disrepair." And let's admit that the president does the de facto same thing.
If you come to the historic center of Jáchymov, you will be amazed at how devastated it is - including houses with Renaissance cores. At a time when Jáchymov is celebrating 500 years of silver mining and tolar minting (dollars for Americans). Why? It is said that due to the rapid fermentation of houses in the 1990s, local officials say. But why is it that the seven kilometers distant Ostrov, the seat of the Šliks who minted the Jáchymov tolars, has its historical core nicely repaired? It is good for the President to draw attention to these matters.
Vojtěch: On Monday we will present a "traffic light" for epidemiological measures
The new system is to play the role of a pandemic plan, the absence of which is facing criticism from the government and the Ministry of Health.
"The degrees will be according to the strength of community spread," the minister explained.
He added that at present, for example, the Moravian-Silesian Region or Prague would reach a medium, orange level.
The system is designed as regional, because the situation in individual regions differs significantly, he added.
The ministry cooperated on the system with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (ÚZIS).
According to the Minister, specific measures will be linked to the individual levels, whether it is the obligation to wear veils or the organization of special wards in hospitals.
The Minister of the Interior, Jan Hamáček (ČSSD), called for the creation of an epidemiological plan on the Prima Partie television program, according to which people should have clear information about what measures they can expect if the epidemiological situation worsens.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has been growing in recent days, although the number of hospitalized remains low.
Vojtěch commented on the fact that nothing fundamental is happening, it is not appropriate to talk about declaring a state of emergency or reconvening the crisis staff.
With regard to the growing number of people infected from Saturday throughout the Czech Republic, the government has again introduced the obligation to wear veils at internal events for more than 100 people.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be limited to 500 people, now it is 1000 people.
The government's approach, when it was not clear until the last moment what measures and when they will come into force or when they will be announced, has been criticized.
"I think that in a situation that is relatively tense, the main actors should, on the contrary, create a feeling of security and, on the contrary, straighten out the confusion," said Senator Marek Hilšer in Questions.
Measures may already vary by region, for example in Prague, from Sunday onwards, the obligation to wear veils also applies in non-residential medical facilities, such as pharmacies or doctor's waiting rooms.
The obligation to wear veils when visiting medical and social facilities or pharmacies has also been introduced in the Liberec and Ústí nad Labem regions since Friday.
In the Vysočina region in the Jihlava region, it is necessary to wear veils in indoor public spaces, in public transport and in medical facilities from 14 July.
On the contrary, anti-epidemic measures have been relaxed in the Moravian-Silesian Region, as well as in the Central Bohemian Region in the Kutná Hora Region.
At the beginning of June, the Czech government also approved the so-called traffic light for Europe, which differentiates the level of risk of infection in individual European countries and adjusts the rules applicable to entry into the Czech Republic from these countries accordingly.
In countries with low and medium risk, the authorities do not require a negative coronavirus test for Czech citizens from 15 June or order quarantine instead.
These are mandatory when Czechs return from high-risk countries.
At the moment, all EU member states are now in the low risk category.
Costa Rica is a champion in the fight against climate change
Costa Rica received the title for several reasons. To begin with, the plan to be carbon neutral by 2050 - however, many countries have committed to this under the Paris Agreement. The Central American state, with a population of about five million, produces only 0.4 percent of the world's emissions. Costa Rica has also committed to a full switch to renewable energy by 2030, with 70 percent of buses or taxis expected to run on electricity.
The official tourism organization states that about 95 percent of energy already comes from renewable sources - in 2017, Costa Rica operated on them for a total of 300 days.
Costa Rica boasts almost thirty national parks.
The density of afforestation also contributes to the reduction of emissions. Rainforests with diverse fauna and flora, which cover more than half of the country, are also one of the main tourist attractions. "Costa Rica is a pioneer in nature conservation and sets an example for other countries in the region, but also around the world. Climate change requires urgent action from all of us," the UN said in a statement.
Costa Rica boasts almost thirty national parks, which is really a lot due to the small area of the country (51,100 square kilometers). Rainforests or fog forests, coral reefs or mangrove swamps are home to five percent of the world's biodiversity. The country also has volcanoes, picturesque waterfalls and you would also find several rescue stations for sloths.
Gentle on the planet. The Night of Scientists begins in Prague
"In Prague, I would definitely visit the Czech Technical University and look at a model of what smart cities will look like. At Charles University, I would visit the Department of Anatomy at the Faculty of Medicine, which is not open to the public at other times," advises the national coordinator of the Night of Scientists.
The Department of Anatomy offers a tour of the autopsy room and the opportunity to try working with surgical instruments.
"Then I would go to the CULS and watch the film Green Desert," adds Navrátilová. Guided tours will also be offered by nine laboratories. The motto of this year's Night of Scientists is "kind to the planet".
Wife change: Ondra's parents were cruelly abused! He ended up in an institution
It was about nerves. The allegedly problematic son Ondřej (9) was severely punished by his father at any moment. "He came from school and lied about a snack. Lukáš looked at me and said that he would kneel as a punishment," Lucie described in the Exchange. Dad Lukáš forced little Ondra to kneel in the corner for several hours! In addition to the cameras, he allegedly had to suffer like this on a wooden foot massage! "Ondřej came to me after the filming and told me - aunt, I'm making the trouble and remarks just so I wouldn't be here because I want to go to the institute," Lucie described the moment when she fully understood what was going on outside the studio door. And the boy's wish finally came true ...
His condition was so serious that he was taken away from his family after filming and placed for a month in the Center for Educational Care in České Budějovice. He returned to his father and surrogate mother Aneta (28) for a short time, but then traveled to a diagnostic institute for problem children. "When I came home, Aneta immediately added me on Facebook, we wrote for a while. She was most interested in whether we got the money. I almost didn't react to it at all. But then she wrote me that the little one was in the institute, that then they returned him, now he is in the diagnostic school. They are both out of work, "says mother Lucie from Plzeň.
Of course, the lightning addressed the other side as well, but received only a vague answer. "I'm not in the mood, I'm sick, call later," Aneta said, hanging up.
Přindiš, Prskavec and Fišerová advanced safely to the semifinals of the World Championships
Kayakers Vít Přindiš and Jiří Prskavec and canoeist Tereza Fišerová advanced safely to the semifinals of the World Water Slalom Championships in Seu d'Urgell. Přindiš was fourth in Friday's qualification, Prskavec fifth and Fišerová eighth. The other three Czech representatives will strive for a semi-final start in Spain in the afternoon corrective qualifying race.
Vavřinec Hradilek did not succeed from the strong national group of kayakers, who at the very beginning of the ride received a 50-second penalty for incorrectly passing the goal. Přindiš and Prskavec, on the other hand, can now rest and concentrate on Sunday's semifinals.
"I set a goal for the first ride in my thirties, which I did. Not that I didn't care how I ended up, because it starts very early in the morning on Sunday, so I was hoping to be a little higher to get better starting position, "said Přindiš, praising the well-being in the Seu. "Before the patrol race, I felt the worst in 14 days since we were here. But then it was good during the race and better again today. It's beautiful here all the time, nice races, the spectators came, so fine," he smiled.
Sparkler was also satisfied. "In qualifying you don't want to make an unnecessary mistake. I didn't do well in the first goals. Then I drove well in the middle, without any problems and I knew I had a run, so the second mistake came when I wanted to go straight down and turned my head. "Overall, I can't be dissatisfied. The form is, we'll see how it goes," said this year's overall winner of the World Cup.
Both representatives praised themselves that they would go to the start on Sunday at the end of the semifinal block. "I'm not a morning bird, it's also cold here in the morning, and when you're here at eight, it wants a jacket and a sweatshirt," Přindiš said. "Overall, the semifinals take an hour and a half, which is a pretty good difference in terms of sleep," Prskavec agreed.
Of the three Czech singkano players, only Fišerová succeeded, Eva Říhová finished two places behind the twenties, Kateřina Havlíčková was 35. "I went down the upper part according to my ideas, The track I wanted to take. I made two pokes and I am just behind the winner with pure time. I have a good starting position for the semifinals, "Fišerová praised herself.

Thank you for the dance! Singer Leonard Cohen will release his last album posthumously
The album Thanks for the Dance will feature unreleased material and various musical collaborations put together by the singer's son. The album will be released on November 22.
In October 2016, the album You Want it Darker was released, on which Cohen collaborated with his son Adam. He asked him to help him complete the individual songs. On an intimate recording, Cohen symbolically copes with the impending death. He died a month after the release of the album at the age of 82.
Seven months later, Adam Cohen began working on the materials he had left over from his father. He invited a number of musicians to collaborate - at random Damien Rice, Bryce Dessner, Javier Mas or singer Beck.
"When we came up with the music for my father's words, we used his own distinctive musical techniques. He's still with us," Adam Cohen told the album. "What impresses me most about the reactions of those who have heard him. One by one, they say that Leonard is still alive," he added.
The first swallow of the album is the short song The Goal. "I'm almost alive, I'm almost home," Cohen sings in his distinctive honey voice. He sang about death, suspecting that the release of new material would not survive. He also admitted this in an interview with The New Yorker magazine a month before his death. "I'm ready to die. I hope it won't be too uncomfortable," he said.
In September 2018, Adam Cohen published a collection of his father's poetry called The Flame. It will be published in Czech under the title Plamen on December 31 at the Argo publishing house.
On holiday only with a credit card? NEO account offers withdrawals from ATMs around the world for free!
According to surveys, about half of all Czechs who go abroad have become accustomed to paying directly with a card. The main reasons include comfort, security, but also the opportunity to use travel insurance, which is often associated with a payment card.
Travelers in almost every corner of the world can appreciate the convenience of paying by card. This is especially true in popular tourist destinations, but today credit cards are accepted almost everywhere. "People who travel more often, for example for work, do not have time to go to exchange offices repeatedly to exchange cash. And even 'holidaymakers' do not want to rely on cash being enough for them. In addition, some foreign currencies do not even have Czech banks or exchange offices. With the NEO account, we therefore solved this so that its users can withdraw cash from all ATMs free of charge, wherever they are, "says Kateřina Petko, Marketing and Communications Director and Spobank CZ Spokeswoman.
In addition, a payment card is a much more reliable way to avoid losing your money than cash. When losing a full wallet, its owner no longer has to wait for the money he carried in it. However, if he loses only his payment card, he can easily block it immediately over the phone or via internet banking. He does not have to suffer any financial loss at all when acting quickly. "In addition to reliable protection, keeping money in a bank account has other advantages. For example, the NEO account has an interest rate of 1.6% per year, which is one of the highest among current and savings accounts. It is set up and managed completely online without having to visit a branch. In addition, the money in the bank account is insured up to 100,000 euros and the account management is completely free, "adds Kateřina Petko.
Travel insurance should be a matter of course for anyone planning to go abroad. Thanks to the possibility of arranging it and paying with a card online, this can be done even at the last minute. However, the mere ownership of a payment card often means insurance protection when traveling. "For example, with embossed MasterCard Gold and MasterCard Business cards, travel insurance is an integral part of trips abroad to all countries around the world. Holders of these cards can also insure their family with whom they travel. CZ. However, it is always advisable to check the scope of the insurance, ie whether it applies to all activities that travelers plan to undertake.
The meal plan has been planned by the ministry since 2021. Nothing has changed in the tax
The Ministry of Finance is preparing an amendment to the Income Tax Act, according to which the employee would receive money for food directly. According to the Ministry of Finance, a quarter of employees, ie about one million people who do not yet receive meal vouchers, will thus receive meals.
According to the chairman of the Association of Voucher System Operators, David Rýc, however, even a number of small companies that do not have a canteen or meal vouchers provide meals to their employees, for example by importing food or by agreement with restaurants.
"The essence of the plan is that we do not change anything in the tax benefit. It will not pay for health and social insurance," Schiller said on Friday. She added that the limit for the maximum employer's contribution applicable as a tax credit would also be maintained.
The Income Tax Act allows companies to pay a maximum of 55 percent of the price of a meal voucher. The remaining part is paid by the employee, in some cases paid by the employer, but without a tax rebate. The best value of a meal voucher for employees and employers this year is CZK 123.
Bloomberg: Venezuela has hidden bitcoins and doesn't know what to do with them
Venezuela's central bank is conducting internal tests to see if it can hold cryptocurrencies. It thus responds to an instruction from the state-owned Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), which seeks to send bitcoins and ethers to the central bank and then pay the cryptocurrency payments to the oil company's suppliers. Employees are also studying a proposal for the central bank to include cryptocurrencies in foreign exchange reserves, which are now close to the 30-year low. Referring to information from four sources, Bloomberg reported.
The sanctions imposed by the United States on the authoritarian regime of President Nicolas Madur largely cut Venezuela off from the global financial system. This has deepened the country's economic crisis. The current crisis is one of the most serious in the world, forcing officials to use a mix of different ways to move money. While Madur's efforts to launch the world's first cryptocurrency have failed, ongoing efforts to use digital currencies show how desperately the government is trying to find ways to circumvent the restrictions.
Neither the Venezuelan Central Bank nor PDVSA responded to the request for comments.
It is not clear how PDVSA came up with its own bitcoins and ethers, or how much value these currencies have. The company has problems obtaining payments from customers through conventional channels because large banks are not willing to trade with entities that are subject to sanctions. Last month, the company received most of the payment of $ 700 million (CZK 16.6 billion) in Chinese yuan because the parties could not find financial institutions that would allow the transaction.
PDVSA may not feel like selling cryptocurrencies on the open market, as this would require it to register on the stock exchange and undergo due diligence. Instead, he wants the cryptocurrency to be used by the central bank and paid with it to entities to which the PDVSA owes. Representatives of the oil company believe that the central bank is less exposed to possible obstacles that could arise in the payment of cryptocurrencies.
Bitcoins and ethers use a decentralized online ledger known as a blockchain to verify and record transactions. In some cases, relatively anonymous transfers are possible without the need for an intermediary. Few banks engage in digital currencies because of problems with money laundering and related client information that complicate compliance.
Cryptocurrencies after the debacle in 2018 are experiencing a return to prominence this year due to the expectation of their greater acceptance by institutions and Facebook's plan to come up with its own cryptocurrency. Even so, they remain unstable. Bitcoin has fallen by almost 20 percent in the last four days, but has made a profit of about 130 percent since the beginning of the year.
Commentary by Jan Šindelář: Managing railways as a company
The heavenly election, though apparently not entirely smooth, is the culmination of the sad story of the state's inability to give the railways a clear direction. The board of directors has been incomplete for over a year and it does not change even after Wednesday evening, because one of the members resigned. The provisional period lasts.
The selection procedure itself was a farce from the very beginning because the requirements for candidates were significantly reduced, especially in the field of practice. Compared to last year's selection, the requirements for the size of the company in which the candidate was to operate in the past have decreased. At first, the members of the selection committee and then the supervisory board played only the role of pimprlat.
Nebeský probably submitted the weakest professional CV of the five finalists, yet without experience from a large company, he rubbed experienced fighters from the management of logistics giants and transport companies. It was the participation of interesting managers from the private sector that was probably the brightest aspect (and the greatest hope) of the whole process. Today, they know that they only played the role of narrative backdrops in the political game.
Maybe Heavenly will surprise, show great talent and eventually prove to be the best railway boss of all time. At least in the beginning, however, it will be accompanied by the taste of political news. Czech Railways does not have an easy period, they have to cope with the competition in the liberalization of the market and the lack of employees in operation. Drivers, shunters and mechanics are missing. What motivation should they have for further work and respect for management when the state behaves in the top management like an elephant in porcelain?
The second important group are creditors. We will see how the tracks at the head of the tracks will interpret next spring when the tracks defend their rating. What is certain is that creditors perceive instability. It is sad that someone else goes to Moody's for České dráhy to defend the rating every year. The agency did not miss the frequent changes in railway management and political influence on the company, it criticized them this summer.
The YES movement coers, among other things, the motto that the state must be run as a company. For a start, it would be enough to run one large state-owned company as a firm, not as a state. Czech Railways is still one of the largest companies in the country and it would be good if the best led them. They reported, but the state despised them. It can certainly be argued that the post at the head of the railways has always been a political matter. But then we can forgive the pranksters with the tender.
An unusually open and unique painting by Karel Gott in Olga Špátová's feature documentary
This unique film from Olga Špátová's workshop will premiere in Czech cinemas next spring.
"In mid-September last year, Ivanka and Karel Gott called me and asked me if I would make a documentary about Karel's life with Karel again after ten years. I didn't hesitate for a minute! Thanks to my exceptional singing talent, artistic humility and immense diligence, it was and is a great honor for me. "director Olga Špátová describes her feelings.
Thanks to a quick agreement and agreement, the first day of filming took place on October 22 last year, and the last shots with Karel Gott were filmed a few days ago. The goal was and is absolutely clear - to authentically capture Karel Gott as a phenomenal singer who distributes himself to his supporters, as a painter, but at the same time a loving husband and father of his children. A man who for sixty years has been distributing joy with his songs to several generations not only in our country, but also in Europe, and in fact all over the world. A man who enrolled in the hearts and souls of his listeners by simply being.
The film is not intended to be a show of Karel Gott's undeniable fame and achievements. "That's why it's not even possible to compare my previous film The Gott Phenomenon with the current one. Everyone is different. At least by shooting them in a different stage of Karel Gott's life, and this is very evident in his personal, even intimate confession, which he gave us and which confirmed us all in what legend we have the opportunity to work and spend time that is truly indescribable, "adds Olga Špátová.
The creators captured Karel Gott during his performances, during meetings with his fans in our country and in Hamburg, but especially in his home environment, whether in Prague, in a cottage in Bohemian Switzerland, in a village where he spent his childhood, and in other places that played an important role in his life. Thanks to Karel Gott's sincere openness, the film will be completely authentic and unique.
"Olga has a great gift for filming with her close team, so that we are often carried away by the spontaneous atmosphere and naturally let it into our privacy, thanks to which I talked about relatively confidential topics. With my husband, cameraman Jan Malíř, We originally wanted to release the film in 2019, when I celebrated my life anniversary, but because I had another beautiful summer with my family, I wanted us to shoot as long as possible. , my wish was to be released in cinemas in the spring of next year. This documentary is a thank you to my supporters and all those who supported and accompanied me in my profession, "says Karel Gott himself about the film.

Managers of state-owned companies are to undergo a new selection procedure. It will be possible to circumvent the law, the opposition claims
"This is a typical bill that is unnecessary," said ZSnek Stanjura, chairman of the ODS parliamentary group.
After several unsuccessful attempts, the Chamber of Deputies approved changes that are intended to prevent the opaque division of functions in the future - critics speak of newsagents - in state-owned companies. Newly, candidates should go through a selection procedure at the given ministry and they will also be assessed by the government committee for personnel nominations.
However, this is a compromise solution, which, for example, the ODS does not like, because it will allegedly allow ministers to make excuses that selection commissions are to blame for a possible poor selection of state managers. In addition, the opinion of the said Committee will not be binding on the Minister. The novelty has yet to be approved by the Senate and signed by President Miloš Zeman.

The library commemorates the anniversary of the death of Wenceslas IV. exhibition of manuscripts
Six rare historical manuscripts from the turn of the 14th and 15th centuries, ie from the time of the Roman and Czech king Wenceslas IV, can be viewed today and on Saturday in the Prague Clementine. The National Library released them from its vaults to commemorate this year's 600th anniversary of Wenceslas' death. This morning, librarians and restorers placed rare originals in display cases in the Mirror Chapel. Admission to the exhibition is free, open on both days from 10:00 to 18:00.
An exhibition of documents entitled Ad mandatum domini Regis: From the Royal Office and Library of Wenceslas IV. prepared by the library together with the National Archive. The written legacy from the reign of Wenceslas IV. the National Archive is viewed from the point of view of official documents and the National Library from the point of view of literary works, said its author Jan Vojtíšek.
"Visitors can look forward to, for example, a work on agriculture by Peter de Crescentiis, which is basically a kind of encyclopedia of agriculture, or a breviary, a prayer book of one of the Benedictines of St. George's Monastery in Prague Castle, from the early 15th century," he said. reasons why, according to him, people should look at the exhibition.
The Epistles of Peter of Blois will also be exhibited, where the introductory miniature H (enrico) depicts a half-figure of King Henry II of England. The author of the decoration is most likely the Master of Samson's History, who, in addition to two volumes of the Bible of Wenceslas IV. he also participated in the decoration of a number of other manuscripts. Visitors will also see a Latin collection of treatises by John Wycliff from the period around 1411 to 1414.
From the library of Wenceslas IV. Not a single book has survived on Czech territory. According to experts, this library was one of the largest and also the most beautiful book collections in what was then Central Europe, because the young king longed to build a representative library that would be comparable to the book collections of his French relatives. However, the library disappeared soon after Václav's death. Apparently it was stolen or destroyed during the conquest of the castle by the Hussites. But several codes have been saved. Most of them are now owned by the Austrian National Library.
"We have a number of treasures in our collections and I am glad that they are in a condition that allows them to be exhibited and made available to the public so-called live and not only in the form of the Manuscriptorium digital library," said Martin Kocanda, director of the National Library.
On Saturday, the national holiday, an exhibition entitled What Hides Under the Floor, which represents the local archaeological discoveries, will be open free of charge in Klementinum.
Techno parties in the Benešov region continue.
She plays at a third of the capacity, she should have finished at noon
Hlaváčkova Lhota (Benešovsko) The techno party near Hlaváčkova Lhota in the Benešov region continues on Sunday evening.
One third of the original 12 music systems still play.
According to evening estimates by the police, about 500 people stay here after 20:00, the original rough estimates spoke of three hundred, there were 900 in the morning, said police spokeswoman Lucie Nováková.
Originally, the techno party was supposed to end at noon on Sunday, at that time some of the music systems had really stopped.
"Some have already left and others are getting ready to leave.
Music production is still partially ongoing.
We expect that music systems will be gradually disconnected and disassembled, "said Nováková.
"Police officers still strictly monitor departing visitors in order to prevent drivers from driving under the influence of alcohol or addictive substances.
Drivers have the opportunity to undergo a preventive breath test before departure, "she added.
Dozens of riot police officers are supervising the event, the foreigner police, traffic and riot police are on site, and handlers with service dogs are also on standby.
"During today, the police checked 470 people moving at the venue and 485 vehicles, 270 drivers were subjected to a breath test, six of which sat behind the wheel under the influence of alcohol," said Nováková.
A total of 95 drivers were tested by police for the presence of narcotics and psychotropic substances, one of which was positive.
Police also dealt with 14 traffic offenses.
At the request of techno party participants, police officers performed 300 preventive breath tests and four preventive tests for the presence of narcotic and psychotropic substances.
There were about 2,000 people at the event on Saturday morning.
If the number of participants did not decrease, the police would intervene there.
This was stated by the Minister of the Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) on the Prima Partie television program.
However, the number of participants dropped below 1,000, so the police assessed that the intervention was not needed, nor did the hygiene station or the Ministry of Health request it.
On Sunday, Czech Television (ČT) stated that the techno parties had extended to the surrounding lands, the owners of which did not agree with their use for techno parties.
It is possible that the owners of the surrounding land will claim damages.
Fans of techno arrived at the meadow near Hlaváčková Lhota on Friday evening.
The police originally guarded the meadow in Blažim in the Benešov region on Friday, where the techno party took place last year.
Blažim is located about 30 kilometers from Hlaváček's Lhota, where the technicians finally got to.
According to Nováková, no one came to Blažim.
Snake bite: The little girl ended up in the hospital!
"The first case this year was recorded in Železnorudsko.
The viper stabbed a girl there, the year 2010, which the parents brought to the local emergency service base themselves, "Mária Svobodová, a regional spokeswoman for the emergency medical service, told Deník, adding that the child was then taken to a hospital in Klatovy.
The viper is the only venomous snake in the Czech Republic, and it is in Šumava that these animals occur in higher numbers, so it is good to be careful when walking.
However, there is no great danger from these animals.
The chance that the viper will bite you is not very high, she is afraid of herself during normal contact.
And if she has room to do so, she likes to crawl away with a loud hiss.
She only attacks if she feels very threatened - for example, if you accidentally step on it.
However, her bite is not a tragedy either, her poison is very effective against small mammals, but it does not kill humans.
This can only happen if a person has a particularly weak organism or suffers from allergies.
The risk is therefore especially for children, the elderly and allergy sufferers.
"After a bite, a person often has a feeling of vomiting, sweating, fever, thirst, abdominal pain and diarrhea, in debilitated individuals and especially allergy sufferers, anaphylactic shock can occur," Miriam Gredová from Klatovy Hospital described for Deník.
The man threatened to throw the baby out the window.
He poured wine after the policewoman and threw dishes
After 23:00, an intervention unit broke into the apartment and detained the man.
Infants were immediately taken into care by paramedics, said Markéta Janovská, a spokeswoman for the regional police, in a press release.
The man did not want to cooperate with the police, he threw dishes, knives or poured wine from the window after the police negotiator.
He intensified his threats several times during the negotiations by leaning out of the window with the child in his arms.
Once he even climbed on the window sill himself, where he staggered.
Police continue to investigate the man.
He does not want to publish more information yet.
Stosurová prefers her daughter to the tennis season
Australian tennis player Samantha Stosur will not intervene in the coronavirus-affected season this year.
The 36-year-old US Open 2011 champion, who became a mother in June, does not want to end her career yet.
He plans to return to the courts next year and believes that thanks to his family and daughter, he will enjoy tennis even more than before.
Two weeks ago, Stosur announced on social media that her partner Liz Astling had given birth to a daughter, Genevieve, in mid-June.
"I will stay at home, spend time with my family, be at all the little milestones that our Evie will experience in the next six months and just enjoy it," said the former world number one in doubles on the Australian Association's website.
The WTA Tour will resume the interrupted season on March 3 with a clay tournament in Palermo.
Sapa Market: A raid revealed meat, fish and eggs of unknown origin
"One of the vehicles entering the area transported 1320 pieces of quail eggs of unknown origin, in addition to unsuitable conditions.
These eggs will also be destroyed in the remediation plant, "said the State Veterinary Administration.
An inspection of the live fish stand revealed that the seller did not have proof of origin and was not registered for the sale of live fish.
The market has been considered problematic from a veterinary point of view for a long time.
For example, last autumn, veterinarians discovered an illegal grocery store in it, with almost half a ton of unlabelled food without proof of origin.
For most, it was not possible to determine the expiration date, some products had reached the expiration date and were spoiled.
For five kilograms of cuttlefish, the shelf life was exceeded by three years.
Last May, veterinarians and police officers detained 80 kilograms of food without proof of origin, including dried fish, squid or frozen ducks, on the market grounds, some of which were moldy.
Spilková in steam. In Indianapolis, he is on the verge of advancement after the first round
After the first round of the Tech Championship in Indianapolis, golfer Klára Spilková is on the verge of advancing to the final rounds. On Thursday, she played two birdies and two bogeys at the LPGA series and finished the opening day in pairs. With the result of 72, he is in the divided 69th place, which is the expected cut.
Twenty-four-year-old Spilková returned to the circuit a month ago after a two-month medical break and did not make it to the second half of the tournament in Portland. She rested because of fatigue and exhaustion after a previous illness.
The first Czech winner of the professional tournament on the European LET series has been a member of the LPGA Tour for the first year and has not been very successful so far. Out of twelve tournaments, she went through the cut three times, the best was the 32nd in Hawaii. He fights to keep the card for the next season.
The tournament in Indianapolis was played best by the Korean Hor Michung. After the first round, he scores -9 and is two shots ahead of the three opponents.
The police accused CzechTourism manager Aleš Pangrác about promotion contracts
Police accused Aleš Pangrác, a former manager of the CzechTourism state agency, about promotion contracts. Pangrác of the SeznamZprávy server confirmed that he accepted the accusations this week. Czech Television (ČT) stated last year that the police are investigating contracts worth 38 million crowns in the case. According to the police, part of the money went back to Pangrác, the server writes. In the case, criminal investigators were also interested in the Minister for Regional Development Klára Dostálová (for YES), to whose department CzechTourism belongs. The investigation into the case according to the server continues.
Detectives from the National Center against Organized Crime provided evidence in the case in the second half of last November. They were, for example, at the headquarters of the Ministry for Regional Development, at the headquarters of CzechTourism, at the autodrome in Most or at the Sport Invest agency. The minister's office computer was also taken from the apartment. In a court order for a house search near Dostálová, which was previously quoted by ČT, it stated that in 2016, when she was a deputy, the Minister decided on CzechTourism's expenses in favor of the chosen persons indirectly and outside the standard official procedure. Dostálová then stated that she felt absolutely innocent, did not err, can document everything and fully cooperates with the police.
According to the agency, it was an individual's fault. The media has previously stated that he is a former director of the Regional Partnership Department in CzechTourism, Aleš Pangrác, who was dismissed due to the results of the audit. As a result, the CzechTourism agency concluded 48 problematic contracts.
"Yes, they accused me. But I don't want to comment on that anymore," Pangrác told the North.

Destroyed shops, fires in the streets, a memorial procession accompanied the riots
Five years ago, 43 students at Ayotzinapa University disappeared, and despite an extensive investigation, the case has not yet been clarified. The students were reportedly detained by police in the Mexican state of Guerrero. It is not clear exactly what happened next, but according to the investigation, the students apparently ended up in the hands of a local syndicate and were subsequently killed and burned, according to the APTN agency.
A memorial procession took place in the Mexican capital on Thursday, with families wanting to express their frustration that they were still unable to find answers and explain the disappearance of their children.
However, the mostly calm march was disrupted by smaller groups of vandals, who destroyed everything that stood in their way. Vandals destroyed shops and hotels, did not shield themselves or destroy monuments, set fires around the city and smashed windows.
Even before the march, President Andres Manuel López Obrador said that he would do anything to catch him and asked the public for any information that would lead to clarification of the case.
More than 142 people were detained during the investigation, but none of them was convicted. Many of them had to be released because their human rights were violated, investigators allegedly had suspects of torture, the APTN added.
Putin telephoned Zelensky before the armistice in Donbas, the Kremlin criticizes the planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke by telephone with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky about the situation in Donbas, where a new ceasefire is to take effect at midnight.
According to the Kremlin's statement, Putin criticized, among other things, the decision of the Ukrainian parliament to hold local elections; Kiev reported that Zelensky called on the release of detained Ukrainians.
Negotiators of Ukraine and Russia, with the support of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), agreed on a new ceasefire on Wednesday evening.
The armistice is due to begin after midnight on Monday night, to be "complete and general" and to pave the way for the fulfillment of other provisions of the peace agreements.
In an interview with Zelensky, Putin said that the decision of the Ukrainian parliament to hold local elections contradicted the Minsk peace agreement and threatened the prospects for a settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
The Ukrainian parliament decided last week that the planned elections to local councils would not take place in the territory controlled by pro-Russian insurgents.
The Minsk agreement envisages that Kiev will regain control of the separatist-occupied Ukrainian territories with Russia after giving these regions broad autonomy and holding local elections there.
According to the Unian agency, the Zelenský office stated that both statesmen agreed on the benefits of the forthcoming ceasefire in Donbas and on the need to take further measures to promote peace in the region, such as demining combat areas or withdrawing troops from the front.
Zelensky also called on Putin to release Ukrainians detained in eastern Ukraine, on the occupied Crimean peninsula and in Russia itself.
The Minsk agreement helped stop the fighting, but occasional shootings and artillery attacks continue to kill people on both sides of the front.
The conflict in Donbas has claimed more than 14,000 lives since spring 2014.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of military support to the separatists, which Moscow denies.
Zelensky made the end of the war in Donbas his priority, but no major breakthrough in the negotiations has taken place yet.
And where are the spectators? Doha cannot be London
At the same time, however, it is a step backwards, as the pilgrimage to Doha has voluntarily and consciously given up the captivating atmosphere prevailing at the sold-out stadium in London in 2017 and last year at the European Championships in Berlin.
Giant banners on the walls of skyscrapers in Doha invite you to "the biggest sporting event of 2019". However, fears about how dignified her scenery will be are growing.
"Tickets for the finish line are sold out for all evenings," say the organizers.
But that's too little.
The upper gallery of the Khalifa stadium with a total capacity of 40,000 spectators is already covered with colorful sails, which also depict the flags of 209 participating countries. Athletics has set off in Qatar in an area where, despite the annual meeting of the Diamond League, it has no roots.
Not surprisingly, last week only 50,000 tickets were sold for ten days of the championship, although their price started at 60 Qatari rials, ie less than 400 crowns.
The organizers have now set themselves the goal of filling at least half of the uncovered parts of the stands. Therefore, according to sources in the British newspaper Giuardian, they allegedly (although the organizers themselves deny this) distribute free tickets to migrants who work here as workers, as well as to children. Which Sebastian Coe, head of the IAAF athletic association, can also comment positively: "In the same way, we can inspire future generations."
In the past, rich Qatar won world championships in handball and cycling, after athletics in 2022 it will be football's turn. The financial offers of the oil power will always be lucrative even for rich sports federations. Such is the reality of today's sports world.
But even if we approach it and ignore the absence of fans in the stadium, we can't help but feel the purely sporting sigh that the experiment with the first outdoor world championship of athletes in the Arabian Peninsula should have been timed better by IAAF leaders - and for another year. The extremely late term, forced by the climate, disrupts the whole scheme of the season in the pre-Olympic year and thus the preparation for the key Olympic season, which would normally start for athletes in October.
Perhaps Qatar will at least make up for it with technological innovations, with the help of which it promises an ultra-modern and attractive championship. That it's just 37 degrees? Already now the stadium area is artificially air-conditioned to twenty-four. And the advanced cameras, built directly into the blocks, are intended to show television viewers in detail what happens to athletes in hundredths of a second before and just after the starter's shot.

The unexpected champion in decathlon is Rykl, heptathlon was dominated by Novotná
The defender of the last two titles, Doležal, did not finish four hundred at the end of Saturday's program;
The decathlon has long been ruled by the Latvian representative Reinis Kregers, who is training in the group of coach Josef Karas, but resigned after the discus.
Rykl had two bronze medals from the outdoor championship so far, this time he was the only decathlon fighter who crossed the 7,000 mark.
Vilém Stráský and Petr Urbánek won other medals for him.
After the competition, Rykl recalled the absence of Adam Sebastian Helcelet and Jiří Sýkora.
"It's a pity that there were no boys here and Kope didn't start it, because the results would look completely different.
But the title tastes very good, I especially appreciate the fact that I put a person 30 centimeters in the distance.
Then I was even more pleased with the stick and I was most disappointed with the disc, I was below average there, "he admitted on the union Facebook.
Kateřina Cachová won the first day of heptathlon with more than a hundred points, even though she suffered from an injured ankle on the bounce leg.
In the long-distance sector, however, she then entered only 570 cm, did not cross 40 meters with her spear, and did not enter the final octopus.
Novotná scored 5878 points and won by 241 points ahead of Kateřina Dvořáková.
It came out mainly from a distance, 631 cm is the best Czech performance of the year.
"I really wished it was around the 630.
Yesterday my calf started to pull, but I'm very glad that I didn't feel it at all and that it didn't limit me at all, "Novotná said on the federal Facebook page.
Organic LPG has arrived in the Czech Republic, it promises ecological operation
Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) is a very well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
It is especially popular for its significantly lower price compared to petrol or diesel, given the significantly lower excise tax, but its benefit is also in lower CO2 emissions per kilometer driven.
Like petrol and diesel, it also has its environmentally friendly variant - "bio LPG".
However, it is quite a novelty - it first appeared on the European market the year before last, and according to a press release from the Czech LPG Association, it arrived in the Czech Republic a few days ago.
"These days we have received the first fifteen tons of bio LPG, which will be distributed to our filling stations in a mixture with conventional fossil LPG," the association quotes Jiří Karlík from Primagas.
However, bio LPG cannot be taken as bioethanol or biodiesel.
According to the association, it is chemically identical to the classic petroleum LPG, which many motorists are refueling in their cars now.
Therefore, it is also possible to mix both versions as you wish.
"The only difference compared to conventional LPG is the method of production," says Ivan Indráček, chairman of the association, about bio LPG.
This is one of the great advantages of bio LPG over other alternative fuels.
It is easy to transport and store, and the distribution infrastructure is also relatively good, eg compared to hydrogen or electricity.
Currently, this gas is obtained as a by-product in the production of bioethanol from food residues and sugar cane.
In the future, it should also be produced in a targeted manner, eg from cellulose biomass, ie wood waste.
In contrast, conventional petroleum LPG is formed partly as a by-product in oil refining and partly by separation in natural gas extraction.
As a result, depending on the production technology and source, the operation of the car on bio LPG is 40-70% more environmentally friendly in terms of carbon footprint than the operation on oil LPG and up to 90% compared to diesel.
However, these are not CO2 emissions from the car's exhaust, but the ecology of fuel production, ie the so-called "well-to-tank" part (in Czech "from source to tank").
One of the largest producers of bio LPG is currently the petrochemical companies Eni, Total and Neste.
According to a recent update of the National Action Plan for Clean Mobility (NAP CM), Unipetrol is also examining the possibility of production in its Litvínov refinery.
According to the association's estimates, about 170,000 LPG vehicles run in the Czech Republic; the Ministry of the Environment states a slightly higher number in the NAP CM, roughly 200,000.
According to statistics from the Ministry of Transport, almost 6,000 conversions of LPG cars were carried out last year alone.
It is possible to refuel LPG in the Czech Republic at about 950 stations of various operators.
Vojtěch revised the number of infected, the number dropped by 1775 cases
Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch (for YES) ordered the ministry to revise the numbers infected with the coronavirus virus.
The new statistics were published by the Ministry of Health on its website on Sunday.
The number on Sunday afternoon dropped from Saturday's 5,254 to 3,479 cases, which is 1,775 less infected.
At present, there are 3422 patients in the Czech Republic.
"Behind the sharp increase in the number of cures is the revision of data, which hygienists have not been able to update recently," said the head of health statistics, Jaroslav Dušek.
By Sunday afternoon, 15,212 people in the Czech Republic had been infected with coronavirus, 11,419 had recovered, and unfortunately 371 Covid-19 had succumbed.
Slovaks have succeeded, they will only pay a fine for racist insults
The Slovak Football Association succeeded in appealing against the closing of the stadium for fan racism. The national team was originally supposed to play a European Championship qualification match with Wales without spectators, instead the union will now only pay a fine of 15 thousand euros (about 387 thousand crowns).
The UEFA disciplinary commission punished Slovakia and Hungary for the behavior of fans in the recent mutual qualifying match in Budapest, which the visiting charges of the Czech coach Pavel Hapal won 2: 1. She closed the stadium for both unions for one match and fined Slovakia 20,000 euros, Hungary 67,000 euros.
After the appeal, the Slovaks received only a fine of 15,000 euros for insulting political shouts. The next match of the national team in the qualification for promotion to the European Championship with Wales on October 10 in Trnava will be open to fans.

Overview of bank accounts for children on the Czech market
Children's bank accounts are provided free of charge. However, you need to consider the offer because some additional account services are already charged. "The motivation of banks to offer accounts for children, whose basic management is usually free, is straightforward. Financial houses expect their forgiven fees to be refunded once. The small migration of Czechs between banks is probably not wrong," says Kristýna Kuncová from dTest.
According to her, "small accounts" can do almost everything that adult accounts do. The child receives his own payment card, can enter payments, monitor account movements, and has his own electronic banking available somewhere. Banks will set up an account, but it is up to the parents to teach the children how to handle them and also to check their payments.
"Quite flexibly, the parent can set weekly or monthly limits, turn on and off individual services, etc. But above all, they can monitor what is happening on the account, either by browsing the Internet or through information SMS. Please note that these may not be free." Kuncová adds and adds: "If a parent is considering an account for his child, he should consider his abilities and possibilities."
The museum in Semily with the exhibition returns to the Velvet Revolution
Imitation of a standardization room with a television, in which footage from the brutal intervention of police officers against students on November 17, 1989 in Prague runs. This is also the new exhibition of the museum in Semily, which is dedicated to the Velvet Revolution. "The basis is to present what happened in Semily after the events on Národní třída," said the curator of the exhibition, Tomáš Chvátal.
"I would say that the atmosphere was basically the same everywhere, with the first demonstration in Semily on November 22, and then more people gradually packed up every day," he said. Among the most active were initially a group of local dissidents around Miroslav Matěcha, who was the only one from the city and the immediate vicinity to sign Charter 77, and the Dědečeks, who spread the Several Sentences petition. According to Chvátal, the Civic Forum was formed relatively quickly at that time. "One specificity is that there was a very strong group of local doctors in the Civic Forum," said the curator.
About 50 photographs should draw visitors into what was happening in the city at that time, the images were taken 30 years ago by Karel Bárta. A video from the general strike on November 27, 1989, shot by František Tomíček, has also been preserved, which will be released in a loop throughout the exhibition. Ivan Hlas also spoke and sang at the demonstration. The Semily Archive also lent a number of preserved banners of the time to the exhibition. "They said: Let's not get drunk with a croissant, From riverbed to riverbed, We don't want violence," Chvátal said. Some changes in the city were very rapid at the time, for example, already in December, in an all-mileage vote, the people decided that the square would be Riegrovo and abolished the previous name Gottwaldovo.
The exhibition also captures the events before the November events. "In the first part, we present to witnesses and students what was before such a late normalization. I think we managed to collect unique documents from Semily, whether they are banners with various communist slogans or a bronze plaque from the then museum of the workers' movement," said Chvátal . One room is supposed to evoke the feeling that could have looked like in the living room of an ordinary household at the time.
The last part of the exhibition focuses on what happened after the Velvet Revolution. It focuses on the first free elections. "We wallpapered one room with election posters. Those who have experienced it will remember the posters With us to Europe or there is Václav Klaus still under the heading OF with a beautiful motto Everyone for their community," added the curator.
Pike in a pond, or a relatively prosperous open-air museum?
Babiš chose statistics such as good security (the Czech Republic is the seventh in the world), a low unemployment rate, and a low state debt for his optimistic view. Or a statement that, according to a recent study, our country is the twenty-fourth in terms of quality of life out of 140 countries evaluated.
However, developer Dušan Kunovský and architect Josef Pleskot presented other, far from "pink" data in a television interview on the occasion of the Summit of Architecture and Development. For example, that the Czech Republic ranks 154th in the world in terms of construction proceedings. It may be that the current economic "boom" will not leave any significant architectural heritage as it did in the past.
The biggest obstacle is not only the current legislation, but also the slow, inefficient bureaucracy. This is also documented by comparative studies in which the Czech Republic lags significantly behind the developed countries in the overall quality and performance of public administration.
Our country has simply not yet been able to make good use of the potential of the good economic situation of recent years to invest in the future. It is nice that salaries and pensions are rising, but people with a better standard of living will also want to have a place to live, to travel modernly and quickly, to have quality cultural stalls, to live without an unbearable environmental burden.
But in the capital city of Prague, for example, it has not been possible to complete the internal and external circuit for years or to build a high-speed railway or metro to the airport. And Prague does not even have a modern, architecturally daring national library, concert hall or national gallery. The reason is not only absurd struggles for architectural competitions, zoning plans and building permits, but also a kind of specifically Czech conservatism, which adheres to the motto "every bolder change is for the worse".
And when it seems that something more daring could be done, it will almost certainly be ruined by conservationists or other somewhat wretched associations, or politicians. In the absurd drama around Jan Kaplický's "blob" designed for the new building of the National Library, President Václav Klaus even wanted to attach himself to the excavators.
However, the list does not end with Prague. The Czech Republic is not able to complete its backbone motorway network, nor to start building high-speed train tracks, so Germany finally decided to run its tracks for super-fast trains from Berlin to Vienna by "detour" through Bavaria. In addition, repairs to the existing infrastructure are often drowned in Schlindrian. Getting from Prague to Brno quickly is a riddle now.
Babiš came into politics with the promise that he would "arrange things". But not much has happened so far when it comes to meaningful investment and speeding up cumbersome bureaucratic procedures. Although an amendment to the Act on Accelerating the Construction of Transport Infrastructure has been in force since 2018, we will have to wait for more extensive positive effects, such as easier expropriation of land. And the new building law, approved by the government, which is supposed to reduce the current average length of construction proceedings from 5.4 years to one year, will, if we are lucky, start to apply from 2021. But many people would probably not bet on it. .

Mobile voting units or correspondence election.
A political scientist and a sociologist were looking for options for a pandemic
According to Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD), a change in the law is needed so that people in quarantine due to coronavirus can also vote in the October regional and senate elections.
Parliament could discuss it in August or September under an accelerated regime.
He stated this on Sunday in the Prima TV Party.
On Tuesday, he wants to discuss possible solutions at the ministry with representatives of parliamentary parties.
"Whatever we do, it will have to mean a change in the electoral law," Hamáček said.
On Wednesday, the Senate called on the government to find a solution within the applicable legal rules.
However, the minister stated that it would be necessary to amend the provision of the law, according to which people in quarantine cannot vote due to their health condition.
The ban on voting should be maintained, for example, for patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop stated in the OVM program that the possibility of a correspondence option has been postponed since 2004.
Even the current bill, which is in the Chamber of Deputies, then envisages its introduction for voting abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
At the same time, Prokop considers the concerns of YES or the CSSD (because, according to experience from abroad, it would rather be to other types of parties) of the correspondence choice overestimated.
Personally, he is against the possibility of electronic voting, where there is a significant possibility of abuse.
Michal Klíma said that now it is necessary to devise ad hoc mechanisms (elections), which could be carried out this year and with the least possible health risk.
He considers it to be the main thing to be ready for the year 2021, when parliamentary elections are to take place in the Czech Republic.
He considers the correspondence option (whether only abroad or also in the Czech Republic) to be one of the functional methods.
He sees the already mentioned electoral units or, for example, the possibility of proxy voting within the family as another.
He added that it is possible to learn how similar situations -⁠ choices at the time of coronavirus -⁠ were dealt with in Croatia, Poland or France.
Due to the spread of coronavirus infection, various types of elections have already been postponed this year in 67 countries around the world.
The Prague Stock Exchange grew slightly, with Czech banks, O2 and Avast doing well
The Prague Stock Exchange closed the trading week with a slight increase. The PX Index rose 0.13 percent to 1,038.45 points. It was pulled up by Czech banks, the telecommunications company O2 and the technology company Avast. On the contrary, the Austrian titles and the media company CME did not succeed. This follows from the results of trading on the stock exchange website.
For most of Friday's session, the Prague Stock Exchange traded in slightly positive territory and ended up with a small profit. "However, it lost just over one percent over the whole week (PX index)," said Josef Dudek from Fio banka.
Domestic banks partially corrected the declines from the past few days. Komerční banka improved by 0.82 percent to CZK 803 and Moneta Money Bank by 0.41 percent to CZK 72.80. Shares of Avast appreciated by 0.89 percent to 113 crowns and the operator O2 gained 0.46 percent to 216.50 CZK.
Kofola's securities grew the most, by 1.38 percent to 294 crowns. The tobacco company Philip Morris, whose shares rose in price to CZK 13,640, received less than one percent.
Securities of the energy company ČEZ stagnated at Thursday's value of 520 crowns.
Three stocks were loss-making - Erste Bank depreciated 0.87 percent to 779.20 crowns, CME 0.73 percent to 109 crowns and the insurance company VIG 0.40 percent to 618 crowns.
The koruna weakened slightly against both major world currencies. It lost four pennies per euro to CZK 25.85 / EUR, and three pennies per dollar to CZK 23.62 / USD. This follows from the data on the Patria Online server.
Protests in Hungary: Pig ears were being thrown by protesters at the government building
Participants in a demonstration against Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov and his cabinet threw pig ears at the government building.
It was another in a series of protests against the "mafia style of government" that have been taking place in Sofia and other cities for almost three weeks.
The organizers are planning a nationwide blockade on Wednesday, the DPA agency said.
According to Rádio Svobodná Evropa / Rádio Svoboda, today's protest, which took place for the 18th day in a row, had a weaker turnout than the previous one.
At 20:00, about 300 people gathered, some streets had to be closed to traffic.
Demonstrators played a stage in front of the government building, during which they symbolically locked Prime Minister Borisov and Attorney General Ivan Gešev to the prison cell in connection with the arrest of two advisers to President Rumen Radev, a strong political opponent of the Prime Minister.
The resignation of both is one of the basic demands of the protesters.
They also called for the abolition of the announced health care reform and an end to corruption in construction on the Black Sea coast.
The organizer of the protests, Nikolai Hajigenov, stated today on public radio that "the peak of the escalation" in the form of a "nationwide demonstration in Sofia and blockades across the country" is about to take place on Wednesday.
He reiterated his call for Borisov and his government to resign, as well as call early elections.
The regular ones should take place in March 2021.
Borisov has previously stated that he does not intend to resign.
He justified this, among other things, by the need to make Bulgaria a peacemic-19 pandemic and the resulting economic crisis.
However, he replaced five members of his government team on Friday, although the concession did not reassure the protesters.
Earlier this week, Borisov's government stopped the vote of confidence in parliament in parliament.
The Attorney General resumed prosecuting a mother who manipulated her daughter against her father
The Attorney General, Pavel Zeman, does not agree with the release of a mother who has long manipulated her daughter and disrupted her relationship with her father. She faced charges of torturing and threatening upbringing. The regional court acquitted her, Zeman disagrees. According to his appeal to the Supreme Court, a similar act can be seen as a criminal offense.
The Supreme Court's decision could have a broader impact on other cases. "A more specific definition of such a specific form of abuse can be considered necessary also from the point of view of directing further application practice," says Zeman's appeal.
Last year, the District Court in Svitavy first found the woman guilty of torturing the entrusted person and endangering the child's upbringing. She formed a strong, even symbiotic bond with her daughter, even in a situation where she was to be entrusted to her father.
The result was a pathological fixation on the mother and a markedly negative relationship with the father. The situation marked the emotional development of her daughter, who was even hospitalized. She threatened self-harm if she was handed over to her father's care.
The Svitavy court sentenced the mother two years in prison with a two-year suspended sentence. However, the Pardubice branch of the regional court acquitted the woman in the appellate proceedings, it is said that this is not a criminal offense. The same verdict was repeated by the regional court even after the Supreme Court had once ordered it to decide again.
The regional court stated that situations where one parent manipulates a child towards the other are by no means exceptional. It is resolved in custody proceedings, or with the help of psychologists or youth social protection bodies. Only in exceptional cases is criminal law the solution.
However, according to the Attorney General, the woman committed both torture and threats to her upbringing. "The accused acted purposefully when she aroused negative feelings towards her father in her daughter, and purposefully strengthened these negative emotions. the sphere of minors will have negative consequences, "stands in the appeal.
Zeman asked the Supreme Court to return the case to the regional court. It follows from the appeal that the child is now in the care of the father.
Let the fans be positive, Hašek wishes. Sparta is waiting for a hit in Pilsen
"We will play at the limit of possibilities, we will do everything in our power to succeed. In order to manage the match in terms of games and results," the Spartan Martin Hašek promised in an interview for club television.
In a week, the goal was decided by a cup duel in Jihlava (2: 1). Sparta advanced to the next round, which was her duty. She was relieved, but she continues to worry about the game.
Even though the season is slowly spilling over into the second period, football Sparta is still looking for the face that coach Václav Jílek talked about at the beginning of his engagement.
"But it's still Sparta that has very good players. We have a difficult match ahead of us," warns Roman Procházka from Pilsen.
When the Spartans arrived in Štruncovy sady for the last time, in mid-May it was a clear matter in the superstructure. The guests left after a soulless performance with a beating of 0: 4, the largest in the history of the independent Czech league.
While at that time the difference between the clubs in the table was eight points before the match, now Sparta is already losing nine points after ten games of the new season. It is experiencing one of the worst entries of the season ever.
"It's not an easy situation either for us or for the fans who would like to see their beloved club completely different from what it is at the moment," Hašek feels. "But we would like them to continue to support us, stay positive and stand behind us."
Sparta does not know whether he will be able to use Tetteh in Pilsen, who received a two-match penalty for expulsion in Pilsen, but appealed against him on Friday.
Costa, Dočkal, Drchal, Panák, Pulkrab, Zahustel, Krejčí and Kadlec remain on the numerous marauders, who are the only cadres to remember the last Spartan victory in Pilsen in 2011.
The home team, who won the last five matches, including Wednesday's cup in Hlučín, should only miss midfielder Čermák. And as the captain, defender Jakub Brabec, a Spartan offspring, should lead them into the match.
Milan Jakubů: The army stole the funeral for itself! Says Andor Sandor
There are still uncertainties surrounding the funeral of Brigadier General Milan Jakubů. The media speculated during the week that the army was planning the last farewell to the deputy director of Military Intelligence, despite the wishes of the bombastic family, as far as the soldiers can. There were also discrepancies regarding the date of the funeral. Jan Pejšek, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, denied this.
"It's nonsense! We have been in contact with the family from the beginning, the agreed Friday funeral date has been valid from the beginning, no one has changed it. Just as military honors are valid. The funeral will finally take place on Friday and it will not lack all military honors, including the flight of fighters.
However, there is still a tense atmosphere around the last farewell to the popular general. The funeral ceremony will not be attended by the decision of the organizers people who have worked with the general in the past!
For example, he is a former head of military intelligence, Andor Šándor (62), who met Milan Jakubů 17 years ago. Sandor remembers his former colleague as hardworking, intelligent and "good guy".
In addition, he has met him regularly in recent years to celebrate the anniversary of the founding of Military Intelligence. That is why he would like to say goodbye to Milan Jakubů. "Personally, I would go to the funeral of Milan Jakubů," Šándor told Blesk. But he can't.
"I also know of other people from the organization who would like to go, but they are unlucky because the potentates will usurp the funeral for themselves. I think it is not right to privatize the funeral in this way," said a security expert. He is also not played by the allegedly considered closing of the ceremony to the public due to the secrecy of army leaders.
"The leadership of the army is not kept secret, and neither are the leaders of military intelligence, because they need to be promoted at Prague Castle, we see them there. for the army to overthrow the family and its wishes, "concluded Šándor.
Milan Jakubů died on Saturday in a car accident near Špindlerův Mlýn. The frontal collision of Milan's Rapid with the Ford Mustang was allegedly caused by the driver of the sports car Vojtěch Ch. (31).
The amateur racer in the turn was supposed to go in the opposite direction, Milan Jakubů apparently did not have a chance to prevent the collision. His wife (47) suffered serious injuries in the accident and may suffer the consequences for the rest of her life. Police heard the perpetrator of the accident on Thursday.
Coach Boloni Mihajlovič doesn ́t want to play without spectators
Boloni Siniša Mihajlovič, the coach of the football players, has had enough of the matches of the Italian league without spectators.
The Serbian coach hopes that fans will return to the stadiums from the new season.
"What we are currently doing here is not football.
I already have my teeth full of matches without spectators.
It's sexless football, it brings me no emotions, no joy.
Those matches are worse than training.
Playing like this is terrible and I don't think I'm the only one who thinks so, "said Mihajlovič before today's match against Lecce.
The coronavirus pause is followed by Series A matches in quick succession, and although they are played only in the evening, their actors are exposed to heat.
"We play in the heat every three days.
In such conditions, it is not even known how the teams are doing.
For this season to end.
Those measures had to be taken in order to complete the competition, but I hope that the fans will be back from September, "said the coach, who in the past also led Fiorentina and AC Milan.
For Mihajlovič, this season is extraordinary also because he has been missing on the bench for four months to treat leukemia.
"Despite my illness, the interruption of the league and everything else, our team managed to move up a level.
We want to keep growing and we need players to be mentally stronger, "he said.

The launch of the new toll is not endangered, Kremlík reports. But the change of operator is at stake
On Friday, the Ministry of Transport began preparations for a new tender for the operation of a new toll system. It is a contingency plan that the state would use in the event that the current toll contract was legally canceled. In addition, the state is preparing another temporary solution if it does not manage to complete the tender on time. This was stated on Facebook by the Minister of Transport Vladimír Kremlík (for YES).
On Thursday, the Office for the Protection of Competition (ÚOHS) banned the fulfillment of the toll agreement between the state and the CzechToll / SkyToll consortium, with a one-year delay. The Ministry will file an appeal against this.
"The launch of the new toll collection system is not endangered. Starting today, we are starting the preparation of a new transparent tender procedure, the subject of which will be the services of operating the new toll system, which is now being completed by the CzechToll and SkyToll consortium," said the Minister.
In the tender, the state would look for the operator of the toll currently being prepared, which will be launched from December this year. It would therefore not be a competition for a completely new toll system, as was the case with the last tender, nor the use of the old system now operated by Kapsch.
However, according to Kremlík, the ministry is also preparing for the fact that it would not be able to prepare a new tender in time. "Based on previous experience with the course of the toll tender, I am deeply convinced that the Office is wrong and that it is not possible to objectively prepare and implement such a complex tender procedure and hand over the operation of the toll system to a new operator within the 12-month period.
Thus, in addition to the new tender procedure, the resort will also prepare a temporary solution that would resolve the collection of tolls for a transitional period until the state finds a full-fledged form of solution.
The state will probably not use the offer submitted to it in recent days by the current toll administrator Kapsch. The Austrian state company offered to operate the existing system in case the toll contract was canceled.
At the same time, the Kremlin reiterated that he believed that a backup plan would not be needed. The Ministry will therefore file an appeal against the decision of the Antimonopoly Office.
On Thursday, the Office issued a decision banning the performance of the toll contract. However, the ban will not take effect until one year after the Office's decision has become final. It is not final and an appeal can be lodged against it with the President of the Office. The Ministry and CzechToll are therefore continuing to prepare a new toll, which should be launched in December.
The CzechToll / SkyToll consortium won last year's tender for a new toll system and its operator. It succeeded in a toll tender with an offer of 10.75 billion crowns for ten years of operation. The current operator Kapsch protested against the course of the tender and the validity of the toll contract, which failed in the competition with an offer of over 13 billion crowns.
My heart is like a bell and my lungs are non-smoking. I'll just have a few infusions, Zeman joked
On Tuesday, the head of state underwent a several-hour medical examination at the Central Military Hospital (ÚVN). According to the director of the hospital, Miroslav Zavoral, the doctors did not find any "disease states" in the president. The president will celebrate his 75th birthday on Saturday.
Doctors at the president's examination revealed slight signs of dehydration. His problems with low pressure were caused by insufficient flooding. "To fix the dehydration of the body, I will give myself several infusions that will get minerals into my body," Zeman said.
Otherwise, according to him, the director of ÚVN stated that "the Czech state has a healthy president". In this connection, the President mentioned that Zavoral received several hate messages due to a medical examination.
According to the president, the doctors examined him closely and did not miss a single place on his body. "So a brief recap: the heart beats like a bell, the lungs are clean like it's not a smoker, the liver works like I'm an abstinent, the kidneys are fine too, and I can go on and on," Zeman said.
The iDNES.cz editorial staff turned to a military hospital to comment on Zeman's statement about their health.
The issue of Zeman's health became a topic especially during last year's presidential election or during some public appearances during which Zeman has clear problems with walking. According to Prague Castle, the president is having a bad time due to diabetic multifunctional neuropathy. He also has problems with low blood pressure and is harder to hear. He reduced smoking because of his health.

Sparta does not want to lose Tetteh in Pilsen. She appealed against the double match
Football Sparta appealed against a two-match penalty for striker Benjamin Tetteh, which the player received from the disciplinary committee for exclusion in Sunday's derby with Slavia (0: 3).
The Letna Club informed about it on its twitter and is now awaiting the verdict of the appeals committee.
Tetteh has already served half of the penalty in Wednesday's home cup match in Jihlava. Sparta is now working to ensure that the 22-year-old Ghanaian striker can take part in Sunday's 11th round of the first league in Pilsen.
The situation from last October could be repeated. At that time, Olomouc appealed against the sentence for Šimon Falta, who on Thursday received a distance from the disciplinary commission for one match for expulsion against Liberec.
The Appeals Committee did not have time to hear the case, so it postponed the effectiveness of the sentence and Falta was able to take office on Saturday, paradoxically against Sparta.
The commission finally confirmed the one-match penalty for the Olomouc midfielder next week, and Falta missed the next duel with Zlín.
Disciplinary stopped Tetteh's activity for a foul on the nightingale David Hovorka, for whom he received a straight red card from the referee Miroslav Zelinka in the 82nd minute.
The alleged spitting of the Ghanaian player on the captain of the opponent Tomáš Souček has not been proven.
We have been the target of a cyber attack by foreign states, says Iran
Since the end of June, fires and explosions have been reported from a number of Iranian military, industrial and nuclear facilities, as well as oil refineries, power plants, factories and businesses.
Some Iranian officials have said the fire that erupted in Natanz's underground nuclear operation this month could have caused cyber sabotage.
The cause of many other incidents has not yet been explained.
According to Iranian media, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi told reporters that the infrastructure of the Islamic Republic faces "thousands of cyber attacks" every day.
He added that this is not a new phenomenon and that most of them will be repelled.
In recent months, according to Mousavi, several wider cyber attacks have been recorded, which, according to analyzes, were "certain governments and groups".
However, he did not provide more details about possible perpetrators, according to Reuters.
Mousavi also added that fires in forests, refineries and other places are common in the summer.
An article by the Iranian state agency IRNA this month discussed that Iran's enemies, such as Israel and the United States, may have been behind the recent incidents.
However, none of these countries was directly accused of specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States severed diplomatic relations shortly after the 1979 revolution, when Iranian militant students attacked the US embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
Long-standing tensions between the two countries intensified in 2018 after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and the world powers and imposed sanctions on Iran that have a severe impact on its economy.
Another significant escalation came this year after the US military killed Iranian General Qasem Solejmani and Abu Mahdi Muhandis, a member of the Iraqi militia leadership, on January 3.
On January 8, Iran fired a number of missiles at bases in Iraq, where the Americans operate.
The United States has long admitted that dozens of American soldiers have been injured.
Israel sees Iran as its main enemy, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a major opponent of the 2015 international nuclear agreement with Iran.
According to the Israeli prime minister, Iran is trying to develop an atomic bomb, which Iran denies.
Harry in the footsteps of Princess Diana († 36)! Where is Meghan?
Diana was unique in being able to grab people's hearts. In January 1997, it caused a stir when it visited Africa and especially the minefield. The pictures of him wearing a protective suit and a shield on his face have become iconic. And even then, no one could have guessed that a few months later, the princess of human hearts would exhale for the last time in a tragic car accident in Paris.
Now her younger son Harry has scored when, after 22 years, he has gone to the same place as her. He went to the demining station in Diric, Angola, also put on a special protective suit and looked very thoughtful. He certainly did not resist the memories of his beloved mother, whom he lost at the age of only 13.
Harry gave a speech on the spot, praising the efforts of the Halo Trust, which is working to destroy minefields and other explosives in war-torn countries. "Minefields are the unhealed wounds of war. By clearing them, we can help the community find peace with opportunities," he said, calling for saving and preserving wildlife and the local river as a source of water. After this visit, the Duke of Sussex moved to Huamba to rename the local orthopedic center after his famous mother, Princess Diana.
He did not forget to mention her in his official Instagram account: "The Duke is honored to visit a place and community that were so important to his mother, to get acquainted with their tireless mission and to speak to all whom (Diana) felt most they needed to be heard, even though the problem wasn't exactly popular worldwide, "the Sussex Royal Instagram post appeared.
But royal fans may freeze that he did not take his wife Meghan (38) and their son Archie (4 months) on such an expedition to remember Diana. They both have a separate program from Harry since Wednesday, probably to protect them. After all, taking a little baby to a minefield doesn't sound very safe, and Harry doesn't want to endanger his beloved family at any cost.
The carmaker TPCA has extended the shutdown of production, now until May 25
Cologne-based carmaker Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile (TPCA) has again extended production shutdown due to coronavirus.
Production lines are scheduled to resume on Monday, May 25 morning.
The launch will be accompanied by dozens of hygienic measures, said car spokesman Tomáš Paroubek.
The production has stood due to the coronavirus pandemic since the evening of March 18.
The company originally intended to restore it on Monday, May 18.
According to Paroubek, the reason for extending the outage is closed borders and closed dealerships, so there is no one to sell cars.
According to Paroubek, the company will produce 100 percent from the beginning, ie in two shifts.
Coronavir affects key company markets, such as Italy, the United Kingdom and Spain.
Mayor Michael Kašpar (Change for Kolín) said that the shutdown of production in TPCA is not affected by life in the city.
"It was obvious from the beginning, the city was empty.
But gradually the streets are filling up, especially now from Monday, when it has become very loose.
So the city is full, "said Kaspar.
According to him, there are no complications even with foreign workers who stayed in hostels.
"In those two months, we had to solve almost no problem," said Kašpar.
For example, Škoda Auto from Mladá Boleslav, which also discontinued production due to the coronavirus crisis, resumed production on Monday, April 27, in all three of its production plants in the Czech Republic.
None of the plants operate at 100 percent capacity.
The resumption of production at Škoda was accompanied by more than 80 hygiene measures.
On the night from Monday to Tuesday, the third, ie night shift, took place in Mladá Boleslav and Kvasiny for the first time after the resumption of production.
TPCA currently employs about 2,500 people and the company is one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and also an employer in the Kolín region.
Line D will be supervised by a new metro architect, bringing experience from the London Underground
The Prague transport company has chosen an architect who will oversee the design of the metropolitan metro. Anna Švarc will become her from October, her primary task will be the appearance of the new line D, but the existing station will also be in charge. According to her, the metro cannot be seen only as a transport structure, traveling by underground should also bring an aesthetic experience.
The Czech architect, who participated in, for example, the reconstruction of three London Underground stations, won a tender announced by the Prague Transport Company (DPP).
In addition to the tender, another 14 applicants took part. "The selection process included a cover letter and a CV. Probably decided by my previous practice from London, where I created a kind of aesthetic manual for the local tube in a team of three people," explains the new metro architect. According to her, her practice from the Institute of Planning and Development of the Capital City of Prague could also decide. of Prague.
The metro is not only perceived as a functional transport structure. Stations should also have aesthetic value.
"I have ideas about how the metro will change, how the space will improve, but I will only find out how it will actually take place in the coming weeks, when a transport company will introduce me to its ideas," says Švarc.
"This is not a series of dogmas, but rather recommendations, the aim of which is primarily to maintain the context of all stations in the event that they are reconstructed," the design manual explains.
Whether a similar tool is also a way to improve public space in the Prague metro is a question. The Prague metro is specific. "I really don't know yet if the manual is ideal or if a personality can cover it," Švarc concludes.
The cancer killed the bride shortly after the wedding: She left a message for her family
Gemma Sisson had been battling insidious cancer for more than two years, and when she seemed to have beaten the cancer, the disease resounded.
The 39-year-old woman, who loved bodybuilding, ended up in a bed in a hospice, where she still managed to marry the love of her life.
Unfortunately, she succumbed to the disease.
A few hours after her death, a shocking message appeared to her Facebook account on the social network.
Gemma Sisson from Leeds, England, loved bodybuilding.
With a friend Ricky Moore, with whom she had lived for more than 16 years, they traveled to competitions around the world.
The 39-year-old woman played sports and lived a healthy life, yet in April 2018 she was diagnosed with cancer.
Gemma began an exhausting treatment, radiotherapy, hoping to recover.
After months of treatment, Gemma did appear to have overcome the cancer, but in August 2019, the cancer returned, this time invading the spine.
According to the British daily Daily Mirror, the bodybuilder and personal trainer underwent a ten-hour spine operation and then resumed drastic treatment.
But everything was in vain.
Earlier this year, on her 39th birthday, doctors told her she had a few months to live.
In April, the handsome blonde finally decided to go to a hospice in Leeds, where she was visited at any moment by her family, who even arranged a wedding for her with her love Ricky.
The marriage lasted two months.
Ricky took Gemma to the restaurant for their last month on their two-month anniversary.
Four days later, Gemma died in his arms.
Just hours after her death, a post Gema wrote for her family appeared on her social media account.
"If this was published, it means that I finally died after weeks of fighting too long.
Although I will have a broken heart to leave my loved ones here, I will be so happy to get rid of what this terrible disease has caused me.
I can't thank Ricky enough, who was by my side the whole time and gave me a huge amount of love and support during that terrible time, "she wrote on the social network, adding that the pain and suffering finally stopped and she found peace.
"I am also grateful for all the support I have received from all my followers on the social network," she wrote, adding that everyone should respect their life and live it to the fullest.
The first Miss Christ finally went to herself: She lost a few pounds and immediately looked out
The first modern miss from 1989, Ivana Christová (49), had problems with overweight for many years, which caused her not only physical problems, but especially mental ones. She suffered because she has changed a lot since the time of Miss Czechoslovakia. But now it seems that she took the reproaches to heart and set out to fight with extra pounds. Although it's a long run.
She used to be a first-class beauty who also conquered Paris. But thirty years have passed since then and Ivana Christová can only remember the beauty contest. Not only because of her fame, but also because of how thin she was.
Over time, she decided not to follow the strict modeling rules that dictated that she be as slimest as possible and often not eat. She decided to stop listening and began to indulge in what she wanted.
But she went from starvation to overeating, which was immediately reflected in her figure. In addition, Kila tried to disguise herself with various loose clothing, which, however, added to the size of the plump shapes.
Now it looks like Ivana really went inside. She visibly lost weight, began to dress tastefully and appropriately to her fuller figure.
She surprised everyone present at the baptism of Miloš Zapletal's book (75), that she looked again and has the features of a charming brunette who entered history in 1989 not only as the first Miss winner after the revolution, but also by the controversy her victory provoked.
Christová will forever be the first winner of beauty, but also the very first to which the spectators in the Palace of Culture and Sports in Ostrava whistled as a sense of deprivation when she put on the crown.
"A parody of justice." A scientist warned of cancer from pollution, sitting in a Turkish base
Between 2011 and 2015, Sik and other scientists participated in a study commissioned by the Turkish Ministry of Health. It concluded that water, soil and food pollution in some industrial areas in the west of the country was linked to an increased incidence of cancer among local people.
The researchers mentioned in particular the Dilovasi industrial zone, which is located about 80 kilometers from Istanbul and where a number of chemical and metallurgical plants are located. According to them, people living in its vicinity suffer from cancer far more often than the international average.
Erdogan takes revenge for the coup, despite international criticism
It seemed to Sik that, despite the clear conclusions of the study, the government was not taking any action. He therefore wrote several articles about the research in the opposition daily Cumhuriyet. Authorities then began to prosecute him for disclosing classified information.
"The study clearly showed the extent to which water resources were contaminated with toxic substances," Sik told reporters after the verdict. "The court ruling shows that the results of studies that directly concern public health can be concealed. This is unacceptable," the scientist added.
"The Turkish authorities should investigate this important public health problem instead of prosecuting people who sound the alarm," said Andrew Gardner of the Turkish branch of AI.
Environmental and human rights organizations have long accused the Turkish government of not enforcing environmental regulations, despite the rapid development of industry in certain regions.
Following the failed coup of 2016, the regime of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan launched a large wave of arrests. There are now almost 80,000 people behind bars, including a number of Cumhuriyet employees. Authorities also suspended or fired 150,000 civil servants and members of the armed forces altogether.
Opposition and human rights organizations have accused the government of using the coup attempt to persecute their opponents. However, the authorities defend themselves by saying that these are measures necessary to ensure national security.

The Slovenians also defeated the Polish world champions and are in the finals of the European Championships
Slovenian volleyball players will play a sensational title for the European title. With the support of almost 12,000 rioting fans in Ljubljana, the reigning two-time world champions defeated the Poles 3: 1 and are the first finalists.
It will be decided on Friday between France and Serbia who will be challenged at the culmination in Sunday in Paris.
The Slovenian team was much more compact in the semifinals than the Polish world champions. These included only the beginning of the opening set and, fortunately, the ending of the second set, but the domestic volleyball players outperformed themselves and of the players in the red and white jersey, only a native of Cuba, León, scored.
On the other hand, in the home line-up, both smashers Čebulj and Urnaut introduced themselves in life form, as well as the second universal Štern, who soon replaced the indistinct Gasparini. The Poles paid for the fact that they had won all previous matches on this Euro sovereignly, while the Slovenes gained confidence after difficult battles in the playoffs with the Bulgarians and the Russians.
With the Poles in August this year, the Slovenes lost in the Olympic qualification in Gdansk 1: 3, but at home they retaliated. But now Stožica will leave the sold-out Ljubljana arena. After today, however, they have a certain second medal in history, in Paris they can improve the unexpected silver from the European Championships four years ago.
At the previous European Championship, the Slovenians finished eighth, behind the Czech national team.
Traveler Sigismund or General Boček. The Senate handed out commemorative medals
Ninety-six-year-old Boček, who was a British Air Force fighter during World War II, thanked on behalf of all those awarded for the medals. "The Senate was one of the first not to forget war veterans," he said. "The award I received today also belongs to my friends who are no longer with us," he added.
In his speech, Kubera warned against the division of society. "Let's not forget our roots, which, whether we like it or not, connect and shape us all. It is from these values that our successful present is based," said Kubera.
The awards were cardiologist and the most cited Czech scientist Renata Cífková, long-term rector of Tomas Bata University in Zlín Petr Sáha, geologist, writer and traveler and popularizer of science Václav Cílek, chairman of the Czech Biathlon Association and vice president of the World Biathlon Union Jiří Hamza and František Paštěka. The upper house appreciated his heroism - in January this year, he saved the lives of his neighbor and his two-year-old granddaughter when he pulled them out of a burning car. Former chairmen of the upper chamber Libuše Benešová and Milan Štěch also received medals.
Together with Jiří Hanzelka, Zikmund undertook a number of travel expeditions around the world, during which they gathered a number of documentary material. Fištejn was a commentator and director of Radio Free Europe, and now works with the public media. Steigerwald also works as a playwright and screenwriter, and musician Kocáb was the head of the parliamentary commission to oversee the deportation of Soviet troops.
The medal was awarded to Luboš Perek, an astronomer and head emeritus of the UN Office on Space Affairs, in advance on the occasion of his 100th birthday in July. By the end of the year, the Czech native and the first US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and the British philosopher and political scientist Roger Scruton, who, among other things, participated in the activities of the so-called underground university during the communist regime in the former Czechoslovakia, are to receive the same award.
Insects are up to sixty times less than 40 years ago
No other animal class is represented in nature more than insects. Beetles, butterflies and other species make up more than half of life on Earth. But there are growing reports that the insect kingdom is shrinking radically. Another scientific study on the subject was published this week, and she said the situation was even more serious than humanity had ever realized.
The study is based on field research in a tropical rainforest in Puerto Rico, in which American scientists copied a similar survey from 1976. As they write at the beginning of the report, insects are "ten to sixty times less" in the rainforest today. This is a decrease in the entire population, ie not the number of species, and the research concerned not only insects, but all arthropods. Due to the extinction of insects, the population of other fauna, which is dependent on insects in the food chain, such as birds, frogs or lizards, is also thinning.
The authors of the research put their conclusions directly related to climate change. According to them, the average air temperature in the rainforest has risen by two degrees Celsius over the last thirty years, and warming has become the driving force behind the collapse of the food chain. According to the author's team, the study shows that the impact of climate change on tropical ecosystems may be much greater than previously thought.
A major article about the report was published in the Washington Post on Monday, which reports the new findings as hyperalarmatic in the headline. "It's one of the most troubling articles I've ever read," entomologist David Wagner of the University of Connecticut told the paper, quoting him as an independent expert.
Insect extinction also affects Europe. "In our country, the decrease is also an order of magnitude," points out Lukáš Čížek from the Institute of Entomology of the Academy of Sciences. According to him, however, in addition to climate change, it is also necessary to take into account the changes in the landscape, which play a significant role in Europe. "In our country, it only runs for a significantly longer time than in Puerto Rico," adds Čížek to the explanation of why scientists were able to measure such a rapid decline in the rainforest compared to the 1970s.
French candidate for Oscar The Poor will launch the Be2Can show

The chairman of the police unions, Štěpánek, resigned, he wants to live as a free man
The chairman of the Independent Police Trade Union, Milan Štěpánek, has decided to resign. This was stated on Friday by Czech Radio - Radiožurnál. Štěpánek has been leading the unions since 2005. He will be the chairman of the unions for another two months. He will remain with the police even after leaving the head of the union.
"I can confirm that this week I handed over my written resignation to the presidency, after which I will continue to hold office for another two months," Štěpánek told Radiožurnál. "I have decided as a free man who does not want to be attached to a trade union forever. And who wants to live a quieter life," he said of the reasons for leaving.
The independent trade union of the Police of the Czech Republic associates members and employees of the security forces or employees of the Ministry of the Interior. Among other things, the union took part in police protests against budget cuts or petitions for better conditions for the security forces. In 2011, for example, he got into a dispute with the then Minister of the Interior, Radek John, and organized a petition for his resignation. The governing coalition leadership later agreed to John's departure.
Salaries in healthcare will increase by a maximum of five percent next year.
According to Vojtěch, a larger increase is unrealistic
Salaries in healthcare could increase by a maximum of five percent next year, said Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch (for YES) in Václav Moravec's Questions on Czech Television.
He considers the demand of trade unionists for an increase of up to 15 percent unrealistic.
He also said that the state should try to be self-sufficient in providing protective equipment.
According to him, hospitals now have their supplies.
"I think that the increase (in salaries) can be somewhere up to five percent," the minister said.
According to him, it is necessary to reflect the current situation where, since March, the coronavirus pandemic and the government's regulation against its spread have intervened in the selection of the insurance pandemic.
The income of insurance companies fell at that time.
"I get a 15 percent increase unrealistic at the moment," said Vojtech.
According to the data of the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (ÚZIS), the average monthly earnings of a doctor in acute inpatient care will probably reach 88,312 crowns this year, and nurses 47,498 crowns.
The difference between the salary of nurses in state hospitals and the salary of other founders will be up to seven thousand crowns.
The IHIS data also show that the number of nurses in hospitals has stopped.
According to data from the Czech Statistical Office, the average wage in the Czech Republic in 2019 was CZK 34,125.
Trade union representatives said in June that they would demand a minimum increase of ten percent for 2021, ideally 15 percent.
They criticize the long-term significant difference between the earnings of doctors and nurses in state hospitals, which must follow the salary scales, and the contractual wages in city, regional or private hospitals.
They therefore also demand that salary scales be uniform for health professionals.
For nurses this year, the difference will reach up to seven thousand crowns per month.
For example, for doctors last year, wages grew faster than wages.
According to the president of the Czech Dental Chamber, Roman Šmucler, trade unions should perceive what the current situation is.
Due to the effects of the covid epidemic, the Chamber of Deputies recently approved an increase in this year's state budget deficit to a record 500 billion crowns, of which 1.75 billion is to go to the remuneration of health professionals in hospitals and social services.
According to Šmucler, the council of health care providers does not agree with a general increase in salaries next year.
According to him, the remuneration should be decided by the hospitals and medical facilities themselves, and the extra money should go to them through a payment decree.
Vojtěch also stated that hospitals currently have enough protective equipment.
Pavel Švagr, chairman of the State Material Reserves Administration (SSHR), said this week that the administration does not currently own a single protective medical device.
Awaiting completion of tenders.
According to Vojtěch, suppliers in the world are now better able to deliver goods than in March, when they were bought out.
According to him, the state should try to be as self-sufficient as possible and buy from Czech companies as well.
Petra Černocká changed her image and did well! She was rejuvenated in blond hair
The film Saxana Petra Černocká (69) looks absolutely fantastic for her age. Although she will celebrate her life anniversary in November, she has never looked like a retiree. And now she helped. She changed her image until her colleagues did not recognize her.
Actress Petra Černocká never looked like a typical grandmother who had her hair woven in gray, wore sedentary things and went out into society sporadically. She has always taken care of herself, and the older she gets, the more she can untie her eyesight.
Fortunately, she has not succumbed to the trend of plastic surgery and takes care of her skin with the help of good old indulon. And her anti-wrinkle recipe pays off. But now she had changed her hair color and peered out completely.
When she came to the social event, where celebrities said goodbye to summer, no one could meet Peter. Not only did she have lighter and shorter hair, but she was also dressed in a yellow jacket that brightened her even more.
Ladies should learn from Saxana how not to underestimate the fact that even at the age of seventy they can risk their appearance. And it paid off for Petra, she looks like a maximum of fifty.
Lucie Bílá's father did not support her at all. You will not believe what she should have eaten!
Who does not know that the national treasure of Lucie Bílá (53) is the original profession of a seamstress and her real name is Hana Zaňáková, she probably does not live in the Czech Republic. But the singer herself now revealed that she almost worked in a glassworks!
Lucie Bílá knew from a relatively young age that she wanted to be a singer. Her love for singing was born when she performed as a little girl in a cultural house in her hometown of Otvovice, where the warbler still lives.
"And I will remember exactly where my mother sat. At that time, a singer was born in me," she admitted for Impulse radio.
But her father was a little worried about his daughter's future and advised her to take the path of a craft that has a golden bottom.
"Dad always said, 'Craft girl, craft. Walk your feet on the ground!' He even persuaded me if I didn't want to go to the local glassworks. The glassworks is no longer working, I'm fine. I'm a trained seamstress and I make various rosaries and pendants from beads at home, which I then auction off and buy wheelchairs for money, "she added with a laugh.
Děčín Zoo is happy with a small macaque
"Our gang currently has seven members. Its youngest member was born on August 17, she was born by a female Buffy and is her fifth cub, the father is a male Hitam. For the first days after giving birth, the female wore a cub firmly pressed to her body and for a long time did not want to show the world. "If she gave birth to a male or a female. At about three weeks of age, the cub began to put it off for a short time, and the nurses have known for a few days that it is a male," said zoo spokeswoman Alena Houšková, adding that the Děčín Zoo had successfully bred 12 young of this species.
Crested macaques are the so-called endemics of the island of Sulawesi, which means that they do not live in the wild elsewhere in the world. A typical feature is black fur and a tuft on the head, after which they have a name. Crested macaques live in rainforests, especially at lower altitudes.
Like most primates, they feed on plant and animal foods. The menu is dominated by the fruits of forest trees, which complement the flowers and leaves. He solves the need for protein by eating small arthropods, larvae and, to a lesser extent, bird eggs and chicks.
"Leaving aside the natural enemies, which are pythons, everything else has been written down by man. The locals hunt macaques as a favorite prey with tasty meat and for fur. Burning and felling of the rainforest is fatal for these animals," the spokeswoman added. .
Unexplained death of a little girl († 8) in the Příbram region: Viník is not punished
Unexplained cases are called "monuments" in criminal slang. But even these are investigated if new information emerges after years. Especially when it comes to the death of a child. Criminalist Jiří Markovič was able to investigate the murder of two girls in Prague's Prokopské údolí valley, which was 12 years old at the time, in 1980. "The case of 1955? It will be difficult, very difficult. It would like to find a file to begin with, it no longer has to exist, to talk to those who investigated it. There is always hope, but it would be really difficult," says Markovic.
Under the previous regime, the public was not very informed about violent crimes, but according to Markovic, this certainly does not mean that they would be investigated laxly. "It always depended on specific people," the detective thinks. The problem may be that materials from the 1950s may be destroyed, although open cases should not be shredded.
Soldiers could take over the clever clever quarantine.
We're ready, they say
"Smart quarantine works, there is room for improvement of course.
We'll discuss it with the military tonight.
The army works perfectly and the question is whether they should not manage the whole thing again, "the Prime Minister said on Sunday in his Facebook program Chow People.
According to him, it is not possible to sufficiently connect IT systems and hygienic stations, which must gradually switch to more modern methods of operation.
According to the Prime Minister, the problems were in the Moravian-Silesian Region, where there are some of the current outbreaks of the epidemic.
Ministry of Defense spokesman Jan Pejšek told ČTK that he had no information about Sunday's meeting and that the government should discuss the matter on Monday.
According to him, the army is ready for this step.
The clever quarantine project was taken over by the Ministry of Health on May 25.
Until then, the clever quarantine was led by a 90-member central management team set up under the army as an advisory body to the government, led by former Deputy Minister Roman Prymula.
The rubbing project was criticized on Sunday by the Minister of the Interior Jan Hamáček (CSSD).
He also suggested that he could be taken over again by the army.
The government's Commissioner for IT and Digitization, Vladimír Dzurilla, who is in charge of the project, also previously admitted shortcomings in the project.
"The system is working, but it is still being worked on.
For twenty years it was created independently and unsystematically, now we are trying to unify it in a few months.
It's not galloping.
People on the go, poor hygiene on the go adapt the new systems and actually catch the mistakes, "he said.
Ostrava Mayor Macura will not run again, because he does not want to "get lost in politics"
The current mayor of Ostrava, Tomáš Macura (YES), will not run in the next municipal elections.
The reason is the effort to "not fool around in politics," he told the Respekt.cz server.
Macura, who is also a member of the YES movement board, has been the mayor of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the municipal elections in 2018, the candidate of the ANO movement led by Ostrava won almost a third of the voting votes.
Macura originally wanted to be in office for only four years.
"I thought I would last one term and with that business experience I could turn everything over here and get it on its feet," he told Respekt.
He added that he had been persuaded to some extent for the second term.
"It simply came to our notice then.
I don't want to fool around in that politics, "added Macura, who described himself in the interview as a difficult introvert who does not like frequent contact with people.
According to Respekt, Macura's possible end to the YES movement has been speculated for some time.
The server recalls that Macura has repeatedly criticized the YES movement, for example for its alliance with the SPD movement or for supporting Miloš Zeman in the presidential election.
As one of the few personalities, ANO supported Zeman's opponent Jiří Drahos in the elections.
Macura has no plans to leave the YES movement, which he joined in 2017.
"As long as I feel that I can change something in the movement, that it is not a completely futile fight and that no one is messing with it, I have no immediate motive to end it," he told Respekt.
Macura, 56, graduated from the University of Economics in Prague.
Before becoming mayor of Ostrava in 2014, Macura worked, among other things, as the director of the manufacturer of the pharmaceutical company Walmark.
He also sat on the bodies of other companies.
Uber will return to Brno offering transport services
The company Uber, which offers transport services, will return to Brno at the end of July.
It is a consequence of a change in the law, Petr Kratochvíl (ODS), Brno's councilor for transport, said in a press release on Thursday.
Taxi drivers protested against Uber in Brno, pointing out that Uber does not meet conditions such as designation as a taxi or taximeter.
However, the change in the law has changed the conditions for operating ordinary taxis as well as alternative ones since July.
In recent weeks, Kratochvíl has had several meetings with representatives of Uber.
"Based on them, this company decided to return to Brno with its services at the end of July this year.
This step is the result of a change in the law, which allows this company to operate legally.
The city was acquainted with this change and we believe that the company will operate its services within the given limits, "said Kratochvíl.
Uber worked in Brno in the past.
Taxi drivers protested against him for not marking vehicles as a taxi or missing a taximeter.
The court issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting Uber from driving in the city.
Brno originally supported taxi drivers, but last year at the end of the year, Mayor Markéta Vaňková (ODS) stated that the city would like to take steps to make Uber work in Brno.
According to later court decisions, Uber could travel in Brno, but the company did not use it.
He will now return based on a change in the law.
Since July, it has been the case that, in addition to classic taxis with a flashlight and a taximeter, it is easier to operate a transport service ordered and paid exclusively through mobile applications.
Too boisterous celebration in Brno: a flying chair landed a meter away from a man on the sidewalk
An office chair flew from the fourth floor of the apartment building on Saturday evening in Brno and landed about a meter from the sidewalk.
At that moment, a pedestrian followed him, who immediately called the guards.
Immediately upon arrival at the address in the western part of the city, the patrol noticed an open window, under which a chair still lay, and a few cans and cigarette butts beside it.
"The noise coming from the room on the fourth floor indicated that a rather noisy celebration was taking place inside.
The police officers went out into the hallway to the apartment and asked the three young men present, aged 26 to 29, for an explanation, "said spokesman Jakub Ghanem.
Young Czechs think they can do it with money. The survey did not confirm this
"Thus, it turns out that young Czechs have a slightly greater confidence in their knowledge of finance than reality. In this case, women and respondents without a high school diploma had a significantly higher share of bad answers," said KRUK director Jaroslava Palendalová.
Men and young high school or university students are more likely to believe in their knowledge of financial products.
Young Czechs learn the most about the functioning of financial matters from their parents (37 percent), through self-study on the Internet (23 percent) and only in the third place from school teaching (21 percent).
Women mainly consult with their parents about financial issues, while men tend to look for information on the Internet. Obtaining financial information from parents predominates in all age groups of young people, regardless of their educational attainment or personal income. Prospectuses of financial institutions, professional magazines and publications have a practically minimal effect.
"Once again, the importance of raising children is shown by their parents, who represent authority in all major areas of life. Therefore, the key level is the financial literacy of parents, who pass on their knowledge and experience to their offspring," said Palendalová.
94 percent of young people prefer savings and investments.
Unequivocally, young people are asked whether it is better to save and buy, for example, their own house or apartment, or to enjoy and spend money rather, without savings and their own housing.
94 percent of respondents support the strategy of savings and investments in tangible fixed assets. This applies across all age groups of young people, regardless of their education, social status or current personal income.
The survey strategy is then 100% supported by people in a marriage with two or more children and employees in the public sector. On the other hand, people living alone and with an income of over 30,000 crowns a month want to enjoy themselves.
Strict but fair, we enjoy the clock! This is how Benešov high school students see their favorite cantor writer
Humanism should be present in every good book, believes Pavel Hoza. A high school teacher of Czech and history, he is also a poet, novelist and awakener of literary life in a small town.
Bohuslav Reynek comes to mind Pavel Hoza's texts. His poetry, his paintings. Bare trees, whitish country houses, quivering grass, shepherds, sheep and goats, old roads and the people who walked on them for centuries. Mourning, cursing, blessing. This contemporary successor of Reynek teaches Czech, literature and history at the grammar school in Benešov, runs an equivalent of the Prague Viola in the local Café and annually organizes the Benešov Literary Festival.
Babiš discusses the request to dismiss Rafaj with the CSSD
On Monday, Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO) plans to discuss with the coalition Social Democrats a request for a motion to dismiss the head of the Antimonopoly Office (ÚOHS) Petr Rafaj.
Non-profit organizations and the Ústí nad Labem Region also called on Rafaj to dismiss the government's anti-corruption council.
The Social Democrats say the exchange at the head of the office is appropriate.
According to ČTK, Rafaj was not invited to the Government Office on Monday.
His second term ends in the middle of next year, and by law he cannot be appointed a third time.
His dismissal is in the competence of President Miloš Zeman.
In addition to the invitation to non-profit organizations, the Prime Minister also received a letter with a similar request from the Ústí Region.
The reason is supposed to be, among other things, Rafaj's recent cases.
Last week, the prime minister refused to comment on the request, saying that he would get acquainted with the materials and that the government parties would take "some opinion" on this.
He also said that he had not yet discussed the challenges with the president, he did not have an appointment with him in the near future.
According to the statement of the Office, there is no reason to appeal, because Rafaj was not charged with anything.
Last week, the IHNED.cz and Aktuálně.cz servers wrote that the police were interested in Rafaj's meetings with President Jiří Čunk.
The meetings connected, among other things, with the decision to compete for the project of the controversial new Zlín hospital for eight billion, which Čunek is pushing hard for.
Cunek admitted the meetings, according to him they solved his "senate activities" together.
Rafaj speaks similarly.
The Ústí nad Labem Regional Council called for the government to dismiss Rafaj at the end of June.
It also calls for a reform of the Office's decision-making mechanisms.
According to Deputy Governor for Transport Jaroslav Komínek, the Office's decision-making on public procurement is not transparent and has signs of arbitrariness.
Last March, police intervened at the antitrust office over a toll tender.
In June this year, the Aktuálně.cz server pointed out that Rafaj uses apartments written for the company of the influential behind-the-scenes player of the CSSD, Alexander Čuba.
However, a deposit of 3.5 million for an apartment in Brno was paid from Rafaj's account.
Rafaj has been the Chairman of the Office for the Protection of Competition since July 9, 2009, and for the second term of office the President appointed a former Member of the Social Democracy in June 2015.
In less than a year, Rafaj's second six-year term will expire.
The Antimonopoly Office Act states that the President may remove the President of the Office at the suggestion of the Government.
He may be dismissed only if he has not held office for more than six months or seriously undermines the dignity of his office or the independence and impartiality of the Office.

Employees collapsed in the Blane library.
Air conditioning will help
The new technology will cost 740,000 and will be in operation in the second half of August.
"It is good news for me.
We go to the library in the center of Blansko regularly with three children.
In the warm months, however, it was practically impossible to stand there.
It was terribly hot and bad air.
Ventilation did not help.
That is why I am happy for air conditioning, "said one of the Blane readers, Petr Novotný.
According to the director of the library, Lukáš Dlapa, the temperatures in the building often climbed to over thirty degrees.
The south wall of the building is glazed and functions as a greenhouse on sunny days.
"In addition, the sun rests on it for most of the day due to the curvature of the building.
At the same time, it is a big problem to ventilate individual departments, because the windows must be closed overnight for safety reasons.
We often have it in the library since the morning to thirty degrees, "said Dlapa.
The worst was the study and reading room on the third floor.
And upstairs there are exhibition rooms and a director's office.
The unpleasant climate was also in the children's ward, which is located under the roof of the building.
"On several occasions, librarians collapsed at work and ended in incapacity for work.
The problem also regularly arose in the cultural room at lectures attended by dozens of people.
After a few minutes, it was impossible to breathe there, "Dlapa remarked.
Originally, the representatives of the city wanted to make air conditioning in all areas of the library this year.
In the end, there will be only three circuits out of five.
"Due to limited funding, air conditioning will have only the most problematic premises.
Study and reading room on the third floor.
Furthermore, the cultural room and the children's department one floor up, "said Jiří Svoboda from the Blane investment department.
He added that in the first phase, last autumn, the workers installed air conditioning in the mentioned premises and modified the electrical installation.
Approximately 360 thousand crowns.
The Blansko Municipal Library has almost three thousand registered readers.
Of this, he is about nine hundred to fifteen years old.

Crawford returns to the game
Not every infected athlete will come out with the truth.
Especially when it comes to NHL players who are silent about the health of players like a grave and don't publish anything at all.
He was one of the few to leave the Crawford series.
The 35-year-old native of Montreal was present only at the first training session, and has been missing from the line-up ever since.
"I would like to inform you all that I have tested positive on Covid-19 and have spent the last fortnight locked in my house because of this," he said.
Fans no longer have to worry about his health.
Crawford is ready to return to full load.
"It 's amazing to be back.
I will do everything to get in shape as soon as possible, "he added.
An experienced goalkeeper won two Stanley Cups with Chicago, and has been a fixed part of the goal area for the tenth season in a row.

A tragic traffic accident occurred on Friday on a straight section between Přerov and the village of Kokory. The 28-year-old Fabia driver failed to drive here and drove off the road. The car overturned on the roof and he was wedged under it. He did not survive the injuries he suffered.

Thousands of people protested against the prime minister in Israel
Thousands of Israelis have protested in several parts of the country against unemployment, corruption and the way Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is addressing the coronary crisis.
The demonstrations took place, among other things, in front of Netanyahu's private villa in Caesarea, near his official residence or in a park in Tel Aviv.
Protests have been held regularly in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv for several weeks.
Their participants are demanding Netanyahu's resignation because of a trial in which he is accused of corruption and fraud, and also because the government is dealing with another wave of the coronavirus epidemic.
"Bibi, go home," according to the AP, one of the protesters wrote on his banner, referring to Netanyahu's well-known nickname.
"Everyone sees that the emperor has lost his clothes," said another.
Netanyahu, 70, is Israel's first prime minister to be in office.
He is charged in three cases of corruption, fraud and abuse of trust.
He denies all the allegations and calls them witch hunts.
According to local media, the trial can take up to three years, with over 300 witnesses being summoned.
The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed in nearly 60,500 people in Israel, which has a population of about nine million.
About 455 people died in connection with the infection.
The Israeli government introduced quarantine measures in March to help reduce daily increases in those infected.
However, after the gradual easing of restrictions from the end of April, the number of infected people began to rise significantly again, especially at the end of June.
Netanyahu's critics claim that the government did not help enough, for example, self-employed people affected by quarantine measures.
The protesters are also annoyed by the fact that the government is issuing conflicting instructions in the fight against coronavirus.
Step back, he called on Schiller for words about the opposition dirt Czernin
"I consider it completely unacceptable for a member of the Czech government to use such a totalitarian statement anywhere, especially in the parliament," Czernin wrote in an open letter to Schiller.
Her words caused a stir during the discussion of the draft constitutional lawsuit against President Miloš Zeman. The opposition did not get enough votes and the draft constitutional lawsuit, which the Senate came up with, was dropped by deputies.
"I get dozens of messages from people I don't know. There's not a single vote in support of this lawsuit. There are messages in support of the president and messages like taxpayers' money is spent here, empty straw is threshed here. And I even dare, I don't use it. hard expressions, one of them quote: It's opposition and senatorial filth, "said the finance minister.
"These terms used the Nazis to be citizens of Jewish origin and the Communists to use their political opponents. It is totalitarian rhetoric, without a shred of respect for man and opinion," wrote TOP 09 Deputy Prime Minister Czernin, who will fight for the post of party chairman Adamovou.
"I quoted one of the many reports I received dozens of during the House. Their common denominator was the disgust at the constant personal dishonesty we witness daily in domestic politics, which was also the main motive for Thursday's House meeting. applies to itself, it surprises me, "Schillerová responded for ČTK.
The driver smashed the car against a tree and died.
The body had to be cut out of the wreck by firefighters
The tragic accident happened around 11 pm near Neveklov on a narrow district leading from the Slapy dam.
The driver apparently flew down into the woods at considerable speed and smashed the car against a tree.
He died on the spot.
The body had to be rescued from the wreck by firefighters, among other things they cut off the roof.
The circumstances of the accident are being investigated by police officers.
They ordered a forensic autopsy, which should clarify, among other things, whether the man was driving under the influence of alcohol or other addictive substances.
No more wasting and spewing one collection after another.
Pietro Filipi cancels discounts and bets on sustainability
The Czech clothing brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and is embarking on a fundamental change in strategy.
He cancels discounts and no longer wants to spew one collection after another.
The fact that the fashion industry is one of the biggest polluters of the environment is nothing new.
Billions of pieces of clothing end up in incinerators and landfills every year.
However, the view of slow fashion, an often despised approach to dressing, has changed relatively quickly in recent years.
About half of Pietro Filipi's goods were sold at full price.
The other half, which was sold thanks to discounts, will not simply buy.
The company does not want to spit out one collection after another and at the end of each season reduce the price of products below their production price.
Moreover, according to the owner Michal Mička, the times of new and old collections and the blind following of rapidly changing fashion trends are gone.
"Most traders count on discounts when buying goods, so the full price includes a much higher margin.
So it's actually a bit of a scam, "says Pietro Filipi owner Michal Mička.
In addition, the company wants to support the local business with its approach.
"Each of our products is made from carefully selected quality fabrics and designed by local designers.
We emphasize that a large part of our collection consists of so-called basic pieces - ie clothing that is timeless and over-season.
Worldwide, the segment of premium brands in the absence of any discounts is typical, the price of the product simply corresponds to its quality and a discount is not needed, "adds Mička.
Giant graffiti features RAF pilot Kurt Taussig
"The task was to create something to mark the anniversary of the end of the war.
And I remembered our fighter pilot, who fought in the British Royal Air Force in World War II.
The management liked the design, "said Vacek, who finished his work after fourteen days of intensive work.
He used about 300 liters of paint and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplice-Šanov.
He left town when he was 15 years old.
During the war, due to his Jewish origin, the Nazis dragged him to an internment camp, where they kept him for several weeks.
However, thanks to Nicholas Winton's organization, he and his brother managed to avoid a concentration camp.
In 1939, Taussig entered Great Britain, where he volunteered for the Royal Air Force (RAF), and later underwent pilot training in Southern Rhodesia and Palestine, Africa.
He joined combat operations in early 1945.
After the Velvet Revolution, he visited the Czechia and his native Teplice several times, which granted him honorary citizenship.
Forty-six-year-old Kamil Vacek, known to people in the street graphic arts industry under the nickname Camo, has been working with sprays in the streets of Teplice for over 20 years.
He started with graffiti on areas set aside for this purpose by the then mayor Jaroslav Kubera (ODS).
Sparta is really full this year, acknowledges the Hradec Králové back Nedomlel
In his case, the increased motivation is more than understandable. Hradec Králové hockey defender Richard Nedomlel will go to Friday's match against the club where he recently worked. However, the former Spartan is convinced that his teammates will be in a similar situation, even though they have never worn the jersey of the Prague club.
"Everyone wants to go against Sparta," says Hradec Králové before the match of the 5th extra-league round.
Hradec Králové will try to stretch its series of wins, which currently counts three three-point wins in a row. After Kladno, Pilsen, the most appreciated by the fans came on Sunday, Mountfield reached neighboring Pardubice for.
"But we can't look at the matches that were. We need to focus on the matches that await us now and play in them in the same way, if not better," warns the Hradec defender.
The people of Hradec Králové should not look back at last year's balance with Sparta either. They lost in three of the four matches, taking points only once after the victory in Prague after extra time. In addition, Sparta's leadership brought several significant reinforcements in the summer and expects the team to return to the top.
"Sparta has always had quality players, but what we're talking about, they're really busy this year," admits Nedomlel before the first game at the end of this week.
And the other one? Also a nice shift, waiting for Mountfield on Sunday afternoon in Trinec.
XXX Lutz can buy a competitor Kika, the authority allowed. But it has a catch
"The Office for the Protection of Competition has authorized the merger of competitors - XLCEE-Holding GmbH on the one hand, and Kika Nábytek and Lambda Properties Czechia on the other, subject to the fulfillment of structural commitments set in favor of maintaining effective competition," said Martin Švanda, spokesman for the Office.
In addition to the XXX Lutz chain, XLCEE-Holding owns Möbelix stores. If the Kika chain were to be swallowed up, it would occupy too much of the Czech furniture and accessories market. Therefore, he has to sell part of the company he is buying.
XLCEE-Holding also buys Kika branches in other countries where the chain operates, ie in Hungary, Slovakia and Romania. There, too, the transaction must be authorized by the antitrust authorities. XXX Lutz announced the purchase of 22 foreign branches of the Kika chain from the Signa holding in May. Signa took over the bankrupt Kika last year for a symbolic price.
The Kika chain entered the Czech market in 2005 and is number two after the Swedish company IKEA. Before it was taken over by the Austrian company Signa, it belonged to the South African company Steinhoff International Holdings from 2013. She faced problems when she discovered discrepancies in her accounting. Kika has nine stores in the Czech Republic.
XXX Lutz has been operating in the Czech Republic since 2010. In addition to IKEA, Sconto, Jysk and Asko-Nábytek and Kika, it is one of the largest furniture retailers on the domestic market. The Möbelix brand has the same owner. Following the acquisition of Kika's foreign branches, XXX Lutz will already operate over 300 department stores in 12 countries. According to the company's website, its annual turnover is 4.4 billion euros (about 114 billion CZK).
Storm Hanna arrived on the Texas coast
Hurricane Hanna arrived on the southwest coast of the US state of Texas on Saturday afternoon local time (before midnight CET at night).
It hit the Texas island of Padre Island, about 24 kilometers north of Port Mansfield, and weakened to a tropical storm as it moved over the mainland.
However, according to meteorologists, it still poses a great danger to the inhabitants of coastal areas.
It brought with it a strong wind and heavy rainfall; along with local floods, power outages and various property damage, including damaged ships, are reported, according to the AP.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of natural disaster on 32 counties in southwest Texas on Saturday and recommended that people voluntarily evacuate.
The strongest warning was given to people from the coastal strip between Port Mansfield and Mesquite Bay, but in total the element is to hit an area almost 500 kilometers long before gradually moving over northeastern Mexico.
"Although Hanna is now a tropical storm, heavy rain and wind, rising water levels, dangerous surfs and isolated tornadoes can pose a threat," warned the US National Hurricane Center (NHC).
This morning local time (CET afternoon), the storm was moving in the area of the American-Mexican border and was accompanied by a wind of 85 kilometers per hour.
Hanna became the first hurricane of this year's hurricane season in the Atlantic area on Saturday.
It was accompanied by a wind of up to 145 kilometers per hour over the Gulf of Mexico, but as it progressed to the mainland, it gradually weakened to 112 kilometers per hour, which again excluded Hanna from the hurricane category.
Authorities urged locals to weather the storms, not forgetting hygiene measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
Texas is one of the US states most affected by the covid-19 pandemic.
Due to the existing safety measures and the need to observe distances, possible evacuations are also a great challenge.
Temporary shelters were opened in hotels, schools and gyms.
In Hidalgo County, Texas, one of the buildings was also adapted as a shelter for evacuees who tested positive for coronavirus or were otherwise infected.
Local authorities urged all evacuees to take veils and disinfectant gels with them if possible.
"We are far from over.
We are expecting catastrophic floods, "AP quoted Chris Birchfield, who works for the National Meteorological Service (NWS) in Brownsville.
Forecasts suggest that in some places up to 300 millimeters of rainfall could rain in a few hours, in some cases almost 500 millimeters, which, along with rising sea levels, could flood a number of coastal settlements.
Toyota Hydrogen still believes it is preparing a second generation Mirai car
The Toyota Mirai should never be just a concept. Toyota took it so seriously that even though there was virtually no hydrogen infrastructure in the world, it still put it on offer. So not to a completely standard, the customer had to really go for this car on purpose, but no one else offered such a variant at the time.
Toyota boss Takeshi Uchiyamada confirmed at an international conference on hydrogen that a new generation will come next year. Toyota still believes that these cars have a future and will match the price of hybrids within ten years. Of course, this is connected with the development of gas networks. However, the future is connected with hydrogen as well as electricity.
The word hydrogen was often used at the conference with the needs of ecological operation, not of cars, but on the contrary of large tractors, ships, trains, etc. Simply those means of transport that need to overcome long distances in one refueling. Pure battery versions cannot offer this. Thanks to extensive experience and long development, Toyota could find new markets.
It remains to be remembered that, like Toyota, Hyundai also believes in hydrogen propulsion, which now also offers the Nexo hydrogen crossover.

Zeman will grant the rank of general to Colonel Lipek
On Wednesday, President Miloš Zeman will grant the rank of colonel to Colonel Pavel Lipek.
This follows from an overview of the expected events of the Ministry of Defense.
The reason for conferring the rank of brigadier general is Lipka's August appointment as deputy commander of the Alliance's Multinational Division Northeast in Poland.
Lipka still works as the deputy commander of the ground forces of the Czech army.
The government proposed a promotion to Zeman at the end of June.
From the beginning of August, Lipka will replace Brigadier General Karel Řehka in the position of Deputy Commander of the Multinational Division Northeast in Elblag, Poland, which commands units of the Alliance's advanced presence in Poland and the Baltics.
In March, Řehka became the director of the National Office for Cyber and Information Security (NÚKIB).
The government proposed to the president that he grant Lipek the rank of brigadier general.
According to the Act on Professional Soldiers, a higher rank may be granted to a soldier for the period of performing the elected office or for the period of performing a service task that requires the granting of a higher rank.
The position of Deputy Commander of the Alliance Division corresponds to the rank of general.
A soldier to whom a rank has been granted has the same rights and obligations as if he had been appointed to that rank.
However, he is not entitled to a salary adjustment that would correspond to the given rank.
The award of a rank lasts until the reason for which it was granted expires.
"Colonel Lipka demonstrates high professional readiness and is a role model for subordinates.
It plays an important role in fulfilling the tasks of the Czech Armed Forces, including cooperation with foreign partners and ensuring the army's participation in foreign operations, "the Ministry of Defense said in June of the proposal for promotion.
Wednesday's promotion will take place at 12:30 at Prague Castle, with the participation of Defense Minister Lubomír Metnar and Chief of General Staff Aleš Opata.
Technically perfect confusion with a weak scenario. Gemini and Will Smith did not intimidate the criticism
The dystopic sci-fi spectacle Gemini Man boasts an interesting premise - Will Smith will present his younger version in the film. But critics say the story is the weakest part of the film. The film will be shown in Czech cinemas on October 10.
Henry Brogan (Will Smith) is an absolute leader in his field. It kills effectively and without unnecessary questions. But one day he decides to nail his career. Of course, his employers don't like that, who will send another killer to Henry. The catch is that the killer is Henry himself, or more specifically his younger clone made of DNA. Can one determined person win the battle over himself? This time literally.
Three-time Oscar winner Ang Lee was supposed to be a guarantee of quality. Although this is his first sci-fi, he has extensive experience with dramatic action films, as he demonstrated, for example, in the aforementioned Tiger and Dragon or the western Ride with the Devil. Six screenwriters collaborated on the screenplay. The most famous is certainly David Benioff, one of the creators of the highly successful Game of Thrones. According to the first responses, even all this was not enough for a good film.
"Although Ang Lee strives for great things in technical filmmaking, the film itself doesn't have enough character to highlight it," said Fionnuala Hannigan of Screen Daily.
"This unsatisfactory film is less than the sum of all the talents involved. The weak script and plot are held together only by the technological magic of the filmmakers," summed up Stephen Dalton of The Hollywood Reporter.
"Gemini is a case in which a huge amount of work has resulted in an incredibly boring action film," said Peter Deburge, a Variety server reviewer.
"A confused product arising from a bizarre idea," Ella Kemp of IndieWire summed up the film in her review.
"It's hard to care that one man is a double for another when neither behaves like a human," wrote Nicholas Barber of The Wrap.

Hundreds of enslaved children were freed from a religious school in Nigeria
According to the BBC, there were almost five hundred men and boys, Reuters reported, referring to the police commissioner, that there were over three hundred children from the age of five. Some were chained to each other, others were chained to iron rings in the wall.
Kaduna police chief Ali Janga told the BBC that the raid on the school was carried out on the basis of allegations. He called the school a house of horrors. Starving people were held there by force, tortured and sexually abused. They could not leave, there was a razor wire above the walls. According to him, this is a case of slavery.
Several people were detained during the raid, according to police spokesman Jakubu Sabo.
The children told police that they were taken to school by their parents or relatives, saying it was a religious school. "We have identified two children from Burkina Faso, but most were brought here by parents from the Nigerian states in the north," a Sabo spokesman said of the victims' identity. The Nigerian states in the north of the country are predominantly Muslim.
Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal's school pretended to be a religious school for the study of the Qur'an.
The freed were transported to the stadium, where they are provided with help and food. Some have already met with relatives.
The fastest man on the planet missed the tests. I'm not taking anything, he's defending himself
Traditionally, the much-watched battle for the fastest man on the planet will be a hunt for Christian Coleman's silver defender at the World Cup. The 23-year-old American is the world leader in 9.81 seconds and has only lost once this year. However, his start at the peak of the season was threatened due to a case of missed doping tests.
The US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) closed his case in early September without charge for formal reasons. Coleman did not pass three doping tests last year and this year, but not within 12 months. His first offense was dated back to the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) on April 1, 2018, the beginning of the second quarter, but he did not miss the test until June 6. And because the third omission occurred on April 29, 2019, Coleman did not commit an offense in the form of three failed inspections within 12 months.
Coleman argued that he only forgot to update the in-app data for athletes. "I don't take drugs or take anything legal. A lot of athletes use legal creatine or protein powder or various other supplements for faster regeneration. And I don't take anything, I work hard and that's it," he said before the World Cup began.
He suffered the only defeat out of six starts this year in a hundred at the start of the season at the Diamond League in Shanghai, where he was only six thousandths of a second ahead of his compatriot Noah Lyles. He took advantage of Coleman's absence to triumph in the Diamond League final, but will only run two hundred at the World Championships.
On paper, the second fastest competitor with a performance of 9.86 is the 22-year-old Nigerian Divine Oduduru, who has so far only succeeded in American university competitions.
The title will be defended by 37-year-old American Justin Gatlin, who flashed 9.87 in Stanford in June. He ran the last hundred in Zagreb in only 10.29, because he slightly injured his hind thigh muscle.
The circle of favorites also includes South African Akani Simbine, three-time Olympic medalist from Rio Andre de Grasse or European champion Zharnel Hughes. The fastest Jamaican with a time of 9.96 is the 2011 world champion Yohan Blake.
The men's 100 will start on Friday with the preliminary rounds and starts. The semifinals and finals are scheduled for Saturday. The medal will run at 21:15 CEST.
EU countries have coronavirus standards for aviation
European Union countries have agreed on common hygiene standards for air travel to help reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
This was announced by the German Minister of Transport Andreas Scheuer.
Among the agreed standards is keeping a distance or wearing veils in the plane and at the airport, but the middle seats in the aircraft will not have to remain unoccupied.
Reuters reported.
"I am glad that my colleagues have accepted the German proposal for Europe and that we have been able to agree on these uniform standards," Scheuer told the European Aviation Conference.
The German Ministry of Transport then added that the agreement had been concluded by officials and that it still had to be formally approved by the ministers.
The agreed measures include the requirement to cover the mouth and nose of passengers from the age of six, to observe the recommended distance during security checks and check-in at the airport.
Sufficient fresh air must also be guaranteed in aircraft and all information must be available in several languages.
Airlines will also be able to occupy the middle seats.
The common rules agreed by the officials meet at least some of the airlines' requirements.
Different standards caused confusion.

Soldiers are rehearsing, pull the curtains. China is preparing to celebrate the site of the massacre
The military has been rehearsing the parade on recent weekends. Shops in central Beijing had to close and residents near the square were ordered to draw curtains. Military vehicles rolled down the empty streets to the square, and fighter jets circled in the sky.
Several Chinese have told Reuters that they are proud that their country will show its military strength. But one woman said it was hard to deny that the celebrations would upset other states.
Apparently, she came across Taiwan, which China claims and where elections are approaching. But they may also have concerns in the semi-autonomous city of Hong Kong, where thousands of people have repeatedly demonstrated against the administrator-appointed administrator.
The celebrations are also being prepared outside of Beijing. The South China port of Xiamen showed a special light show on Thursday night. Xiamen is located opposite the island of Taiwan and is one of the ten most innovative Chinese cities.
Before the anniversary, the list of forbidden things grows. Drone, balloons, dragons, alcohol, radios and radio-wave equipment are already on it, The Guardian said. He added that the popular Chinese social network Weibo is erasing "harmful political information".
"This is another milestone, another opportunity to show that the Chinese Communist Party remains (by the oar) despite all the predictions," said Maura Cunningham, a historian who deals with China. "This is a time when a party can demonstrate order, control and power," she added.
The People's Republic of China was established in 1949 when the Communists, led by Mao Zedong, won the battle with Chiang Kai-shek's nationalists, who retreated to Taiwan.
In the second half of the 1960s, China underwent a catastrophic communist experiment in the form of the so-called cultural revolution. In June 1989, the regime in Tiananmen Square massacred thousands of pro-democracy protesters, both students and workers.
Since the late 1970s, China has increasingly taken over elements of the capitalist economy. According to critics, it is now a mixture of the worst of communism (one-party monopoly and persecution of the opposition) and (Dickensian) capitalism (labor exploitation).

Trump is considering canceling Chinese stocks in the United States
The administration of US President Donald Trump is considering revoking the license of Chinese companies to trade on the stock markets in the United States. An informed source told Reuters today. Such a move would be a radical escalation of trade tensions between the United States and China. The shares of the companies in question on the New York Stock Exchange immediately went down after the report and withdrew the entire market.
The withdrawal of shares would be part of a broader effort to limit US investment in China, the source added. He confirmed the Bloomberg report, which shortly before caused a shock on the financial markets. Shares of Chinese companies Alibaba Group Holding, JD.com, Pinduoduo, Baidu, Vipshop Holdings, Baozun and IQIYI lost two to four percent.
According to government data from February, the shares of 156 Chinese companies are traded on the US stock exchanges Nasdaq and NYSE. There are also at least 11 state-owned enterprises among them.
Bloomberg pointed out that a precise mechanism has not yet been developed to ensure the withdrawal of shares of Chinese companies from US stock exchanges. A possible plan would have to be approved by Trump, who, however, gave the green light to negotiations on the matter.
China and the United States have been waging a trade war for more than a year, during which they impose tariffs on each other. The dispute between the two countries has negative effects on the world economy and raises fears of a recession in the global economy. Washington is using tariffs to force Beijing to change trade practices and reduce China's trade surplus with the United States.
According to the CNBC television server, trade negotiations between the USA and China should be resumed on October 10. Its goal is to end the trade war.
Former French President Chirac will be buried on Monday, with a public pieta on Sunday
The funeral of former French President Jacques Chirac, who died Thursday at the age of 86, will take place on Monday evening at the Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris. The French media reports with reference to Chirac's family. The ceremony will be private.
The public will be able to say goodbye to the former head of state on Sunday afternoon during a pieta in the Invalidovna in Paris, where a coffin with Chirac's remains will be displayed, the Elysee Palace announced.
According to the AFP agency, crowds of people have been flowing into the presidential residence since Thursday evening to sign the condolence book. This will be possible until Sunday. On Monday, President Emmanuel Macron declared state mourning.
In the meantime, further reactions are coming from the world and from France to the deaths of the former mayor of Paris and the president from 1995 to 2007, whom Prime Minister Édouard Philippe today described as "French in the true sense of the word".
Chiraca was remembered, for example, by the Japanese, because the politician was known for his love for their country and the sport of sumo. The news of the death of the former French president appeared on the front pages of all Japanese dailies, including sports ones, the French press notes.
The Museum of Tribal Art on Quai Branly in Paris, which Chirac founded, will not collect admission for ten days in honor of the former head of state.
A temperature record was set in Arctic Svalbard, where they measured almost 22 degrees
"A 41-year-old record was set in Longyearbyen," the Norwegian Meteorological Institute said on Twitter.
In the early evening, the temperature there rose to 21.7 degrees Celsius, which exceeded the record of 1979 by 0.4 degrees, he added.
About 2,000 Longyearbyen is the largest city in Svalbard, located about 1300 kilometers from the North Pole.
Svalbard is heating up faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This highlights the dangers of warming other parts of the Arctic - from Alaska to Siberia, according to a report by last year's Norwegian Center for Climate Study.
According to him, the average temperature in Svalbard has risen by three to five degrees since the 1970s.
By 2100, it could rise by as much as ten degrees if greenhouse gas emissions are not reduced.
Rising temperatures in Svalbard can result in the melting of permafrost, which threatens the stability of many buildings, roads or airports and can cause more avalanches and landslides.
Climate warming is also threatening Arctic fauna, such as polar bears and seals, which are dependent on the ocean ice sheet.
Unsuccessful qualification. Czech athletes are not doing well in Doha yet
The Doha World Championships began with qualifying setbacks for Czech athletics. Diana Mezuliáníková dropped out in the 800-meter start-up and the pole vaulter Romana Maláčová and the hammerhead Kateřina Šafránková, who defended the eighth place, which surprised her the year before last in London, did not pass the qualification.
Hurdler Vít Müller will complete the start on Friday and Marcela Joglová will run the night marathon race.
Šafránková threw 65.46 meters with her third attempt and fell almost six meters behind her maximum this year, which she would have to improve to advance. Maláčová jumped 435 cm, 450 cm was already beyond her strength. To participate in the finals, it was necessary to overcome the limit of 460 cm.
Mezuliáníková, who got to the championship only at the last minute thanks to an invitation from the IAAF, finished in the fourth run in the penultimate sixth place and not even 2: 03.48 minutes was enough for her to advance to the semifinals. It was one and a half seconds behind its maximum this year. "It was quite fast for me, unfortunately I fought with my opponent in the corner, which robbed me of my strength. It occurred to me that I still had strength, but it slowed me down. I almost stopped and had to start again, so in "It was a bit uncomfortable for this. I can't be completely satisfied," said the Czech national team member.
She was glad that she overtook at least one opponent in the finish line. "She really wasn't doing well, so every losing opponent was good. But I think it was in fifth place. Unfortunately," she added. The fastest half-runner in the starts was Winnie Nanyond from Uganda in 2: 00.36.
Doha lacks South Africa's top eight-year-old Caster Semenya, who has too high testosterone levels in her body, but, like some other runners, is refusing treatment ordered by IAAF rules this year.
In the 100-meter races, the American Christian Coleman confirmed the role of the number one favorite. His compatriot Justin Gatlin, who at the age of 37 is striving to defend the title, also advanced to the semifinals. The Nigerian Divine Oduduru did not start, who is second in this year's performance with a performance of 9.86, and his duel with Coleman, who has a performance of 9.81 this season, was expected.
The great form was shown in the qualification of long-distance Cuban Juan Miguel Echevarría, who flew to a distance of 840 cm with the first jump. No athlete has jumped that far in World Cup qualification in the last 20 years. The 21-year-old Cuban leads this year's tables with an output of 865 cm.
Berlin is responding to public pressure and addressing the housing crisis. He will buy 6,000 flats from a private company
Berlin will buy 6,000 former social housing from the private Luxembourg company ADO Properties SA for 920 million euros (CZK 23.8 billion), which the city sold 15 years ago. It thus responds to public pressure, which is rebelling against rocketing rising rental prices. According to Berlin Senator Katrin Lompscher on behalf of the Left (Die Linke), this is the largest such buyout in the history of the German capital. The opposition criticizes the move.
"The intention is to keep rents stable in Berlin and give tenants security," said Berlin Mayor Michael Müller (SPD) in a statement. "At the same time, we will continue to build new apartments and legally treat the rent freeze," he added. The municipal company Gewobag will take over thousands of flats located in the Spandau and Reinickendorf districts in the western part of the city in December this year.
According to Jefferies analyst Thomas Rothäusler, the city bought too much. Rothäusler told Bloomberg that, according to his estimate, the housing unit overpaid about ten percent above their book value.
According to the German opposition party Liberals (FDP), the Berlin authorities are contributing to real estate speculation. The FDP stated this on Twitter on Friday. The protest party Alternative for Germany (AfD) called the move a "waste of money".
Already in mid-July, Gewobag regained 670 flats on Berlin's Karl-Marx-Allee, the weekly Der Spiegel recalled on its website. The price was not published by the council at that time. The dispute over the flats on the former exhibition street from the times of the GDR was accompanied by protests and filled the front pages of the German press. It became a symbol of the difficult situation of tenants in large German cities, the paper wrote.
At the same time, the German capital used to be famous for its low cost of living and low rents. In recent years, however, it has gained in attractiveness. According to the AFP agency, rental prices have doubled in the last ten years, making it difficult for some residents to find affordable housing.
The British who return from Spain will face a mandatory two-week quarantine
The British cabinet also called on citizens to avoid all unnecessary trips to mainland Spain due to the risk of spreading covid-19.
The Canary and Balearic Islands are therefore not mentioned, but even after returning from them, people have to go into isolation for two weeks.
The new rules come into force at midnight.
"Protecting public health is our absolute priority.
We have taken this decision to prevent the possible spread of the virus in Britain, "British diplomacy said in a statement.
"We have always made it clear that if necessary, we will immediately remove a country from the list of safe ones," she added.
As noted by the British newspaper Metro, the latest announcement will hit the travel plans of thousands of Britons.
Spain is one of the very popular holiday destinations.
Among other things, the British are concerned about whether they will be paid sick pay if they have to end up in isolation for 14 days after returning from vacation.
For example, Neil Hunter from Sittingbourne booked a 10-day vacation to Lanzarote, which was scheduled to depart on Tuesday.
They have booked the tour since December.
"We were supposed to go the whole family, my wife Amanda and daughter Bethany, but to be honest, I don't know what will happen after this announcement.
I work as a train driver and I don't think my employer will agree to be quarantined for two weeks after returning from vacation, "Metro Hunter was quoted as saying.
With regard to Spain, there are concerns that the country is at the beginning of the second wave of the epidemic.
Over the last two days, more than 900 new infections have been added in 24 hours.
Authorities in some areas are already tightening coronavirus measures, for example, Catalonia is trying to curb all nightlife to prevent people from meeting in large numbers.
The Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recently drawn attention to the increased risk of infection in Catalonia, Aragon, the Basque Country and the Madrid region.
Czechs or children are not allowed to enter. The CTIA revealed discrimination in restaurants
These included, for example, incorrect pricing and non-compliance with the principles of fair sales.
In one case of discrimination, restaurants in Prague refuse to let smaller children into the business. According to the CTIA, it writes on its website that the device is not suitable for children under the age of eight. "When asked electronically if it was possible to order a table for four adults and one child aged four at the restaurant, a restaurant employee replied electronically that they did not accept the presence of children under the age of eight at the restaurant," Fröhlich added.
In the second case, another Prague company did not want to let Czech-speaking people to the table, while allowing English-speaking people to do so. "Czech-speaking inspectors, as consumers, were not allowed to sit at a table in the restaurant and place an order. English-speaking consumers were allowed to do so," the CTIA spokesman said.
Both cases are now being resolved in administrative proceedings. As they have not yet been finalized, the spokesman for the inspectorate was unable to provide further information on the restaurants in question.
However, discrimination occurred in only a very small proportion of restaurants inspected in the second quarter. In total, the CTIA performed 139 inspections. In addition to the two cases mentioned, discrimination revealed other errors in 64 cases. Most of them were shortcomings in compliance with the principles of fair sales and failure to inform the consumer about the prices of products and services in accordance with regulations.
Already on Wednesday, the inspectorate reported cases of discrimination against foreigners in two Prague restaurants, Clock Caffé and Café Restaurant. In both establishments, foreigners were charged higher amounts than Czech-speaking clients. In these cases, final fines of 60,000 crowns have already been imposed.
The model of electricity purchase from Dukovany will be discussed by the government
On Monday, the government will discuss a model for the purchase of electricity from the planned new unit of the Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant.
The bill envisages that if the purchase price is higher than the price of power on the market, the difference will be paid by all consumers through tariffs.
In the second case, where the purchase price is lower than the market price, the impact on consumers will be the opposite.
Power electricity is an unregulated part of the final price of electricity for customers.
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry Karel Havlíček (for YES) and the energy company ČEZ have previously stated that a more probable option is that people will save on electricity thanks to the construction.
Analysts, on the other hand, point out that the long-term outlook for electricity prices in the markets is always uncertain, as developments in the past have shown several times.
The plan has previously been criticized by environmental organizations.
"The purchase price can be both below and above the market price of power electricity.
The final impact at the time of application of the rule can be both negative and positive.
The impact will be distributed among customers according to the size of the circuit breaker - with lower consumption or according to electricity consumption - with higher electricity consumption, "said the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MIT) in the material documents.
In May, Havlíček stated that he assumes that the wholesale price of electricity will increase and that people will earn on the Dukovan construction site.
Otherwise, the impact will be in the tens of crowns per year per family, which, according to him, is far less than people pay annually in electricity bills to support so-called supported resources.
He had previously estimated that the purchase price could be between 50 and 60 euros (about 1320 to 1600 CZK) per megawatt-hour (MWh).
The submitted material does not contain any proposed amount, it should be included only in the purchase contract.
The price of electricity on the Prague Energy Exchange for 2021, for which traders now supply the most, is currently around 45 euros (about 1190 CZK) per MWh.
"Given the difference between the purchase price and the market price of electricity of ten euros, the average household could pay a surcharge of 3.3 MWh per year - it may correspond to a four-member household, equipped with electrical appliances as standard, including an electric hob and oven, but does not use electricity for heating. and hot water heating - less than CZK 100 / year, "the MIT wrote in documents for the government.
"We live in an extremely turbulent time.
The coronavirus pandemic has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term forecast of market prices to be an explicitly speculative matter, "Tomáš Voltr, the executive director of the Energy financial group investment group, told ČTK earlier.
The proposed law envisages that the purchase would be carried out by the Ministry of Industry and Trade, or a legal entity authorized by it, owned by the state for a predetermined price.
The contract between the investor and the state, guaranteeing the conditions for the purchase of electricity, would be concluded for at least 30 years, with a possible extension of ten years, even repeated, but no longer than until the end of operation of low-carbon production.
It defines a low-carbon generation proposal as electricity generation with a nuclear reactor connected to an electricity system with an installed capacity with a minimum electrical output of 100 megawatts (MW) after 2030.
Havlíček previously stated that the new Dukovany unit should have an output of 1,200 MW and produce nine terawatt hours of electricity per year, which would correspond to one tenth of the expected Czech consumption.
The unit should be put into operation in 2036.
The government approved the financing model for the new Dukovany bloc on Monday.
The state should finance interest-free facilities during construction, and a 2% interest rate is expected during operation.
The opposition does not agree with the financing model, it is also bothered by the possibility that Dukovany would build Russian or Chinese companies.
The state should participate in the construction 70 percent.
The rest should be paid by ČEZ, which will also cover any additional costs.
In May, CEZ CEO Daniel Benes told CTK that the expected amount for the construction of the unit at current prices is about six billion euros (approximately 162 billion crowns).
Agreements between the state and ČEZ on the construction of a new Dukovany unit will be signed on Tuesday.
The CSA mine in Karviná was on fire, no one was injured
The CSA Mine in Karviná was on fire this morning. The cause of the fire is not yet known. However, no one was injured during it, Ivo Čelechovský, a spokesman for the mining company, told ČTK.
The fire broke out at 04:25 in a face at a depth of about 1200 meters. "Nothing happened to any of the employees, no one was injured. The banana rescuers immediately intervened on the spot, who directly destroyed the fire and carried out a search of the terrain. The workplace was immediately closed and inaccessible," the spokesman said. The exact cause of the fire will now be determined by a special commission.
In the former Ostrava-Karviná district, coal is mined only in the Karviná part, namely in the mines ČSA, Lazy, Darkov, ČSM-Sever and ČSM-Jih. Mining should end in the Lazy Mine this year, and other mines are also waiting for a gradual decline. The mining company OKD is the only producer of hard coal in the Czech Republic, its production last year was 4.62 million tons. The mines employ 9,000 people.
Brno Grand Prix? There is a risk of ticket prices rising
The most expensive item is the listing fee every year before the Grand Prix. This year it was about one hundred and fifteen million crowns. "A mass of people who come to Brno during the Grand Prix will spend money there on accommodation, food or entertainment, which should more or less offset the costs associated with organizing the event, including the listing fee," said economist Petr Pelc.
According to him, the importance of the race is also in attracting tourists to the city. "Brno does not have so many world tourist attractions. The great price there attracts visitors from abroad. It is as important for Brno as, for example, the Tuřany airport or the exhibition center. And these are projects that are supported from public money," added the economist.
Grand Prix in Brno
- costs for the past five years: 686 million crowns
- profits from the past five years: 682 million crowns
- problem: lack of money to organize, increasing listing fee for the promotional company Dorna
- possible solutions: more money from the state, use of advertising space, increase in ticket prices
- state of play: negotiations on a new contract for the next five years
According to the director of the Institute of Public Administration, Filip Hrůza, the organizers must now evaluate whether the race is advantageous for Brno. "The Grand Prix sucks money out of public budgets for other matters. But to a certain extent, it's a political issue, not an economic one," he thinks.
In the future, the cost of a motoring event may be even higher. In the game, there is a variant to increase the listing fee almost double.
"The situation is not closed, we must try to negotiate the best possible conditions with Dorna. It also depends on the extent to which the state is ready to contribute to the race. If the worst case scenarios come true, I am afraid it is not realistic for the city and the region paid the amount, "admitted the mayor of Brno Markéta Vaňková.
As Deník Rovnost has already informed, representatives of the South Moravian Region and Brno are also discussing the possibility of using advertising due to difficulties in raising money for the Grand Prix. "Dorna's condition is that the advertisement must be placed in places that do not occupy the cameras. The selection of companies is also limited, because if Dorna has a general sponsor, then the company from the same area cannot be the second sponsor," Vaňková explained.
Organizers can also get more money from tickets in the coming years. "We have to sit down and say what the costs will actually be. And we have to adjust the revaluation of tickets accordingly," said the Brno opposition representative for the ANO movement and former mayor Petr Vokřál.
The Ministry of Regional Development has withdrawn material on the promotion of tourism in the media for two billion
The Office withdrew the material, according to which the Ministry for Regional Development (MRD) planned to spend two billion crowns in the media, on the Internet and on billboards for advertising on holidays in the Czech Republic.
Minister Klára Dostálová (for YES) of the SeznamZprávy.cz server said that the material is still being worked on.
The Zdopravy.cz server drew attention to the document in the eKlep (electronic library of the legislative process) on Friday.
The ministry justified the plan by the decline in tourism due to coronavirus.
During the coronavirus crisis, both the revenue and the media fell.
The proposal provoked criticism from the opposition and tourism representatives.
According to the proposal, which can now be viewed on the hlidacstatu.cz website, the Ministry of Regional Development planned to give money for advertising on television, radio, in the press, on the Internet, billboards and areas at railway stations through the state agency for tourism support CzechTourism.
The largest part of the money, 700 million crowns, would be given to television.
Most would be won by Nova and Prima private televisions.
Printed dailies and weeklies would receive 400 million and the same part would be given by the Ministry of Regional Development for PR articles, advertising banners and videos on websites.
Radio stations would receive 350 million for the media campaign, most of which again private stations.
The remaining 150 million would be used for outdoor advertising on billboards, LED screens and areas at stations or in the metro.
The campaign to support tourism in the Czech Republic was to begin in mid-August and last for a year.
"The material is still being worked on, it is definitely not in the form that should be presented yet," Dostálová said without further details to the SeznamZprávy server.
The material was criticized by the opposition, according to the head of TOP 09, Markéta Pekarová Adamová, the media from the trust funds of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (YES) would benefit from the advertisement.
"I firmly believe that this spectacular contempt will get a blow to the eyes in the autumn at the election," she wrote on Twitter.
Dostálová denies that it is in fact a matter of helping the media affected by the crisis.
"It can also be a coincidence, I don't know anything about media support at all," she told Deník N on Friday.
According to her, the budget of two billion is indicative.
"Of course we still count it, it can be less or more.
It is a working material, "she added.
The Save Tourism initiative does not make sense for a media campaign to promote domestic tourism.
"We want two billion for companies in tourism, not an unnecessary advertising campaign," the chairman of the initiative, Tomáš Barčík, said on Sunday.
If there are those two billion crowns in the state budget, they should go to companies, not the media, the initiative writes in an open letter to the government.
The end of political news? According to critics, the new law will not help anyway!
However, according to some opposition deputies, the law tends to make ministers relinquish responsibility for the election while continuing to select their candidates.
Greater transparency in selection procedures for positions in state-owned companies - this is one of the goals of the nomination law. 119 deputies spoke in favor. The law passed, for example, thanks to the votes of YES, the KSČM, the Social Democrats and even the Pirates.
Candidates for state-owned companies will have to go through a selection process before a government committee. For example, it was the Pirates who sought to make the recommendation to the minister binding. That didn't work out in the end.
The Civic Democrats and the SPD fear that the nomination law will be passed on to ministers. "The minister will now be able to hide behind a commission decision and will therefore not have a clear and transparent accountability," said SPD chairman Tomio Okamura. ODS Deputy Chairman Martin Kupka speaks similarly.
The government committee should completely reject candidates who do not meet the conditions. These will include criminal integrity, indebtedness, a minimum age of 25 and professionalism should be the main selection criterion.
The law will still have to pass the Senate and then the president will sign it.
The car tuner brought the voice of the digital soul
Everything you know about obesity is wrong, according to the headline of a long text written by Michael Hobbes for the Huffington Post and photographed by Finlay Mackay. In a provocative explanation, it is written that the medical community for decades ignored the facts about obesity and waged a ruthless (and also useless) war against overweight people, which not only affected public opinion but also destroyed many lives. But now is the time for a new paradigm.
What Hobbes states at the outset is the fact that there is often a very long and tedious journey from knowing the facts to putting them into practice. He mentions the case of scurvy, where some captains handed out lemons, limes and oranges to their crew in the seventeenth century, believing that they would prevent diseases. However, the British Navy withdrew from this practice due to fears of increased costs. The clear influence of the fruit in the prevention and treatment of the disease was then demonstrated in the middle of the 18th century, but it took another fifty years before the navy took this into account. Seat belts also existed long before the invention of the car, but became mandatory only in the 1960s, as did the first confirmed asbestos-related death in 1906, yet its first ban came in 1973.
"Every discovery in the field of public health - no matter how significant - has always had to compete with traditions, prejudices and financial incentives within the society in which it was to be implemented," writes Hobbes. In American society today, nearly 80 percent of the adult population and about one-third of children meet the definition of overweight or obesity. More Americans today live with obesity than with breast cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and HIV combined.
Obesity is seen as a sovereign personal failure of an individual, which is said to burden the health care system and reduce GDP. The fear of obesity is so great in the population that Americans today spend more money on diets than they spend on computer games and movies. However, the truth is that diets do not work. As early as 1959, research showed that 95 to 98% of attempts to lose weight end in failure, and two-thirds of people on a diet then gain more than they lose.
Armed with statistics, Hobbes further describes the lifestyles and traumas of overweight people. The personal one encounters the systemic one, where, for example, at the faculties, only 19 hours of the entire study are devoted to the issue of nutrition when teaching future doctors. Which, at a time when the 60 calorie process that Americans receive comes from ultra-processed food.
How obesity is stigmatized is again illustrated by reports from surgeries, where overweight people usually experience shorter check-ups, doctors approach them with less empathy and consider them more problematic patients.
However, being overweight is far from just an American problem, Hobbes writes. Since 1980, the proportion of obesity in 73 countries has doubled and has risen in 113. And during that time, no country has managed to reduce and stop this increase. Absolutely none.
Simona Krainová: Fuck the Age! Then she kissed Lucia Bílá!
The day before the baptism of the Fuck The Age calendar, Simona Krainová published her latest photos, in which she is completely naked! "I was a little afraid that people would condemn me for taking pictures naked at my age. I'm a pretty shy man. But so far I have only positive reactions. I wanted to show women that if they want to, it's possible in 46 years, to have a solid figure. Of course, there is hard work and renunciation behind it, but otherwise it is not possible. "
"Lukáš Dvořák and I took about three thousand photos, selected about a hundred and there are twelve of them in the calendar, so the rest is still waiting for its moment. This is definitely not the last time I was naked," very exposed.
She had an elongated Bernhardt jacket and shorts underneath, which were invisible, so she seemed to have forgotten her bottom. Everyday running has strengthened her legs, so she can afford similar models.
Simona was so happy with the success that she kissed everyone she met at the baptism. Husband, friends, even Slavica Lucia Bílá.
Broth of life, a rooster of beer and death like a blade of grass
The third album entitled And Death is a Blade of Grass by the Brno poet, a tireless organizer of cultural activities and publisher Jaroslav Erik Frič, who also left a year ago, on May 24, is posthumous.
He is the fifth item in Frič's discography and, as in previous titles, the main emphasis here is on Frič's poetry, of which he himself is an excellent performer.
Frič, born in 1949, was of course influenced by the American beat generation, but he inspired this inspiration through his own, individually presented experiences as well as very inner expressions of faith.
However, he was far from agitation, if he talked or wrote about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, non-aggressive, completely tolerant.
In this context, Bohuslav Reynek (in contrast to Jan Zahradníček, for example) comes to mind, the masters forgive.
Frič's album offers recordings of the author's reading from 2006, as well as performances with musicians who always accompanied him very sensitively, whether it was cellist Josef Klíč, or Honza Bartoň and Vítězslav Holata.
I will be happy - gladly - with the words of the Ostrava poet Petr Hruška about Frič's long poetic compositions.
"They radiated a proud and endless bitterness," Hruška writes, "over the state of our endangered world.
The world, which is sinking more and more into dull consumer vanity and greed, is moving further and further away from what its soul was made of - the mystery of faith, humility and human closeness.
There was a longing for those who know that the values for which it was created are of little interest to them, but who also know that they cannot be renounced simply because of a general lack of interest.
Those poems reminded that one may have to lose everything expensive, but it is not irrelevant how it is lost.
If he sells himself into general bankruptcy, he resigns skeptically, falls silently, or stays in peace and pride in the last moment on what he believes and loves. "

Paroubek is not my advisor, Hamáček said
Former Prime Minister and Chairman of the CSSD Jiří Paroubek is not a paid advisor to the Social Democracy.
The party chairman and interior minister Jan Hamáček only communicates with him and reads his opinions and articles.
Hamáček said this today on the Prima Partie television show.
On Friday, the SeznamZprávy.cz server informed that Paroubek should be Hamáček's advisor.
"From time to time we write a text message, he sometimes sends me some material and I read it," Hamáček said today.
He added that this was not an official and paid cooperation.
According to him, the CSSD does not have the resources to waste them for similar purposes.
"There are a lot of people like that that I read his opinion from time to time," he said.
In a subsequent discussion with ODS MP Jana Černochová, the minister said that many ODS members were still "openly listening to Václav Klaus' views".
According to him, this is fine, because he is an experienced politician and a former chairman of the party, which is also the case with Paroubek.
He described the fact that the media are making an affair a sign of this year's cucumber season.
The SeznamZprávy.cz server wrote on Friday that Paroubek plays the role of Hamáček's unofficial consultant.
He also wrote that the former chairman of the local cell, Petr Benda, who is connected with Paroubek and acted as vice-chairman of his LEV 21 party, is heading for the fourth place of the party's candidate in the Ústí nad Labem region.
Hamáček said today that he will not comment on the candidate's composition until it is ready and approved.

Duplantis has a mile lead, it's a kick in the ass, the Swede's challenger laments
The 22-year-old American pole vaulter has the ambition and potential to be one of the new ruler's most serious competitors.
He already knows what it's like to beat Duplantis two years younger, he defeated him at a meeting of the NCAA University Association last year.
"We had a battle the year before, then he won and I was second, then we swapped it.
In both cases, it was a very good duel, "describes Nilsen, who secured the victory with a performance of 5.95 meters.
But since then, Duplantis has shot up steeply and is currently alone in the highest spheres of clubbing.
In just twenty years, he became a world record holder, this year on February 8 in Toruń he crossed the bar of 6.17 meters, a week later in Glasgow he added another centimeter.
"He jumped six meters when he was 18 when he finished high school," recalls his peer Nilsen for the World Athletics website.
"It was clear that once he grew from a boy to a man, he would multiply all his potential and talent tenfold.
Twenty years is a pretty good age to break the world record, "he believes.
Although Nilsen's list of accomplishments is much thinner than Duplantis's pride, the American has similar goals.
So far, he has indicated his options at the NCAA races, which he regularly won, in February this year he improved his internal personal record to 5.93 m. Last August he won a gold medal at the Pan American Games in Lima, in 2017 he fought his way to the American expeditions to the world championship, where he finished 13th.
The next milestone for him is to taste the Diamond League for the first time.
"It's definitely my priority to get on the professional circuit and race as much as possible in the Diamond League, because you can make a name for yourself there," he realizes.
"If you can succeed at this level, you can undoubtedly do the same at events such as the Olympics, the World Cup or the Pan American Games."
However, due to the pandemic, these high holidays are being postponed, which gives Nilsen and the other pole vaulters time to improve.
But will that be enough to catch up with Duplantis, who can easily turn a race under five laps into a mere battle for silver?
"Everyone is trying to catch up with him, but I don't think it will be possible in the near future," Nilsen thinks.
"The boy has been jumping for 16 years and has a mile lead over everyone else in training."
And before Tokyo 2021 begins, it will want to increase it even more.
The researchers are looking for toddlers with a congenital defect, the so-called ankle valgosity, in their study
Ankle valgosity is a congenital defect that affects five to ten percent of children. It is usually treated with intensive exercise. The researchers are trying to help these children even more, so they have developed special footwear that should significantly speed up the treatment.
"We have two prototype shoes that will be worn by healthy children and children with diagnoses to map the effect in both groups. Participation in the research will have no risks for children and the measurement will be completely painless," explains Marta Gimunová, head of research at the Faculty of Sports Studies. HIM.
Parents of both groups of children can register for the study via the website, where the registration form and all information are available.
Researchers are looking for fifty children with a diagnosis and fifty healthy children. Half of each group will always wear medical footwear and half will not.
"The moment parents should register their child is when they take the first separate steps, such as the furniture they hold on to when trying to walk. Participating in the research involves three measurements within seven months of the child's first steps. , each lasting about 20 minutes, in half of the participants it also includes wearing the tested shoes, "Gimunová points out.
The opening of the Pumpkin World delayed the ripening of pumpkins
Nová Ves u Leštiny (Havlíčkobrodsko) - The farm in Nová Ves u Leštiny in Havlíčkobrodsko today opened the Pumpkin World for more than a month. Decorations made of thousands of freshly harvested pumpkins are dominated by massive orange pyramids in the garden. The autumn event, which is becoming a tradition, starts a week later this year, as pumpkins have matured longer on the surrounding seven hectares of fields of the Pipek family. There are still many of them in the field, Jaroslava Pipková told ČTK today.
Pipek grows many types of pumpkins, but the weather has not been good for the last two years. This year's harvest was delayed and some species did not come out. "As usual, we have plenty of orange pumpkins for Halloween, but some species didn't work for connoisseurs," Pipková said. Nevertheless, you can choose from several types on the farm, from the already mentioned large pumpkins suitable for carving and digging decorations through pumpkins for cooking hokaido or elongated "spaghetti" to decorative pumpkins of various colors and shapes.
Growing pumpkins is laborious. Farmers manually dig up plants and harvest their fruits, cutting them from the stem of the pumpkin with scissors. The Pumpkin World has been open to Pipek regularly since 2010, previous years have attracted thousands of people. The decoration of pumpkins is complemented by attractions made of straw or a maze of logs. Visitors will also see animals kept on the farm. It will be open daily until November 3.
Details of the event can be found on the farm's website, where growers also offer some recipes for pumpkin dishes, such as pumpkin muffins or juice. Visitors themselves tell them about other possibilities of preparing pumpkins in the kitchen. "A lot of cookbooks have tried their own recipes, and we also get inspired," Pipková said. She noted that some housewives also treat pumpkins to pickles like cucumbers.
We are looking for motivated immigrants. The head of the children's clinic is building an international team of doctors, we bring their stories
Albanian Ledjona Toni studied medicine in Czech and today few people know that she is a foreigner.
Hundreds of medics from abroad study in the Czech Republic, who could stay and work here. A pediatric clinic in Prague's Motol tried to obtain some of them.
In order for Tara Hussein Tayeb to arrive at the Motol Hospital in Prague around five o'clock in the afternoon, she had to get up a lot. Kurdka, with her hair cut short, flew to the Czech Republic from Suleimania, a city in northeastern Iraq, where she works as a pediatrician in a hospital and still treats small patients in a private practice in the afternoon. In addition, he teaches at the university.
Strawberry, plum and invisible. Choose the right shade of lipstick: It's not just one red
When choosing a red lipstick, you should first determine if you are the warm or cold type. Try a simple test - look at the veins in your wrist. If they are blue, you are a cold type, if you are green, then you are a warm type. When choosing a new red lipstick, first put on the sorting based on the undertone. Only pay attention to the texture in the next one.
If you are a woman with a cold undertone, then lipsticks in purple, plum, cherry or mauve are suitable for you.
If you fall into the category of a warm skin undertone, choose lipsticks. You will recognize them by their tendency to orange, coral, gold or brown reflections.
You may find that some veins look green and others blue. In that case, congratulate - you don't have to look at the undertone and you can focus only on your color preferences.

Uncombed wants 45 million from the state
According to Vladimír Řepka, a spokesman for the office, the Ministry of Justice has received six requests in this regard so far and is now analyzing them. The young man was imprisoned for two years for assaulting a woman, but the judiciary eventually acquitted him.
The appeal in the case was not filed by both the Supreme State Attorney Pavel Zeman and the Minister of Justice Marie Benešová.
An attempt to assassinate a hairdresser in Hořice took place in February 2013. The Hradec Králové Public Prosecutor's Office accused him of a then twenty-year-old student at the Nečesaný grammar school. The prosecution claimed that he hit a woman in the head several times with a log and then took over ten thousand crowns from her. Her son found a seriously injured woman, her life was saved by doctors from the Hradec Králové hospital.
Uncombed from the beginning, he denied any guilt. "I am innocent and I swear. I sincerely regret what happened to the victim, but I am not the perpetrator," the young man said earlier in court, who did not deny that it was a fateful day at the hairdresser's. He said he wanted to get a haircut. But he left after the woman told him she was closing. He then reported to the police as a witness.
At first, the hairdresser did not recognize him as the aggressor during the interrogation, but later described Nečesaný as an attacker. According to forensic experts, she suffered from memory loss after the attack.
The Hradec Králové Regional Court gradually handed down five judgments in the case. He first found Nečesaný guilty twice and sentenced him to 16 years in prison, and the High Court of Appeal reduced his sentence to 13 years. Uncombed, he gradually went behind bars twice, but each time, after the intervention of the Supreme Court, he was released. Following the ordered replacement of the judicial panel, repeated acquittals were finally handed down, with the latter upheld by the High Court in March this year.
However, the chairman of the Board of Appeal, Jiří Lněnička, also stated in the reasoning of his conclusions that this decision was wrong, but given the procedural situation, he allegedly did not have a better option. He said he had rejected the prosecutor's appeal against the acquittal, even though her objections were justified.
"The problem with this case is not that there is a lack of evidence, but its evaluation. We believe that a sufficient amount of evidence was gathered in the preparatory proceedings, which would be rich enough for another guilty case to establish guilt," Lněnička stated.
However, Hradec Králové and the Supreme Court looked at the case differently, and their opinion would probably not change the further annulment of the acquittal.

The woman spent hundreds of thousands on her disabled son's disability pension.
A trial awaits her
The money that a 33-year-old man receives from the state as a disability pension is intended primarily to improve the quality of his life.
A woman faces up to eight years in prison for embezzlement.
Due to poor health, the court deprived the sick man of his rights and appointed his mother as a guardian, who was to manage his son's money, among other things.
"From mid-November 2013 to January this year, the woman used part of the funds from her son's disability pension for her own needs and thus deprived him of 440 thousand crowns," said police spokeswoman Dana Ladmanová, adding that she accused the accused woman of having a special guardian obligation to defend the interests of the injured party.
According to the court's instructions, the woman opened an account for her son, but she had his pension sent to her account.
"After paying for the costs associated with her son's stay in the medical facility and payment for the necessary medicines, she used the remaining funds to buy a vehicle, electrical appliances and to run a household," the indictment said.
The woman admitted that she could not use her son's money for her own needs.
But she defended herself by helping them pay family expenses.
"We had problems with our income tightening the household.
We never bought anything above standard.
It was always on things that my son would approve of buying.
I considered it family money.
I had no idea that I was committing a crime, "the woman explained to the police.
She promised to return the money to her son.
North America has been inhabited for 30,000 years, scientists say after finding the tools
Finds from the Chiquihuite cave in the Mexican state of Zacatecas include 1930 limestone tools, including fine blades that could be used to cut meat and pointed objects that could serve as spearheads or spears.
Researchers have found that the oldest of the tools date from 33,000 to 31,000 years ago.
"There are only a few products of this age.
But they are here, "said archaeologist Ciprian Ardelean of the University of Zacatecas and lead author of one of two studies published on the subject in the journal Nature.
The youngest instruments are 12,500 years old.
According to experts, the people have inhabited the Chiquihuite cave, located at high altitude, for 20,000 years.
Until now, the generally accepted theory was that the first representatives of the species Homo sapiens crossed the land bridge from the area of today's Russia to Alaska about 13,500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including unique spearheads used to kill mammoths and other prehistoric animals, has shown that this human culture subsequently spread to much of North America.
However, this model has cracked in recent decades when several ancient settlements were discovered that were two to three thousand years older.
A second study published in the journal Nature reports 42 different sites throughout North America that demonstrate a human presence on the continent between 26,000 and 19,000 years ago.
Researchers believe that a small number of people may have come to the North American mainland earlier than previously thought.
Some could get to America by boat.
"Obviously, people were in America long before the development of the so-called human culture," said anthropologist Ruth Gruhn of a university in the Canadian province of Alberta.
So far, the interest in tickets is fulfilled by the optimistic scenario, say the sellers.
Prices are also gradually falling
Ticket sales in the Czech Republic are growing every week.
Compared to last summer, the interest is still about half, but the demand is growing by up to 20 percent every week.
According to the sellers, the development after the crisis thus fulfills the most optimistic scenarios.
Ticket prices are also gradually falling.
According to the sellers, the most popular destinations are mainly the southern European countries.
According to Kiwi.com, Spain, Italy and Greece lead.
Flights to Split, Croatia are the most sold on the Letuška.cz portal.
Of the other countries, the United Kingdom is the most sought-after, but it has always been one of the busiest destinations.
The average price of air tickets is also falling.
At the Letuška.cz portal, it was around 6,250 crowns in the middle of the month, down 3,000 crowns year-on-year.
This is mainly due to an increase in demand for European destinations, which now account for about 85 percent of sales.
However, prices themselves are also falling to some European cities, such as Spain or Italy, which have fallen by about a fifth in recent weeks.
The crisis has also affected the behavior of customers who now buy tickets much less in advance than before, because they fear further developments in the coronavirus situation.
According to previous information from Kiwi.com, the time of ticket purchase before departure decreased by about ten days year-on-year.
"This is confirmed by the future trend where people will order tickets much less in advance, they will require more flexibility, less risk," said Michal Šindelář, Vice President for Kiwi.com Products.
Currently, the average booking time before departure is 21 days.
Along with the growth in sales, the number of renewed airlines from the Czech Republic is also rising.
At Prague Airport, there are currently regular flights to more than 60 destinations.
Compared to last summer season, this is about half of the destinations.
The hunter was injured when he fell from a sitting position, and was carried to the ambulance for three hours
The unfortunate accident occurred before half past seven in the evening in the top parts near Čertova mlýn.
"It was a very complicated and inaccessible terrain, so we sent five of our rescuers with the appropriate equipment to the injured man. At the same time, we asked the Medical Rescue Service of the Moravian-Silesian Region for cooperation. Beskydy services.
Rescuers found the hunters in a selected locality with multiple injuries. They treated him immediately and then transported them gently, but with difficulty, in a so-called Austrian wheelchair, over impassable terrain.
"Transport on the route of about one and a half kilometers was slow and difficult. The injured nimrod was therefore handed over to the crew of the ambulance after about three hours," added Libor Kluz.
Fortunately, according to Radan Jaškovský, the commissioned chief of the Beskydy Mountain Service and an intervening rescuer, the hunter's colleague was able to describe in detail where the wounded man was.
"We therefore found him relatively quickly. However, if he had the Rescue application on his phone, our rescuers would have been with him sooner and at the same time the dispatcher of line 155 would know about the accident and his situation immediately," Radan Jaškovský remarked.
He added that a charged mobile phone with the Rescue application activated should be a matter of course in the mountains today.
The grand finale tonight!
Watch the darts battle live at Nova Sport
The second most prestigious tournament within the PDC organization reached the grand final.
It will feature the experienced forty-nine-year-old Scottish darts Gary Anderson and the surprise of the tournament, the 26-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh.
Gary Anderson eliminated Justin Pip in the first round, then ran into his neighbor in the leaderboard.
However, he also managed with James Wade and in the quarterfinals he fought well with Simon Whitlock, who had previously sent home the world number one.
He had "Flying Cattle" in the semifinals when he faced Michale Smith.
At the last moment, however, he escaped the gravedigger from the shovel, dominated in overtime and after the result of 18:16 he won a place in the finals of the tournament, which he dominated in 2018, when he defeated Mensur Suljovič in an amazing battle at 21:19.
The biggest surprise of World Matchplay is Dimitri van den Bergh.
He enjoys the Belgian talent in the tournament and perhaps the knowledge that he has nothing to lose helped him to play on an absolutely fantastic wave.
The 26-year-old darts first surprisingly eliminated Nathan Aspinall's world number six, they also pushed Joe Cullen in a dramatic battle and defeated Adrian Lewis in the quarterfinals after a sharp start.
The semifinals were a big test.
Glen Durrant showed his strength at the beginning, but the calmly playing Belgian then gained an advantage with an excellent series, which he held more or less without problems until the end.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in high scoring, which he encountered the occasional uncertainty on doubles.
Cases of coronavirus have increased at least since the beginning of the week, and the number of tests has decreased
Since the beginning of March, when the new coronavirus was first discovered in the Czech Republic, it has been proven to have infected 15,212 people.
Almost 9,600 of them have already been cured, 368 patients have died.
At present, 5,254 people are ill.
This follows from data on the website of the Ministry of Health.
The daily number of newly confirmed cases this week has exceeded four hundred four times in a row.
The maximum was 281 cases on Friday.
There were 235 positive people on Thursday, 246 a day earlier and 206 on Tuesday.
On the first working day of this week, 169 more were infected.
9,590 people have already been cured of covid-19 in the Czech Republic, ie 63 percent of all those infected so far.
In most cases, the disease was mild.
According to the latest data from the Ministry of Health, there are 151 people with coronavirus in the hospital, 19 of whom are assessed as serious by doctors.
There are several outbreaks of covid-19 in the Czech Republic.
Karviná is still the most infected in the last seven days per 100,000 inhabitants, almost 59.
This is followed by the district of Jihlava with 56 and Frýdek-Místek with 36 infected per 100,000 inhabitants in the last week.
Due to the increased number of infections, new measures against the spread of coronavirus have been in force in the Czech Republic since Saturday.
People must wear wearing veils at indoor mass events of over 100 people, these are cultural and sporting events, but also weddings and funerals inside buildings.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be halved from the current thousand people.
Worldwide, the number of people demonstrably infected with the new coronavirus has already exceeded 16 million.
This was stated by the American Johns Hopkins University, which monitors the development of the pandemic globally.
According to this source, the balance of victims who died with covid-19 is close to 645,000.
The latest million infected have been added to the statistics in just three days; the 15 million mark fell on July 22.
The United States, which already registers over 4.1 million infected people, Brazil with 2.4 million and India, where the authorities say almost 1.4 million people became infected, had the largest share in the rapid growth in the number of cases in recent days.
Infection is now increasing at a record pace.
The World Health Organization announced this week that more than 284,000 new cases were added worldwide between Thursday and Friday, the highest daily balance since the start of the pandemic.
This development can be attributed to the fact that the spread of the disease is at its peak in populous countries such as the USA, Brazil and India, but according to Reuters, the number of new cases grew last week in almost 40 countries around the world.
This applies, for example, to Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium and Israel.
The disease has already appeared in almost all countries of the world, the first case was officially announced by the DPRK today.

Household air is up to five times worse than outdoor air.
Air fresheners and deodorants are harmful to health
Health is threatened not only by poor air quality outdoors, but also at home.
Israeli human health expert Carol Abraham, quoted by The Jerusalem Post, pointed this out.
According to Abraham, who helped create the Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection, household pollutants need to be addressed right now, with many people spending more time working from home.
Abraham mentioned a study by the American Environment Agency (EPA), according to which the quality of domestic air is up to five times worse than outdoor air.
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 3.8 million people die prematurely each year due to poor air quality in their homes.
"Because of the coronavirus epidemic, which has forced and continues to force many to work from home, people have to spend more hours in their homes than before, so it's time to focus on indoor air quality," Abraham said.
According to her, almost no one in Israel deals with the quality of "domestic air".
Things that a person normally comes into contact with can be dangerous - paints, air fresheners, disinfectants, deodorants or pesticides.
"The poison gas is also emitted by clothes that we regularly carry to the treatment plant," Abraham said.
According to her, the most endangered are children, old household members and people with breathing difficulties.
Even otherwise, healthy individuals may begin to suffer from problems such as headaches, fainting, nasal irritation, nosebleeds, vomiting, or skin allergies.
Prolonged exposure to unhealthy substances can damage internal organs and the central nervous system.
However, not all pollutants come from objects inside households, the source can also be the material from which houses are built.
Tough competition for the Škoda Kamiq. Kia XCeed relies on rich equipment, at what price?
The Kia XCeed is a relatively difficult model to classify. It is clearly a compact SUV, but does not offer all-wheel drive. This item is left to the larger sibling Sportage, which is such a direct response to cars such as the Škoda Karoq, Opel Grandland X or Volkswagen Tiguan. Compared to them, the XCeed also relies on more dynamic body shapes, which by sloping the rear can remotely resemble the world of the SUV-coupe, popular in this part of the market, especially among premium brands Audi, BMW or Mercedes-Benz.
On the other hand, the XCeed cannot be included only alongside the plastic-coated versions of classic compacts, such as the Ford Focus Active. Compared to him, the Koreans have made a much larger number of changes to the body, so those who do not want to see Ceed in the shape of a novelty may not even have to.
Unlike the compact hatchback or Ceed station wagon, the XCeed is also offered exclusively with supercharged engines, so don't expect a basic atmospheric fourteen. The XCeed starts with a supercharged liter and also offers a supercharged 16 kW with 150 kW, reserved for siblings of the GT version. Don't expect a sports degree here. Turbodiesels 1.6 CRDi is only available in a mild-hybrid version, which means that the internal combustion engine is assisted by an electrical system that helps reduce consumption and emissions. From 100 kW, it is also possible to pay extra for a seven-speed two-clutch machine in addition to the manual.
Soon, the offer will be expanded by a plug-in hybrid, a variant that will cover about sixty kilometers for electricity only. The batteries can then be charged from a normal outlet.
Quiz about Václav Havel: How long he spent in prison and what made him write Charter 77
Fuenlabrada lost her chance to advance to the top Spanish football league due to a coronavirus infection in the team.
The management of the competition canceled the originally postponed duel of the last round of the second league, in which the team could secure its participation in the playoffs.
Fuenlabrada reported another 12 infected people on Saturday, bringing the total number of positive tests for covid-19 at the club to 28.
Due to an infection in the team, Monday's duel against La Coruni was postponed, in which Fuenlabrada had enough points to make it to the playoffs.
The management of the competition stated today that the duel against La Coruni was definitively canceled due to force majeure due to the fact that it was never played again.
Fuenlabrada accepted the decision.
On the other hand, La Coruňa's play was disheartening.
In the end, given the results of their rivals, even a victory over Fuenlabrada would not be enough to save him, but he considers it unfair that the last round did not take place according to custom, complete in a single time.
The leadership of the former elite Spanish club is threatened by a court due to a fall into the third league.
The first two teams in the Huesca and Cádiz tables have the certainty of advancing among the elite.
Zaragoza, Almería, Girona and Elche will compete for the remaining third place in the playoffs.
Did Karel Gott not like Václav Havel ?!
Dominika's daughter revealed it
"Dad didn't have to have him for many years," she told Aha! Gott Dominika's eldest daughter, with the proviso that the Master could not come to Havel's name and whenever it came to him, Karel was always annoyed.
It's hard to say what they did, but according to Dominic, the dispute began sometime in the mid-1990s.
"In an article after the revolution, Dad said it was easier than him.
That Havel could write in a drawer in the dark, but if he resisted, he would have ended his career, "says Gott.
But then he adds that in the end the Czech greats still found their way to each other.
"I know Havel couldn't hear the word until he was in his sixties.
But then the president congratulated him on his birthday and suddenly his father's relationship with him began to change, "Dominika recalls.
After all, ten years later, Gott even invited the former president to celebrate his 70th birthday at the Ambassador Hotel on Wenceslas Square.
"And that's where a new era of their relationship began, because my father then regularly invited Mr. Havel home to Bertramka," added the blonde, whose father died last October.
It is also said that Slavík was sorry that he never received a state award from Václav Havel.
After all, he survived it in 2009, even though it was already in the hands of his successor as Václav Klaus (79).
He will receive further honors in memoriam, as the current president Miloš Zeman (75) is to award him the Order of the White Lion and thus honor his memory.
Since Tuesday, the Czech Republic is in danger of heat, meteorologists warn of fires
Meteorologists' warnings about high temperatures apply to Tuesday afternoons for the whole of Bohemia, with the exception of the Karlovy Vary region, and also for southern and central Moravia.
"Exceptionally, temperatures can exceed 34 degrees Celsius, especially in Central Bohemia," they say.
People are advised to follow a hot drinking regimen and reduce physical activity at noon and in the afternoon.
Due to the warm weather with minimal precipitation, there will be a risk of fires from Tuesday morning.
Windy weather could contribute to their rapid spread.
Meteorologists' warnings about the risk of fires apply to Central Bohemia, including Prague, Liberec, Ústí nad Labem, Karlovy Vary and the Pilsen Region.
The fire warning will be valid until further notice.
"We do not expect significant precipitation that would mitigate the danger in the northwest and west of Bohemia at least until the end of the week," the CHMI states.
The Prague City Council responded to the warnings of meteorologists by banning the setting up of fires in risky places, which is to apply from Tuesday.
People in the capital will not be allowed to start open fires in parks, gardens or forests, for example, up to a distance of 50 meters from the edge of the forest.
Smoking and the use of pyrotechnics are also prohibited in these areas.
The measure will apply until further notice, said Vít Hofman, a spokesman for the Prague City Hall.
The French chef is suing Michelin for removing the star. I'm depressed, he says
Renowned French chef Marc Veyrat lost his third Michelin star in January this year, a year after winning it. He intends to try with the publisher of the Red Guide to obtain the exact reasons for the degradation. Veyrat also doubts the competencies of Michelin inspectors, who he said confused saffron with cheddar. The first trial is scheduled for November.
The chef of the famous restaurant La Maison de Bois in the Alpine region of Haute-Savoie lost one of the three Michelin stars in January this year. He will be sued with the publisher of the prestigious Le Guide Michelin because, according to him, the commissioners' conclusion was not duly substantiated. In addition, according to him, the asterisk was removed without any notice. "I've been depressed for six months. How dare you play with the health of the chefs?" Veyrat told the commissioners.
Michelin is said to have given the chef only vague reasons, such as the fact that the chef put cheddar in the souffle, which the inspection did not like. "I put saffron in it, and those gentlemen thought it was cheddar because it was yellow. I've been working with Savoy ingredients with love from the beginning," Veyrat said against the decision. He is convinced of the strong incompetence of the Michelin commissioners: "You are fraudsters who only provoke disputes for commercial reasons." Outraged, Veyrat does not understand "how could they afford to say that we put cheddar in our souffle". "They also offended our region, my employees were crazy about it. We have eggs from our hens, milk from our own cows, gardeners collect fresh herbs every morning," he said angrily.
The distinguished chef, always with a black hat on his head and dark glasses, is an opponent of the new generation of Michelin commissioners, and therefore demands the removal of his restaurant from the red guide. However, the publisher refuses. "If the company remains open and our inspectors re-select it, we will continue to recommend it," said Gwendal Poullennec, Michelin's international director.
According to Michelin, the chef's lawsuit shows that he has no meaningful accusations yet and that the lawyer will only help him to formulate it. "We regret that Mr. Veyrat is communicating rudely with us. But we will carefully examine his comments," he said.
In addition to La Maison de Bois, Marc Veyart owns two other three-star restaurants.
