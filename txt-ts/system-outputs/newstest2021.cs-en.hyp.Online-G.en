Basketball players on the Medal of the World Championship Under 17 years did not reach, finished fourth
Even the third world championship of seventeen was won by the Americans, who in the final defeated Spain just 77:75 despite 40 points of the Spaniard Angela Salvadores.
"We really wanted to win and not be potato, but maybe we wanted it too much. We caught the start, but we couldn't keep it because they rolled us under the basket, " regretted captain Karolína malečková. "Playing in front of such an audience was an incredible experience," she praised the fans in Klatovy and Pilsen.
The Czechs started very well, thanks to two threes they took the lead 8: 0 and dominated the entire first quarter on the court. At that moment, it seemed that the opponents would pay off the defeat from the base group 85: 88 after overtime. However, the referee whistled 15 fouls during the half and with questionable decisions helped Hungary to return to the game with a 12:2 lead.
"I am convinced that it was enough to put two more three baskets, run away to 20 points and we would not let it go. But instead came our mistakes. I'm not interested in the referees, but what we did wrong, and there were mistakes that helped the opponent to catch, " evaluated coach Richard Fousek.
"It was not the first time we had a lapse in concentration. But the girls are fighters, they did not let anything out and fought to the end. But the opponent was very good, " he added.
The Czechs kept in the game especially Petra holešínská accurate shooting from a distance and pivotka Tereza šípová. However, the Czech top scorer had a problem with fouls and missed much of the third quarter on the court. The Hungarians took advantage of this and gained a slight lead, which they already kept, although the Czechs fought until the last seconds.
"For us, the first five matches were very difficult, we rotated the matches in a narrow rotation and it cost us a lot of strength. Already against Spain, you could see that the girls were tired and there was nowhere to take. Because of the physicality, we weren't consistent defensively. We didn't play a quick counterattack, we missed a rebound. And the Hungarians are so good that if you don't put everything together, it's hard to win, " added Fousek.
He believes that a promising future awaits his ward. "In two years, the girls were able to win the Youth Olympics, to be second at the European Championship of sixteen-year-olds, and now they are fourth in the world. It is a quality team with a good character and we need to continue to work with it and develop talent. Now it is up to the federation which coach will be assigned to them in the higher categories, " added Fousek.
Thomas Cook: Czechs kicked out of hotel in Mallorca. Guarantees were not enough
The Austrian, German and Polish divisions of the group also filed for insolvency this week. The future of the Czech branch is currently under discussion, and a decision should be made by the end of September.
According to the deputy chairman of the association of travel agencies of the Czech Republic, Jan pope, there are three possible solutions in play - liquidation will be announced, or the company will be sold, or a team from the Czech branch will set up a new travel agency. "Which of them it will be, but it is impossible to predict, it will depend on the German owner," he told CTK today.
In addition to two prematurely terminated tours, CK also deals with cases where clients had to pay for their stay from their own account, although the company tries to provide guarantees to hoteliers. CK promised to pay its clients, according to the pope, the company has sufficient security for this.
Problems in hotels arose mainly in Mallorca, where the company also asked the Czech consulate for help. In this context, the pope described to CTK one of the cases when the hotel there threw out all the tourists offices. "The hotelier could not determine who belongs to the German and who to the Czech company. Therefore, he threw everyone out of the hotel despite the fact that the local Neckermann provided guarantees," he said. According to šrámek, the situation was finally resolved.
The Czech branch of the bankrupt British group Thomas Cook last year increased its sales to CZK 995 million, almost 21 percent more year-on-year, according to the company's annual report. It covers the accounting period from October 2017 to the end of September 2018. On the contrary, the company's net profit decreased by about seven million to CZK 15.3 million. From previous years, however, the company was left with an outstanding loss of almost CZK 103 million. The branch includes two basic divisions-in addition to CK neckermann, it is also the Global Travel company Lufthansa city center.
Novak helped Trabzonspor to second place, Škoda also scored
Defender Filip Novak helped with a goal in the last round of the Turkish Football League Trabzonspor to the title of vice-champion.
His team won 2: 1 on the field of Kayserispor and kept behind the third Besiktas.
Striker Milan Škoda scored his 10th goal for Rizespor after a January transfer from Slavia, which was saved even after losing 1-3 on Fenerbahce's pitch.
Novak confirmed the excellent productivity of the defender with the seventh goal in this league year.
63. a minute later, the goalkeeper of Kayserispor just fired a sharp shot, and the Czech footballer from an angle fired the ball into the net.
The home side managed to equalize five minutes before the end, but Trabzonspor snatched the victory for their side in the sixth minute of the match when brejk successfully completed a four-on-one.
Škoda in the opening of the second half of the match with Fenerbahce equalized after a solo at 1: 1.
Rizespor did not hold the tie for long, but it did not have to regret it, because thanks to the results of the opponents, it remained three points above the relegation zone.
The competition ends Sunday's duel of the master Basaksehir on the Kasimpasa field.
The well-hidden cave at the hermit in the forests near nový Bor was not actually habitable
In the north of Bohemia, in the foothills of the lusatian mountains, near nový Bor in Czechoslovakia, several sandstone rock formations are hidden in the forests along the count's path.
Both natural and man-made.
And we will go after the man-made one.
The place is called the hermit's cave.
In fact, no hermit ever lived here, and the cave served as a shelter, more precisely, a hiding chamber, probably for grain.
The cave is carved from the side into the rock face and accessible by stairs from above.
At the same time, until the last moment, it is practically not visible.
It is revealed only by narrow steps leading to a kind of rock gallery, from where you only enter the rock.
Although it seems that the chamber is considerably far from human habitation, at the time of creation it could have been on the plateau, where today there is a forest, a field.
"The fact that the building does not have a window and the traditional location of the firebox clearly proves that no hermit could ever survive the winter here," explains historian Kamil podroužek from the Faculty of philosophy of John the evangelist purkyně in Ústí nad Labem.
The one-story building has only a stone bench at the back, apparently serving to store containers.
"I see it as a storage chamber for some food or products from the field," adds Kamil podroužek.
Traces of tools are visible on the walls of the cave.
Breaking off the sandstone with a tip was quite simple and quick for the initiates.
It was enough to properly use the joints and gradually break off the sandstone.
According to the length of the trail of the canines and the method of cutting in general, it is possible to determine the period of formation of the cave.
According to the historian, this is probably the end of the 18th century. century.
The cave is freely accessible and according to the mess that appears in it, someone sometimes sleeps there these days.
If you approach the cave from above from one of the forest paths and you are intrigued by a flowing stream under the cave and a nearby count's path, then you will definitely find a path down.
And on the way out of the forest, you may still be captivated by the nearby Raven rocks.
Someone killed a non-combatant homeless woman under the bridge. Police are looking for witnesses
According to the Prague police, the murder took place sometime during the early evening until the night of Tuesday to Wednesday. It is to this time that the police call for possible testimony refers.
"Some of the drivers, who drove along the bridge connecting Libeň and Žižkov or along the street under krejcárkem, could have filmed the murderer, for example, on the dashboard camera. Some witness might just have seen him and described him. In short, we welcome any testimony on this case and will receive it on line 158, " said Jan daněk, spokesman for the regional police directorate.
According to a spokesman for the tax office, the murdered homeless woman was non-combative, did not drink alcohol and did not seek the company of other people. At the scene of the crime, a woman lived. "Most often she moved around krejcárk, palmovka and Holešovice, when she had large blue shopping bags," daněk added a description of the victim, which could also help potential witnesses.

Nokia sues the Brno company because of the name Lokia. People will not mistake us, Moravians believe
Nokia filed objections to the application of the Lokia brand to the office of industrial property. However, according to ccv, product substitution is unlikely.
The Brno company developing CCV software is facing legal action from the Finnish manufacturer of telecommunications equipment Nokia. Finns do not like that the program of the Brno company for warehouse management is called Lokia WMS, wrote the daily E15. Therefore, Nokia filed objections to the application of the Lokia brand to the industrial property office. The CCV considers that substitution is unlikely.
Marketing director Petr ondrášek said that the program is already used by two dozen customers, it has been on the market since last September.
"The Nokia brand enjoys recognition and trust around the world. When someone attempts to register a trademark that we believe may lead to confusion or weakening of our brand, we take steps to protect our valuable asset," said Nokia spokesman Mark Durrant.
Brno developers claim that they did not think about the brand famous in the past by mobile phones when creating a warehouse program. The designation Lokia according to ccv is based on the Latin name for one species of Dragonfly, whose rapid movement is supposed to be an analogue of the movement of storekeepers around the warehouse.
"In the Czech market, the possibility of substitution is unlikely. We sell modern cloud software with which companies equip their warehouse operations, and we are not really heading into the field of mobile phone production. And we do not want to be compared to a brand that may be running out of steam in its field, " CCV manager Tomáš kormaňák responded in E15.
Ccv applied for trademark protection in August before the launch of the programme at the industrial property office. "Protection was sought for products and services in classes 9, 35 and 42, since software belongs to class 9, related warehouse business management services belong to class 35 and computer software development to class 42 according to the international classification," said ondrášek.
Nokia's objection is based on the fact that the earlier Nokia trade mark is valid in all classes of goods and services and thus covers the widest possible range of goods and services and therefore, of course, overlaps also in classes 9, 35 and 42. 'The CCV does not dispute the claim of the objector as regards the conformity of those classes of products and services. In reality, however, these are completely different brands aimed at other target groups, " said ondrášek.
The dispute over the brand can take months, according to E15, and this can complicate the company's activities.
Coal will give way to gas and core. Renewables won't cover increased demand, says ExxonMobil's European boss
Renewable resources will not be enough for the Czech Republic to meet future energy demand. Due to the unsuitable climate, wind and solar power plants need to be supplemented with other alternatives, such as those using natural gas.
In an interview with hn, Philippe ducom, president of the European branch of the American concern ExxonMobil, one of the largest global oil producers, says this. At the same time, he mentions that large storage facilities, where unused energy from days when there is enough sun and wind, could be stored for later, are still too expensive.
Ducom visited the ExxonMobil center in Prague, where 1,200 people work and whose task is to support the company's business activities and provide logistics and other services necessary for the company's functioning.
Sydney to London in four hours? In 2030, a possible reality
Sabre combines a classic aircraft engine with a rocket one. It is designed to propel the aircraft at twice the speed at which the Concorde flew. "Once the Sabre engine is operational, it could allow us to reach Australia in about four hours," said Turnock. And, for example, the distance between London and New York, the plane could manage to travel in one hour.
The server independent notes that the so-called hypersonic flights, in which the speed of sound is exceeded five times, are complicated due to overheating of the engine. But Sabre (Synergetic air Breathing rocket engine) should deal with this problem thanks to the use of super-cold helium, which should prevent the rise in temperatures.
"The most important thing about sabre is that it is a hybrid of a rocket and an aircraft engine that is powered by a stream of exhaust gases created from the air," says Shaun Driscoll of Reaction Engines. "Missiles over the past 70 years have not undergone such a great development, while aircraft ones do. So when you combine the engines, you can have a very light and efficient propulsion system and essentially create a space plane, " he added.
The engine is currently being tested, with test flights expected to begin around the middle of next year. Commercial flights then around 2030.
I still see myself as a boy who is just looking around, says Jan Cina
"It was a great school for all who worked on it. I fell in love with afro dancing there. The fact that I have something Romani in me from my father made me completely enchanted, " said Jan Cina, who considers himself mainly a musical actor.
He has much fresher memories than the series first step for the role of the decorator in the new film national class. Cina revealed that the director Stepan Altrichter had to entice him a lot. "The work was difficult, but the result is worth it. The film was made a year ago. Hard and honest, but fun at the same time. It was shot on national Avenue, where I drove a car as a non-driver. A lot was also filmed in the southern city of Prague, " he said of the Czech-German co-production.
Although he is nominated for the Thalia award for his role in the production of the little prince, he does not consider it the pinnacle of his career. "That's not how I feel. I still see myself as a kid just looking around. But the nomination is very pleasant and surprising. I can see the peak far ahead of me, " he revealed, adding that he did not even think about a thank you speech in case of victory. "Not really, but as a child, when I listened to talk shows on the radio, I always imagined myself speaking to people."
Jan Cina has been living with his colleague Petr vančura for thirteen years. What is his recipe for a happy relationship? "To love each other and to perceive problems as a challenge and a good thing to solve," he revealed, recalling the Czech Lion award, when his friend fell on the stairs.
"Yes, it really happened. He had new slippery shoes, and the red carpet was slippery, too. So he did not last long and lay on the ground. He made it a priority. He had a workshop Vančurova stairs, where he taught how to safely fall down the stairs at VIP events."

Jockey Minařík is in artificial sleep after a heavy fall in Germany
"Philip is now in the best of hands.
The institute is equipped for such cases, in addition, fortunately, we have a part of the family in Hanover.
This greatly facilitates my situation, and also the care of my daughter Finja, " the server quoted Jezdci.cz a statement from Minařík's wife Katja.

Now we all have to be patient and give him time, " said the wife of the forty-five-year-old jockey.

Video referee took the players Sassuola four goals, lost 0:2
Sassuolo's players scored four times in the match in Naples on Saturday, but eventually had to accept a 0-2 defeat.
None of their goals the referee after consulting the video because of offside did not recognize.
According to Italian media, this is a record adversity of technology, so many hits have never been missed by VAR to one team.
"VAR was more severe on Sassuolo than the road radar and punished him like no team yet.
The new technology breaks records, " Gazzetta dello Sport wrote in a comment.
"Festival of unrecognized goals sassuola.
Never before has var been so strict on one team, " added the newspaper Corriere dello Sport.
Naples took the lead at 8: 00 on Saturday. a minute, but after half an hour of play, Sassuolo seemed to equalize.
Filip djuričič's goal was not recognized after the video referee because of offside.
For the same reason, Djuricic's next shot and Francesc Caputo's and Domenico Berardi's goals did not apply.
The home side, on the other hand, added one more goal.
Electric cars report a new record.
In the Czech Republic, they were recharged the most in history
"Growth was driven by a 30% increase in the number of stations in our network and the trend of more frequent charging at public stations, as well as the accelerated development of registrations of new e-cars," said Tomáš chmelík, head of the čez clean technologies department.
Other big players, such as PRE and e, are also claiming their share of the market.He, the manufacturer of electric cars Tesla, but also supermarkets bill and Lidl.
In turn, the operators of conventional petrol stations are represented by MOL.
She doesn't have the numbers yet.
"We started building our network for electromobility only last year," explained company spokeswoman Jana jusková.
However, the editors of the journal exclusively obtained data from all 216 electrical stands operated by čez.
It follows from them that drivers from the stations took an average of 13.5 kWh.
That's equivalent to a 100-mile range of a smaller electric car.
Leaving aside minor pumping up to 1 kWh, the average charge lasts two and a half hours.
The vast majority of refueling then took place at a free tariff.
If motorists have already paid for the collection, their typical spend was around CZK 330.
Electromobility pulls mainly in the capital.
On the territory of Prague there are all five of the most busy recharges of čez, which overshadow the entire regional cities with their popularity.
Between the regions then leads Olomouc.
On the contrary, the least interest is in remote stations in the border area, for example in bohumín or in prachatice, which often remain unused throughout the day.
More than four thousand electric vehicles are currently registered in the Czech Republic.
In the first half of this year alone, 1274 new e-cars were added.
In an extensive survey of the newspaper "Czechs in motion", eight percent of readers said that they are considering buying an electric car for the family.
However, only a third of respondents know where to look for the nearest charging station in their area.
Epilepsy complicated his love of sports, thanks to the operation he has a new hope
For the first time, the parents of Honzik noticed that something was wrong with him, in a year and a half. He always looked into space for a few minutes, became immobile and did not react to anyone. Therefore, the pediatrician sent him to the children's neurological clinic, where doctors diagnosed him with epilepsy after a series of examinations and immediately put him on medication, which did not work immediately.
It took almost a year for the doctors to find the ideal combination of drugs, thanks to which he completely stopped having seizures. At the age of five, doctors stopped him from taking medication, and since the seizures did not return, his parents thought that Honza was healthy and began to lead him more to sports. He rode a bicycle, skied, played tennis and floorball, spent his free time playing with his sister and friends. But at the age of eleven, he had another seizure, and everything started all over again.
Doctors again tried different combinations of drugs, but this time nothing worked anymore, seizures in the form of absences were constantly repeated. Since he always lost his senses during a seizure, his parents were terrified that he would get it during sports and get injured. Gradually, Honza stopped cycling and replaced downhill skis with cross-country skis and snowboard. Although from time to time the sport gave him a fit, he never completely gave it up. He even fulfilled his dream and finished the Spartan race, but together with a friend who had him constantly in sight to help in case of an emergency.
When Honza was 15 years old, his parents decided to try to change doctors and turned to specialists in the FN in Motol. The doctors there, after a series of examinations, concluded that Honza was a candidate for surgery to remove a lesion from his brain-the source of epileptic seizures. "I had 2 operations in a row, first the doctors inserted probes into my brain that sensed its activity, then they could only remove the bearing. It's been a few weeks of hell for me. I just had to lie down and hardly move, wires sticking out of my head, which were connected to the computer, " recalls Honza.
The operation was successful, and the doctors removed a fairly extensive bearing. "The first days after the operation it was very mentally demanding, Honza was apathetic, confused, sad and almost did not speak. As opposed to how he is normally alive and communicative, this was a scary change, but fortunately, after a couple of days everything returned to normal, "the mom describes, adding:" a month and a half after the operation, he had 1 seizure, but according to doctors, it happens. He's been seizure-free for three months."
This school year, Honza will graduate, in addition to sports, he enjoys languages and began to cooperate with the company E, with which he travels around schools for discussions about epilepsy. Honza is not yet fully engaged in sports activities, he is starting to return to the sport gradually. "I learn how to play sports properly, how to breathe well, so as not to expose the body to sudden stress, which, however, is quite a challenge with my competitive nature," explains Honza.
This year, therefore, will not actively participate in the traditional EPPI water triathlon, which meets patients with epilepsy and healthy athletes, and which takes place this weekend 28. September 2019 at veselská piskovna. But maybe next year.

Not just for better water retention.
In Prague, environmental activists protested
According to the organizers, the government's actions so far on the issues of protection and recovery of the Czech landscape and the solution of the climate crisis are insufficient, the speakers called on the state to take a more aggressive approach.
The event called the last drop was attended by representatives of large organizations such as the rainbow movement, Greenpeace or the Green Party, as well as smaller local associations.
"We have here, for example, people who oppose the expansion of the Turów mine in the long term, there are people who oppose the extraction of gravel at uherský ostroh, there are people who oppose the construction of senseless dams," said Marika volfová on behalf of the organizers.
She stated that the main demands of the protesters are the creation of a plan for water retention in the countryside, a radical change in agricultural policy and the subsidy system towards the promotion of sustainable agriculture and the fastest possible transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.
"The government has to defend the interests of the people, not reckless and devastating business," she said.
On malostranské square, a stand was placed with a petition calling on the representatives of the Czech state to take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and restore the Czech land and landscape.
The people present were equipped with banners with slogans such as" the end of rape depression "or"less coal, more newts".
Jan Škoda from the association for water for people came to Prague from South Moravia to protest against the plan of gravel extraction in hodonínska.
"It threatens the source of drinking water for 140, 000 people," he said.
He added that wells represent the fifth most productive source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
According to him, the planned gravel extraction is located only about 500 meters from the wells, and according to the assessments it is certain that the water quality will be compromised.
Vojtěch Veselý came from the village of valeč in Karlovy Vary as a so-called agroecological farmer.
He drew attention to the advantages of small farms, which do not seek income and profit and supply the population directly on the spot.
"Small agro-ecological farms are able to feed the entire population quite normally, on top of this they do not do such destruction in the form of the countryside and the environment," he said.
Kovosvit sells an office building and other halls. Expecting worse times
Due to restructuring, Kovosvit ended last year with a consolidated loss of CZK 100 million, consolidated turnover was CZK 1.3 billion. Among the main problems of last year, the chef ranks the lack of staff and shifts of subcontractors. This year, demand for machine tools fell by 10 to 20 percent year-on-year. "This is related to the expected decline in turnover of the order of ten percent," said the CEO. In 2017, Kovosvit had revenues of CZK 1.3 billion and profit after tax of CZK 40.1 million. The loss for 2016 was 719 million.
Kovosvit now offers for sale several properties, halls and land, which are either not used, or only minimally. This also applies to the administrative building, where from five floors it uses two, and not yet completely. "Part of the long-term restructuring plan is to slim down kovosvit, to streamline its activities. The sale of assets is not part of any current solution, whether it is cash-flow, but part of a long-term plan, when we want to devote all our resources to investment development, " said the CEO.
About half of kovosvit's production is exported. Its standard markets are the EU and Russia, last year to a lesser extent Asia. This year, Kuchar ranks among the most interesting in India, where Kovosvit received a contract for machines enabling five-axis machining worth CZK 100 million. This year, the company also exported two five-axis machines worth CZK 30 million to China. "There is another contract in the same volume, which we would like to fulfill before the end of the year," said Kuchar. In the Russian market and elsewhere, Kovosvit is facing restrictions due to sanctions.
Last year, the company sold two five-axis machining centers to France, a company that subcontracts to Airbus. In May this year, it delivered another machine, one more should be delivered at the end of the year or early in 2020.
The main investment this year was the transition of heating from steam to hot water for CZK 20 million. Kovosvit employs 500 people, the average worker's salary is CZK 28,500. The company is looking for casting grinders for foundry, machine tools, lathes and electricians.
The company has been owned since September 2016 by industrialist and gunsmith Jaroslav Strnad. The enterprise has a tradition in the production of machine tools. In 1939 it was founded by Tomáš baťa. The company had at one time as many as three thousand employees.
In the fall of the plane on the house in Germany killed three people
Today, three people died and two others were injured when an ultralight aircraft crashed into an apartment building in western Germany.
It was reported by the local emergency services, according to which among the dead are probably two crew members and one resident of the house.
The plane crashed on the roof of a building in the town of Wesel in North Rhine-Westphalia.
The attic apartment, which was one of five housing units in the House, subsequently caught fire.
Firefighters have already managed to bring the flames under control.
Deputy commander of the local fire department Robert meyboom said that apparently both crew members of the aircraft died.
The third victim, according to the police, is a woman who lived in the house.
The newspaper Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (waz), citing the mayor of Wesel, wrote that it was a single mother whose two-year-old daughter was rescued from the apartment with minor injuries.
Near the accident, an emergency parachute was found, which apparently served as a brake during landing.
The police assume it came from the crashed plane.
In the airplane there was a place for two people.
The machine took off from the airport in the nearby town of marl.
The Rheinische Post newspaper, citing eyewitnesses, reported that before the crash, the plane collided with a hot air balloon.
However, this information has not yet been confirmed.
Waz, citing other witnesses, wrote that the aircraft disintegrated in the air before hitting the ground.
Accident on D5: Highway closed collision of trucks
The incident was reported around 08: 00 on 22. kilometer in the direction of the threshold. "The highway is closed, at least for freight traffic. Passenger cars can go through the gas station, " said police spokeswoman Michaela Richter in the morning. Traffic was able to resume around 14: 30. According to Richter, the preliminary damage is at least two million crowns, the cause of the accident is being investigated by the police.
A spokesman for the Central Bohemian firefighters, Petr Svoboda, said that one truck was carrying passenger vehicles and the other was carrying plastic pellets. "Due to the large impact, the displacement of the transported vehicles occurred, which firefighters had to first secure against a possible fall," he added.
One of the cars had a damaged fuel tank, from which about 200 liters of diesel leaked. Another 200 liters firefighters managed to pump out. The accident was caused by a fuel leak caused by employees of the Department of the environment of the Beroun town hall. The rescue of the crashed vehicles and the motorway was provided by a private company, which also removed the contaminated soil.
Microplastics have reached the human intestines, confirmed for the first time a study
Scientists have confirmed several years of suspicion. A team led by Vienna University Professor Philipp Schwabl has published a study that for the first time proves the presence of microplastics in human stool. Although the study is small, with eight participants from Europe, Japan and Russia-however, tiny plastic particles measuring between 50 and 500 micrometers were found in the samples of all subjects studied. None of the eight subjects were vegetarian, six of them did not avoid sea fish, all drank water from plastic bottles and food packed in plastic.
And it would actually be kind of a miracle if nothing was found. We already know that microplastics - which are either produced directly, for example for the cosmetics industry, or produced by breaking up larger pieces-are present in marine animals, insects, tap water and sodas; in short, everywhere on the planet. Thus, their entry into the digestive system of man is only officially confirmed. There were about 20 microplastic particles per ten grams of stool, and scientists estimate that more than half of the world's population will have them.
Of course, both lay and scientific awareness knows that this is not good. However, humanity still does not know how bad it is-and what effect microplastics have on the "host" organisms. Small particles can get into the bloodstream or the lymphatic system and end up, for example, in the liver. "This is the first ever study of its kind and has confirmed what we have long thought. Now that we have the first evidence of the occurrence of microplastics in the human body, we must continue to investigate what exactly this means for human health, " says Schwabl.
So far, it is known that microplastics in the intestines can negatively affect the immune reactions of the digestive system, thereby facilitating the absorption of poisonous chemicals and other pathogens into the body. And so far, no other solution is known than to limit the use of plastics, especially polypropylene. However, this will be difficult-the first task facing governments and authorities will at least be to stop its steep increase. As for plastic bottles alone, experts estimate that in three years, humanity will consume a fifth more than today. The current rate is a staggering million bottles bought per minute. Around eight million tonnes of plastic end up in the seas and oceans every year. Waste threatens marine ecosystems and infects the digestive systems of marine animals.
Some countries have already adopted restrictions and other measures, Kenya, for example, has banned plastic bags under the threat of draconian penalties. The European Commission is considering small-scale bans (the well-known straws), and the domestic Ministry of the environment is heading in the same direction. But critics say that such measures, while Nice, are completely inadequate.
Repair of the Krkonoše museum will be a year late
The Krkonoše national park administration (krnap) has postponed the deadline for submitting bids for the second tender for the repair of the Krkonoše museum in Vrchlabí by three weeks. The original date for opening envelopes was 20. September, said national park spokesman Radek drahny. The reason for the postponement of the deadline for the submission of tenders is the reduction of the budget from CZK 110 million to CZK 83 million.
"At the moment we are working with the prices that are on the market. There has been a change in the budget, this is the price we expect to be offered. If someone submits an offer that will be acceptable, then the work will begin as soon as possible, " said Dear.
Compared to the original plans, the start of the repair of the museum is about a year late. Krnap wanted to have a selected supplier of construction parts by the end of last year and start construction work this spring. According to the management of the national park administration, European subsidies of CZK 123 million for the project are not threatened.
Krnap administration is unable to choose a construction company for the repair of the museum. The second tender was launched this summer, because in the previous tender all offers of companies significantly exceeded the then estimated price of 65 million. The bids exceeded 100 million crowns.
The museum, which is housed in a former Augustinian monastery and belongs to the krnap administration, has been closed since autumn 2017. The selected firm should provide the construction part of the project. The total cost, including the construction of a new exposition, is estimated at CZK 210 million. The krnap visitor center should be built in the now vacated building by the end of 2021 after the transformation of the expositions.
The repaired museum with a new interactive exposition, which should be a story of nature and people settled in the mountains and build on the successful exposition stone and life, should serve as a representative entrance gate of the giant mountains for visitors. The visitor center should provide the most understandable form of information about the past and present of the giant mountains and motivate people to discover the mountains and protect them. It should also assume the role of a traditional museum. The center will also offer opportunities to organize concerts, festivals, theatrical performances or lectures in the open air. The plans include the construction of a new entrance to the building, the establishment of a study or cafe.
On Saturday, česká spořitelna erroneously charged some card payments twice.
The error has already been fixed
Česká spořitelna erroneously charged some card payments twice to its clients on Saturday afternoon.
According to the bank's spokesman Lukáš kropík, the problem could have involved thousands of transactions.
The error has already been corrected by the savings bank and the money returned to the clients.
Problems with double billing of card payments the savings bank noticed on Saturday afternoon.
"Just yesterday (Saturday) night, we updated the system and immediately returned all these double payments to our clients.
At the moment everything works without problems, " said Kropík on Sunday afternoon.
The exact number of clients to whom the bank deducted money from card payments twice, the spokesman of the bank does not know, according to his estimate, these were lower thousands of transactions.
The causes of problems are being investigated by the savings bank.
"It could have been a combination of several factors," said kropik.
Česká spořitelna is the largest bank in the Czech Republic by number of clients.
At the end of March, she had 4.6 million.
The owner of the savings bank is the Austrian financial group Erste Group Bank, which is a key player in the banking market of central and eastern Europe.
Vojtěch on Monday will present a system of three emergency stages against coronavirus
"Degrees will be according to the strength of community dissemination at the regional level.
We are working on this together with epidemiologists and the Institute of health information and statistics, " Vojtěch said in the Czech Republic.
This will be a traffic light, with each region marked in green, orange or red depending on the risk of coronavirus.
The minister added that the inclusion of individual regions will still talk with epidemiologists.
He admitted that only the Moravian-Silesian region would be orange at present, and Prague would be closer to it.
The map will also include individual measures for regional sanitary stations, hospitals, social facilities and employers.
"We want to solve this at the regional level, because the situation in them is not uniform," Vojtěch said.
"A frightening result of the study."Islam does not belong to the West, the vast majority of Austrians think
1200 respondents were interviewed, the survey shows considerable distrust of Islam in Austrian society.
Almost 60 percent of the population of Austria fears that some Muslims are terrorists, and 48 percent would call for the introduction of a ban on the construction of mosques. For more monitoring of the Centers of Islam, 80 percent of those surveyed.
The majority of Austrians also want Muslims to be restricted in their religious practices and say that the presence of Muslims sometimes makes them feel like foreigners in their own country.
"The result of the study is frightening," says study author Wolfgang Aschauer, adding: "such a propensity for ethnocentrism could eventually lead to the adoption of discriminatory attitudes. Religious freedoms granted to Muslims are in danger of being curtailed."
In believers, the critical attitude is less pronounced. Aschauer argues that in Austria it is not a conflict between religions, but between cultures. Dialogue and education could help blunt polarization, according to the sociologist.
According to the study, the most hostile attitudes towards Muslims are held by voters of the extreme right, people without higher education or seniors over the age of 75. The most welcoming, on the contrary, are green voters, people under the age of 30 and college students.
According to estimates by the Austrian Ministry of the interior, about 700 thousand Muslims live in Austria, which has a population of about 8.7 million people. The vast majority have Turkish roots. There are more than 400 Muslim prayer houses and mosques in the country, and Islam has been officially recognized here as a religion since 1912.
Which cities disappear under the sea?
The vote of the upper house of the Canadian parliament confirmed a well-known rumor for several days: Canada is withdrawing the honorary citizenship of the former legend of the struggle for human rights, Nobel Peace Prize winner Do Aung San Suu Kyi. The current leader of Myanmar (Burma), who spent years under house arrest for trying to bring freedom to her country, lost her honorary title for her part in the genocide against the minority Rohingya people.
The decision to take away Suu Kyi's honorary citizenship was approved by the lower legislature a week ago, and senators have now unanimously supported it. "This is the right message for her, for Myanmar and for the world," Independent Senator Ratna Omidvar commented on the decision of her colleagues. "We must make it clear that accomplices of genocide are not welcome here in Canada - much less as honest citizens."
The verdict of the Canadian parliament does not technically change anything for Suu Kyi, it is only an honorary title, but on a symbolic level it is a strong message for her. The silence of a long-time human rights campaigner on the atrocities that the army of majority Buddhist Myanmar has been committing for endless months against the Rohingya Muslim minority is intolerable.
The fact that officially organised genocide is taking place in Myanmar and that Suu Kyi - the de facto prime minister of the government there - has completely failed in her duty to protect her citizens has recently been brought to light in a UN report. In particular, it mentions the names of several army commanders who, according to the investigation team, should stand trial for crimes against humanity committed in actions that-as the report says - "shock both with the horror of their actions and with the enormous scale". According to the United Nations, Suu Kyi and her administration have been complicit mainly by covering up the soldiers ' actions and spreading a protective fog of lies around them - for example, that it was an "anti-terrorist operation."
After the removal of Suu Kyi, five figures remain on the list of honorary citizens of Canada: Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, Nelson Mandela, Tändzin gjamccho, 14. Dalai Lama, Karim Aga Khan IV, 49. imam of Shiite Muslims and Malala Yousufzai.
The Canadian Museum of human rights also reflected developments surrounding the former icon of the struggle for freedom and democracy, where Suu Kyi's profile included information about atrocities against the Rohingya and the parliamentary decision to take away her honorary citizen title. "We have also dimmed the illumination of her photo on a plaque depicting a timeline of the struggle for human rights, and we are thinking of replacing her face with a portrait of a member of the Rohingya minority," Canadian media quoted museum spokesman Rory McLeod as saying.
The only thing that will remain so in the current turmoil of Suu Kyi-at least for now-is the Nobel Peace Prize, awarded to her at the suggestion of Vaclav Havel in 1991 for her enormous contribution to the struggle for democracy. "Although the current actions of Ms. Suu Kyi are regrettable, her award will not be canceled," Lars Heikensten, the head of the Nobel Foundation, told Canada's CBS.

Technology companies want to rule our cities
Francis Fukuyama's history is kind of baked in. In 1992, at the height of the wave of liberalism that followed the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Iron Curtain, this political scientist wrote in his most famous book the end of history and the last man: "what we may be witnessing... it is the final point of the ideological development of mankind and the universal acceptance of Western liberal democracy as the final form of government."
Twenty-six years later, we are seeing rather illiberal models triumph from the US to Russia, from Turkey to Poland, and from Hungary to Italy, and various forms of nationalism and radicalism flourish. Fukuyama's current ninth book, identity: the demand for Dignity and the politics of Resentment, attempts to balance these forces. As his interview with George Eaton for the New Statesman shows, he reconsiders many of his former positions: he argues that the ideas of socialism should be returned to the public space, and Marx was right in many respects. At the same time, he insists that his intellectual development is still in line with the position of the 1990s, and critics have not understood the end of history and the last man correctly.
"What I said back then was that one of the problems of modern democracy is that while it provides peace and prosperity, people want more than that... Liberal democracies do not even try to define what a good life is. It leaves it to individuals who feel alienated, do not see the point, and therefore group themselves into groups according to identity that give them a sense of belonging."
In its time, the book the end of history and the last man was written as a strong argument against the Marxists, who perceived communism as the final stage of history. When Fukuyama is asked how he now sees the rise of socialists in Britain and the US, he replies: "it all depends on what you mean by socialism. If we are talking about ownership of the means of production, then, in my opinion, this will not work, except when clear public services are in demand. But if you mean redistributive programs that are trying to solve the huge imbalance in income and wealth that we are already seeing, then yes. I think not only could he come back, he should come back. The long period that President Reagan and prime minister Thatcher started, in which certain types of ideas about the benefits of an unregulated market came to the fore, has had a disastrous effect in many ways."
In the end, Fukuyama tries to calm the current situation, warning all liberals that even the advent of new, not entirely democratic regimes will not mean the end of history.
Civilization in the allotted time
Recently, I remembered a beautiful "line" from one of the great stories of Simek with Grossman, which takes place partly in the cemetery, which reads as follows: "I warned her that she cries well, but on someone else's grave!"It occurred to me that many world politicians engaged in the senseless fight against climate change are now behaving very similarly.
They behave as if the planet earth is ruled by humans. In fact, we are just a speck on its surface, which it can blow out with its enormous forces like a sharp gust of wind the flame of a candle. Perhaps few of them look at the famous British and American natural science documents discussing the destructive capabilities of our blue ball. After all, it would be enough for one of the larger active volcanoes to properly" blow up " and our advanced civilization will fall from it.
And that this will happen in the near future is highly likely. A number of large volcanoes have, according to leading volcanologists, "charged and unlocked" (for example, Katla in Iceland).
In a way, it would be ideal if the eruption, if it must happen once, occurred as soon as possible. Even before trillions of dollars are wasted on measures to reduce carbon dioxide production, because any really angry volcano, along with dust and poisonous volcanic gases, can release at least a hundred times more into the atmosphere than has been saved at the expense of the people of Europe.
Therefore, it makes no sense to restrict CO2 production by force. In addition, it has been scientifically proven that with its significantly higher proportion in the air, plants form more biological matter and are also more drought-resistant. For humanity, possible warming is significantly more favorable than, for example, a rapid return of the ice age.
Bearing in mind the still insufficiently studied influence of the solar cycles on the earth's climate, there is only one reasonable conclusion to be drawn: let us strive to keep the earth as clean as possible, and let us try to adapt to other changes with which we cannot cope with the force with the least cost!
Aquarius and Karolínka
When the watermen Jonah and the Miller's daughter karolínka fall in love, it's not easy at all.
Jonah in love is prevented by his father, the irascible Waterman hastrbuch, Karolínka has no idea that her beloved Jonah is not a man.
Fortunately, there is a young Libor, who will do everything to protect the whole village, and especially karolínka, from this Aquarius villain.
So what if he's scheming and lying?
Especially if she can get Caroline to reject Jonah and give preference to him, the valiant Libor.
Soon it becomes clear to everyone in the village who is responsible for the drowning of the night teapot, the spoiled flour, the fire of the mill and other villainies.
Angry villagers organize a hunt for the Aquarian, and on top of that, an implacable Aquarian curse falls on Jonah's head.
And now, little Caroline, the teapot's soul!
How to soften the old hasterbuch, convince the neighbors of Jonah's innocence, find Jonah and deliver him from the spell?
The fairy tale was filmed in September 2010 in the studios of ČT and exteriors at the brzina pond, in obděnice in sedlčanská and in the beautiful surroundings of the historic mill in hoslovice.
Kristýna Plíšková did not reach the final, her second title is still missing
In 2016 she won her first tournament on the WTA circuit and this year she performed very masterfully.
After wins with Paolini, kawaová and Kužmová, she fought her way to the top four.
But the match with Alison Van Uytvanck did not go well for Kristyna. The Belgian held her serve and broke Plíšková's serve twice in the first set. In the second set, Van Uytvanck soon took a 3-0 lead and Kristyna failed to turn it around, even though she managed to turn one break point. At the last, she turned away one sword, but at the second, the end came.

Purposeful slander? Ustka zoo is looking for a new veterinarian, no one is interested
Most recently at the end of this month. The city administration attributes this to rumors that arose around the former director of the zoo and veterinarian Václav poživil, that he purposefully killed exotic animals that he cared for. For example, it was a female rhinoceros zambu, an elephant Kalu or an orangutan nuñaka.
Therefore, the city council announced a new contract. "For veterinary care for the zoo with an estimated value of 3.5 million crowns without VAT and for the city centre for animals in need with an estimated value of 2.8 million crowns without VAT," approached the city spokeswoman Romana macová.
Deputy mayor Věra nechybová (UFO) explained that this is the third time the city has announced a competition for veterinary services. "Dr. poživil had to explain these unfounded suspicions. I consider this an outrageous dehonestation of such a quality specialist," she noted.
Specialists specializing in exotic animals, according to her, are very few. "It's definitely not pleasant. The zoo, meanwhile, provides veterinary care in the form of orders," she said. Orders and contract cost the same money. "The garden has to comply with the law on public procurement in terms of financing," explained zoo spokeswoman Nikola roštejnská.
Václav poživil himself is one of the recognized experts. For example, he participated in a unique operation in which the USTA cheetah Jane was the first cheetah in the world to receive a total endoprosthesis. He served as director of the zoo from 2009 to 2012. Anonymous slander on his person did not comment. Yesterday he did not answer phone calls or respond to SMS text messages.
As for the contract for the zoo, some veterinarians believe that in the zero interest in it there is not necessarily concern about similar purposeful allegations, as in his case, but simply little information. For example, the veterinarian of Ústí nad Labem, Jiří král, has not heard of her yet. "This is the first time I've heard this from you. No one called us. Such a thing, I think, will spread quickly, " he added.

Plane crash near Zhinkovo in Pilsen: two people did not survive the accident
The plane was carrying two people, a man (†63) and a woman (†38). "The plane requested permission to land at Chaloupky u klatov airport at 9: 30 p.m.," said police spokeswoman Dana Ladman. This was also the last record, at that time, according to GPS coordinates, it should be located near Vojovice near žinkov.
Klatovy airport has not flown. After the lost aircraft, which sent a distress signal, immediately began to search. "In addition to the police, a military helicopter was involved," said police spokeswoman Martina korandová. But the search operation did not have a happy ending.
In the forest near Petrovice near měčín, which is about six kilometers from the place where the plane last checked in, a helicopter crew noticed the wreckage before nine o'clock in the morning. "We found a plane and two bodies with no signs of life," confirmed korandova.
The crashed machine remained partially wedged in the branches of trees, pieces fell to the ground in the vicinity. "We will determine the cause of the accident in cooperation with experts and employees of the Institute for the professional investigation of the causes of air accidents," added korandová.
The course of the disease of the majority is mild, only three percent of the infected have to go to the hospital
Either a milder form of coronavirus is spreading through the Czech Republic, or the summer dose of sunshine has significantly improved our immunity.
Infectious disease wards of hospitals are half empty, although the numbers of infected are growing.
"The situation today and in April is completely different and this is mainly due to the number of hospitalized patients," confirms the minister of health Adam Vojtěch.
It is worth remembering that 11. April, when the first wave of the epidemic peaked in our country, everyone wore masks, the army took samples, the republic was closed and the Czechs used disinfectants for a year ahead.
Still, ten people died a day.
Now the daily increases in the number of infected are higher, but every day with covid-19, a maximum of two people die.
Karvinsko still has the highest number of people infected per capita, and Jihlava has similar numbers due to an outbreak in the local Alzheimer's center, where there are already 57 infected - 40 clients and 17 employees.
Another home for the elderly was closed by hygienists in černožice in Hradec Králové.
The disease was confirmed by tests on one of the nurses.
"We are traversing, we have restricted movement, we have all hygienic measures," says Martin scháněl, director of the retirement home.
According to him, none of the clients of the home yet have symptoms of the disease.
Area testing will begin tomorrow, and then the hygienists will decide on the next measure.
Hospitals are also responding to the increased number of infected.
The Institute of oncology in Brno today launched an automatic camera system at the entrance, which detects if people are wearing a mask when entering.
The record is reported by South Bohemian hygienists, who recorded twenty - five cases of coronavirus-most of them are foreign employees of a prachatic firm.
A total of 131 infected people arrived on Saturday-half of the number on Friday-but fewer are being tested at the weekend.
Only children. Reproduction is not certain, but we do not have to scare
Some words have sinister connotations, even if they only convey the state of affairs. These include the word only child. It refers to a child growing up without siblings, but does not sound neutral. "You know that, only child," they say, without further ado. It is interesting that the" only child " bears this trait from a long time ago, even from the times when terms such as the demographic crisis were not widely used.
Today, even people outside the scientific community know that a fertility rate of 2.1 children per woman is necessary to ensure the simple reproduction of the population. It is also widely known that no state in Europe today attains this value. At most, it is close to France or Sweden, but the European countries do not have a simple rate of population reproduction. (Within the west, only Israel stands out with an aggregate fertility rate of 3.1 children per woman.) It's a situation made for alarmism. Therefore, it is not surprising when the minister of labour and social affairs maláčová is also failing him: "there are almost as many only children as families with two children," she said in an interview for LN. But she left out the devil in the detail.
Yes, it is good to draw attention to the problem instead of downplaying or ideologizing it. For example, in Germany, where the campaign for more children easily gets the label of fascism (in the style of "so did Hitler"). It's good to be reminded that many couples are directly planning their only child. It is good if politicians show the will to remove the obstacles that lead to these decisions (for example, the weak expansion of work from home discourages women from further pregnancies). But despite all this, let's note one thing.
When Minister maláčová says that" there are almost so many only children", there is a touch of demagoguery. That statement should have been made 20 years ago. Recall that fertility in the Czech Republic last provided simple reproduction in 1980 ("Husák's children"). Then it dropped to an ominous 1.14 in 2000. But since then it has risen by almost fifty percent, to the current 1.70 children per woman, which is above the European average. It is not enough for simple reproduction, so the activity of politicians is necessary. Only with this alarmism can they ease up a little.
Neckermann cancels all flights, it concerns five hundred Czech clients
Neckermann cancels flights in connection with the insolvency of the British Thomas Cook and his German daughter.
"The Czech company Thomas Cook, s.r. o., acting under the trade name Neckermann travel agency, has not filed an insolvency petition," šrámek said in a press release.
"However, CK neckermann is forced to continue to cancel the scheduled departures of its clients," he added, adding that this currently applies to all departures from 26. September to 6. October.
According to šrámek, the cancellation of flights will affect about 500 clients. About 800 clients of Neckermann, who are currently abroad, according to him, "will be taken care of and their safe return to the Czech Republic is ensured by their scheduled flight".
The travel agency admitted that some clients were asked to pay for their stay. "In this case, it is necessary that clients immediately contact the SOS line of CK neckermann," šrámek added.
The Thomas Cook crash happened on Monday. In August of this year, the travel agency concluded an agreement on the basis of which creditors were to invest 900 million pounds in the company.
Half of the amount was to be received from the Chinese company Fosun Tourism. The latter, on the basis of this, was to become the majority owner. The other half was to be provided by bondholders and creditor banks. Already 20. however, in September, information appeared that creditors demanded from the travel agency to receive a reserve of 200 million pounds, otherwise the deal falls. On Monday, the company announced that it had gone bankrupt.
Jaromír Soukup spoke about Gott: he wishes him peace
Presenter and businessman Jaromir Soukup (50) will not be afraid of any questions. In his program call and write to the boss, he publicly expresses himself on various topics. And he is no stranger to tabloid cases, which he gleefully and wittily glosses. Although he wasn't laughing this time.
Jaromír Soukup commented on the sad news, which is a very serious illness of Karel Gott. The singer himself promised one very thoughtful thing.
"You know, Charles got sick, and he said it fairly, without having to poke around somewhere tabloid journalists. I do not want to comment on this, it is a serious illness, we all have great respect for Karl Gott. And I would like to wish him, of course, successful treatment and, most importantly, peace! The peace he needs now, " said the owner of the TV Barrandov.
"I wish the media would leave him alone. And she waited for the news that the master himself decides to give to the media. I don't even like the various statements that his old friends and various celebrities make about his health. And for our media, I can say that we will address his illness and his person only if he shows interest in it himself. In my opinion, other media outlets should consider a similar approach."
Mahulena bočanova interrupted the annual detox and again sins!
More than a year ago, Mahulena bočanová confided in the flash that she was quitting alcohol. "Over the holidays, I thought I'd give my tired old 50-year-old body a breather. I gave myself a deadline forever. I feel terribly rested, I have a lot of energy and, most importantly, my psyche has improved. I haven't been in a good place mentally lately. I get up better, I don't have a headache, I have more energy, more money."
A year of abstinence, they say, was enough, and the actress again found her way to alcohol. "Sometimes I have bubbles or good wine, but I don't drink what I used to. I'll have one drink and have fun until the morning. I've got a bottle of wine in the fridge for a week. I also enjoyed non-alcoholic beer, which I can drink at any time, " boasted Mahulena, who is still a couple with the Brno entrepreneur Peter.
After the holidays, bočanová returned to the theatre season and will take part in the series "ordinace v růžové záhrada". "I'm ashamed of the first two performances, I was really bad, I was swearing. But it's getting better, " smiles the actress critically.
The couple wrapped the bitch with tape and drowned in the river, the children found the bag
The case took place at the end of July in the village around valašské klobouk. A 27-year-old woman brought home a donated dog one to two years old, which she wanted to take care of. However, her 10-year-old partner did not like the fact that she was a bitch, so he decided to get rid of her.
"He wrapped the animal with duct tape and rope, greatly eliminating its vocal speech. He put the dog in a jute bag, which he tied. Then they took the animal together to the river, where they threw it in a sack. At the moment when the dog was thrown into the water, the dog was clearly alive, " said Zlín police spokeswoman Monika kozumplíková.
The next day, the children, who were playing by the river, found a jute bag on the bank. When they opened it, they found the body of a dead dog inside. So they called a woman who was passing by, and they ran away. The woman reported the incident to the police emergency line 158.
"The police, thanks to the knowledge of the townspeople, found out who is probably the perpetrator of this incredible act. And they weren't wrong. A man and a woman confessed to the crime and described how the event took place, " added the police spokeswoman.
Expert statements from the field of Veterinary Medicine confirmed that the dog died clearly in a harrowing way as a result of suffocation, when before death the animal suffered in the order of several minutes.
"The actions of the perpetrators undoubtedly show a clear intention to get rid of the animal at all costs in this despicable way, even if they could donate or sell the dog. The commissioner of the criminal police from Zlín accused the couple of committing the crime of animal cruelty committed in complicity. Both previously unpunished charges could, if convicted, spend up to three years behind bars, " kozumplíková noted.
Declaration of the end of the right in the house or what "right" coalition ODS, TOP 09, Stan and KDU?
In the media and comments recently there are reports about the upcoming coalition of the parties mentioned. Many are applauding that the 'right' is finally coming together, but I am more interested in why these parties still identify themselves as right-wing.
Apart from the new Tricolor movement, the Czech Chamber of Deputies no longer has a real right-wing party. And it does not matter how the subjects themselves refer to themselves or what label the mainstream media parrot. The ODS is hardly centrist in its average of top politicians of this party, the top 09 is clearly the party of the urban pseudo-liberal left (which is ashamed of its leftism and thus hypocritically refers to itself as conservative or even right-wing). Stan is a party that, by its concept, ideology and voter targeting, basically merges with TOP 09 (the reason for its existence is simply not clear to me). And the KDU has even long labeled itself as a center-left party-but their political compass is much more to the left than they say.
Do you feel like I took them all out of the water? No, I am based on the real political actions of these parties. If I consider myself a classically liberal right-wing voter, the highest value for me is the freedom of the individual, the free market and minimal state interference in the life of individuals and the economy. How do they fulfil this general assumption of right-handedness? How many laws cutting people's freedoms with a sausage sizzle, raising taxes, confirming new regulations and increasing surveillance, increasing ties to a socialist EU, or promoting environmental and gender madness in recent years? Very, very much. Not their own labels, but actions identify them. These parties, despite all sorts of declarations or partial concessions, want to strengthen the role of the state in our lives. And that has nothing to do with being right-wing.
Coalition cooperation TOP 09, Stan and KDU I would not be surprised at all, on the political map they simply belong to each other and, except for Christian or, on the contrary, homosexual and gender aspects, I do not see any obvious difference for voters in terms of the influence of the state on their lives. However, the ODS has long portrayed itself as "the only right-wing party", and by associating with these three entities, it no longer reveals its true political affiliation.
By the way, when I briefly mentioned the stickers. Have you noticed how often all these parties consistently and cheaply refer to critics of dirigism and socialism coming from the European Union as pro-Russian agents? Are they unable or unwilling to understand that there are many people to whom eurosocialism and growing inequality do not smell as strongly as the authoritarian regime in Russia? Do they not by any chance hide their utter inability to argue and their groundless or blind adoration of the euro-union situation?
In short, it is possible that in the Czech Republic, politics other than the center no longer has a chance of greater success. Maybe that's what the voters really want. Perhaps they want left-wing politics under the cloak of the "right" because they are ashamed of their political beliefs (or they cannot even identify them). I don't know. I'm certainly not one of those voters.
Debutant champion!
Van den Bergh finished the fairy tale, Anderson was swept away
The big surprise of the tournament by the name of Dimitri van den Bergh showed an excellent performance even in a duel with the player who won the second most prestigious enterprise within the PDC in 2018.
The start of the match was balanced on both sides, the break came at 8: 7 for the Belgian dart player.
Van den Bergh took brejk with a 13-point leg and has had the upper hand ever since.
He literally crushed his opponent with his game, and the significantly more experienced "Flying Scot" was hardly able to get to the doubles.
The way the "dream maker" had it in his hand is also evidenced by the fact that a disheveled Anderson played his first maximum only at 24. LEGO.
In addition, the young Belgian coped brilliantly with high checkouts.
The last time he lost in the 11th leg, under unfavorable conditions, but "caught a big fish" and closed 170.
At the end of the match, Anderson showed tremendous frustration.
He was more of a dart thrower and his triumphant opponent was absolutely masterful.
Van den Bergh converted the first of three match darts and lived up to his name-he wrote his big dream.
Winning the trophy named after Phil Taylor is all the more valuable for the Belgian dart player because it is his first major won.
The last player to beat van den Bergh was Karel sedláček.
Babiš called for security cooperation at the memorial to the victims of terror
Prime minister Andrej Babiš and his wife Monika visited 27. September 2019 in New York the memorial of the terrorist attacks of 11. September 2001 ground zero.
Terrorism is the main enemy against which all states of the world should fight together. At the end of a five-day visit to the United States, this today at the New York memorial to the terrorist attacks of the 11th and 12th centuries. September 2001 declared the Czech prime minister Andrej Babiš. On this occasion, the prime minister paid tribute to the memory of two victims of Czech origin.
"It is a very touching place," said the prime minister, as he, accompanied by his wife Monika, placed a white rose next to the names of Lukáš Rambousek and Czechoslovak emigrant Alena sešínová. Both were among the more than 2,750 dead claimed by the hijacked aircraft attack on the former World Trade Center (WTC) skyscraper pair. The towers of the World Trade Center collapsed after the impact, in their place is now a memorial with the names of the victims.
"It is necessary to remember what happened here, the horror," said Babiš. Attack on the United States of 11. September 2001 was cited by the prime minister as the reason why the UN should cooperate in a united campaign against international terrorism. The terrorists then, in addition to destroying the skyscrapers of the World Trade Center, crashed a hijacked plane into the building of the Ministry of defense in Washington and planned another strike on a target in Washington, presumably the White House or Congress. But this plane crashed when the passengers confronted the hijackers.
"This is our main enemy, where all the states of the world should unite and fight international terrorism in a coordinated manner," the Czech prime minister added.

Czechs in Europe by Ondřej Houska: should Czechoslovakia have rejected the Munich agreement in 1938 and gone to war with Germany? Three times no
Undated photo shows Adolf Hitler visiting Czechoslovak border fortifications. The task of the fortresses was never to stop the German army, but to slow its advance before the allies became involved.
If, almost exactly 81 years ago, Czechoslovakia had rejected the Munich Agreement and then faced a German attack, what would have put the most Czechoslovak soldiers out of the fight? German tanks, air force, or perhaps artillery? Quite possibly, it would not be either of these weapons, although in them the Germans had an overwhelming superiority over the Czechoslovaks. The Czechoslovak army would probably suffer the greatest losses-because of blisters.
In Nantes, charges were filed over the fire of the cathedral, the man confessed
The cathedral of St. Peter and Paul in the heart of Nantes caught fire last Saturday and the fire severely damaged the original stained glass windows from the 16th century. century and destroyed the organ.
Suspicion of arson investigators checked due to the fact that the fire proceeded through the temple from three different places.

The accused is a volunteer with the local diocese, a 39-year-old Rwandan refugee.
The police arrested him shortly after the fire, but then released him without opening a criminal case.
Now the prosecutor's office reported that on the basis of new evidence, the man was arrested again on Saturday, confessed and faces charges of arson.

According to his lawyer, the man regrets the crime and decided to cooperate fully with the investigators, wrote Le Monde.
Zeman monument keeper-man suspending the Constitution calls for law enforcement
Who moves in a camp-divided society and does not want to go completely crazy, he will welcome a situation when he does not have to root only for his own. When he can admit pluses even to the one whom he otherwise criticizes. Already so that he does not feel that he is oriented only according to the pre-assigned stickers. Such situations include a list of badly damaged monuments, which President Zeman swears by during his favorite trips to the regions.
Everybody knows what's going on. And those who occasionally travel through the Czech Republic see many of these devastated monuments - from the Centers of historical cities to individual castles, monasteries, old houses, churches or estates - with their own eyes. Everyone knows that even here he can come to the word demagogy. That if we reproach the town hall does not care about monuments or some horror in the zoning plan, it can be the work of former administrations. Or an object privatized, the owner of which is not traceable. The head of state of local politics calls: "the paragraph of the monument law allows you to fine the owners of objects who do not take care of their property."But even if the owner is unattainable, it must be admitted that the president calls for law enforcement. Which even critics of his bending of the constitution should acknowledge as a plus.
Of course, Milos Zeman would not be Milos Zeman if he considered all the details and formalities of a complex problem. But he stands up for a good cause like squatters, which he himself does not recognize. Two years ago we wrote: "Despite all the epithets, squatters draw attention to a problem beyond the current interest. To the fact that this or that building is in disrepair."And let's admit that the president does de facto the same.
If you come to the historic center of Jáchymov, you will be amazed at how devastated it is - including houses with Renaissance cores. By the time Jachymov celebrates 500 years of silver mining and Tolar mining (for Americans dollars). Why? I heard it was for a quick-sell home in the ' 90s. years, officials say. But how is it that seven kilometers away the island, the seat of the šliks who minted the jáchymov tolars, has the historical core nicely repaired? It is good that the president brings these things to his attention.
Vojtěch: on Monday we will present "traffic light" for epidemiological measures
The new system is supposed to fulfill the role of a pandemic plan, because of the absence of which the government and the Ministry of health are facing criticism.
"The degrees will be according to the strength of community dissemination," explained the minister.
He added that at present, for example, the Moravian-Silesian region or Prague would reach the middle, orange degree.
The system is designed as a regional one, since the situation in individual regions varies significantly, he added.
On the system, the ministry cooperated with epidemiologists and the Institute of health information and statistics (Uzis).
According to the minister, specific measures will be linked to individual degrees, whether it is the obligation to wear veils or the organization of special departments in hospitals.
The minister of the interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) called for the creation of an epidemiological plan on prima partie television, according to which people should have clear information about what measures they can expect if the epidemiological situation worsens.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has been growing in recent days, although the number of hospitalizations remains low.
Vojtěch commented that nothing fundamental is happening there is no place to talk about declaring a state of emergency or calling the crisis staff again.
The government in view of the growing number of infected from Saturday across the Czech Republic again introduced the obligation to wear masks at internal events over 100 people.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be limited to 500 people, now it is 1000 people.
The government's action, which until the last moment was not clear what measures and when they will start to apply or when they will be announced, has received criticism.
"I think that in a situation that is quite tense, the main actors should, on the contrary, create a sense of security and, on the contrary, straighten out the confusion," Senator Marek Hilser said in the questions.
Measures may already vary by region, for example, in Prague, from Sunday, the obligation to wear veils applies even in non-residential medical institutions, for example, in pharmacies or in waiting rooms at the doctor.
The obligation to wear veils when visiting health and social facilities or pharmacies has been introduced since Friday also in the Liberec and Ústí region.
In the highlands of Jihlava, it is necessary to wear masks in indoor public places, in public transport and in medical institutions from the 14th to the 16th centuries. July.
On the contrary, in the Moravian-Silesian region, anti-epidemic measures were relaxed, as in the Central Bohemian region of kutno.
At the beginning of June, the Czech government also approved the so-called traffic light for Europe, which colorfully differentiates the level of risk of infection in individual European countries and, accordingly, regulates the rules applicable to entry into the Czech Republic from these countries.
For low-and medium-risk countries, authorities from 15. they do not require Czech citizens to test negative for coronavirus or order quarantine instead.
The latter are mandatory when returning Czechs from high-risk countries.
At the moment, all EU member states are now in the low-risk category of infection.
Costa Rica is a champion in the fight against climate change
The title was received by Costa Rica for several reasons. For a start, the plan to be carbon neutral by 2050-however, many countries have committed to this under the Paris agreement. The Central American state with a population of about five million produces only 0.4 percent of world emissions. Costa Rica has also committed to fully switch to renewable energy sources by 2030, with 70 percent of buses or taxis expected to run on electricity.
The official Tourist Organization reports that already about 95 percent of energy comes from renewable sources - in 2017, Costa Rica worked on them for a total of 300 days.
Costa Rica boasts almost thirty national parks.
The density of afforestation also contributes to the reduction of emissions. Rain forests with diverse fauna and flora, covering more than half of the country's territory, are also one of the main tourist draws. "Costa Rica is a pioneer in the field of nature conservation and sets an example for other states in the region, but also around the world. Climate change requires urgent action from all of us, " the UN said in a statement.
Costa Rica boasts almost thirty national parks, which is really a lot, given the small size of the country (51, 100 square kilometers). Rain or mist forests, coral reefs or mangrove swamps are home to five percent of the world's biodiversity. The country also has volcanoes, pitoresque waterfalls and you would also find several rescue stations for sloths.
Planet-friendly. The night of scientists begins in Prague
"In Prague, I would definitely visit CTU and look at the model of what smart cities will look like. At Charles University I would visit the Department of anatomy at the Faculty of medicine, which is not accessible to the public at other times," advises National Coordinator of the night of scientists Jitrenka Navrátilová.
The Institute of anatomy offers a tour of the autopsy room and the opportunity to try their hand at working with surgical instruments.
"Then I would go to čzu and watch the film Green Desert," adds Navrátilová. Nine laboratories will also offer guided tours. The motto of this year's night of scientists is "friendly to the planet".
Wife swap: Ondra's parents cruelly mistreated! He ended up in the Institute
It was about nerves. Allegedly troubled son Ondřej (9) was severely punished by his father every moment. "He came home from school and lied with a snack. Lukáš looked at me and said that he would kneel for punishment, " Lucie described in the exchange. Dad Lukas made little Ondra kneel in the corner for hours! Off camera, he must have suffered like this on a wooden foot massage mat! "Ondřej came to me after the shooting and said to me-auntie, I'm making these troubles and remarks just to not be here, because I want to go to the institute," Lucie described the moment when she fully understood what was going on behind the door of the studio apartment. And the boy's wish finally came true...
His condition was so serious that he was taken from his family after the shooting and placed for a month in the center of educational care in české Budějovice. He briefly returned to his father and surrogate mother Aneta (28), but then wandered to the diagnostic Institute for problem children. "When I arrived home, Aneta immediately added me on Facebook, we wrote for a while. She was most interested in whether we got the money. I barely reacted to that at all. But then she texted me that the kid was institutionalized, then they gave him back, now he's in the ICU. They are both out of work, " says mum Lucie from Pilsen.
Of course, the Lightning also reached the other side, but received only a vague answer. "I'm not in the mood, I'm sick, call later," Aneta excuses herself and hangs up the phone.

"Before the patrol race, I felt the worst in the 14 days we've been here. Then during the race it was good and today it was better. All the time it's beautiful, nice races, the audience came, so fine, " he smiled.
Even sparkler was happy. "In qualifying, one does not particularly want to make an unnecessary mistake. In the first goals I was not very good. Then I drove the center perfectly, no problems and I knew that I had mileage, so came the second mistake, when I wanted to go down straight and I turned the Erka. Overall, I can not be dissatisfied. The form is, we'll see how it goes from there, " said this year's overall World Cup winner.
Both representatives praised that on Sunday they will go to the start only at the end of the semifinal block. "I'm not a morning person, it's cold in the morning, and when you're here at eight, you want a jacket and a sweatshirt," said prindiš.

Of the trio of Czech singkanoists, only fišerová succeeded, Eva říhová finished two places behind the top 20, Kateřina havlíčková was 35th. "I rode the upper part according to my ideas, in the middle passage it seemed to me that I was not in time and not going according to the plan, but I was able to get to the comfortable track that I wanted to go. I made two putts, and I'm just behind the winner with a clean time. I have a good starting position for the semifinals, " praised fišerová.

Thank you for the dance! Singer Leonard Cohen will posthumously release the last album
The album "thanks for the dance" will contain unreleased material and various musical collaborations put together by the singer's son. The album comes out 22. November.
In October 2016, the album you want it Darker was released, on which Cohen collaborated with his son Adam. He asked him to help him complete the individual songs. On an intimate recording, Cohen symbolically comes to terms with his impending death. He died a month after the release of the album at the age of 82.
Seven months later, Adam Cohen began to work on the materials left to him by his father. He invited a wide range of musicians to collaborate-Damien Rice, Bryce Dessner, Javier Mase or singer Beck at random.
"When we invented music for my father's words, we used his own characteristic musical techniques. So he's still with us, " said Adam Cohen about the album. "I am most impressed by the reactions of those who have already heard it. One by one they say that Leonard is still alive, " he added.
The first track on the album is a short song called the goal. "I'm almost alive, I'm almost home," Cohen sings in his characteristic honeyed voice. He sang about death, he knew that the release of new material will not live to see. He also admitted this in an interview with the New Yorker magazine a month before his death. "I'm ready to die. I hope it will not be too unpleasant, " he said.
In September 2018, Adam Cohen released a collection of his father's poetry called the flame. In Czech it will be released under the name Plamen 31. December at Argo publishing house.
On vacation with only a credit card? Neo account offers ATM withdrawals worldwide for free!
According to surveys, about half of all Czechs who go abroad have become accustomed to paying directly by card. The main reasons include comfort, security, but also the possibility to use travel insurance, which is often associated with a credit card.
The convenience of paying by card can be appreciated by travelers in almost all corners of the world. This is especially true in popular tourist destinations, but today credit cards are accepted almost everywhere. "People who travel more often, perhaps for work, do not have time to go repeatedly to exchange offices to exchange cash. And even "vacationers" do not want to rely on the fact that cash is enough for them. Moreover, Czech banks or exchange offices do not even have some foreign currencies. For neo account, we have solved it so that its users can withdraw cash free of charge from all ATMs, wherever they are, " says Kateřina Petko, director of marketing and communications and press officer of Expobank cz.
In addition, a credit card is a much more reliable way to avoid losing your money than cash. With the loss of a full wallet, its owner can no longer wait for the money he carried in it. However, if he only loses his payment card, he can easily immediately block it over the phone or through internet banking. Thus, when acting quickly, he does not have to suffer any financial loss at all. "Keeping money in a bank account has, in addition to their reliable protection, other advantages. For example, the neo account has an interest rate of 1.6% per annum, which is among the highest among current and savings accounts. Its creation and management takes place completely online without the need to visit the branch. In addition, the money in the bank account is insured up to 100 thousand euros, and the account management is completely free, " adds Kateřina Petko.
For everyone who is going to go abroad, travel insurance should be a matter of course. Thanks to the possibility to arrange it and pay by card online, this can be done even at the last minute. However, the mere possession of a credit card often means insurance protection when travelling. "For example, with embossed Mastercard Gold and Mastercard business cards, travel insurance is an integral part when traveling abroad to all countries of the world. Holders of these cards can also insure their family with whom they travel. They often do not have any additional equipment, " adds Kateřina Petko from expobank cz. However, it is always advisable to check the scope of the insurance in question, that is, whether it covers all the activities that travelers plan to take.
The ministry plans a food lump sum from 2021. Nothing changes tax - wise
The Ministry of finance is preparing an amendment to the income tax act, according to which the employee would receive money for meals directly. According to the Ministry of finance, a quarter of employees, or about a million people who do not yet receive food vouchers, will also be able to support meals.
According to the chairman of the Association of voucher operators, David rýc, however, even a number of small companies that do not have canteens or meal vouchers provide their employees with food, for example, by importing food or by agreement with restaurants.
"The essence of the intention is that we do not change anything on the tax benefit. In addition, health and social insurance will not be paid from it, " Schiller said on Friday. It added that the threshold for the maximum employer contribution applicable as a tax credit would also be maintained.
The income tax Act allows companies to pay a maximum of 55 percent of the meal ticket price. The remaining part is paid by employees, in some cases also paid by the employer, but without a tax discount. The most advantageous value of a meal ticket for employees and employers this year is 123 CZK.
Bloomberg: Venezuela has hidden Bitcoins and does not know what to do with them
The central bank of Venezuela conducts internal tests to determine whether it can hold cryptocurrencies. It responds to an instruction from the state-owned company Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), which seeks to be able to send bitcoins and ethers to the central bank, and then the bank pays the suppliers of this oil company with cryptocurrencies. Employees are also studying the proposal to allow the central bank to count cryptocurrencies in foreign exchange reserves, which are now close to the minimum in 30 years. Citing information from four sources, this was reported by Bloomberg.
The sanctions imposed by the United States against the authoritarian regime of President Nicolás Maduro have largely cut Venezuela off from the global financial system. This further exacerbated the economic crisis in the country. Meanwhile, the current crisis is one of the most serious in global comparison, forcing officials to use a mixture of different ways to move money. While Maduro's effort to launch the world's first state-owned cryptocurrency has failed, ongoing efforts to use digital currencies show how desperate the government is to find ways around the restrictions.
Neither the central bank of Venezuela nor PDVSA responded to a request for comment.
It is not clear how PDVSA came to own bitcoins and ethers, nor how much value these currencies possess. The enterprise has problems obtaining payments from customers through conventional channels, since large banks are not willing to do business with entities subject to sanctions. Last month, the company received most of the payment of 700 million dollars (16.6 billion rubles) in Chinese yuan, because the parties could not find financial institutions that would allow the transaction.
PDVSA may not have the appetite to sell cryptocurrencies on the open market, as this would require it to register on the exchange and undergo an in-depth review, the so-called due diligence. Instead, it wants the central bank to use the cryptocurrency and pay with it the entities to which PDVSA owes. Representatives of the oil company believe that the central bank is less exposed to possible obstacles that could arise when making payments with crypto-currencies.
Bitcoins and ethers use a decentralized internet ledger known as blockchain to verify and record transactions. In some cases, relatively anonymous transfers are possible without the need for an intermediary. Few banks engage in digital currencies because of the money laundering and client information problems associated with them, complicating compliance.
Cryptocurrencies, after the debacle of 2018, are experiencing a return to the limelight this year thanks to the expectation of their greater acceptance by institutions and Facebook's plan to come up with its own cryptocurrency. Even so, they remain unstable. Bitcoin has fallen almost 20 percent over the past four days, however, since the beginning of the year it has a gain of about 130 percent.
Commentary by Jan Šindelář: managing railways as a company
The election of heaven, although apparently not entirely smooth, is the culmination of a sad story about the inability of the state to give the roads a clear direction. The board of directors has been incomplete for over a year, and even after Wednesday evening, it does not change because one of the members resigned. Provisorium lasts.
The selection procedure itself was a farce from the beginning, because the requirements for candidates were significantly relaxed, especially in the field of practice. Compared to the selection last year, the requirements for the size of the company in which the candidate was supposed to work in the past have been reduced. First, the members of the selection committee and then the supervisory board played only the role of pimprlat.
Nebeský submitted probably the weakest professional CV of the five finalists, yet without experience from a large company, he beat experienced guys from the management of logistics giants and transport enterprises. It was the participation of interesting managers from the private sector that was probably the brightest side (and the greatest hope) of the whole process. Today, those concerned know that they played only the role of an epic backdrop in the political game.
Perhaps the heavenly will surprise, show great talent and eventually prove to be the best boss of the railways of all time. However, at least in the beginning, it will be accompanied by the aftertaste of a political newsstand. České dráhy is facing a difficult time, having to cope with competition in the liberalisation of the market and the lack of staff in operation. Missing drivers, shifters and mechanics. What is the motivation for further work and respect for management, when the state behaves in the top management like an elephant in a china shop?
The second important group is creditors. We will see how they interpret the games at the head of the tracks next spring, when the tracks will defend the rating. What is certain is that lenders perceive instability. The sad thing is that every year someone else comes to Moody's to defend the rating. The agency did not escape frequent changes in the management of railways and political influence on the company, it criticized them already this summer.
Among other things, the ANO movement coined the slogan that the state should be run as a business. For starters, it would be enough to run one large state-owned company as a company, and not as a state. České dráhy is still one of the largest companies in the country and it would be good if they were led by the best. They applied, but the state despised them. It can certainly be argued that the post at the head of the railways has always been a political issue. But then we can forgive ourselves for the competition antics.
An unusually open and unique image of Karel Gott in the feature documentary film by Olga Spátová
This unique film from the workshop of Olga špátová will have its premiere in Czech cinemas in the spring of next year.
"In the middle of September last year, Ivanka and Karel Gott called me and asked if I would make a documentary about his life with Karl again after ten years. I didn't hesitate for a minute! It was and is a great honour for me to film with a man who has stood in the limelight of Czech culture for more than half a century thanks to his exceptional singing talent, artistic humility and immeasurable diligence. I accepted the invitation to make a full-length documentary about Karl Gott, who brings joy to three generations of listeners with his art, as a commitment to this legendary singer, " director Olga špátová describes her feelings.
The first day of shooting, thanks to a quick agreement and agreement, was already 22. October last year, and the last shots with Karl Gott were filmed a few days ago. The goal was and is absolutely clear-to capture authentically Karl Gott as a phenomenal singer who gives himself to his fans, as a painter, but at the same time a loving husband and father of his children. A man who for 60 years has been giving joy to several generations with his songs, not only in our country, but also in Europe, and indeed throughout the world. A man who has inscribed himself in the hearts and souls of his listeners by simply being them.
The film is not meant to be a parade of the undisputed fame of Karl Gott and his achievements. "Therefore, it is not even possible to compare my previous film The Gott phenomenon with this current one. Everyone is different. At least by the fact that we filmed them in a different stage of Karel Gott's life, and this is very evident in his personal, even intimate confession, which he gave us and which confirmed us all in what kind of legend we have the opportunity to work with and spend time that is truly indescribable," adds Olga špátová.
The creators captured Karel Gott during his performances, during meetings with his fans in our country and in Hamburg, but especially in his home environment, whether in Prague, in a cottage in Czech Switzerland, in the village where he spent his childhood, and in other places that played an important role in his life. Thanks to Karl Gott's sincere openness, the film will be completely authentic and unique.
"Olga has a great gift for filming with her close team in such a way that we often got carried away by the spontaneous atmosphere and naturally let her into our privacy, thanks to which I talked about topics quite confidential. She and her husband, cameraman Jan malíř, have become part of our family. We originally wanted to release the film in 2019, when I celebrated my life's Jubilee. But because I had a lovely summer with my family, I wanted us to shoot as long as possible. Well, and since there were a lot of me everywhere in 2019, my wish was that it be released to cinemas in the spring of next year. This documentary is a thank you to my supporters and all those who supported and accompanied me in my profession, " says Karel Gott himself.

Managers of state-owned companies are to undergo a new selection procedure. The law will be possible to circumvent, says the opposition
"This is a typical bill that is useless," said ZBYNĚK Stanjura, chairman of the ODS group.
After several unsuccessful attempts, the chamber of Deputies approved changes designed to prevent the opaque distribution of functions - critics speak of newsagents - in state-owned companies in the future. New candidates should go through a selection procedure in the respective ministry and will be considered by the government committee for personnel nominations.
However, this is a compromise solution, which, for example, the ODS does not like, because it will allegedly allow ministers to make excuses that the selection committees are to blame for the possible poor selection of state managers. Moreover, the opinion of the said committee for the minister will not be binding. The novelty has yet to be approved by the Senate and signed by President Milos Zeman.

The library commemorates the anniversary of the death of Wenceslas IV. exhibition of manuscripts
Six rare historical manuscripts from the turn of the 14th century. and 15. 19th century, that is, from the time of the Roman and Czech King Václav IV., can be viewed today and Saturday by people in Prague's Klementinum. The National Library released them from their vaults to commemorate this year's 600. anniversary of Václav's death. This morning, librarians and restorers placed rare originals in display cases in the mirror chapel. Admission to the exhibition is free, it is open on both days from 10: 00 to 18: 00.
Exhibition of documents entitled ad Mandatum Domini Regis: from the royal office and library of Wenceslas IV. prepared by the library together with the National Archives. Written heritage from the reign of Wenceslas IV. the national archive looks from the point of view of official documents and the National Library from the point of view of literary works, its author Jan vojtíšek said about the exhibition.
"Visitors can look forward to, for example, a work on agriculture by Peter de crescentiis, which is essentially an encyclopedia of agriculture, or a breviary, a prayer book of one of the Benedictine monks of the monastery of St. George in Prague Castle, from the beginning of the 15th century. he listed the reasons why people should look at the exhibition, according to him.
The epistles of Peter of Blois will also be exhibited, where the semi-figure of the English king Henry II is depicted in the opening miniature h (enrico). The author of the decoration is most likely the master of Samson's history, who, in addition to the two volumes of the bible of Wenceslas IV. he also participated in the decoration of a number of other manuscripts. Visitors will also see a Latin anthology of John Wycliff's treatises from about 1411 to 1414.
From the library of Wenceslas IV. not a single book has been preserved in the Czech territory. This library, according to experts, was one of the most extensive and also the most beautiful book collections in central Europe at that time, because the young king wanted to build a representative library that would match the book collections of his French relatives. However, the library ceased to exist soon after Václav's death. Apparently, it was looted or destroyed during the conquest of the castle by the Hussites. But several codes were saved. Most of them are now owned by the Austrian national library.
"We have a number of treasures in our collections and I am glad that they are in a state that allows them to be exhibited and made available to the public so-called Live and not only in the form of the Digital Library Manuscriptorium," said the director of the National Library Martin Kocanda.
On the day of Saturday's national holiday, an exhibition entitled What is hidden under the floor, which presents local archaeological discoveries, will also be opened free of charge in Klementinum.
Technoparty on benešovsko continues.
She's playing at one-third capacity, and she's supposed to finish at noon.
Hlaváčkova Lhota (benešovská) the Technoparty at hlaváčkova Lhota in benešovská continues on Sunday evening.
A third of the original 12 music systems still play.
According to evening police estimates, about 500 people remain here after 20:00, the initial rough estimates were about three hundred, in the morning they were 900, said police spokeswoman Lucie nováková.
Originally, the technoparty was supposed to end on Sunday at noon, at that time, indeed, part of the music systems went silent.
"Some have already left and others are preparing to leave.
The musical production partly still lasts.
We expect that the disconnection and disassembly of music systems will gradually take place," said nováková.
"Police officers still rigorously check departing visitors in order to prevent drivers under the influence of alcohol or addictive substances from driving.
Drivers have the opportunity to undergo a preventive breath test before departure, " she added.
Dozens of riot police officers supervise the event, foreign police, traffic and riot police are on site, and dog handlers with service dogs are also on alert.
"During the day, police officers checked 470 people moving around the venue of the event and 485 vehicles, 270 drivers were subjected to a breath test, six of them got behind the wheel under the influence of alcohol," said Novakova.
A total of 95 drivers police tested for the presence of narcotic and psychotropic substances, of which one was positive.
Police officers also dealt with 14 traffic violations.
At the request of the participants of the technoparty, the police conducted 300 preventive breath tests and four preventive tests for the presence of narcotic and psychotropic substances.
About 2000 people were at the event on Saturday morning.
If the number of participants had not decreased, the police would have intervened.
This was stated by the minister of the interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) on the prima partie television programme.
However, the number of participants fell below 1000, so the police assessed that intervention was not needed, and neither did the sanitary station or the Ministry of health.
Czech television (CT) reported on Sunday that the technoparty had extended to the surrounding land, whose owners did not agree with the use for the technoparty.
It is possible that the owners of the surrounding land will demand compensation for damage.
Techno fans came to the meadow near Hlaváčkova Lhota on Friday evening.
Police originally on Friday guarded the meadow in blažimi on benešovsko, where the technoparty was held last year.
Blažim is located about 30 kilometers from Hlaváčkovy Lhota, where the engineers actually went.
According to nováková, no one came to blažimi.
Viper bite: the little girl ended up in the hospital!
"The first case this year was recorded in Zheleznorudsk.
The Viper bit a girl, year 2010, in the leg, which her parents themselves brought to the rescue service base there," regional spokeswoman of the medical rescue service Mária svobodová told the newspaper, adding that the child was then taken to the hospital in Klatovy.
The Viper is the only venomous snake in the Czech Republic and it is in Šumava that these animals are found in higher numbers, so it is good to be careful when walking.
However, there is no great danger from these animals.
The chance that the Viper will bite you is not very high, with normal contact, it is afraid of itself.
And if she has room for it, she likes to crawl away with a loud hiss.
She will only attack if she feels very threatened-for example, if you accidentally step on her.
Although its bite is not a tragedy, its venom is very effective against small mammals, but it does not kill people.
This can happen only if a person has a particularly weakened organism, or he suffers from an allergy.
Thus, the risk of danger is primarily in children, the elderly and allergy sufferers.
"After a bite, a person often feels nauseous, sweats, has an elevated temperature, thirst, abdominal pain and diarrhea, in weakened individuals and especially allergy sufferers, anaphylactic shock can occur," Miriam Gredová from the Klatovy hospital described for the daily.
The man threatened to throw the infants out of the window.
After the policeman poured wine and threw dishes

The infants were immediately taken into care by paramedics, regional police spokeswoman Markéta janovská said in a press release.
The man did not want to cooperate with the police, after the police negotiator threw dishes, knives or poured wine from the window.
Several times during the negotiations, he reinforced his threats by leaning out of the window with the child in his arms.
Once he even climbed to the windowsill himself, where he was dozing.
Police are still investigating the man.
He doesn't want to release any more information.
Stosur will give preference to her daughter before the tennis season

Sapa market: raid reveals meat, fish and eggs of unknown origin
"One of the vehicles entering the premises transported 1320 pieces of quail eggs of unknown origin, moreover, in unsuitable conditions.
Also, these eggs will be disposed of at the rendering plant," the state veterinary administration said.
When inspecting the stand with live fish, it was then found that the seller does not have documents on the origin of the goods and is not registered for the sale of live fish.
The market is considered problematic from a veterinary point of view in the long term.
For example, last fall, veterinarians discovered an illegal food store in it, there were almost half a ton of unmarked food without documents of origin.
Most could not find out the expiration date, some of the products had expired shelf life and were spoiled.
For five kilograms of cuttlefish, the expiration date was exceeded by three years.
Last May, veterinarians and police officers seized 80 kilograms of food without proof of origin, including dried fish, squid or frozen ducks, some of which were moldy.

Police have charged Czech Tourism Manager Aleš Pangrác over advertising contracts
Police have charged the former manager of the state agency CzechTourism Aleš pangrác over contracts for promotion. Pangrac server listmessages confirmed that the charges took over this week. Czech television (CT) reported last year that police officers in the case are reviewing contracts worth CZK 38 million. Part of the money, according to the police, went back to Pangrác, writes the server. In the case, the criminalists were also interested in the minister of regional development Klára dostálová (for yes), to whose department CzechTourism belongs. The investigation in the case, according to the server, continues.
Detectives from the National Center against organized crime were gathering evidence in this case in the second half of last November. They were, for example, at the headquarters of the Ministry of regional development, at the headquarters of CzechTourism, at the Autodrome in most, or at the Sport invest agency. The office computer was also taken from the minister's apartment. The court search warrant for Dostálová, which had already been cited by the Czech news agency, stated that in 2016, when she was deputy minister, the minister decided on expenses of CzechTourism for the benefit of selected persons indirectly and outside the standard official procedure. Dostalova said at the time that she felt absolutely innocent, she did not doubt, she could document everything and fully cooperate with the police.

The media has previously reported that this is the former director of the Department of regional partnership in CzechTourism Aleš pangrác, who was dismissed due to the results of the audit. This resulted in the conclusion of 48 problematic contracts by CzechTourism.
"Yes, they accused me. But I don't want to comment further, " Pangrác told the north list news.

Destroyed shops, fires in the streets, a memorial procession accompanied by riots
Five years ago, 43 students of Ayotzinapa university disappeared, despite an extensive investigation, the case has not yet been clarified. Allegedly, the students were to be detained by the police in the Mexican state of Guerrero. It is not clear exactly what happened next, according to the investigation, but the students apparently ended up in the hands of a local syndicate and were subsequently killed and burned, APTN reports.
On Thursday, a memorial procession was held in Mexico's capital, families wanted to express their frustration at the fact that they still could not find answers and explain the disappearance of their children.
The mostly peaceful march was disrupted by smaller groups of vandals, who destroyed everything in their path. Vandals destroyed shops and hotels, did not hesitate to destroy monuments, set fires around the city and blew out windows.
Even before the march, president Andres Manuel López Obrador said that he would do everything to catch them, and asked the public for any information that would lead to clarification of the case.
More than 142 people were detained in the investigation, but none of them were convicted. Many of them had to be released because their human rights were violated, the investigators allegedly had to torture the suspects, APTN adds.
Putin spoke on the phone with Zelensky before the start of the ceasefire in the Donbass, the Kremlin criticizes the planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke by phone with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky about the situation in the Donbass, where a new ceasefire is to take effect from midnight.
According to the Kremlin statement, Putin, among other things, criticized the decision of the Ukrainian parliament to hold local elections; Kiev reported that Zelensky called for the release of the detained Ukrainians.
A new ceasefire was agreed on Wednesday evening by the negotiators of Ukraine and Russia with the support of the organization for security and cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
The truce is to begin after midnight on Monday night, is to be "complete and general" and is to open the way to fulfilling other provisions of the peace agreements.
Putin told Zelensky in an interview that the decision of the Ukrainian parliament to hold local elections contradicts the Minsk peace agreement and threatens the prospects for a settlement of the conflict in the east of Ukraine.
The Ukrainian parliament last week decided that the upcoming elections to local councils will not take place in the territory controlled by pro-Russian rebels.
The Minsk agreement assumes that Kiev will regain control of the border of Ukrainian lands occupied by separatists with Russia, after granting these regions broad autonomy and holding local elections there.
Zelensky's office, according to the Unian agency, said that both statesmen agreed on the usefulness of the upcoming truce in the Donbas and on the need to carry out other measures to promote peace in the region, such as the demining of areas of fighting or the withdrawal of part of the troops from the front.
Zelensky also called on Putin to release Ukrainians detained in the east of Ukraine, on the occupied peninsula of Crimea and in Russia itself.
The Minsk agreement helped to stop the fighting, but people continue to die on both sides of the front in sporadic shootings and artillery attacks.
The conflict in the Donbas has claimed over 14,000 lives since the spring of 2014.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of military support for the separatists, which Moscow denies.
Zelensky has made ending the war in the Donbas his priority, but a more fundamental breakthrough in negotiations has not yet occurred.
And where are the spectators? Doha can't be London
At the same time, however, it is a step back, since the pilgrimage to Doha, athletics voluntarily and consciously renounced the rousing atmosphere that prevailed at the sold-out stadium in London 2017 and last year at the European Championships in Berlin.
Giant banners on the walls of skyscrapers in Doha invite to the "biggest sporting event of 2019". However, concerns about how dignified her backdrops will be are growing.
"Tickets for the destination are sold out for all the evenings," the organizers say.
But that's too little.
The top floor of the Khalifa stadium with a total capacity of 40 thousand spectators is already covered with colorful sails, on which the flags of 209 participating countries are depicted. Athletics in Qatar went to a territory where, despite the annual meeting of the Diamond League, it does not have sunk roots.
So let's not be surprised that last week only 50 thousand tickets were sold for ten days of the championship, although their price started at 60 Qatari rials, that is, in terms of less than 400 crowns.
The organizers have now set themselves the goal of filling at least half of the uncovered sections of the stands. Therefore, according to sources of the British newspaper giuardian, they allegedly (although the organizers themselves deny this) give out free tickets to migrants who work here as workers, and also to children. Sebastian Coe, head of the IAAF Athletics Association, comments positively: "this is how we can inspire the next generation."
Rich Qatar in the past won the world championships in handball and cycling, after athletics will come football in 2022. The financial offers of the oil power will always be lucrative even for the rich sports federations. Such is the reality of today's sports world.
But even if we accept it and leave aside the absence of fans in the stadium, we will not prevent a purely sporting sigh that the experiment with the first outdoor world championship of athletes in the Arabian Peninsula should have been timed better by the IAAF leaders - and for another year. The extremely late deadline, forced by the climate, disrupts the whole scheme of the season in the pre-Olympic year and thus the preparation for the key Olympic season, which would normally begin in October for athletes.
Perhaps Qatar will make up for this at least with technological innovations, with the help of which it promises ultra-modern and attractive championships. That it's 37 degrees right now? Already now the area of the stadium is artificially air-conditioned to twenty-four. And advanced cameras, built directly into the blocks, are also intended to give television viewers a detailed look at what is happening in the athletes in hundredths of a second before the starter shot and just after it.

The unexpected champion in decathlon is Rykl, Novotná dominated the heptathlon
The defending champion of the last two titles Dolezal did not finish at the end of Saturday's program four hundred, Kopecký on Sunday did not jump the pole.
The decathlon has long been ruled by the Latvian representative Reinis kregers, who is preparing in the group of coach Josef Karas, but after the discus he resigned.
Rykl had two bronze medals from the outdoor world championships so far, this time he was the only decathlete who got over the seven-thousandth limit.
Other medals behind him were won by Vilém strásky and Petr urbánek.
Rykl recalled the absence of Adam Sebastian helcelet and Jiří sýkora after the competition.
"It's a pity that there were no guys here and Kope did not start, because it would have made the results look completely different.
But the title tastes very good, I especially appreciate the fact that I had a personal 30 centimeters in the distance.
Then I was still pleased with the stick and most of all I was disappointed about the disk, I was below average there, " he admitted on the Union Facebook.
Kateřina cachová won the first day of the heptathlon with a more than 100-point advantage, although she was bothered by an ankle injury on the rebound leg.
In the long-distance sector, however, she entered only 570 CM, did not throw a javelin 40 meters and did not enter the final eight hundred.
Novotná scored 5878 points and won by 241 points ahead of Kateřina dvořáková.
Her best result was the distance, 631 CM is the best Czech performance of the year.
"I really wish it was around the 630.
Yesterday my calf started to pull, but I am very glad that I did not feel it at all and that it did not limit me at all, " Novotná said on the union's Facebook page.
Bio LPG arrives in Czech Republic, promises ecological operation
Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is a well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
It is especially popular for its significantly lower price compared to petrol or diesel, due to a significantly lower excise tax, but its benefit is also in lower CO2 emissions per kilometre.
Like gasoline and diesel, it also has its environmentally friendly variant - "bio LPG".
However, it is quite a novelty-it first appeared on the European market a few years ago and arrived in the Czech Republic a few days ago, according to the press release of the Czech Association of LPG.
"These days we have received the first fifteen tons of bio LPG, which will be mixed with the classic Fossil LPG distributed to our gas stations," the association quotes Jiří karlík from primagas.
However, bio LPG cannot be taken as bioethanol or biodiesel.
According to the association, it is chemically identical to the classic oil LPG, which many motorists now refuel in their cars.
Therefore, it is also possible to mix both versions arbitrarily.
"The only difference from conventional LPG is the method of production," says Ivan Indráček, chairman of the association, about bio LPG.
This is also one of the great advantages of bio LPG over other alternative fuels.
It is easy to transport and store, and the distribution infrastructure is relatively good, e.g. compared to hydrogen or electricity.
Currently, this gas is obtained as a by-product in the production of bioethanol from food residues and sugar cane.
In the future, it should also be produced in a targeted way, e.g. from cellulosic biomass, i.e. from wood waste.
In contrast, conventional petroleum LPG is produced partly as a by-product in oil refining, partly by separation in natural gas extraction.
As a result, depending on the production technology and the source, the operation of the car on bio LPG is 40-70% more environmentally friendly in terms of carbon footprint than the operation on oil LPG and up to 90% compared to diesel.
However, it is not about CO2 emissions from the exhaust of the car, but about the ecology of fuel production, that is, the so-called "well-to-tank" part (from the source to the tank).
Petrochemical companies Eni, Total and Neste are currently among the largest producers of bio LPG.
According to the recent update of the national clean mobility action plan (NAP čm), Unipetrol is also exploring the possibility of production at its Litvinov refinery.
According to the association's estimates, about 170,000 vehicles use LPG in the Czech Republic; the Ministry of the environment reports a slightly higher figure, about 200,000, in the NAP čm.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of transport, last year alone, almost 6 thousand conversions of cars to LPG were made.
It is possible to refuel LPG in the Czech Republic at about 950 stations of various operators.
Vojtěch revised the number of infected, the number decreased by 1775 cases
Minister of health Adam Vojtěch (for yes) ordered the ministry to revise the numbers infected with the coronavirus virus.
The new statistics were published on Sunday by the Ministry of health on its website.
The number on Sunday afternoon fell from Saturday's 5254 to 3479 cases, which is 1775 fewer infected.
There are currently 3422 patients in the Czech Republic.
"Behind the jump in the number of cured is the revision of data, which hygienists have not been able to update recently," said the head of health statistics Jaroslav dušek.
By Sunday afternoon, 15,212 people had become infected with coronavirus in the Czech Republic, 11,419 had recovered and 371 had unfortunately succumbed to covid-19.
Slovaks have succeeded, for racist insults only pay a fine
The Slovak football association has succeeded in appealing against the closure of the stadium for racism of fans. The national team was originally without spectators to play the match of the qualification of the European Championship with Wales, instead now the union will only pay a fine of 15 thousand euros (about 387 thousand).
The disciplinary commission of UEFA punished Slovakia and Hungary for the behavior of fans during the recent mutual qualifying match in Budapest, which the visiting trustees of the Czech coach Pavel Hapal won 2:1. Both unions closed the stadium for one match and fined Slovakia 20 thousand euros, Hungary 67 thousand euros.
Slovaks after the appeal received only a fine of 15 thousand euros for insulting political cries. The next match of the national team in qualifying for the European Championship with Wales 10. October in Trnava will be made available to fans.

Overview of bank accounts for children on the Czech market
Children's accounts banks provide for free. But it is necessary to consider the offer, because some additional services to the accounts are already charged. "The motivation of banks to offer accounts for children, whose basic management is usually free, is straightforward. Financial houses count on the fact that the forgiven fees will return to them one day. With a small migration of Czechs between banks, they are probably not mistaken, " says Kristýna kuncová from dtest.
"Small accounts", according to her, can do almost everything that accounts for adults. The child gets his own payment card, he can enter payments, track the movements on the account, somewhere he has his own electronic banking. Banks may set up an account, but it is up to parents to teach children how to use them and also to control their payment.
"Quite flexibly, a parent can set weekly or monthly limits, turn on and off individual services, and so on. But above all, it can monitor what is happening on the account, either by browsing through the internet or through informational SMS. Attention, these may no longer be free, "adds Kuncová, adding:" if a parent is considering an account for his child, he should consider his capabilities and possibilities."
Museum in sEmily with an exhibition returns to the Velvet Revolution
Imitation of a normalization room with a TV in which footage of the brutal crackdown of police officers against students from 17. November 1989 in Prague. This, too, is in the new exhibition of the museum in sEmily, which is dedicated to the velvet revolution. "The basis is to imagine what happened in sEmily after the events at Národní třída," said Tomáš chvátal, curator of the exhibition.
"I would say that the atmosphere was basically the same everywhere with the fact that the first demonstration was held in sEmily on 22. November, and then every day gradually packed up more people," he said. Among the most active were at first a group of local dissidents around Miroslav matěcha, who was the only one from the city and the immediate vicinity to sign Charter 77, and the spouses of the grandfathers, who spread the petition several sentences. According to chvátal, the civic forum was also formed relatively quickly. "One of the specifics is that there was a very strong group of local doctors in the civic forum," said the curator.
Visitors should be drawn into the current events in the city by about 50 photographs, taken 30 years ago by Karel bárta. A video of the 27th general strike has also been preserved. November 1989 filmed by František tomíček, which will be played in the loop throughout the exhibition. At the demonstration, Ivan the voice also spoke and sang. The semilsk archive also lent a number of preserved banners to the exhibition. "They said: let's not get drunk with a roll, from trough to trough, we do not want violence," chvátal said. Some changes in the city were very rapid at that time, for example, already in December the people in the All-Russian vote decided that the square would be riegrovo and abolished the previous name gottwaldovo.
The exhibition also captures the events before the November events. "In the first part, we present to the contemporaries and students what was before, such a late normalization. I think we managed to collect unique documents from Semil, whether they are banners with various communist slogans or a bronze plaque from the Museum of the workers ' movement at that time," chvátal said. One room is supposed to evoke the feeling of what it might have looked like in the living room of an ordinary household.
The last part of the exhibition, in turn, is devoted to what was after the velvet revolution. It is aimed at the first free elections. "We papered one room with election posters. Those who have experienced it will remember the posters with us to Europe or there is Václav Klaus still under the heading OF with a beautiful motto each for his village," added the curator.
Pike in a pond, or a relatively prosperous open-air museum?
Babiš chose for his optimistic view statistics such as good security (the Czech Republic is the seventh in the world), low unemployment rate, low national debt. Or the fact that our country, according to one recent study, is 24th in quality of life out of 140 countries evaluated.
However, the developer Dušan kunovský and the architect Josef pleskot, in a television interview on the occasion of the summit of architecture and development, presented other, not so "rosy" data. For example, that the Czech Republic is at 154. place in the world in the speed of construction management. It may be that the current economic "boom" will not leave behind any significant building heritage, as it was in the past.
The biggest obstacle is not only existing legislation, but also a slow, inefficient bureaucracy. This is also documented by comparative studies, in which the Czech Republic lags significantly behind developed countries in the overall quality and performance of public administration.
Our country has simply not yet been able to make good use of the potential of the good economic situation of recent years to invest in the future. It is nice that salaries and pensions are increasing, but people with an improving standard of living will also want to have somewhere to live, to travel modern and fast, to have quality cultural stands, to live without the unbearable environmental burden.
But in the capital city of Prague, for example, it has not been possible for years to complete the inner and outer ring road or build an expressway or metro to the airport. And Prague does not even have a modern, architecturally daring national library, concert hall, or National Gallery. The reason for this is not only absurd scramble for architectural competitions, zoning plans and building permits, but also a kind of specifically Czech conservatism, which adheres to the motto "every bolder change is for the worse".
And when it seems that something more daring could succeed, it will almost certainly be thwarted by the monuments men or other rather well-intentioned associations, or politicians. In the absurd drama surrounding Jan Kaplický's" blob " proposed for the new building of the National Library, president Václav Klaus even wanted to tie himself to the dredgers.
However, the list does not end with a threshold. The Czech Republic is not able to complete its backbone motorway network, nor to start building high-speed trains, so Germany finally decided to run its tracks for superfast trains from Berlin to Vienna by "detour" through Bavaria. In addition, in šlendrián, repairs to existing infrastructure are often carried out. Getting from Prague to Brno quickly is now a done deal.
Babiš came into politics promising to "get things done". But not much has happened yet when it comes to meaningful investment and speeding up cumbersome bureaucratic procedures. Since 2018, an amendment to the law on speeding up the construction of transport infrastructure is in force, but we will have to wait for more extensive beneficial effects, such as easier land expropriation. And the new building code, approved by the government, which is supposed to reduce the current average length of construction proceedings from 5.4 years to one year, will, if we are lucky, start to apply from 2021. I don't think a lot of people would bet on that.

Mobile voting units or correspondence dialing.
The political scientist and sociologist were looking for variants for the time of the pandemic
According to deputy prime minister and interior minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD), a change in the law is needed in order for people in quarantine due to coronavirus to be able to vote in the October regional and Senate elections.
Parliament could debate it in August or September under a fast-track procedure.
He stated this on Sunday in the party of Prima Television.
On Tuesday, the ministry wants to discuss possible solutions with representatives of parliamentary parties.
"Whatever we do, it will have to mean changing the electoral law," said Hamáček.
The Senate on Wednesday called on the government to find a solution within the current statutory rules.
But the minister said that it will be necessary to adjust the provisions of the law, according to which people in quarantine because of the state of health can not vote.
The prohibition to vote should be maintained, for example, for patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop stated on ovm that the possibility of a correspondence election has been postponed since 2004.
Even the current bill, which is in the house, then provides for its introduction for voting abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
At the same time, Prokop considers the concerns of ANO or ČSSD (because, according to the experience from abroad, it would rather record to other types of parties) from the correspondence election to be overestimated.
Personally, he is against the possibility of electronic voting, where there is a considerable possibility of abuse.
Michal Klíma said that now it is necessary to invent ad hoc mechanisms (elections) that could be carried out this year and with the least possible health risk.
The main thing is to be ready for 2021, when parliamentary elections are to be held in the Czech Republic.
He considers the correspondence option (whether in a foreign country or also in the Czech Republic) as one of the functional methods.
As another, they see the already mentioned electoral units or, for example, the possibility of proxy voting within the family.
He added that there is an opportunity to learn how similar situations - elections at the time of coronavirus - were handled in Croatia, Poland or France.
Due to the spread of coronavirus infection, various types of elections in 67 countries of the world have already been postponed this year.
The Prague Stock Exchange grew slightly, Czech banks, O2 and Avast did well
The Prague Stock Exchange closed the trading week with a slight increase. The PX index rose 0.13 percent to 1038.45 points. Czech banks, telecommunications company O2 and technology company Avast pulled him up. On the contrary, the Austrian titles and the media company CME did not fare well. It follows from the results of trading on the site of the exchange.
For most of Friday's session, the Prague stock exchange traded in slightly positive territory and eventually closed with a small profit. "However, during the whole week, the PX index lost slightly over one percent," said Josef Dudek from fio Banka.
Domestic banks partially corrected the declines of recent days. Komerční Banka improved by 0.82 percent to CZK 803 and Moneta Money Bank by 0.41 percent to CZK 72.80. Avast shares appreciated by 0.89 percent to CZK 113 and operator O2 added 0.46 percent to CZK 216.50.
Kofola securities rose the most, by 1.38 percent to CZK 294. Less than a percent was acquired by the tobacco company Philip Morris, whose shares rose to CZK 13,640.
Securities of the energy company CEZ stagnated at 520 crowns on Thursday.
Losses were three titles-Erste Bank wrote off 0.87 percent to 779.20 crowns, CME 0.73 percent to 109 crowns and insurance company Vig 0.40 percent to 618 crowns.
The koruna weakened slightly against both major world currencies. On the euro lost four pennies to 25,85 CZK / EUR, on the dollar three pennies to 23,62 CZK / USD. This follows from the data on the Patria online server.
Protests in Buhari: pig's ears thrown by demonstrators at the government building
Participants of the demonstration against the Bulgarian prime minister Boyko Borisov and his cabinet threw pig ears at the government building.
It was another in a series of protests against the" mafia style of government " that have been taking place in Sofia and other cities for almost three weeks.
The organizers are planning a nationwide blockade on Wednesday, the dpa news agency reported.
Today's protest, which took place already 18. the day after, according to Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty, had a weaker turnout than the previous one.
By 20: 00, about 300 people had gathered, some streets had to be closed to traffic.
In front of the government building, demonstrators staged a theatrical scene in which they symbolically locked in a prison cell prime minister Borisov and prosecutor general Ivan Geshev in connection with the arrest of two advisers to President Rumen Radev, who is a strong political opponent of the prime minister.
The resignations of both are among the basic demands of the protesters.
They also demanded the cancellation of the announced health care reform and the end of corruption in construction on the Black Sea coast.
The organizer of the protests, Nikolai hadzhigenov, said today on public radio that the "peak of escalation" in the form of "nationwide demonstrations in Sofia and blockades throughout the country"is about to take place on Wednesday.
He repeated the demand for the resignation of Borisov and his government, as well as the call for early elections.
The regular ones should take place in March 2021.
Borisov has previously said that he does not intend to resign.
He justified this, among other things, by the need to implement the covid-19 pandemic in Bulgaria and the resulting economic crisis.
On Friday, however, he replaced five members of his government team, though the concession did not placate the demonstrators.
Earlier this week, Borisov's government withstood a vote of confidence in parliament.
The prosecutor general resumed the prosecution of a mother who manipulated her daughter against her father
The Supreme prosecutor Pavel Zeman does not agree with the acquittal of the mother, who for a long time manipulated her daughter and violated her relationship with her father. She was facing charges of abuse and endangering the welfare of a child. The regional court acquitted her, Zeman does not agree with this. In a similar act, according to his appeal to the Supreme Court, a crime can be seen.
The decision of the Supreme Court could have a wider impact on other cases. "A more specific definition of such a specific form of abuse can be considered necessary also from the point of view of directing further application practice," says Zeman's appeal.
The district court in svitavy first found the woman guilty last year of mistreatment of the entrusted person and endangering the upbringing of the child. With her daughter, she formed a strong, even symbiotic bond, even in a situation where she should have been entrusted to her father.
The result was a pathological fixation on the mother and a sharply negative attitude towards the father. The situation marked the emotional development of the daughter, who was even hospitalized. She threatened to self-harm in the event of handing over to the custody of the father.
Svitavsky court sentenced the mother to two years in prison with a two-year suspended sentence. But the Pardubice branch of the regional court acquitted the woman in the appeal proceedings, it is not said to be a crime. The same verdict was repeated by the regional court even after the Supreme Court had already ordered it to decide again.
The regional court found that situations where one parent manipulates a child towards the other are by no means exceptional. They are dealt with in guardianship proceedings, possibly with the help of psychologists or youth social protection bodies. Only rarely is the solution criminal law.
However, according to the chief prosecutor, the woman committed both cruelty and threats to education. "The accused acted purposefully in arousing in her daughter negative feelings towards her father, and purposefully reinforced these negative emotions. In doing so, she not only pursued an illegal intention to limit or exclude the father's contact with a minor, but she had to be aware that this would cause negative consequences in the psychosocial sphere of the minor," the appeal states.
Zeman asked the Supreme Court to return the case once again to the regional court. It follows from the appeal that the child is now in the care of the father.
Let the fans be positive, wishes Hasek. Sparta awaits šlágr in Pilsen
"We will play at the limit of possibilities, we will do everything in our power to succeed. We have to manage the game and the result," Martin Hašek promised in an interview for Club TV.
In the week the goal decided the Cup duel in Jihlava (2: 1). Sparta advanced to the next round, which was a duty for her. She's relieved, but the arcade is still hurting.
Even though the season slowly spills over into the second period, football Sparta is still looking for the face that coach Václav jílek talked about at the beginning of his engagement.
"But it's still Sparta who have very high quality players. We have a difficult game ahead of us, " warns Roman Procházka from Pilsen.
When the Spartans last arrived in the Strunce orchards, in mid-May, it was a definite matter in the superstructure. The guests left after a soulless performance with a beating of 0:4, the largest in the history of the independent Czech league.
While back then, before the match, the difference between the clubs in the table was eight points, now Sparta loses after ten games of the new season already nine points. Experiencing one of the worst entries to the season ever.
"It is not an easy situation for us, nor for the fans who would like to see their beloved club completely different from what it is at the moment," Hasek feels. "But we would like them to continue to support us, stay positive and stand behind us."
Sparta does not know if they will be able to use Tetteh, who was given a two-match suspension in Pilsen, but appealed against it on Friday.
Costa, děkal, drchal, panák, pulkrab, zahustel, Krejčí and Kadlec, who as the only one of the cadre remembers the last Spartan victory in Pilsen in 2011, remain on numerous sick leave.
The home team, who have won the last five games including Wednesday's Cup in hlucín, should be missing only midfielder čermák. And as captain, they should be led into the match by the defender Jakub Brabec, spartan bred.
Milan jakubov: the army stole the funeral for itself! Says Andor Šándor
There is still confusion around the funeral of brigadier general Milan jakubov. Media in the week speculated that the military last farewell to the deputy director of military intelligence planned against the wishes of the family bombastic, as only soldiers can. There were also discrepancies regarding the date of the funeral. Defense ministry spokesman Jan pejšek denied this.
"It's nonsense! We have been in touch with the family since the beginning, the Friday funeral date has been valid since the beginning, no one has changed it. Just as military honors are valid. We will only deal with the possible involvement of the media with regard to the family," said pějšek on Wednesday. The funeral will finally take place on Friday and will not miss all military honors, including the flight of fighter jets.
But there is still a tense atmosphere around the final farewell to the favorite general. People who have worked with the general in the past will not participate in the mourning ceremony because of the decision of the organizers!
For example, the former head of military intelligence Andor šándor (62), who met Milan jakubov 17 years ago. Šándor remembers his former colleague as hardworking, intelligent and a "good guy".
In addition, in recent years, he regularly met with him at the celebration of the anniversary of the founding of military intelligence. That is why he would like to say goodbye to Milan jakubov. "I personally would go to Milan jakubov's funeral," šándor told blesko. But he can't.
"I also know of other people from the organization who would like to go, but are unlucky, because potentates usurp the funeral for themselves. I think that this way to privatize the funeral is not right, " said the security expert. He does not care about the allegedly considered closure of the ceremony to the public because of the secrecy of military leaders.
"The leadership of the army is not classified, and the leaders of military intelligence are not either, because they are promoted at Prague Castle, we see them there. If the media reports are true, and the family has indeed been put on the back foot by the military, that is, of course, a family matter. I personally would never allow the army to overwhelm the family and its wishes, " concluded Šándor.
Milan jakubov died on Saturday near Spindleruv Mlyn in a car accident. The head-on collision of the Milan rapid with the Ford Mustang was allegedly caused by the driver of the sports car Vojtěch ch. (31).
The amateur racer in the corner should have driven into the opposite direction, Milan jakubov apparently had no chance to prevent the collision. His wife (47) suffered serious injuries in the accident and it is possible that she will suffer the consequences for the rest of her life. Police questioned the culprit of the accident on Thursday.
Coach Boloni Mihajlovic no longer wants matches without spectators
Coach of football players of Bologna Siniša Mihajlovic already has enough matches of the Italian league without spectators.
The Serbian coach hopes that from the new season the fans will return to the stadiums.
"What we are running here at the moment is not football.
I'm tired of games without spectators.
It's sexless football, it doesn't bring me any emotion, no joy.
Those fights are worse than training.
Playing like this is terrible and I think I'm not the only one who thinks so, " Mihajlovic said before today's match against Lecce.
After the coronavirus pause, the matches of series a follow in rapid succession, and although they are played only in the evening, their actors are exposed to the heat.
"We play every three days in terrible heat.
You don't even know where the teams stand in these conditions.
I wish this season was over.
These measures had to be taken in order to finish the competition, but I hope that by September the fans will be back," said the coach, who has also led Fiorentina and AC Milan in the past.
For Mihajlovic, this season is also unusual because he missed four months on the bench due to leukemia treatment.
"Despite my illness, the interruption of the league and everything else, our team managed to move up a level.
We want to continue to grow and for that we need players to be mentally stronger, " he said.

The launch of the new toll is not threatened, reports the Kremlin. But there is a change of operator in the game
The Ministry of transport on Friday began preparations for a new tender for the operation of the new toll system. This is a backup plan that the state would use in the event that the current toll contract was finally terminated. In addition, the state is also preparing other provisional solutions in case the tender could not be completed on time. On Facebook, this was stated by Transport Minister Vladimir kremlik (for yes).
The office for the protection of competition (úohs) on Thursday banned the performance of the toll contract between the state and the CzechToll/skytoll consortium, with a one-year delay. The ministry will file a lawsuit against it.
"The launch of the new toll collection system is not threatened. Starting today, we are launching the preparation of a new transparent tender, the subject of which will be the services of the operation of the new toll system, which is now being finalized by the CzechToll and skytoll consortium," the minister said.
Thus, the state would look for the operator of the currently prepared toll in the tender, which will be launched from this December. So it would not be a competition for a completely new toll system, as was the case with the last tender, nor the use of the old system, which is now operated by Kapsch.
However, according to the Kremlin, the ministry is also preparing for the fact that it would not be able to prepare a new tender in time. "Based on my experience with the toll tender process, I am deeply convinced that the úohs is wrong and that it is objectively impossible to prepare and implement such a complex tender procedure and transfer the operation of the toll system to a new operator within the 12-month period," he said.
In addition to the new tender procedure, the resort will also prepare a provisional solution that would solve the toll collection for a transitional period until the state finds a full-fledged form of solution.
Thus, the state will probably not take advantage of the offer presented to it by the current toll administrator Kapsch in the past few days. An Austrian company offered the state to operate the existing system in case the toll contract was cancelled.
At the same time, the Kremlin reiterated that it believes that a backup plan will not be needed. Therefore, the ministry will file an appeal against the decision of the antimonopoly authority.
On Thursday, the úohs issued a decision in which it banned the performance of the toll contract. But the ban will come into force only one year after the legal force of the decision of the authority. This is not final and can be appealed to the president of the office. The ministry and CzechToll are therefore continuing to prepare the new toll, which should be launched in December.
The CzechToll/skytoll consortium won last year's tender for a new toll system and its operator. It succeeded in a toll tender with a bid of 10.75 billion crowns for a ten-year operation. The current operator Kapsch protested against the tender process and the validity of the toll contract, which failed in the tender with an offer of over CZK 13 billion.
My heart is like a bell and my lungs are like a non-smoker's. Just have a couple of infusions, joked Zeman
The head of state underwent a several-hour medical examination at the Central Military Hospital (CNS) on Tuesday. According to the director of the hospital Miroslav Zavoral, doctors did not find any "disease states"in the president. The president will celebrate his 75th birthday on Saturday. birthday.
Doctors at the president at inspection revealed slight signs of dehydration. His problems with low pressure were caused precisely by insufficient irrigation. "To fix the dehydration of the body, I will take several infusions that will get minerals into my body," said Zeman.
Otherwise, according to him, the director of ÚVN stated that "the Czech state has a healthy president". In this context, the president mentioned that Zavoral received several hate messages because of the medical examination.
According to the president, doctors examined him thoroughly and did not miss a single spot on the body. "So, a brief recap: the heart beats like a bell, the lungs are clean, as if it were not a smoker, the liver works as if I was a teetotaler, the kidneys are also fine, and I can go on and on," Zeman said.
Editorial staff iDNES.cz she turned to the military hospital to comment on Zeman's statement about her health.
The issue of Zeman's health became a topic especially at the time of last year's presidential election or during some public appearances, during which Zeman has obvious problems with walking. According to the Prague Castle, the president does not walk well due to diabetic polyfunctional neuropathy. He also has problems with low pressure and worse hearing. For the sake of his health, he limited smoking.

Sparta does not want to lose Tetteh in Pilsen. She appealed against the two-match penalty
Football Sparta appealed against the two-match penalty for striker Benjamin Tetteh, which the player received from the disciplinary commission for exclusion in Sunday's derby with Slavia (0:3).
The flight club announced this on its Twitter and is now waiting for the verdict of the appeal commission.
Tetteh has already served half of his sentence in Wednesday's domestic cup match in Jihlava. Sparta are now aiming for the 22-year-old Ghanaian striker to feature in Sunday's 11th-round clash. first league round in Pilsen.
The situation of last October could be repeated. At the time, Olomouc appealed against the punishment for Šimon falta, who on Thursday received a one-match suspension from the disciplinary commission for his expulsion against Liberec.
The appeals board did not have time to discuss the case, so the effectiveness of the punishment was postponed and Falta could start on Saturday, paradoxically against Sparta.
The commission finally confirmed the one-match penalty for the Olomouc midfielder in the following week, and Falta missed the following duel with Zlín.
The disciplinarian stopped Tetteh's activity for a foul on Slavist David Hovorka, for which he received in 82. a minute from the referee Miroslav Zelinka straight red card.
The alleged spit of the Ghanaian player on the captain of the opponent Tomas Souček has not been proven.
We have become the target of cyberattacks by foreign states, says Iran
Since the end of June, fires and explosions have been reported from a number of Iranian military, industrial and nuclear facilities, as well as oil refineries, power plants, factories and enterprises.
Some Iranian officials have said that the fire that broke out this month at the underground nuclear plant in Natanz could have been caused by cyber sabotage.
The cause of a number of other incidents has not yet been explained.
Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi told reporters, according to Iranian media, that the infrastructure of the Islamic republic faces "thousands of cyber attacks"daily.
He added that this is not a new phenomenon and that most of them will be repelled.
In recent months, according to Mousavi, several broader cyber attacks have been recorded, behind which, according to analyzes, were"certain governments and groups."
However, he did not disclose more details about possible perpetrators, according to Reuters.
Musavi also added that fires in forests, refineries and other places are frequent in the summer.
An article by Iran's state-run IRNA news agency this month suggested that Iran's enemies, such as Israel and the US, may have been behind the recent incidents.
However, neither of these countries was directly accused of specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States severed diplomatic relations shortly after the 1979 revolution, when Iranian militant students stormed the U.S. embassy in Tehran, holding 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
Long-strained relations between the two countries escalated in 2018 after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers and imposed sanctions on Iran, which have a hard impact on its economy.
Another major escalation came this year after the US military 3. in January, she killed Iranian general Qassem Soleimani and a member of the leadership of Iraqi militias, Abu Mahdi Muhandis.
Iran then 8. January fired at the bases in Iraq, where the Americans operate, a number of missiles.
The US only admitted in hindsight that dozens of US soldiers had been wounded.
Israel considers Iran its arch-enemy, and prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is the main opponent of the 2015 international nuclear agreement with Iran.
According to the Israeli prime minister, Iran is trying to develop an atomic bomb, which Iran denies.
Harry in the footsteps of Princess Diana (†36)! Where's Meghan?
Diana was special in that she could hold people's hearts. In January 1997, she caused a stir when she visited Africa and especially minefields. The images in which he is wearing a protective suit and a shield on his face have become iconic. And even then no one could have guessed that a few months later the princess of human hearts in a tragic car accident in Paris will breathe her last breath.
Now her younger son Harry has also scored, having gone to the same place as her after 22 years. He went to the mine-clearing post in Diric, Angola, also wearing a special protective suit and looking very thoughtful. He certainly did not avoid the memories of his beloved mother, whom he lost at the age of only 13.
Harry gave a speech on the spot, where he praised the efforts of the HALO Trust, which works to defuse minefields and other explosives in the countries where the war took place. "Minefields are the unhealed wounds of war. By cleaning them up, we can help the community to find peace, with which comes opportunities, " he said, and also appealed to save and preserve wildlife and the local river as a source of water. After this visit, the Duke of Sussex moved to Huamba to rename the local orthopedic center after his famous mother, Princess Diana.
He did not forget to mention it on his official Instagram account:" the Duke is honored to visit a place and community that was so important to his mother, to learn about their tireless mission and to speak for all those about whom she (Diana) felt they needed most to be heard, even if the issue was not exactly popular worldwide, " the Sussex royal
But royal fans may regret that he did not take his wife Meghan (38) and their son Archie (4 months) on such an expedition for the memories of Diana. The two of them have had separate agendas for Harry since Wednesday, apparently to protect them. After all, taking a little baby to a minefield doesn't sound very safe, and Harry doesn't want to jeopardize his beloved family at any cost.
The carmaker TPCA extended the production shutdown, now to 25. may
Cologne automaker Toyota Peugeot Citroën automobile (TPCA) has again extended the production shutdown due to coronavirus.
Production lines are expected to restart on Monday 25. may morning.
The start will be accompanied by dozens of hygiene measures, said Tomáš paroubek, a spokesman for the automaker.
Production stands due to the coronavirus pandemic from the evening of 18. Brezno.
Originally, the company intended to restore it on Monday 18. may.
The reason for the extension of the shutdown, according to paroubek, are closed borders and closed dealerships, so there is no one to sell cars.
According to paroubek, the company will produce 100 percent from the beginning, that is, for two shifts.
The company's key markets, such as Italy, the United Kingdom or Spain, are affected by the coronavirus.
Mayor Michael kašpar (change for Cologne) said that the shutdown of production in TPCA does not affect life in the city.
"At first it was obvious, the city was empty.
But gradually the streets are filling up, especially now since Monday, when it got a lot loosened up.
So the city is full, " said Kaspar.
According to him, there are no complications even with foreign workers who stayed in hostels.
"In those two months, we did not have to solve almost any problem," said Kaspar.
For example, Mladá Boleslav Skoda Auto, which also discontinued production due to the coronavirus crisis, resumed it on Monday 27. April in all three of its production facilities in the Czech Republic.
None of the plants are operating at 100 percent capacity.
The restoration of production in the pest was accompanied by more than 80 sanitary measures.
On the night of Monday to Tuesday, the third night shift was held in Mladá Boleslav and Kvasiny for the first time after the resumption of production.
TPCA currently employs approximately 2,500 people and represents one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and an employer in Cologne.
The D line will be overseen by a new metro architect, bringing experience from the London Underground
The Prague transport company has chosen an architect to oversee the design of the Metropolitan metro. From October, Anna švarc will take over, her primary task will be the design of the new line D, but she will also be in charge of the existing stations. According to her, the metro can not be viewed only as a transport structure, traveling by underground should also bring an aesthetic experience.
A Czech architect who participated in the reconstruction of three London Underground stations, for example, won a tender put out by the Prague transport company (DPP).
The tender was attended by 14 other bidders. "The selection procedure included a motivation letter and a CV. Apparently decided my previous practice from London, where in a team of three people I created a kind of aesthetic manual for the metro there," says the new metro architect. Similarly, according to her, her practice from the Institute of planning and development of the city of Prague could also decide.
The metro is not perceived only as a transport construction. Stations should also have aesthetic value.
"I have ideas about how the metro will change, how the space will improve. However, I will find out how it will really work in the coming weeks, when the transport company introduces me to its ideas, " says švarc.
"This is not a series of dogmas, but rather recommendations aimed primarily at maintaining the context of all stations in the event that they are reconstructed," the design manual approximates.
Whether a similar tool is also a way to improve public space in the Prague Metro is a question. The Prague Metro is specific. "Whether the manual is ideal, or whether it can be covered by a personality, I really do not know yet," concludes švarc.
Cancer killed the bride shortly after the wedding: she left a message to the family
For more than two years, Gemma Sisson battled insidious cancer, and when it seemed that she had defeated the cancer, the disease came again.
The thirty-nine-year-old woman, who loved bodybuilding, eventually ended up on a bed in a hospice, where she still had time to take the love of her life.
Unfortunately, she succumbed to the disease.
A few hours after her death, a shocking message for those closest to her appeared on her Facebook account.
Gemma Sisson, originally from Leeds, England, loved bodybuilding.
With her boyfriend Ricky Moore, with whom she lived for more than 16 years, they traveled to competitions held around the world.
The 39-year-old woman played sports and lived healthy, yet in April 2018 she was diagnosed with cancer.
Gemma began a grueling treatment, radiotherapy, in the hope of healing.
After months of treatment, it really seemed that Gemma had managed to win over the cancer, however, in August of 2019, the cancer returned and this time attacked the spine.
The bodybuilder and personal trainer, according to the information of the British Daily Mirror, underwent a ten-hour operation on the spine and then began again with drastic treatment.
However, everything was in vain.
Earlier this year, on her 39th birthday, doctors told her that she had a few months left to live.
In April, finally, the handsome blonde decided to go to a hospice in Leeds, where she was visited every now and then by her family, who even arranged her a wedding with her love Ricky.
The marriage lasted two months.
Ricky took Gemma to a restaurant for the last time on their two-month anniversary.
Four days later, Gemma died in his arms.

"If this was made public, it means that I finally died after weeks of fighting too long.
Although I will be heartbroken to leave my loved ones behind, I will be so glad to get rid of what this terrible disease has done to me.
I can't thank Ricky enough, who was by my side the whole time and gave me a huge amount of love and support during that terrible time, " she wrote on the social network, adding that the pain and suffering finally stopped and she found peace.
"I am also grateful for all the support I have received from all my followers on the social network," she wrote, adding that everyone should appreciate their life and live it to the fullest.
The first miss Christ finally went into herself: she lost a few pounds and immediately saw through
The first modern miss of 1989 Ivana christová (49) had long years of problems with excess weight, which caused her not only physical problems, but mainly mental ones. She suffered because she had changed a lot since the days of Miss Czechoslovakia. But now it seems that she took the reproaches to heart and with extra pounds went into battle. Even if it's a long run.
She used to be a world-class beauty who conquered Paris. But since then, thirty years have passed, and Ivana christova can only remember the beauty contest. Not just because of the fame, but because of how thin she was.
Over time, she decided not to submit to strict modeling rules, which ordered her to be as slim as possible and often did not eat. She decided to stop listening and began to indulge in what she just has an appetite for.
But from hunger strikes she switched to overeating, which immediately took its toll on her figure. The extra kilos she tried to disguise with various loose clothes, which added to the size of the plump shapes.
Now it looks like Ivana's really into herself. Visibly losing weight, she began to dress tastefully and appropriately to her fuller figure.
She surprised all those present at the baptism of the book Miloš Zapletal (75), that she had once again seen through and already has the features of a charming brunette, who in 1989 entered history not only as the first winner of Miss after the revolution, but also by the controversy her victory caused.
Christová will forever be the first beauty winner, but also the very first one that the audience at the Palace of culture and sport in Ostrava whistled like senseless when she put on her crown.
"A travesty of justice."The scientist warned of cancer from pollution, sitting in a Turkish prison
Sik, along with other scientists, participated in a study commissioned by the Turkish Ministry of health between 2011 and 2015. Its conclusion was that pollution of water, soil and food in some industrial areas in the west of the country is associated with an increased incidence of cancer among local residents.
The researchers mentioned in particular the dilovasi industrial zone, which lies about 80 kilometers from Istanbul, and where a number of chemical and metallurgical plants are located. According to them, people living in its vicinity suffer from cancer far more often than the international average.
Erdogan retaliates for coup, international criticism despite
Despite the clear conclusions of the study, it seemed to Sika that the government was not taking any action on the matter. Therefore, he wrote several articles about the research in the opposition newspaper Cumhuriyet. The authorities subsequently began to prosecute him for leaking classified information.
"The study clearly showed the extent to which water sources were contaminated with toxic substances," sik told reporters after the verdict. "The court's decision shows that the results of studies directly related to public health can be concealed. This is unacceptable, " the scientist added.
"Instead of pursuing people sounding the alarm through the courts, the Turkish authorities should investigate this significant public health problem," said Andrew Gardner of AI's Turkish branch.
Environmental and human rights organizations have long accused the Turkish government of not enforcing environmental regulations despite the rapid development of industry in certain regions.
Following the failed 2016 coup, the regime of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan launched a large wave of arrests. Almost 80, 000 people are now behind bars, including a number of employees of the Cumhuriyet newspaper. The authorities also laid off or completely dismissed 150,000 civil servants and members of the armed forces.
The opposition and human rights organisations accuse the government of using the coup attempt to persecute opponents. But the authorities argue that these are measures necessary to ensure national security.

The Slovenians beat the Polish world champions and are in the final of the European Championship
Slovenian volleyball players will sensationally play for the Premier title of European champions. With the support of almost 12 thousand boisterous fans in Ljubljana, the reigning two-time world champions defeated the poles 3:1 and are the first finalists.
Who will be called up in Sunday's climax in Paris will be decided on Friday between France and Serbia.
The Slovenian team performed much more compactly in the semifinals than the Polish world champions. These included only the beginning of the opening set and, with luck, the end of the second set, but the home volleyball players surpassed themselves in defense and from the players in red and white jerseys, only the native of Cuba, León, actually scored.
However, in the Home lineup, both smecters Čebulj and urnaut presented themselves in life form, as well as the second all-rounder štern, who soon replaced the lackluster Gasparini. The poles paid for the fact that they won all previous matches at this euro in a masterful manner, while the Slovenians gained confidence after heavy battles in the playoffs with both Bulgarians and Russians.
With the poles this August, the Slovenes lost in the Olympic qualifier in Gdansk 1:3, but they returned the defeat at home. But now the sold-out arena in Ljubljana Stožica will leave. After today, however, they have a certain second medal in history, in Paris they can improve on the unexpected silver from the European championships four years ago.
At the previous European Championship Slovenians finished eighth, only behind the Czech national team.

Former presidents of the upper chamber Libuše benešová and Milan Štěch also received medals.
Together with Jiří hanzelka, Zikmund undertook a number of travel expeditions around the world, during which they collected a lot of documentary material. Fištejn was a commentator and director of Radio Free Europe, now he cooperates with public media. Steigerwald also works as a playwright and screenwriter, the musician kocáb was the head of the parliamentary commission for supervising the withdrawal of Soviet troops.

Insects are up to sixty times less than 40 years ago
No other animal class is more represented in nature than insects. Beetles, butterflies and other species make up more than half of life on earth. But reports are mounting that the insect kingdom is drastically shrinking. Another scientific study on this topic came out just this week, and the situation, according to her, is even more serious than humanity has realized so far.
The study is based on field research in the tropical rainforest of Puerto Rico, in which American scientists copied a similar survey from 1976. As they write right at the beginning of the report, insects are now in the forest "ten to sixty times less". This is a decline in the entire population, not the number of species, and the research concerned not only insects, but all arthropods. Due to the extinction of insects, the population of other fauna that are dependent on insects in the food chain, such as birds, frogs or lizards, is also thinning.
The authors of the research put their conclusions in direct connection with climate change. According to them, the average air temperature in the forest has risen by two degrees Celsius in the last thirty years, and warming has become the driving force behind the collapse of the food chain. Thus, according to the author's team, the study shows that the impact of climate change on tropical ecosystems may be much greater than previously thought.
The report was published on Monday in a large article in the Washington Post, which makes the new findings immediately in the headline as hyper-alarming. "It's one of the most disturbing articles I've ever read," entomologist David Wagner of the University of Connecticut, whom the paper cites as an independent expert, told the paper.
The extinction of insects also concerns Europe. "In our country, the decline is also an order of magnitude," says Lukáš čížek from the Entomological Institute of the Academy of Sciences. However, in addition to climate change, it is necessary to take into account the landscape changes that play an essential role in Europe. "In our country only runs significantly longer than in Puerto Rico," adds Čížek to explain why in the rainforest compared to 70. years ago, scientists could measure such a rapid decline.

The head of police unions Stepanek resigned, wants to live as a free man
The chairman of the independent trade union of police Milan Stepanek decided to leave his post. This was stated on Friday by the Czech Radio-Radio Journal. Štěpánek led the trade unions since 2005. He'll be union president for two more months. In the police even after leaving the head of the union will remain.
"I can confirm that I submitted my written resignation to the bureau this week, after which I will continue to perform my duties to the full for two months," štěpánek told radiožurnál. "I decided as a free man who does not want to be forever chained to the trade union. And who wants to live a quieter life, " he stated the reasons for leaving.
The independent trade union of the police of the Czech Republic brings together members and employees of the security forces or employees of the Ministry of the interior. Among other things, the Union participated in police protests against budget cuts or petitions for better conditions for the security forces. He also got into a dispute with the then minister of the interior, Radek John, in 2011 and organized a petition for his resignation. The leadership of the ruling coalition later agreed on John's departure.
Salaries in the health sector will rise by a maximum of five percent next year.
A bigger increase is unrealistic according to Vojtech
Salaries in the health sector could rise by no more than five percent next year, said Health Minister Adam Vojtěch (for ANO) in Václav Moravec's questions on Czech television.
The demand of trade unionists for an increase of up to 15 percent considers unrealistic.
He also said that the state should try to be self-sufficient in providing protective equipment.
According to him, hospitals now have their supplies.
"I think that the increase (in salaries) can be somewhere within five percent," said the minister.
According to him, it is necessary to reflect the current situation, when since March intervened in the collection of insurance premiums pandemic coronavirus and government regulations against its spread.
The income of insurance companies at that time fell.
"I find the increase of 15 percent unrealistic at the moment," Vojtěch said.
The average monthly earnings of a doctor in acute inpatient care, according to the data of the Institute of health information and statistics (Uzis), are likely to reach 88, 312 crowns this year, 47, 498 crowns for nurses.
The difference between the salary of nurses in state hospitals and the salary of other founders will be up to seven thousand crowns.
Uzis data also show that the decline in nurses in hospitals has stopped.
The average salary in the Czech Republic was CZK 34,125 in 2019, according to data from the Czech Statistical Office.
Representatives of trade unionists already said in June that for 2021 they will demand a minimum increase of ten percent, ideally 15 percent.
They criticize the long-term significant difference between the earnings of doctors and nurses in state hospitals, which must be guided by salary tables, and contract wages in hospitals of cities, counties or private.
They therefore also call for uniform pay tables for health professionals.
For nurses this year, the difference will be up to seven thousand crowns per month.
But for doctors, for example, wages grew faster than salaries last year.
According to the president of the Czech Stomatological Chamber, Roman šmucler, trade unionists should perceive the current state of affairs.
Due to the effects of the covid epidemic, the chamber recently approved an increase in this year's state budget deficit to a record 500 billion crowns, of which 1.75 billion is to go to the remuneration of health workers in hospitals and social services.
The board of health care providers, according to shmucler, does not agree with a blanket salary increase next year.
According to him, the remuneration should be decided by the hospitals and medical institutions themselves, and the extra money should go to them through the reimbursement decree.
Vojtěch also said that the hospitals currently have enough protective equipment.
Pavel svagr, chairman of the state material reserves administration (sshr), said this week that the administration does not currently have a single protective medical device in its assets.
He is waiting for the completion of the selection procedures.
According to Vojtěch, now suppliers in the world are able to deliver goods better than in March, when they were redeemed.
According to him, the state should also try to be as self-sufficient as possible and buy from Czech companies.
Petra chernocká changed the image and did well! In light hair rejuvenated
Film saxana Petra černocká (69) looks absolutely fantastic for her age. Although she will celebrate her life's jubilee in November, she never looked like a pensioner. And now she's helped make it happen. She changed her image until her colleagues didn't recognize her.
Actress Petra chernocká never looked like a typical grandmother, who would have her hair streaked with gray, wear sedate things and go out sporadically into society. She has always taken care of herself, and the older she is, the more she is able to indulge in looking at her image.
Fortunately, she did not succumb to the trend of plastic surgery and takes care of the skin with the help of good old-fashioned indulona. And her anti-wrinkle recipe is paying off. But now she's changed her hair color and completely seen through.
When she came to a social event where celebrities said goodbye to summer, no one could recognize Petra. Not only did she have lighter and shorter hair, but she was also dressed in a yellow coat, which made her even more radiant.
Ladies should learn from saxana how not to underestimate themselves, that even on the threshold of seventy they can take risks with appearance. And it paid off for Petra, she looks like she's 50 at the most.
Lucie bílá's father didn't like her at all. You won't believe what she had to do for a living!
Who does not know that the national treasure Lucie bílá (53) is a seamstress by profession and her own name is Hana zaňáková, probably does not live in the Czech Republic. But the singer herself has now revealed that she almost worked in a glass factory!
Lucie bílá knew from a fairly early age that she wanted to be a singer. Her love for singing was born when, as a young girl, she performed at the cultural house in her native otvovice, where she still lives.
"And I remember exactly where my mother was sitting. At that time, a singer was born in me, " she admitted to Pulse Radio.
Her father, however, was a little worried about his daughter's future and advised her to take the path of a craft that has a golden bottom.
"Dad always said,' craft girl, craft. Get your feet on the ground!'He even talked me into going to the local Glassworks. The glassworks are down, I'm pretty good. I am a trained seamstress and at home I make various rosaries and pendants from beads, which I then auction at auctions and buy wheelchairs with money," she added with a laugh.
Děčín zoo rejoices at a small macaque
"Our group currently has seven members. Her youngest member came into the world 17. Augustus was born to a female Buffy and is her fifth cub, fathered by a male Hitam. The first days after birth, the female carried the cub tightly pressed to the body and for a long time did not want to show the world whether she gave birth to a male or a female. At about three weeks of age, however, the cub gradually began to postpone it for a little while and the caretakers have known for a few days that it is a male, " said zoo spokeswoman Alena houšková, noting that the Děčín zoo has successfully bred 12 cubs of this species.
Crested macaques are so-called endemites of the island of Sulawesi, that is, they do not live anywhere else in the world in the wild. A typical feature is a black coat and a plume on the head, according to which they got the name. Crested macaques live in rain forests, mainly at lower altitudes.
Like most primates, they feed on plant and animal food. In the diet, the fruits of forest trees predominate very significantly, which complement the flowers and leaves. The need for protein is solved by eating small arthropods, larvae and, to a lesser extent, birds ' eggs and chicks.
"Apart from natural enemies, which are pythons, everything else has been written down by man. Local residents hunt macaques as a favorite prey with tasty meat and for fur. The burning and felling of the rainforest is also fatal for these animals, " the spokeswoman added.
Unexplained death of a little girl (†8) in Příbram: the culprit will not be punished
Unexplained cases are called "memorials"in forensic slang. But even these are investigated if new information comes to light after years. Especially when it comes to the death of a child. In 1980, the criminalist Jiří Markovič was able to investigate the murder of two girls in Prague's Prokopské údolí Valley, 12 years old at the time. "The 1955 case? It will be hard, very hard. It would take a start to find the file, it may no longer exist, to talk to those who investigated it. There is always hope, but it would be really hard, " says Markovic.
Under the previous regime, violent crimes were not widely reported to the public, but according to Markovic, this certainly does not mean that they were investigated laxly. "It always depended on specific people," the criminalist thinks. The problem may be that materials from 50. flight 20. they can be destroyed, although unsolved cases should not be shredded.
The scrubbing smart quarantine could be taken over by soldiers.
We're ready, they say.
"Smart quarantine works, there is something to improve of course.
We'll discuss it with the army tonight.
The army is working perfectly and the question is whether they should not manage it all again, " the prime minister said on Sunday in his Facebook show Hello people.
According to him, it is not enough to connect IT systems and sanitary stations, which gradually have to switch to more modern methods of functioning.
According to the prime minister, the problems were in the Moravian-Silesian region, where there are some of the current outbreaks of the epidemic.
Defense ministry spokesman Jan pejšek told CTK that he had no information about Sunday's meeting and that the government should discuss the matter on Monday.
According to him, the army is ready for this step.
The smart quarantine project was taken over by the Ministry of health 25. may.
Until then, the smart quarantine was led by a 90-member central management team established under the army as an advisory body to the government, headed by the former minister's deputy Roman prymula.
Interior minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) criticized the scrubbing project on Sunday.
He also suggested that the army might take over again.
The shortcomings in the project were previously admitted by the government commissioner for it and digitization, Vladimir dzurilla, who is in charge of it.
"The system works, but it is still being worked on.
For 20 years it was created independently and unsystematically, now we are trying to unite it in a few months.
It's not going in the jet.
People on the move, poor sanitation workers on the move are adapting these new systems and actually picking up these mistakes," he said.
Ostrava Mayor Macura will not run again, because he does not want to "get crazy in politics"
The current mayor of Ostrava Tomáš Macura (ANO) will not run in the next local elections.
The reason for this is an effort "not to fool around in politics," he told the server Respekt.cz.
Macura, who is also a member of the Presidium of the ANO movement, has been mayor of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the 2018 municipal elections, the candidate of the ANO movement led by him won almost a third of the electoral votes in Ostrava.
Macura originally wanted to be in office for only four years.
"I thought that I would last one term and with the experience of business here in that time I can turn everything around and put on its feet," said Respektu.
He added that he had been persuaded to a certain extent for a second term.
"But for me this is the maximum.
I don't want to fool around in politics, " added Macura, who in an interview described himself as a heavy introvert who does not like frequent contact with people.
According to respect, there has been speculation for some time about Macura's possible end in the ANO movement.
The server recalls that Macura has repeatedly criticized the ANO movement, for example, for its alliance with the SPD or for supporting Milos Zeman in the presidential elections.

Uber will return to Brno offering transportation services
Uber, which offers transportation services, will return to Brno at the end of July.
This is a consequence of the change in the law, said on Thursday in a press release the Brno councillor for transport Petr kratochvíl (ODS).
Taxi drivers protested against Uber in Brno, pointing out that Uber does not meet the conditions such as the designation as a taxi or taximeter.
However, by changing the law, since July, the conditions for operating both ordinary taxis and alternative ones have changed.
Kratochvil has held several meetings with representatives of Uber in recent weeks.
"On their basis, this company decided to return to Brno with its services at the end of July this year.
This step is due to a change in the law, which allows the company to operate legally.
The city was familiar with this change and we believe that the company will operate its services within the given limits, " said Kratochvil.
Uber has operated in Brno in the past.
Taxi drivers protested against him because of the non-marking of vehicles as taxis or the absence of a taximeter.
The court issued a preliminary injunction that banned Uber from driving in the city.
Brno initially supported taxi drivers, but at the end of last year, Mayor Markéta vaňková (ODS) said that the city would like to take steps to make Uber work in Brno.
According to later court decisions, Uber could ride in Brno, but the company did not take advantage of this.
Now they will return on the basis of a change in the law.
Since July, in addition to classic taxis with a flashlight and a taximeter, it is easier to operate a transport service ordered and paid exclusively through mobile applications.
Too exuberant celebration in Brno: a flying chair landed a meter from a man on the sidewalk
An office chair flew from the fourth floor of an apartment building on Saturday night in Brno and landed about a meter from the sidewalk.
After him at that moment went a pedestrian, who immediately called the officers.
The patrol noticed an open window right after arriving at the address in the western part of the city, under which a chair was still lying, and next to it several cans and cigarette butts.
"The noise that was carried from the room on the fourth floor indicated that a rather noisy celebration was taking place inside.
The officers went down the corridor to the apartment and asked the three young men present, aged between twenty-six and twenty-nine, for an explanation," said Jakub Ghanem, a spokesman for the officers.
Young Czechs think they can do it with money. The survey did not confirm this
"So it turns out that young Czechs have a little more confidence in their knowledge of finance than reality. In this case, women and respondents without a high school diploma had a significantly higher proportion of wrong answers," said Jaroslava palendalová, director of Kruk.
Men and young high school or college students are more likely to trust their knowledge of financial products.
Young Czechs learn most about the functioning of financial affairs from parents (37 percent), self-study on the internet (23 percent) and only in the third place from teaching at school (21 percent).
Questions around finances consult with parents mainly women, while information on the internet is more often sought by men. Obtaining information about finances from parents prevails in all age categories of young people, regardless of their educational attainment or personal income. Practically minimal influence is exerted by prospectuses of financial institutions, professional journals and publications.
"Once again, the importance of raising children by their parents, who represent authority in all major areas of life, is shown. Therefore, the level of financial literacy of parents who transfer their knowledge and experience to their offspring is key, " said palendal.
Savings and investments are preferred by 94 percent of the young.
Clearly, young people are faced with the question of whether it is better to save and buy, for example, their own house or apartment, or to enjoy and spend money rather, without savings and their own housing.
The strategy of saving and investing in fixed tangible assets is professed by 94 percent of respondents. This applies across all age groups of young people, regardless of educational attainment, social status or current personal income.
The survey strategy is 100% supported by people in a marriage with two or more children and employees in the public sector. On the contrary, people living alone and with an income above CZK 30,000 per month want to enjoy themselves more.
Strict, but fair, the clock entertains us! This is how the Beneš gymnasts see their favorite Cantor of the writer
Humanism should be present in every good book, Pavel Hoza believes. At the same time, the high school teacher of Czech and history is a poet, prose writer and awakener of literary life in a small town.
Bohuslav reynek comes to mind over Pavel Hoza's lyrics. His poetry, his paintings. Bare trees, whitish country houses, quivering grass, shepherds, sheep and goats, old roads and people who have been following them for centuries. Grieving, cursing, blessing. This contemporary follower of Reynek's teaches Czech, literature and history at the grammar school in benešov, runs an analogue of the Prague viola in the café na slovíčko and organises the Benešov literary festival every year.
Request for dismissal of Rafaj probere Babiš with ČSSD
Prime minister Andrej Babiš (ano) plans to discuss with the coalition Social Democrats on Monday the request for the draft dismissal of the head of the antimonopoly office (úohs), Petr rafaj.
Non-profit organizations at the meeting of the anti-corruption Council of the government and also the Ústí nad Labem Region called for Rafaj's dismissal.
The Social Democrats state that the replacement of the head of the office is in place.
According to CTK, Rafaj was not invited to the government office on Monday.
The second mandate expires in the middle of next year, according to the law, he can not be appointed for the third time.
His dismissal is within the competence of President Milos Zeman.
In addition to the appeal of non-profit organizations, the prime minister received a letter with a similar request from the Ústí region.
The reason is supposed to be among other Rafaj's cases from recent times.
In the past week, the prime minister refused to comment on the request, saying that he will get acquainted with the materials and the government parties will take "some position" on this.
He also said that he has not yet discussed the challenges with the president, a meeting with him in the near future has not been arranged.
According to the statement of the úohs, there is no reason to appeal, since Rafaj was not accused of anything.
Servers IHNED.cz a Aktuálně.cz in the past week, they wrote that the police are interested in Rafaj's meetings with Hetman Jiří čunek.
The meetings were related, among other things, to the decision on the competition for the controversial new Zlín hospital project for eight billion, which Čunek is pushing hard for.
According to him, together they dealt with his "Senate activities".
Similarly, Rafay speaks.
The Ústí nad Labem regional council called on the government to remove rafaj at the end of June.
It also calls for reform of the authority's decision-making mechanisms.
According to the deputy governor for transport Jaroslav komínek, the decision-making of the úohs regarding public procurement is not transparent and has signs of arbitrariness.
Last March, the police interfered with the antimonopoly office because of a tender for the collection of tolls.
This June then server Aktuálně.cz he drew attention to the fact that Rafaj uses apartments written for the company of an influential backstage player of ČSSD, Alexander čuba.
But the advance of 3.5 million for the apartment in Brno was paid from Rafaj's account.
The president of the office for the protection of competition is rafaj since 9. July 2009, for a second term, the president appointed a former Social Democrat MP in June 2015.
In less than a year, Rafajova's second six-year mandate will expire.
The law on the antimonopoly bureau states that the president can dismiss the head of the bureau on a proposal from the government.
He may be removed only if he has not held office for more than six months or if he seriously undermines the dignity of his office or the independence and impartiality of the office.

In the library of Blaine, the employees collapsed in the heat.
Will help air conditioning
The new technique will cost 740 thousand and will be in operation in the second half of August.
"For me, this is good news.
With three children we go to the library in the center of blansko regularly.
But in the warm months there was practically impossible to endure.
It was so hot and the air was so bad.
Ventilation did not help.
Therefore, I am happy for the air conditioning, " said one of blanensky readers Petr Novotný.
According to the director of the library, Lukáš dlapa, the temperature in the building often climbed to over thirty degrees.
The southern wall of the building is glazed and works as a greenhouse on sunny days.
"In addition, the sun relies on it for a large part of the day due to the curvature of the building.
At the same time, it is a big problem to ventilate individual compartments, because overnight the windows must be closed for safety reasons.
We often have thirty degrees in the library in the morning, " said dlapa.
Worst of all was the study and reading room on the third floor.
And one floor up, the exhibition rooms and the principal's office.
Unpleasant climate was also in the children's department, located under the roof of the building.
"Several times it happened that librarians at work collapsed and ended up on sick leave.
The problem regularly occurred also in the cultural room at lectures, which are attended by dozens of people.
After a few minutes there was no way to breathe, " said dlapa.
Originally, city officials wanted to make this year air conditioning in all areas of the library.
In the end, there will be only three circuits out of five.
"Due to limited funding, only the most problematic premises will have air conditioning.
Study and reading room on the third floor.
Then there is the cultural room and the children's department one floor higher," said Jiří Svoboda from the blaně investment department.
He added that in the first phase, the workers had already installed HVAC systems in the mentioned premises last autumn and adjusted the wiring.
Approximately for 360 thousand crowns.
The municipal library of blansko has almost three thousand registered readers.
Of these, about nine hundred are under fifteen.

Chicago's mainstay banished the coronavirus.
Crawford returns to the game
Not every infected athlete comes out with the truth.
Especially when it comes to players from the NHL, which is silent about the health of players like a tomb and does not publish anything at all.
As one of the few stood out from the ranks of Crawford.
The 35-year-old native of Montreal was present only at the first training session, since then he was absent from the lineup.
"I would like to announce to all of you that I have tested positive for covid-19 and because of this I have spent the last fortnight locked in my house," he revealed the reason for his absence.
Fans no longer have to worry about his health.
Crawford is ready to throw himself into the full load again.
"It's amazing to be back.
I will do everything possible to get in shape as soon as possible, " he added.
The experienced goaltender won two Stanley Cups with Chicago, a solid part of the goaltending is already the tenth season in a row.

Thousands of people protested in Israel against the Prime Minister
Thousands of Israelis in several parts of the country protested against unemployment, corruption and the way prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is handling the coronavirus crisis.
Demonstrations took place in front of Netanyahu's private villa in Caesarea, near his official residence, and in a park in Tel Aviv.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, protests have been held regularly for several weeks.
Their participants are demanding Netanyahu's resignation because of the trial in which he is accused of corruption and fraud, as well as how the government is dealing with the next wave of the coronavirus epidemic.
"Bibi, go home," one of the protesters wrote on his banner, referring to Netanyahu's widely known nickname, according to AP.
"Everyone sees that the emperor has lost his clothes," it said on another.
The 70-year-old Netanyahu is the first prime minister of Israel to be tried in office.
He is accused in three cases of corruption, fraud and abuse of trust.
He denies all the accusations and calls them a witch hunt.
According to local media, the trial can last up to three years, more than 300 witnesses are summoned.
The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has been confirmed in almost 60,500 people in Israel, which has a population of about nine million.
At 455 people died in connection with the disease.
In March, the Israeli government introduced quarantine measures that helped reduce the daily increase in the infected.
However, after a gradual easing of restrictions since the end of April, the numbers of infected began to grow significantly again, especially at the end of June.
Netanyahu's critics argue that the government has not done enough to help, for example, the businesses affected by the quarantine measures.
Protesters also resent the fact that the government is issuing contradictory instructions in the fight against coronavirus.
Step back, urged Schiller for words about opposition filth Czernin
"I find it completely unacceptable that a member of the Czech government should use such a totalitarian expression anywhere, much less in parliament," Czernin wrote in an open letter to Schiller.
Her words caused a stir when discussing a draft constitutional lawsuit against President Milos Zeman. The opposition did not get enough votes, and the draft constitutional lawsuit, which came up with the Senate, was thrown off the table by the deputies.
"I get dozens of messages from people I don't know. There is not a single voice in support of this lawsuit. There are messages in support of the president, and messages like, "how taxpayers' money is being spent here, how empty straw is being threshed here." And I even allow myself, I do not use harsh expressions, to quote one of them: it is opposition and senatorial filth," said the finance minister.
"These expressions were often used by the Nazis by citizens of Jewish origin, and by the communists by their political opponents. This is totalitarian rhetoric, without a shred of respect for people and opinion," TOP 09 deputy chairman Czernin, who will compete for the post of party chairman in the autumn with the current first deputy chairman, Markéta pekarová adamová, wrote to the minister.
"I quoted one of the many reports that I received dozens of during the proceedings of the house. Their common denominator was the disgust at the constant personal dehonestations that we witness daily in domestic politics, and which was also the main motive for Thursday's session of the house. The fact that someone applies the term to themselves surprises me, " Schillerová responded for čtk.
The driver crashed his car into a tree and died.
The body had to be cut from the wreckage by firefighters
The tragic accident happened around 23. clock at neveklov on a narrow district leading from the Slapské dam.
The driver apparently flew at considerable speed down into the forest and smashed the car against a tree.
He died on the spot.
The body had to be rescued from the wreckage by firefighters, among other things, they cut off the roof.
The circumstances of the crash are being investigated by police.
They ordered a forensic autopsy, which should, among other things, clarify whether the man did not drive under the influence of alcohol or another addictive substance.
No more wasting and spewing one collection after another.
Pietro Filipi cancels discounts and bets on sustainability
The Czech clothing brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and is embarking on a fundamental change of strategy.
He cancels discounts and no longer wants to churn out one collection after another.
The fact that the fashion industry is among the largest polluters of the environment is not news.
Billions of pieces of clothing end up in incinerators and landfills every year.
But the view of slow fashion, the often despised approach to dressing, has been changing quite rapidly over the past few years.
Approximately half of the goods Pietro Filipi sold at full price.
The other half, which was sold due to discounts, is not so easy to buy.
The company does not want to churn out one collection after another and at the end of each season the products are discounted below their production price.
In addition, according to the owner Michal mička, the Times of new and old collections and blind following of rapidly changing fashion trends are over.
"Most discount retailers are already counting on the purchase of goods, so a much higher margin is included in the full price.
It is actually a bit of a scam, " says Michal mička, owner of Pietro Filipi.
In addition, with its approach, the company also wants to support local business.
"Each of our products is made from carefully selected quality fabrics and designed by local designers.
We emphasize that a large part of our collection is made up of so - called basic pieces-i.e. clothing that is timeless and over-the-season.
Worldwide, the segment of premium brands is typical of the absence of any discounts, the price of the product simply corresponds to its quality and the discount is not needed, " adds mička.
Giant graffiti representing RAF airman Kurt Taussig
"The assignment was to create something for the anniversary of the end of the war.
And I remembered our fighter pilot who fought in the ranks of the British Royal Air Force in the Second World War.
The city administration liked the design, " said Vacek, who completed his work after fourteen days of intensive work.
He consumed about 300 liters of paint and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplice-šanov.
He left town when he was 15.
During the war, because of his Jewish origin, the Nazis dragged him to an internment camp, where he was held for several weeks.
However, he and his brother managed to avoid the concentration camp thanks to the organization of Nicholas Winton.
In 1939, Taussig arrived in the United Kingdom, where he volunteered to join the Royal Air Force (RAF), and subsequently underwent pilot training in Southern Rhodesia and Palestine.
He joined the combat operations in early 1945.
After the velvet revolution, he visited Czech Republic several times and his native Teplice, which granted him honorary citizenship.
The 46-year-old Kamil Vacek, whom people in the field of street graphic art know by the nickname camo, has been working with spray paint in Teplice's streets for over 20 years.
He started with graffiti on the areas that were set aside for these purposes by the then mayor Jaroslav Kubera (ODS).
Sparta is really busy this year, acknowledges hradecký bek Nedomlel
In his case, increased motivation is more than understandable. Hradec hockey defenseman Richard nedomlel will go in Friday's game against the club where he recently worked. However, the former Spartans player is convinced that his teammates will be in a similar situation, even though they have never worn the Prague club jersey.
"Against Sparta, everyone wants to pull out," says Hradecky Bek before Game 5. an extra-League round.
Hradec Králové will try to stretch its winning streak, which currently counts three three-point wins in a row. After Kladno, Pilsen came on Sunday the fans most appreciated, Mountfield went to neighboring Pardubice.
"But we can not watch the matches that were. We need to focus on the matches that are ahead of us now, and play in them the same, if not better, " warns the Hradec Kralove defender.
Hradec Králové should not look back on last year's record with Sparta. In three of the four matches they lost, they took points only once after winning in Prague after overtime. In addition, the leadership of Sparta in the summer brought several significant reinforcements and expects the team to return to the top.
"Sparta has always had quality players, but what we will talk about, this year they are really charged," admits nedomlel before the first match of the end of this week.
And the other one? Also a nice shift, waiting for Mountfield on Sunday afternoon in Trinity.
Xxx Lutz can buy competitor Kika, authorized authority. But there's a catch.
"The office for the protection of competition has authorised the merger of competitors - xlcee-Holding GmbH, on the one hand, and Kika Nábytek and lambda properties Czechia, on the other hand, subject to compliance with the structural obligations set out in favour of maintaining effective competition," said Martin švanda, a spokesman for ÚOHS.
In addition to the XXX Lutz chain, xlcee-Holding owns Möbelix stores. If the Kika chain were swallowed up, it would occupy too large a part of the Czech furniture and accessories market. Therefore, he has to divest part of the company being bought.
Xlcee-holding also buys Kika's branches in other countries where the chain operates, i.e. Hungary, Slovakia and Romania. Even there, the transaction must be authorized by the antimonopoly authorities. The purchase of 22 foreign branches of the Kika chain from the Signa Holding was announced by XXX lutz in May. Signa took over the failing Kika last year for a symbolic price.
The Kika chain entered the Czech market in 2005 and is the second after the Swedish company IKEA. Before it was taken over by the Austrian company Signa, it had been owned since 2013 by the South African firm Steinhoff International Holdings. The latter faced problems when it discovered irregularities in its accounts. Kika has nine stores in the Czech Republic.
Xxx Lutz has been operating in the Czech Republic since 2010. In addition to IKEA, Sconto, JYSK, Asko-nábytek and Kika, it is one of the largest sellers of furniture on the domestic market. The same owner has the brand möbelix. After taking over Kika's foreign offices, XXX Lutz will already operate over 300 stores in 12 countries. According to the company's website, its annual turnover is EUR 4.4 billion (about CZK 114 billion).
Storm Hanna has arrived on the coast of Texas
Hurricane Hanna on Saturday afternoon local time (before midnight CEST on the night of today) arrived on the southwestern coast of the US state of Texas.
It struck the Texas island of Padre Island, about 24 kilometers north of the town of Port Mansfield, and weakened to a tropical storm as it moved over land.
However, according to meteorologists, it nevertheless poses a great danger to the inhabitants of coastal areas.
It brought with it strong winds and intense rainfall; along with local flooding, according to the AP agency, there are reports of power outages and various material damage, including damaged ships.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott already on Saturday for 32 counties in southwest Texas declared a state of natural disaster and advised people to voluntarily evacuate.
The strongest warnings were given to people from the coastal strip between Port Mansfield and Mesquite Bay, but the element is expected to hit an area of almost 500 kilometers before gradually moving over northeastern Mexico.
"Although Hanna is now a tropical storm, heavy rain and wind, surface highs, dangerous surf and isolated tornadoes can pose a threat," the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) warned.
This morning local time (afternoon CEST), the storm moved in the area of the US-Mexican border and was accompanied by winds of 85 kilometers per hour.
On Saturday, Hanna became the first hurricane of this year's hurricane season in the Atlantic region.
Over the Gulf of Mexico, it was accompanied by winds of up to 145 kilometers per hour, but the latter gradually weakened to 112 kilometers per hour as it approached the mainland, which again knocked Hanna out of the category of hurricanes.
The authorities urged local residents to wait out the storm at home, while not forgetting the hygiene measures associated with the prevention of the spread of coronavirus.
Texas is among those U.S. states that the covid-19 disease pandemic plagues the most.
Due to the existing security measures and the need to observe the distances, possible evacuations are also a great challenge.
Temporary shelters were opened in hotels, schools and gymnasiums.
In Hidalgo County, Texas, one of the buildings was also adapted as a shelter for evacuees who tested positive for coronavirus or were otherwise exposed to the disease.
Local authorities called on all evacuees to take masks and disinfectant gels with them to the shelter, if possible.
"We're not nearly there yet.
We expect catastrophic flooding," AP quoted Chris Birchfield, who works for the National Weather Service (NWS) service in the city of Brownsville.
Forecasts say that in some places, up to 300 millimetres of rain could fall in a few hours, in some cases almost 500 millimetres, which, together with rising sea levels, could flood a number of coastal settlements.
Toyota hydrogen still confident, preparing the second generation of the Mirai car
The Toyota Mirai was never supposed to be just a concept. Toyota took it so seriously that even if there was practically no hydrogen refueling infrastructure in the world, it nevertheless put it on the menu. So not quite standard, the customer had to really purposefully go after this car, but no one else then offered such a variant.
Toyota chief Takeshi Uchiyamada confirmed at the international hydrogen conference that a new generation will arrive next year. Toyota still believes that these cars have a future and within ten years they will be on a par with hybrids. Of course, this is due to the development of pumping networks. But the future is as much about hydrogen as it is about electricity.
At the conference, the word hydrogen was often associated with the need for environmentally friendly operation not of passenger cars, but, on the contrary, of large tractors, ships, trains, etc., simply those means of transport that need to overcome long distances for one refueling. This purely battery versions can not offer. Toyota could thus, thanks to great experience and long development, find new outlets.
It remains to be recalled that, like Toyota, they believe in hydrogen propulsion, and Hyundai, which now also offers a hydrogen crossover Nexo.

Zeman bestows the general rank of Colonel Lipko
On Wednesday, President Miloš Zeman will bestow the general rank on colonel Pavel Lipko.
This follows from the review of the expected events of the Ministry of defense.
The reason for granting the rank of brigadier general is the August arrival of Lipka at the post of deputy commander of the NATO multinational division north-east in Poland.
Lipka still serves as deputy commander of the ground forces of the Czech army.
The promotion to Zeman at the end of June was proposed by the government.
From the beginning of August, Lipka will replace brigadier general Karel řehka as deputy commander of the multinational north-east division in Elblag, Poland, which commands the Allied advance presence in Poland and the Baltic states.
In March, řehka became director of the national cyber and information security bureau (nukib).
The government proposed to the president that Lipko be given the rank of brigadier general.
According to the law on professional soldiers, a higher rank can be granted to a soldier for the duration of the performance of an elected function or for the duration of the performance of a service task that requires the granting of a higher rank.
The post of deputy commander of the alliance division corresponds to the rank of general.
The soldier to whom the rank was bestowed has the same rights and duties as if he were appointed to this rank.
However, he is not entitled to a salary adjustment corresponding to the rank.
The conferment of the rank shall continue until the reason for which it was granted ceases to exist.
"Colonel Lipka demonstrates high professional readiness and is a role model for subordinates.
It takes a significant part in fulfilling the tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic, including cooperation with foreign partners and ensuring the participation of the army in foreign operations, " the Ministry of Defense said in June on the proposal for promotion.
Wednesday's promotion will take place at 12: 30 at Prague Castle, attended by Defense Minister Lubomir Metnar and chief of the general staff Aleš Opata.
Technically perfect confusion with a weak scenario. Gemini with Will Smith did not thunder criticism
The dystopian science fiction spectacle Gemini (Gemini man) boasts an interesting premise - Will Smith confronts his younger version in the film. But, according to critics, the story is the weakest part of the film. The film will be released in Czech cinemas 10. October.
Henry Brogan (Will Smith) is the absolute leader in his field. It kills efficiently and without unnecessary questions. But one day he decides to hang his career on the nail. This, of course, does not like his employers, who will send another killer to Henry. The catch is that the killer is Henry himself, more precisely, his younger clone created from DNA. Can one determined man win a fight against himself? This time, literally.
A certain guarantee of quality was to be three-time Oscar winner Ang Lee. Although this is his first science fiction, he has a wealth of experience with dramatic action films, as demonstrated, for example, in the above-mentioned Tiger and dragon or the Western Ride with the devil. Six screenwriters worked on the script at once. The most famous is certainly David Benioff, one of the creators of the highly successful game of Thrones. According to early reviews, even this was not enough for a good film.
"Even though Ang Lee is trying great things in technical filmmaking, the film itself doesn't have enough character to make it stand out," thinks Fionnuala Hannigan of Screen Daily.
"This disappointing film is less than the sum of all the talents that participated in it. A weak script and plot are held together only by the technological magic of filmmakers," summed up Stephen Dalton of the Hollywood Reporter magazine.
"Gemini is a case in which a huge amount of work has resulted in an incredibly unified action movie," Variety reviewer Peter Deburge does not hide his disappointment.
"A confused product that came up with a bizarre idea," Ella Kemp of IndieWire summed up the film in her review.
"It's hard to care about one man being a doppelganger of another when neither man behaves like a human being," wrote Nicholas Barber of the web site The Wrap.

Hundreds of enslaved children freed from religious school in Nigeria
According to the BBC, there were almost five hundred men and boys, Reuters, citing the police commissioner, reported that there were over three hundred children from five years above. Some were chained together, others were chained to iron rings in the wall.
Kaduna police chief Ali Janga told the BBC that the raid on the school was carried out on the basis of denunciations. He called the school a house of horrors. Starving people were held there by force, tortured and sexually abused. They couldn't leave, there was razor wire above the walls. According to him, this is a case of slavery.
Several people were arrested during the raid, according to police spokesman jakubu Sabo, they were local teachers.
The children told the police that they were taken to the school by their parents or relatives, saying that it was a religious school. "We have identified two children who come from Burkina Faso, but most were brought here by parents from Nigerian states in the North," said spokesman Sabo to the identity of the victims. Nigerian states in the north of the country are predominantly Muslim.
The school of Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal pretended to be a religious school focused on the study of the Koran.
The liberated were taken to the stadium, where they are provided with help and food. Some have already met with relatives.
The fastest man on the planet missed the tests. I'm not taking anything.
The traditionally high-profile fight for the fastest man on the planet will be on the world championships in a hurry to the silver defender Christian Coleman. The 23-year-old American is the leader of the world charts with a time of 9.81 seconds and has lost only once this year. However, his start at the top of the season was jeopardized due to a case with missed doping tests.
The US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) closed his case in early September without filing charges due to formal reasons. Coleman did not pass three doping tests last year and this year, but not in 12 months. His first offense, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) dated back to 1. April 2018, that is, to the beginning of the second quarter, however, the test itself missed up to 6. June. And because the third omission occurred on the 29th. on April 20, 2019, Coleman did not commit a misdemeanor in the form of three failed inspections within 12 months.
Coleman argued that he only forgot to update the data in the application about the whereabouts of athletes. "I don't do drugs, I don't do anything legal. A lot of athletes take legal creatine or protein powder or various other supplements for faster recovery. And I don't take anything, I work hard and that's what it's about, " he said before the start of the World Cup.
The only defeat from six starts this year on the hundred was suffered right at the start of the season at the Diamond League in Shanghai, where he was only six thousandths of a second ahead of compatriot Noah Lyles. He took advantage of Coleman's absence to triumph in the Diamond League final, but will only run a double hundred at the World Cup.
On paper, the second fastest competitor with a performance of 9.86 is 22-year-old Nigerian Divine Oduduru, who has so far succeeded only in American university competitions.
Defending the title will be the thirty-seven-year-old American Justin Gatlin, who in June at Stanford flashed with a time of 9.87. He ran the last 100 in Zagreb but only in 10.29 because he slightly injured his back thigh muscle.
The favorites also include South African Akani Simbine, three-time Olympic medalist from Rio Andre De Grasse or European champion Zharnel Hughes. The fastest Jamaican is the 2011 world champion Yohan Blake with a time of 9.96.
The men's 100 starts on Friday with the preliminaries and heats. Semi-finals and finals are on the agenda on Saturday. The medals will be competed at 21: 15 CEST.
EU countries have coronavirus standards for aviation
European Union countries have agreed on common sanitary standards for air travel to help limit the spread of the new coronavirus.
This was announced by German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer.
Among the agreed standards is the observance of distance or wearing of veils on the plane and at the airport, but the middle seats in airplanes will not have to remain unoccupied.
This was reported by Reuters.
"I am glad that my colleagues accepted the German proposal for Europe and that we were able to agree on these uniform standards," Scheuer said at the European aviation conference.
The German transport ministry then added that the agreement had been concluded by officials and that it still had to be formally approved by ministers.
The agreed measures include the requirement to cover the mouth and nose for passengers from the age of six, to observe the recommended distance during security checks and check-in at the airport.
There must also be sufficient fresh air on the aircraft and all information must be available in several languages.
The airlines will also be able to occupy the middle seats.
The common rules that officials have agreed on Meet at least some of the requirements of airlines.
The different standards caused confusion.

The soldiers are rehearsing, draw the curtains. China is preparing celebrations at the site of the massacre
The army has been rehearsing the parade over recent weekends. Shops in the center of Beijing had to close, and residents near the square were ordered to close the curtains. On the empty streets, military vehicles rolled towards the square, and warplanes circled in the sky.
Several Chinese told Reuters they were proud of their country's military prowess. But one woman said that it was hard to deny that the celebrations would upset other countries.
Apparently, she was referring to Taiwan, which China claims and where elections are approaching. But they may also have concerns in the semi-autonomous city of Hong Kong, where thousands of people have repeatedly demonstrated against the Chinese-appointed administrator.
Celebrations are also being prepared outside Beijing. The South China Sea port of Xiamen has already shown a special light show on Thursday night. Located opposite the island of Taiwan, Xiamen is one of China's ten most innovative cities.
Before the anniversary, the list of prohibited things is growing. Already on it are drones, balloons, kites, alcohol, walkie-talkies and devices using radio waves, the Guardian newspaper pointed out. He added that the popular Chinese social network Weibo erases"harmful political information."
"This is another milestone, another opportunity to show that the Chinese Communist Party remains (at the OAR) despite all the predictions," said historian Maura Cunningham, who studies China. "This is a moment when the party can demonstrate order, control and power," she added.
The people's Republic of China was formed in 1949, when the communists under the leadership of Mao Zedong won in the struggle with the Chiang Kai-shek nationalists, who retreated to Taiwan.
In the second half of 60. for years, China underwent a disastrous communist experiment in the form of a so-called cultural revolution. In June 1989, the Tiananmen Square regime massacred thousands of pro-democracy protesters, both students and workers, with tanks.
Since the late 70's. for years, China has increasingly taken over the elements of the capitalist economy. According to critics, it is now a mixture of the worst of communism (the monopoly of one party and the persecution of the opposition) and (Dickensian) capitalism (the exploitation of workers).

Trump Considers Canceling the registration of Chinese shares in the US
The administration of US President Donald Trump is considering revoking permission for Chinese companies to trade on the stock markets in the United States. An informed source told Reuters today. Such a move would be a radical escalation of trade tensions between the US and China. The shares of the companies concerned on the New York Stock Exchange immediately headed down after the news, pulling the entire market with it.
The stock withdrawal would be part of a broader effort to curb U.S. investment in China, the source added. Thus, he confirmed the report of Bloomberg, which shortly before caused a shock in the financial markets. Shares of Chinese companies Alibaba Group Holding, JD.com, Pinduoduo, Baidu, Vipshop Holdings, Baozun and iQiyi lost from two to four percent.
According to government data from February, shares of 156 Chinese companies are traded on the US Nasdaq and NYSE exchanges. There are also at least 11 state-owned enterprises among them.
Bloomberg noted that the exact mechanism that would ensure the withdrawal of shares of Chinese companies from US exchanges has not yet been worked out. Any plan would have to be approved by Trump, who gave the green light to negotiations on the matter.
China and the US have been engaged in a trade war for more than a year, in which they impose tariffs on each other. The dispute between the two countries has negative consequences for the world economy and raises fears of a recession in the global economy. Washington is using Tariffs to try to force Beijing to change its trade practices and reduce China's trade surplus with the US.
According to CNBC television, trade negotiations between the US and China are expected to resume 10. October. His goal is to end the trade war.
Former French President Chirac will be buried on Monday, public pieta will be on Sunday
The funeral of former French president Jacques Chirac, who died on Thursday at the age of 86, will take place on Monday evening at the Montparnasse cemetery in Paris. This is reported by the French media with reference to Chirac's family. The ceremony will be private.
The public will be able to say goodbye to the former head of state on Sunday afternoon at a piety in the Paris Invalides, where the coffin with Chirac's remains will be exhibited, the Elysee Palace announced.
Crowds of people have been streaming into the presidential residence since Thursday evening to sign a condolence book, according to AFP. This will be possible until Sunday. On Monday, then President Emmanuel Macron declared state mourning.
Meanwhile, other reactions are coming from the world and from France to the deaths of the former mayor of Paris and president from 1995 to 2007, whom Prime Minister Édouard Philippe today called "a Frenchman in the truest sense of the word".
Chirac was remembered, for example, by the Japanese, as the politician was known for his love of their country and the sport of sumo. The news of the death of the former French president appeared on the front pages of all Japanese newspapers, including sports ones, the French press notes.
The Museum of tribal art on the Quai Branly Avenue in Paris, which Chirac founded, will not charge admission for ten days in honor of the former head of state.
In the Arctic Spitsbergen fell temperature record, measured there almost 22 degrees
"A 41-year-old record has fallen in Longyearbyen," the Norwegian Meteorological Institute said on Twitter.
On the eve of the temperature there rose to 21.7 degrees Celsius, breaking the record of 1979 by 0.4 degrees, he added.
About two thousand Longyearbyen is the largest city in Spitsbergen, located about 1300 kilometers from the north pole.
Spitsbergen heats up faster than almost any other place on earth.
This fact highlights the dangers arising from the warming of other parts of the Arctic - from Alaska to Siberia, according to a report last year by the Norwegian Center for climate studies.
According to him, the average temperature in Spitsbergen has risen from 70. flight 20. century by three to five degrees.
By 2100, it can rise even by ten degrees, if the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere is not reduced.
The increase in temperature can lead to the melting of permanently frozen soil in Svalbard, which threatens the stability of many buildings, roads or airports, and can cause more avalanches and landslides.
The warming of the climate also threatens Arctic fauna, such as polar bears or seals, which depend on the ice cover of the ocean.
Failed qualification. Czech athletes are not doing well in Doha
The world championships in Doha began with qualifying failures for Czech athletics. Diana mezuliáníková was eliminated in the 800 metres and neither Rod player Romana maláčová nor hammer thrower Kateřina šafránková, who defended her eighth place in London last year, qualified.
The race on Friday will be completed by the hurdler Vít Müller and the night marathon race will be run by Marcela joglová.
Šafránková threw 65.46 meters on the third attempt and fell almost six meters behind her maximum this year, which she would have to improve to advance. Maláčová jumped 435 CM, 450 CM was already beyond her strength. To participate in the final it was necessary to overcome the limit of 460 CM.
Mezuliáníková, who got to the championship only at the last minute thanks to an invitation from the international federation IAAF, finished in the fourth run on the penultimate sixth place and even the time of 2:03.48 minutes was not enough for her to advance to the semifinals. She was one and a half seconds behind this year's maximum. "It was quite fast for me, unfortunately I was in a fight with my opponent in the corner, which took a lot of energy out of me. I thought I still had the strength, but it slowed me down there. I almost stopped and had to start running again, so that was a little awkward. I can't be completely satisfied, " said the Czech representative.
She was glad that in the finish line she overtook at least one rival. "She really wasn't doing well, so every opponent she beat was good. But I think it was for the fifth place. Unfortunately, " she added. The fastest halfback in the heats was Winnie nanyond from Uganda in 2:00.36.
In Doha, the best eight-hundredth runner of recent years, Caster Semenya, is missing from the spring, who has too high a level of testosterone in her body, but, like some other runners, she refuses the treatment that has been prescribed by the rules of the IAAF since this year.
In the heats of the 100 meters confirmed the role of the number one favorite American Christian Coleman, who with a time of 9.98 was the only one below the limit of ten seconds. His compatriot Justin Gatlin, who is aiming to defend his title at the age of 37, also advanced to the semi-finals. The Nigerian Divine Oduduru, who is the number two in this year's charts with a performance of 9.86, did not start and was expected to compete with Coleman, who has a 9.81 this season.
Cuban Juan Miguel Echevarría showed great form already in the qualification of distance runners, who reached the distance of 840 cm with the first jump. No athlete has made it this far in World Cup qualifying in the last 20 years. The 21-year-old Cuban leads this year's table by 865 CM.
Berlin responds to public pressure and solves the housing crisis. From a private company will buy 6000 apartments
Berlin will buy 6,000 former social housing units sold by the city 15 years ago for 920 million euros ($23.8 billion) from the private Luxembourg company ADO Properties SA. It responds to public pressure to rebel against skyrocketing rental prices. According to Berlin senator Katrin lompscher for the party of the left (Die Linke), this is the largest such buyout in the history of the German capital. The opposition criticizes the move.
"The intention is to keep rents stable in Berlin and give tenants certainty," Berlin mayor Michael Müller (SPD) said in a statement. "At the same time, we will continue the construction of new apartments and legally treat the freezing of leases," he added. The municipal company gewobag will take over the thousands of apartments located in the districts of Spandau and Reinickendorf in the western part of the city this December.
According to Jefferies analyst Thomas rothäusler, the city bought too expensive. Bloomberg rothäusler said that, according to his estimate, housing units overpaid by about ten percent above their book value.
According to the German opposition party, the Liberals (FDP), the Berlin authorities are contributing to real estate speculation through their actions. The FDP said this on Twitter on Friday. The protest party Alternative for Germany (AfD) called the move a "waste of money".
Already in mid-July, gewobag acquired back 670 apartments in Berlin's Karl-Marx-Allee street, the weekly Der Spiegel reminded on its website. The price was not published at the time by the prosecutor's office. The dispute over apartments on the former exhibition Avenue from the Times of the GDR was accompanied by protests and filled the front pages of the German press. He became a symbol of the plight of tenants in large German cities, wrote the newspaper.
At the same time, the German metropolis used to be famous for its low cost of living and low rents. In recent years, however, it has gained in attractiveness. According to AFP, rental prices have doubled in the past ten years, making it difficult for some residents to find affordable housing.
The British, who will return from Spain, waiting for a mandatory two-week quarantine
The British cabinet also urged citizens to avoid all non-essential travel to mainland Spain due to the risk of spreading covid-19.
The Canary and Balearic islands are therefore not mentioned, however, even after returning from them, people have to be isolated for two weeks.
The new rules come into force at midnight.
"Protecting public health is our absolute priority.
We took this decision to prevent the possible spread of the virus in Britain, " British diplomacy said in a statement.
"We have always made it clear that if necessary, we will immediately remove a country from the list of safe ones," she added.
As noted by the British newspaper Metro, the latest announcement will hit the travel plans of thousands of Britons.
Spain is a very popular holiday destination.
Among other things, Britons are concerned about whether they will be paid sick leave if they have to end up in isolation for 14 days after returning from holidays.
For example, Neil Hunter from Sittingbourne booked a ten-day holiday to Lanzarote, they were supposed to leave on Tuesday.
The tour has been booked since December.
"We were supposed to go the whole family, my wife Amanda and daughter Bethany, but to be honest, after this announcement I do not know what will happen.
I work as a train driver and I do not think that my employer will accept that I will be quarantined for two weeks after returning from vacation, " the Metro newspaper quoted Hunter as saying.
With regard to Spain, there are fears that the country is at the beginning of the second wave of the epidemic.
Over the past two days, there have been over 900 new infections every 24 hours.
Authorities in some areas are already tightening coronavirus measures, for example, Catalonia is trying to limit all nightlife to prevent people from gathering in large numbers.
The Czech Ministry of foreign affairs has recently warned of an increased risk of infection in Catalonia, Aragon, the Basque country and the Madrid region.
Czechs or children are not allowed to enter. COI reveals discrimination in restaurants
These included, for example, erroneous information about prices and non-compliance with the principles of fair sales.
In one case of discrimination, a restaurant in Prague refuses to let smaller children into the business. On its website, according to COI writes that the device is not suitable for children under the age of eight years. "To the consumer's electronic query as to whether it is possible to order a table for four adults and one child aged four in the restaurant, the restaurant employee replied electronically that they do not accept the presence of children under the age of eight in the restaurant," Fröhlich added.
In the second case, another Prague company did not want to let Czech-speaking people come to the table, while it allowed English-speaking people to do so. "Czech-speaking inspectors, in their capacity as consumers, were not allowed to sit down at a table in the restaurant and make an order. English-speaking consumers were allowed to do this, " a spokesperson for the COI described the situation.
Both cases are now being dealt with in administrative proceedings. Since they are not yet legally terminated, the spokesman of the inspection could not give more detailed information on the said restaurants.
However, discrimination occurred only in a very small proportion of the restaurants inspected in the second quarter. A total of 139 inspections were carried out by the CAI. In addition to the two cases of discrimination, it found other irregularities in 64 cases. Most of these were shortcomings in compliance with the principles of fair sales and failure to inform the consumer about the prices of products and services in accordance with the regulations.
Already on Wednesday, the inspection reported cases of discrimination against foreigners in two Prague restaurants, Clock Caffé and café restaurant. In both establishments, foreigners were charged higher amounts than Czech-speaking clients. In these cases, the final fines of 60 000 crowns have already fallen.
The Model of electricity purchase from Dukovany will be discussed by the government
On Monday, the government will discuss a model for the purchase of electricity from the planned new block of the Dukovany nuclear power plant.
The bill provides that in the event that the purchase price will be higher than the price of power electricity on the market, the difference will be paid by all consumers through tariffs.
In the latter case, when the purchase price will be lower than the market price, the impact on consumers will be the opposite.
Power electricity is an unregulated part of the final price of electricity for customers.
Deputy prime minister and minister of industry Karel Havlíček (for yes) and energy company CEZ have previously stated that a more likely option is that people will save on electricity thanks to the construction.
On the contrary, analysts point out that the long-term outlook for electricity prices in the markets is always uncertain, which has been shown several times in the past.
The plan has previously been criticized by environmental organizations.
"The purchase price can be both below the market price of power electricity, and above it.
Thus, the final impact at the time of application of the rule can be both negative and positive.
The impact will be distributed among customers according to the size of the circuit breaker - with lower consumption or according to electricity consumption - with higher electricity consumption," the Ministry of industry and trade (MPO) said in the materials.
Havlíček said in May that he expects the wholesale price of electricity to rise and people will make money on the Dukovan construction site.
Otherwise, the impact will be in the tens of crowns per year per family, which, according to him, is far less than people annually pay in electricity bills to support the so-called supported resources.
He has previously estimated that the purchase price could range between 50 to 60 euros (about 1320 to 1600 USD) per megawatt-hour (MWh).
The submitted material does not contain any proposal for the amount, it should be included only in the purchase agreement.
The price of electricity on the Prague power exchange for 2021, for which traders now have the most supplies, is currently around 45 euros (about 1190 CZK) per MWh.
"With the difference between the purchase price and the market price of power electricity of ten euros, the supplement of an average household with consumption of 3.3 MWh per year could correspond to a household of four, equipped with standard electrical appliances, including an electric hob and oven, but which does not use electricity for heating and hot water - less than 100 CZK/year," the MPO wrote in the documents for the government.
"We live in an extremely turbulent time.
The coronavirus pandemic has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term prediction of market prices to be a purely speculative matter," Tomáš voltr, executive director of the energy financial group, told CTK.
The proposed law envisages that the purchase would be carried out by the MPO, or a legal entity authorized by it, owned by the state at a predetermined price.
The contract between the investor and the state, guaranteeing the conditions for the purchase of electricity, would be concluded for at least 30 years, with a possible extension of ten years, even repeated, but no longer until the end of the operation of low-carbon production.
The proposal defines a low-carbon generation plant as an electricity generating station with a nuclear reactor connected to the electricity grid with an installed capacity of at least 100 megawatts (MW) after 2030.
Havlíček previously stated that the new dukovanský Blok should have a capacity of 1200 MW and produce nine terawatt-hours of electricity per year, which would correspond to a tenth of the expected Czech consumption.
The block should be put into operation in 2036.
The financing model for the new Dukovany block was approved by the government on Monday.
The facility should be financed by the state during construction without interest, for operation it is calculated with 2% interest.
The opposition disagrees with the financing model, and is also concerned about the possibility of Russian or Chinese companies building Dukovany.
The state should participate in the construction of 70 percent.
The rest should be paid by čez, which will also cover any additional costs.
CEZ CEO Daniel Beneš told CTK in May that the expected amount for the construction of the block at current prices is about six billion euros (approximately 162 billion crowns).
Contracts between the state and CEZ on the construction of the new dukovanské block will be signed on Tuesday.
In the underground mine Čsa in Karviná burned, no one was injured
There was a fire in the čsa underground mine in Karviná this morning. The cause of the fire is not yet known. However, no one was injured, Ivo čelechovský, a spokesman for the mining company, told čtk.
The fire broke out at 04: 25 in poruba at a depth of about 1200 meters. "None of the employees were hurt, no one was injured. Banská Bystrica rescuers immediately intervened on the spot, who destroyed the fire by direct intervention and also carried out an examination of the terrain. The workplace was immediately closed and inaccessible, " the spokesman said. The exact cause of the fire will now be determined by a special commission.
In the former Ostrava-Karviná area, coal is already mined only in the Karviná part, namely in the mines čsa, lazy, Darkov, čsm-sever and čsm-jih. In the Lazy mine, mining should end this year, a gradual decline is also waiting for other mines. OKD mining company is the only producer of hard coal in the Czech Republic, its production last year amounted to 4.62 million tons. 9,000 people work in the mines.
The Brno grand prix? There is a risk of increasing the price of tickets
The most expensive item is annually before the grand prix forlisting fee. This year was about one hundred and fifteen million. "The mass of people who come to Brno during the grand prix will spend money on accommodation, food or entertainment, which should more or less balance the costs associated with organizing the event, including the registration fee," said economist Petr Pelc.
According to him, the importance of the plant is also in attracting tourists to the city. "Brno does not have so many world tourist attractions. A great price there attracts visitors even from abroad. It is as important for Brno as, for example, the Turan airport or the exhibition centre. And these are projects that are supported by public money, " the economist added.
Grand Prix in Brno
- costs for the past five years: CZK 686 million
- profits from the past five years: CZK 682 million
- problem: lack of money for organizing, increasing registration fee for the promoter company Dorna
- possible solutions: more money from the state, use of advertising space, increase in ticket prices
- current status: negotiations on a new contract for the next five years
According to the director of the Institute of public administration Filip hrůza, the organizers now have to evaluate whether the race is advantageous for Brno. "The grand prix is sucking money out of public budgets for other things. To some extent, however, it is a political and not an economic issue, " he thinks.
In the future, the cost of a motor event may be even higher. In the game there is a variant of increasing the landing fee almost twice.
"The situation is not closed, we must try to negotiate the best possible terms with Dorna. It also depends on how much the state is ready to contribute to the organization of the race. If the worst-case scenarios come true, I am afraid that it is not realistic for the city and the region to pay the amount, " admitted the mayor of Brno, Markéta vaňková.
As the daily rovnost has already reported, representatives of the South Moravian region and Brno are also discussing the possibility of using advertising due to difficulties in raising money for the grand prix. "The condition of Dorny is that advertising must be placed in places that do not occupy cameras. The choice of companies is also limited, because if Dorna has a general sponsor, then a company from the same area cannot be the second sponsor, " explained vaňková.
The organizers can also get more money from tickets in the following years. "We need to sit down and say what the costs actually will be. And we have to adjust the revaluation of tickets to this, " said Petr vokřál, an opposition representative for the ANO movement and former mayor of Brno.
The Ministry of Regional Development withdrew the material on the promotion of tourism in the media for two billion
The material, according to which the Ministry of regional development (MMR) planned to spend two billion crowns in the media, on the internet and billboards for advertising on holidays in the Czech Republic, the office withdrew from the comment procedure.
Minister Klára Dostálová (for Yes) of the server SeznamZprávy.cz she said the material was still being worked on.
The document in eklep (Electronic Library of the legislative process) was brought to the attention of the server on Friday Zdopravy.cz.
The ministry justified the plan by the decline in tourism due to coronavirus.
During the coronavirus crisis, the media also experienced a decline in income.
The proposal provoked criticism from the opposition and representatives of the tourism industry.
According to the proposal, which is now available on the site hlidacstatu.cz, MMR planned to give money through the state agency for the promotion of tourism CzechTourism for advertising on television, radio, the press, on the internet, billboards or areas at railway stations.
The biggest part of the money, 700 million crowns, would be given to television.
Most would be acquired by private television Nova and prima.
Printed newspapers and weeklies would receive 400 million, and the same share would be given to MMR for PR articles, advertising banners and videos on websites.
Radio stations would receive 350 million for the media campaign, most of which would again be private stations.
The remaining 150 million would be used for outdoor advertising on billboards, LED screens and areas at stations or on the subway.
The campaign to promote tourism in the Czech Republic was supposed to start in mid-August and last for a year.
"The material is still being worked on, it is definitely not yet in the form that should be presented," dostálová said without further details to the seznamzvávy server.
The material was criticized by the opposition, according to the head of TOP 09, Markéta pekarová adamová, the media would benefit from the advertising from the trust funds of prime minister Andrej Babiš (ano).
"I firmly believe that this blatant contempt will get a blow between the eyes at the elections in the fall," she wrote on Twitter.
Dostalova denies that in fact it is about helping the media affected by the crisis.
"It can also be a coincidence, I do not know anything about media support," she told the newspaper N on Friday.
According to her, the budget of two billion is indicative.
"Of course, we are still counting it, it can be less or more.
It is working material, " she added.
The save tourism initiative does not make sense for a media campaign to promote domestic tourism.
"We want two billion for tourism companies, not an unnecessary advertising campaign," said Tomáš barčík, chairman of the initiative, on Sunday.
If the two billion crowns are in the state budget, they should go to companies, not the media, the initiative writes in an open letter to the government.
The end of political news? The new law, according to critics, will not help anyway!
However, according to some opposition members, the law is more likely to absolve ministers of responsibility for elections while continuing to select their candidates.
Greater transparency in the selection procedures for posts in state-owned companies-this is one of the goals of the nomination law. 119 members voted in favour. The law passed, for example, thanks to the votes of yes, the CPSU, Social Democrats and even pirates.
Candidates for state-owned companies will have to go through a selection procedure before a government committee. For example, it was the Pirates who sought to make the recommendation to the minister binding. That didn't work out in the end.
The Civic Democrats and the SPD movement fear that the nomination law will record ministers. "The minister will now be able to hide behind some commission decision and will therefore not have a clear, transparent responsibility," says SPD president Tomio Okamura. ODS vice-president Martin Kupka speaks in a similar way.
The government committee should completely reject candidates who do not meet the conditions. These will include criminal integrity, debt-free status, a minimum age of 25 years, and the main criterion for selection should also be expertise.
The bill will still have to pass the Senate, and then the president will receive it for signature.
Car tuning brought the voice of the digital soul
Everything you know about obesity is wrong, proclaims the title of a long text written for The Huffington Post by Michael Hobbes and photographed by Finlay Mackay. In a provocative afterthought, it then writes that the medical community ignored the facts about obesity for decades and waged a ruthless (and also unnecessary) war against people with excess weight, which not only scarred public opinion, but also destroyed many lives. However, now is the time for a new paradigm.
What Hobbes states at the outset is that from knowing and knowing the facts to putting them into practice often leads a very long and tiring journey. He mentions the case of scurvy, when some captains already in the seventeenth century distributed lemons, limes and oranges to their crew in the belief that this would prevent disease. However, the British Navy withdrew from this practice due to fears of increased costs. The clear effect of fruit in the prevention and treatment of the disease was then demonstrated in the mid-18th century. but it took another fifty years for the Navy to take it into account. Even seat belts existed long before the invention of the car, but they became mandatory only in the sixties, as well as the first confirmed deaths related to asbestos dates back to 1906, yet its first ban came in 1973.
"Every public health discovery - and no matter how significant it was - always had to compete with traditions, prejudices and financial incentives within the society into which it was to be implemented," writes Hobbes. In American society today, almost 80 percent of the adult population and about one-third of children meet the definition of overweight or obesity. More Americans today live with obesity than with breast cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and HIV combined.
At the same time, obesity is seen as a highly personal failure of the individual, which is said to burden the health sector and reduce GDP. The fear of fatness is so great in the population that Americans today spend more money on diets than they spend on computer games and movies. However, the truth is that diets do not work. As early as 1959, research showed that 95 to 98% of attempts to lose weight end in failure, and two-thirds of people on a diet subsequently gain more than they lost.
Armed with statistics, Hobbes further describes the lifestyle and traumas of overweight people. The personal meets the systemic, when, for example, at the faculties in the training of future doctors, he devotes only 19 hours from the entire study to nutrition. Which at the time 60 process calories that Americans receive come from ultra-processed food-that is, too processed food.
How obesity is stigmatized, in turn, is illustrated by reports from surgeries, where overweight people usually experience shorter check-ups, doctors approach them with less empathy and consider them more problematic patients.
However, overweight is far from just an American problem, as Hobbes writes, since 1980, the proportion of obesity in 73 countries of the world has doubled and increased in 113. And during that time, no country has managed to reduce and stop this increase. Absolutely none.
Simona krainová: fuck the age! Then she kissed Lucia white!
The day before the baptism of the calendar Fuck the age (translated by M*dat age) Simona krainova published her last photos, on which she is completely naked! "I was a little afraid of people judging me for taking naked photos at my age. I'm a pretty shy person. But so far I have only positive reactions. I wanted to show women that when you want to, you can have a solid figure at 46. Of course, there is toil and renunciation behind it, but there is no other way."
"With Lukáš Dvořák we took about three thousand photos, chose about a hundred and there are twelve of them in the calendar, so the rest are still waiting for their moment. It's definitely not the last time I'm naked, " the model, who also came to her christening very exposed, told The Flash.
She had an elongated jacket by Bernhardt and shorts underneath, but they were not visible, so it looked like she had forgotten the bottom. Daily jogging has strengthened her legs, so she can afford similar models.
Simona was so pleased with the success that she kissed at the baptism of everyone she met. Husband, friends, even The Nightingale Lucia the White.
Broth of life, cock of beers and death as a blade of grass
Posthumous is also the third album titled a death is a blade of grass by the Brno poet, tireless organizer of cultural activities and publisher Jaroslav Erik frič, who also left a year ago, 24. may.
It is the fifth entry in frič's discography and, like the previous titles, the main emphasis here is on frič's poetry, of which he himself is an excellent interpreter.
Frič, class of 1949, was of course influenced by the American beat generation, but he channeled this inspiration through his own personal experiences and also very intimate expressions of faith.
However, he was far away from any agitation, if he spoke or wrote about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, non-aggressive, absolutely tolerant.
I think in this context Bohuslav reynek (in contrast to Jan zahradníček), the Masters will forgive.
Frič's album offers recordings of author readings from 2006, as well as performances with musicians who have always accompanied him very sensitively, whether it was cellist Josef klič, or Honza bartoň and Vítězslav holata.
I will help myself-glad-in the words of the Ostrava poet Peter hruška about Frič's long poetic compositions.
"A proud and never-ending bitterness flowed from them," writes Hruska, " over the state of our world threatened with extinction.
A world that is sinking more and more into dull consumerist vanity and avarice is increasingly moving away from what its soul was made of - the mystery of faith, humility and human closeness.
They echoed the anguish of one who knows that the values for which he was created are of little interest, but who also knows that they cannot be renounced just because of general disinterest.
The poems were a reminder that a person may have to lose everything precious, but it is not unimportant how he will lose it.
If he sells himself out to a general decline, he resigns skeptically, shuts up fearfully, or remains until the last moment in a calm and proud insistence on what he believes and loves."

Paroubek is not my advisor, said Hamáček
Jiří paroubek, former prime minister and chairman of the ČSSD, is not a paid adviser to social democracy.
Party chairman and interior minister Jan Hamáček only communicates with him and reads his opinions and articles.
Hamáček said this today on the TV show prima partie.
On Friday, the server informed that Paroubek should be Hamáček's advisor SeznamZprávy.cz.
"From time to time we write a text message, he sometimes sends me some material and I will read it," Hamáček said today.
He added that, however, this is not an official and paid cooperation.
According to him, ČSSD does not have the means to waste them for similar purposes.
"The fact that I sometimes read his opinion, so there are a lot of such people," he said.
In a subsequent discussion with ODs member Jana černochová, the minister said that many ODS members were still "listening to the views of Václav Klaus".
According to him, this is fine, because he is an experienced politician and former party chairman, which is also the case of Paroubek.
The fact that the media is making an affair of it, he called a sign of this year's cucumber season.
Server SeznamZprávy.cz on Friday, he wrote that Paroubek fulfills the role of Hamáček's unofficial consultant.
He also wrote that the fourth place of the party's candidate in the Ústí region is headed by the former chairman of the local cell Petr Benda, who is associated with paroubek and served as deputy chairman of his party Lev 21.
Hamáček said today that he will not comment on the composition of the candidate until it is ready and approved.

Duplantis has a one-mile lead, it's a kick in the ass, laments Sweden's challenger
It is the 22-year-old American rodent who has the ambition and potential to belong to the most serious competitors of the new ruler.
He already knows what it's like to beat Duplantis, two years younger, last year at an NCAA college reunion.
"We had a battle the year before, then he won and I was second, then we switched.
In both cases it was a very good fight, " says Nilsen, who secured the victory with a power of 5.95 meters.
But Duplantis has shot up steeply since then, and is currently alone in the highest pole spheres.
In just twenty years he became the world record holder, this year 8. February in Torun broke the bar of 6.17 meters, a week later in Glasgow another centimeter added.
"He jumped six meters already at the age of 18, when he finished high school," recalls his peer Nilsen for the world athletics website.
"It was clear that as soon as he grew from a boy into a man, all his potential and talent would be tenfold.
Twenty years is a pretty good age to jump a world record, " he believes.
Although Nilsen's list of achievements is thinner than Duplantis', the American has similar goals.
He has so far indicated his options at the NCAA competitions, which he regularly won, this February he improved his personal indoor record to 5.93 m.last August he won a gold medal at the Pan American Games in Lima, already in 2017 he fought his way into the American team for the world championship, where he finished 13th.
The nearest milestone for him is to experience the Diamond League for the first time.
"It's definitely my priority to get on the professional circuit and race as much as possible in the Diamond League, because that's where you can make a name for yourself," he realizes.
"If you can succeed at this level, you can certainly do the same in events such as the Olympic Games, the world cup or the Pan American Games."
But because of the pandemic, these peak holidays are postponed, which gives Nilsen and the other rodent owners time to improve.
But will it be enough to catch up with Duplantis, who can easily turn the race under five circles into a mere duel for silver?
"Everyone is trying to catch up with him, but I don't think it will be possible any time soon," Nilsen reflects.
"The boy has been jumping for 16 years and in training he has a mile lead over everyone else."
And before Tokyo 2021 starts, he will want to increase it even more.
Scientists in their study are looking for toddlers with a congenital defect called valgosity of the ankles
Valgosity (displacement) of the ankles is a congenital defect that affects five to ten percent of children. As a rule, it is treated with intensive exercise. Scientists are trying to help these children even more, so they have developed special shoes that should significantly speed up the treatment.
"We have two prototypes of shoes that will be worn by both healthy children and children with a diagnosis, to map the effect in both groups. Participation in the research will not have any risks for children and the measurement will be completely painless, " explains Marta gimunová, head of research at the mu faculty of sports studies.
Parents of both groups of children can apply for the study through the website, where the registration form and all information is available.
Scientists are looking for fifty children with a diagnosis and fifty children healthy. Of each group, half will always wear medical shoes, and half will not.
"The moment when parents should sign their child is the moment when he starts to take the first independent steps, typically letting go of furniture, for example, which he clings to when trying to walk. Participation in the research involves three measurements within seven months of the child's first steps, each lasting about 20 minutes, half of the participants also include wearing the tested shoes," notes gimunová.
The opening of the pumpkin world delayed the ripening of pumpkins
Nová ves u leštiny (havlíčkobrodsko) - a farm in Nová ves u leštiny in havlíčkobrodsko has opened a pumpkin world for more than a month today. Decorated with thousands of freshly harvested pumpkins, the garden is dominated by massive orange pyramids. The autumn event, which is becoming a tradition, this year begins a week later, because the pumpkins on the surrounding seven hectares of fields of the Pipkov family have matured longer. Even now there are a lot of them in the field, Jaroslava pipková told CTK today.
The pips grow many kinds of pumpkins, but the weather hasn't been good for them for the last two years. This year's harvest was delayed, and some species did not come out. "As usual, we have plenty of orange pumpkins for Halloween, but some varieties have failed for gourmets," said Pipková. Nevertheless, the farm can choose from several varieties, from the already mentioned large pumpkins suitable for carving and chiseling decorations through cooking hokaido or elongated "spaghetti" to ornamental gourds of various colors and shapes.
Growing pumpkins is laborious. Farmers manually dig up plants and harvest their fruits, cutting off the stem of the pumpkin with scissors.

Strawberry, plum and invisible. Choose the right shade of lipstick: there is not only one red
When choosing a red lipstick, you should first determine whether you are a warm or cold type. Try a simple test-examine the veins on your wrist. If they're blue, you're the cold type, if they're green, then you're the warm type. When choosing a new red lipstick, put in the first place precisely on the parting on the basis of the podton. In the next one, look at the texture.
If you belong to women with a cold podton, then lipsticks in purple, plum, cherry or mauve colors are suitable for you.
If you fall into the category of warm skin podton, choose such and lipstick. You can tell them by the way they gravitate toward orange, coral, gold or brown reflections.
It may happen to you that some veins look green, and others-blue. In this case, congratulate yourself-you do not need to look at the undertone and you can only focus on your color preferences.

Uncombed wants $ 45 million from the state.
The Ministry of justice, according to the spokesman of the office of Vladimir řepka, has received six applications in this regard so far and is now analyzing them. The young man was imprisoned for two years for assaulting a woman, but the justice finally exonerated him.
Both the chief prosecutor Pavel Zeman and the minister of justice Marie benešová did not appeal in the case.
The attempted murder of a hairdresser in hořice happened in February 2013. The Hradec state prosecutor's office indicted the then 20-year-old student of the grammar school Nečesaný. The prosecution claimed that he hit the woman several times in the head with a log and then took over ten thousand crowns from her. The seriously injured woman was found by her son, her life was saved by the doctors of the Hradec hospital.
Uncombed from the beginning, he denied any guilt. "I am innocent, and I swear to it. I am sincerely sorry for what happened to the injured, but I am not the perpetrator, " the young man said earlier in court, who did not deny that the fateful day was in the hairdresser. He said he wanted a haircut. But he left after his wife told him he was closing. He turned himself in to the police as a witness.
At first, the hairdresser did not recognize him as the aggressor during the interrogation, but later she called him the attacker. According to forensic experts, she suffered from memory lapses after the attack.
The Hradec Králové regional court successively handed down five judgments in the case. At first, he was found guilty twice and sentenced to 16 years in prison, the Supreme Court of Appeal reduced his sentence to 13 years. Uncombed gradually headed for prison twice, but each time after the intervention of the Supreme Court was released. After the ordered replacement of the judicial chamber, repeated acquittals finally fell, the last of which was confirmed by the Supreme Court in March this year.
At the same time, Jiří lněnička, chairman of the board of Appeal, stated in the grounds of his conclusions that this decision was wrong, but, given the procedural situation, he did not have a better option. He said that he had dismissed the prosecutor's appeal against the acquittal, even though her objections were justified.
"The problem of this case is not that there was a lack of evidence, but their evaluation. We believe that a sufficient amount of evidence was collected in the pre-trial proceedings, which would have been sufficient for the admission of guilt in another criminal case, " said lněnička.
But hradecký, as well as the Supreme Court, looked at the case differently and their opinion would probably not change if the acquittal was overturned.

A woman spent hundreds of thousands on her disabled son's disability pension.
She's in court.
The money that a 33-year-old man receives from the state as a disability pension is intended primarily to improve the quality of his life.
For embezzlement, a woman faces up to eight years in prison.
Due to poor health, the court deprived the sick man of his rights and appointed his mother as a guardian, who, among other things, was to manage his son's money.
"From mid-November 2013 until January this year, the woman used part of the funds from her son's disability pension for her own needs and deprived him of 440 thousand crowns," said police spokeswoman Dana ladmanová, adding that the accused woman is aggravated by the fact that as a guardian she had a special duty to defend the interests of the injured.
The woman, according to the instructions of the court, did set up an account for her son, but she had his pension sent to her account.
"After paying the costs associated with the son's stay in a medical facility and paying for the necessary medicines, she used the remaining funds to purchase a vehicle, electrical appliances and to run the household," the indictment says.
That he can not use his son's money for his own needs, the woman admitted.
But she defended herself by helping them pay for family expenses.
"We had problems from our income to tighten the running of the household.
We never bought anything fancy.
It was always for things that the son would approve of buying.
I thought it was family money.
I had no idea that I was committing a crime, " the woman explained to the police.
She promised to return the money to her son.
North America has been inhabited for 30, 000 years, scientists say after finding tools
The findings from the chiquihuite cave in the Mexican state of Zacatecas include 1930 tools made of limestone, including fine blades that could have been used to cut meat, and pointed objects that could have served as spearheads or spears.
Scientists have found that the oldest of the tools date back to 33, 000 to 31, 000 years ago.
"There are only a few products of this age.
But they are here, " said archaeologist Ciprian Ardelean of the University of Zacatecas state and lead author of one of two studies published on the subject in the journal Nature.
The youngest instruments reach an age of 12,500 years.
Thus, according to experts, people inhabited the Chiquihuite cave, located at high altitude, for a long 20, 000 years.
Until now, the generally accepted theory spoke of the fact that the first representatives of the species Homo sapiens crossed the land bridge from the area of present-day Russia to Alaska about 13,500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including unique spearheads used to kill mammoths and other prehistoric animals, has shown that this clovian culture subsequently spread throughout much of North America.
But this model has received cracks in recent decades, when several ancient settlements were discovered that were two to three thousand years older.
The second study, published in the journal Nature, reports on 42 different sites across North America that prove human presence on the continent as early as 26, 000 to 19, 000 years ago.
Scientists believe that a small number of people could come to the North American mainland earlier than previously thought.
Some could have made it to America by boat.
"It is clear that people were in America long before the development of the so-called clovian culture," said anthropologist Ruth Gruhn of the University of Alberta, Canada, commenting on the new findings.
Interest in tickets so far fulfills an optimistic scenario, sellers say.
Gradually, prices are also reduced
Ticket sales in the Czech Republic are growing every week.
Compared to last summer, the interest is still about half, but the demand is growing every week by up to 20 percent.
Thus, the development after the crisis, according to sellers, fulfills the most optimistic scenarios.
Gradually, ticket prices are also decreasing.
Among the most sought-after destinations, according to sellers, are mainly southern European countries.
By date Kiwi.com they are led by Spain, Italy and Greece.
At the portal Letuška.cz the most sold flights to the Croatian split.
Of the other countries, Great Britain is the most sought after, but it has always been one of the busiest destinations.
The average price of air tickets is also decreasing.
At the portal Letuška.cz in about the middle of the month it was around 6250 crowns, 3000 crowns less year-on-year.
This is mainly due to an increase in demand for European destinations, which now account for about 85 percent of sales.
However, prices in some European places, such as Spain and Italy, have fallen by about a fifth in recent weeks.
The crisis has also affected the behavior of customers, who now buy tickets much less in advance than before, fearing the further development of the coronavirus situation.
According to earlier information Kiwi.com the time to purchase a ticket before departure decreased year-on-year by about ten days.
"This confirms to us the future trend where people will order tickets with much less advance, they will require more flexibility, they will take less risks," said the vice president for products Kiwi.com Michal šindelář.
Currently, the average booking time before departure is 21 days.
Along with the growth in sales, the number of restored Air Lines from the Czech Republic is also growing.
Prague airport currently operates scheduled flights to more than 60 destinations.
Compared to last year's summer season, this is about half of the destinations.
The Hunter was injured in a fall from a sitting position, he was carried to the ambulance for three hours
The unfortunate accident occurred before half past eight in the evening in the top parts of the devil's mill.
"It was a very difficult and inaccessible terrain, so we sent five of our rescuers to the injured man with proper equipment. At the same time, we asked the medical rescue service of the Moravian-Silesian region for cooperation. Medics then dispatched an ambulance to the accident, " Libor Kluz, the dispatcher of the Beskydy mountain service, described the circumstances of the intervention.
Rescuers found a huntsman in a designated area with multiple injuries. They immediately treated him, and then gently, but with difficulty transported on the so-called Austrian trolley through the impassable terrain.
"Transport along the route of about one and a half kilometers was slow and difficult. The injured Nimrod was therefore handed over to the ambulance crew after about three hours, " Libor Kluz added.
Fortunately, according to Radan jaškovský, responsible chief of the Beskydy mountain service and an intervening paramedic, a colleague of the Hunter was able to describe in detail where the injured person is.
"We therefore found it relatively quickly. However, if he had an ambulance app on his phone, our rescuers would surely have been there sooner and at the same time the dispatch office of line 155 would have known about the accident and his situation immediately," Radan jaškovský noted.
He added that a charged mobile phone with the ambulance app activated should be commonplace in the mountains today.

Air in homes is up to five times worse than outside.
Harm to health both air fresheners and deodorants
Health is threatened not only by poor air quality in the open air, but also at home.
This was pointed out by the Israeli human health expert Carol Abraham, quoted by the Jerusalem Post.
According to Abraham, who was instrumental in the creation of the Israeli Ministry of environmental protection, pollutants in homes need to be addressed right now, when many people are spending more time working from home.
Abraham mentioned the research of the US Environmental Agency (EPA), according to which the quality of domestic air is up to five times worse than outdoor.
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 3.8 million people die prematurely every year due to poor air quality in their homes.
"Because of the coronavirus epidemic, which has forced many and still forces them to work from home, people have to spend more hours in their homes than before, so it's time to focus on the quality of the air in their homes," said Abraham.
In Israel, according to her, almost no one is engaged in the quality of "home air".
Dangerous can be things with which a person normally comes into contact-paints, air fresheners, disinfectants, deodorants or pesticides.
"The poisonous gas is also emitted by the clothes that we regularly wear to the dry cleaners," said Abraham.
According to her, children, elderly household members and people with respiratory problems are the most at risk.
Even otherwise healthy individuals may begin to suffer from problems such as headache, fainting, nasal irritation, nosebleeds, vomiting, or skin allergies.
With prolonged exposure to unhealthy substances, internal organs and the central nervous system can be damaged.
But not all pollutants come from objects inside homes, the source may also be the material from which the houses are built.
Heavy competition for Kamiq damage. Kia Xceed is betting on a rich equipment, at what price?
Kia Xceed is a relatively difficult to classify model. It falls clearly among compact SUVs, but does not offer all-wheel drive.this item leaves the larger sibling Sportage, which is such a direct answer to cars like Skoda Karoq, Opel Grandland X or Volkswagen Tiguan. In comparison, the Xceed also bets on more dynamic body shapes, which by sloping the rear can remotely remind the world of the SUV-coupe, popular in this part of the market especially among premium brands Audi, BMW or Mercedes-Benz.
On the other hand, the Xceed can not be classified only alongside the brushed versions of classic compacts, such as the Ford Focus Active. Compared to it, the Koreans have made a much larger number of changes to the body, so who does not want to see the Ceed in the shapes of the novelty may not even see.
Unlike the compact hatchback or Ceed station wagon, the Xceed is also offered exclusively with turbocharged engines, so do not expect a basic atmospheric fourteen. The Xceed starts with a turbocharged liter and also offers a turbocharged 16-piston with 150 kW, reserved for the sibling version of the GT. Don't expect a sports degree here. Turbodiesely 1.6 CRDi is offered only in mild-hybrid design, that is, the internal combustion engine is assisted by an electrical system that helps to reduce consumption and emissions. From 100 kW it is also possible in addition to the manual to pay extra for a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic.
Soon the offer will be expanded by a plug-in hybrid, that is, a variant that will travel about six tens of kilometers only on electricity. The battery can then be charged from a normal socket.

Karel Gott didn't like Václav Havel?!
Dominic's daughter revealed it
"Dad didn't have to do it for many years," she revealed to aha! Gott's eldest daughter Dominika said that the master could not come up with Havel's name and whenever he came up with a speech, Karl was always angry.
It's hard to say what they did to each other, but according to Dominica, the dispute began sometime in the mid-1990s.
"Dad said in an article after the revolution that he had it easier than him.
That Havel could write in his drawer in the dark, but if he had somehow resisted, he would have ended his career," says gottová.
But then he adds that in the end the Czech greats found their way to each other after all.
"I know that the word Havel could not hear at all until his 60s.
But then the president congratulated him with a letter on his birthday and suddenly his father's relationship with him began to change, " Dominika recalls.
In fact, ten years later, Gott even invited the then former president to celebrate his 70th birthday at the Ambassador Hotel on Wenceslas Square.
"And there began a new era of their relationship, because dad then regularly invited Mr. Havel home to his bertramka," added the blonde, whose father died last October.
Nightingale was also said to be sorry that he had never received state honours from Václav Havel.
However, he did get it in 2009, even though it was already out of the hands of his successor in office, Václav Klaus (79).
In memoriam, the current president Miloš Zeman (75) is to award him the order of the white lion to honor his memory.

The French chef is suing Michelin for removing the star. I suffer from depression, he claims
Renowned French chef Marc Veyrat lost his third Michelin star in January this year, a year after winning it. With the publisher of the red guide, he intends to sue to receive the exact reasons for the degradation. Veyrat also doubts the competence of Michelin inspectors, who, according to him, mistook saffron for cheddar. The first trial is scheduled for November.
The chef of the famous restaurant La Maison de Bois in the alpine region of Upper Savoie lost one of the three Michelin stars in January this year. The publisher of the prestigious guide Le Guide Michelin will be sued, because the conclusion of the commissioners, according to him, was not properly justified. In addition, the removal of the asterisk, according to him, occurred without any notice. "Six months I suffer from depression. How dare you mess with the health of the cooks?"Veyrat said to the commissioners.
Michelin allegedly gave the chef only vague reasons, such as that the chef put Cheddar in the soufflé, which the inspection did not like. "I put saffron in it, and these gentlemen thought it was cheddar, because it was yellow. From the beginning, I have been working with Savoy ingredients with love," he protested against Veyrat's decision. The latter is convinced of the strong incompetence of the Michelin commissioners: "you are scammers who only provoke disputes for commercial reasons."The indignant Veyrat does not understand" how they could afford to say that we put Cheddar in our soufflé". "They also offended our region, my employees were crazy about it. We have eggs from our hens, milk from our own cows, gardeners collect fresh herbs every morning, " he huffed.
The distinguished chef, always with a black hat on his head and dark glasses, is an opponent of the new generation of Michelin commissioners, and therefore calls for the exclusion of his restaurant from the red guide. However, the publisher refuses to do this. "If the business remains open and our inspectors re-select it, we will continue to recommend it," says Gwendal Pullennec, international director of Michelin.
According to Michelin, the chef's lawsuit testifies that he does not yet have any meaningful accusation, and the lawyer will only help him formulate it. "We regret that Mr Veyrat communicates rudely with us. But we will carefully examine his comments, " he said.
In addition to La Maison de bois, Marc veyart owns two more three-star restaurants.
