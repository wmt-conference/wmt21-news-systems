Women's basketball players did not reach the medal from the World Championship U17, finished fourth
The American women won their third World 17's Championship as well, beating Spain narrowly 77-75 in the final despite 40 points from Spain's Angela Salvadores.
"We really wanted to win and not be a potato, but maybe we wanted it too much. We caught the beginning but we couldn't hold on because they outplayed us under the basket," regretted captain Karolína Malečková. "But playing in front of such a crowd was an incredible experience," she praised the fans in Klatovy and Plzeň.
The Czechs started very well, taking an 8-0 lead thanks to two threes and dominating the court throughout the first quarter. At that point, it looked like they would avenge their 85:88 overtime defeat. However, the referees whistled 15 fouls in the half and with questionable decisions helped Hungary come back into the game with a 12:2 streak.
"I'm convinced that all we had to do was make two more three-pointers, run it to 20 points and we wouldn't have let it go. But instead, our mistakes came. I don't care about the referees, but what we did wrong, and there were mistakes that helped the opponent get caught," coach Richard Fousek assessed.
"It wasn't the first time we had a lapse in concentration. But the girls are fighters, they didn't let anything go and fought to the end. The opponent was very good," he added.
The Czechs were kept in the game mainly by Petra Holešínská's accurate shooting from distance and Tereza Šípová's peacock shot. However, the top Czech scorer had a problem with fouls and was absent from the court for a large part of the third quarter. The Hungarians took advantage of this and gained a slight lead, which they maintained, although the Czechs fought until the last seconds.
"The first five games were very difficult for us, we turned the games in a tight rotation and it cost us a lot of strength. Already against Spain we could see that the girls were tired and there was no place to take. We were not consistent on defense because of our physicality. We didn't play fast counterattack, we lacked rebounding. And the Hungarians are so good that if you don't put everything together, it's hard to win," Fousek added.
He believes his charges have a promising future. "In two years, the girls managed to win the Youth Olympics, be second at the 16-year-old European Championships and now they are fourth in the world. By our standards, this is a quality team with good character and we need to continue to work with them and develop their talent. Now it's up to the federation to decide which coach to assign them in the higher categories," added Fousek.
Thomas Cook: Czechs kicked out of hotel in Mallorca. The guarantees were not enough
The group's Austrian, German and Polish divisions also filed for insolvency during the week. The future of the Czech subsidiary is currently under negotiation, with a decision expected by the end of September.
According to Jan Papež, vice-chairman of the Association of Travel Agencies of the Czech Republic, there are three possible solutions in play - liquidation will be announced, the company will be sold or the team from the Czech branch will set up a new travel agency. "Which one it will be, however, cannot be predicted, it will depend on the German owner," he told the Czech News Agency today.
In addition to the two prematurely terminated tours, the CK is also dealing with cases where clients had to pay for their stay out of their own pocket, although the company tries to provide guarantees to hoteliers. The CK has promised to reimburse its clients for the payments, according to Pope, and the company has sufficient security to do so.
Problems in hotels have arisen especially in Mallorca, where the company has asked for help from the Czech consulate. In this context, Pope described to ČTK one of the cases when a hotel there kicked out all the tourists of the office. "The hotelier was unable to determine who belonged to the German and who to the Czech company. Therefore, he kicked everyone out of the hotel despite the fact that the domestic Neckermann provided guarantees," he said. According to Šrámek, the situation was eventually resolved.
The Czech arm of the bankrupt British Thomas Cook group increased its revenues to CZK 995 million last year, up nearly 21 percent year-on-year, according to the company's annual report. The company's net profit, on the other hand, fell by around CZK 7 million to CZK 15.3 million. However, the company was left with an outstanding loss of almost CZK 103 million from previous years. The subsidiary comprises two core divisions - in addition to CK Neckermann, it is also the Global Travel Lufthansa City Center business.
Novak helped Trabzonspor to second place, Škoda also scored
Defender Filip Novak helped Trabzonspor to the runners-up title with a goal in the last round of the Turkish Football League.
His team won 2-1 at Kayserispor and kept Besiktas third.
Striker Milan Škoda scored his 10th goal for Rizespor after his January transfer from Slavia, which saved itself despite losing 1-3 at Fenerbahce.
Novak confirmed his excellent productivity for a defender with his seventh goal in this league season.
In the 63rd minute, Kayserispor's goalkeeper only parried a fierce shot and the Czech player headed the ball into the net from an angle.
The home side managed to equalise with five minutes to go, but Trabzonspor pulled off the winner in the sixth minute of stoppage time, successfully finishing off a four-on-one break.
Skoda equalised early in the second half against Fenerbahce after a solo effort to make it 1-1.
Although Rizespor did not hold the draw for long, they did not have to regret it as they remained three points above the relegation zone thanks to the results of their opponents.
The competition will end with the champion Basaksehir's match at Kasimpasa on Sunday.
The hermit's cave in the woods near Novo Bor was not actually habitable.
In northern Bohemia, in the foothills of the Lusatian Mountains, near Nový Bor in the Českolipsko region, in the forests through which the Count's Way led, several sandstone rock formations are hidden.
Both natural and man-made.
And we're going to see the man-made ones.
The place is called the Hermit's Cave.
But in reality, no hermit ever lived here and the cave was used as a shelter, or more accurately, a storage chamber, probably for grain.
The cave is carved out of the side of a rock outcropping and is accessible by stairs from above.
However, it is practically invisible until the last moment.
It is only revealed by a narrow staircase leading to a kind of rock gallery, from where one enters the rock.
Although the chamber appears to be a considerable distance from human habitation, at the time of its construction there may have been a field on the plateau where the forest is today.
"The fact that the building does not have a window or even a fireplace in the traditional place clearly proves that no hermit could ever have survived the winter here," explains historian Kamil Podroužek from the Jan Evangelista Purkyně Faculty of Arts in Ústí nad Labem.
The one-room building has only a stone bench at the back, which was probably used to store containers.
"I see it as a chamber for storing some food or products from the field," says Kamil Podroužek.
Tool marks are visible on the cave walls.
Breaking off the sandstone with a spike was quite simple and quick for the insiders.
It was enough to use the joints appropriately and gradually break off the sandstone.
The length of the point marks and the method of cutting in general give a rough indication of the period of the cave's formation.
According to the historian, it is probably the end of the 18th century.
The cave is freely accessible and, judging by the mess that appears in the cave, someone occasionally sleeps there nowadays.
If you approach the cave from above from one of the forest paths and are attracted by the stream flowing under the cave and the nearby counting road, you will certainly find the path down as well.
And on the way out of the forest you may be captivated by the nearby Raven Rocks.
Someone killed a homeless woman under the bridge. Police are looking for witnesses
According to Prague police, the murder took place sometime during the early evening to late night of Tuesday to Wednesday. It is to this time that the police are appealing for possible witnesses.
"Some of the drivers who were driving on the bridge connecting Libeň and Žižkov or on Pod Krejcárkem Street could have filmed the killer, for example, on a dashboard camera. A witness may have seen him and could have described him. In short, we welcome any testimony about this case and will take it on the 158 number," said Jan Daněk, spokesperson for the Regional Police Directorate.
According to the spokesman, the murdered homeless woman was unconflicted, did not drink alcohol and did not seek the company of other people. The woman lived at the scene of the crime. "She was most often in the vicinity of Krejcárk, Palmovka and Holešovice, carrying large blue shopping bags," Daněk said, adding a description of the victim that could also help any witnesses.

Nokia sues a Brno company over the name Lokia. People won't confuse us, Moravians believe
Nokia has filed an opposition to the Lokia trademark application with the Industrial Property Office. However, according to CCV, confusion of products is unlikely.
Brno-based software development firm CCV is facing legal action from Finnish telecommunications equipment manufacturer Nokia. The Finns do not like the fact that the Brno firm's warehouse management software is called Lokia WMS, the E15 daily reported. Nokia has therefore filed objections against the Lokia trademark application with the Industrial Property Office. CCV believes that confusion is unlikely.
Marketing director Petr Ondrasek said that two dozen customers are already using the programme, which has been on the market since last September.
"The Nokia brand enjoys recognition and trust around the world. When someone tries to register a trademark that we believe may lead to confusion or dilution of our brand, we take action to protect our valuable asset," said Nokia spokesman Mark Durrant.
The Brno-based developers say they did not have the brand, famous in the past for its mobile phones, in mind when creating the stock programme. According to CCV, the name Lokia is based on the Latin name for a species of dragonfly whose rapid movement is meant to be analogous to the movement of warehouse workers through a warehouse.
"In the Czech market, the possibility of confusion is unlikely. We sell modern cloud software that companies use to equip their warehouse operations, and we are not really targeting the mobile phone manufacturing sector. And we don't want to be compared to a brand that may be missing the train in its field," CCV manager Tomáš Kormaňák told E15.
CCV applied for brand protection with the Industrial Property Office in August before the program was launched. "It applied for protection for goods and services belonging to classes 9, 35 and 42, as software belongs to class 9, related business management services in warehouses belong to class 35 and computer software development belongs to class 42 according to the international classification," Ondrášek said.
Nokia's opposition is based on the fact that Nokia's earlier trademark is valid in all classes of goods and services and thus covers the widest possible range of goods and services, and thus naturally overlaps also in classes 9, 35 and 42. "The CCV does not dispute the opponent's claim as far as the coincidence on these classes of products and services is concerned. However, in reality they are completely different marks aimed at different target groups," Ondrášek said.
According to E15, brand disputes can take months and can complicate a company's operations.
Coal will give way to gas and nuclear. Renewables won't cover increased demand, says European ExxonMobil chief
Renewables will not be enough to meet future energy demand in the Czech Republic. Due to the unsuitable climate, wind and solar power plants need to be supplemented by other alternatives, such as those using natural gas.
Philippe Ducom, president of the European branch of the US corporation ExxonMobil, one of the largest global oil producers, says this in an interview with HN. At the same time, he mentions that large storage facilities, which could store unused energy from days when there is plenty of sun and wind, are still too expensive.
In Prague, Ducom visited ExxonMobil's 1,200-employee hub, which is tasked with supporting the company's business activities and providing logistics and other services needed for the company's operations.
Sydney to London in four hours? In 2030, a possible reality
Sabre combines a conventional aircraft engine with a rocket engine. It is designed to propel the aircraft at twice the speed at which Concorde aircraft fly. "When the Sabre engine is operational, it could allow us to fly to Australia in about four hours," Turnock said. And the distance between London and New York, for example, could be covered in one hour.
The Independent notes that so-called hypersonic flights, in which five times the speed of sound is exceeded, are complicated by engine overheating. But Sabre (Synergetic Air Breathing Rocket Engine) should deal with this problem by using super-cold helium to prevent temperatures from rising.
"The most important thing about Sabre is that it is a hybrid of a rocket and aircraft engine, powered by a stream of exhaust gases generated from the air," says Shaun Driscoll of Reaction Engines. "Rockets have not evolved that much in the last 70 years, whereas aircraft ones have. So if you combine the engines, you can have a very lightweight and efficient propulsion system and essentially create a space plane," he added.
The engine is currently being tested, with test flights expected to begin around the middle of next year. Commercial flights will then begin around 2030.
I still see myself as a kid who is still just getting his feet wet, says Jan Cina
"This has been a great school for everyone who has worked on it. I fell in love with Afro dancing there. The way I have a bit of my dad's Romani in me, I was completely enchanted by it," said Jan Cina, who considers himself mainly a musical theatre actor.
He has much fresher memories than the First Step series of his role as a cameraman in the new film National Class. Cina revealed that director Štěpán Altrichter must have tempted him a lot. "It was a tough job, but the result was worth it. The film was made a year ago. Hard and honest, but at the same time fun. It was filmed on Národní třída, where I used to drive as a non-driver. A lot of filming also took place in the South Town in Prague," he said about the Czech-German co-production.
Although he is nominated for a Thalia Award for his role in the production of The Little Prince, he does not consider it a career highlight. "I don't feel that way. I still see myself as a kid who's still just figuring things out. But the nomination is very pleasant and surprising. I can see the peak far ahead of me," he revealed, adding that he hasn't even thought about the thank-you speech in case of a win. "Not really, but as a kid, when I listened to talk shows on the radio, that's what I always imagined speaking to people."
Jan Cina has lived with his colleague Petr Vančura for 13 years. What is his recipe for a happy relationship? "To like each other and to see problems as a challenge and a good thing to solve," he revealed, recalling the Czech Lions award ceremony when his friend fell on the stairs.
"Yes, it really happened. He had new slippery shoes and the red carpet was slippery too. So it wasn't long before he was on the floor. He managed to make a virtue of it. He had a Vanchur's Stairs workshop where he taught how to fall down stairs safely at VIP events."
The Germans elected Keller to head the football association
As expected, the current head of Bundesliga side Freiburg, Fritz Keller, has become the new president of the German Football Association. The sixty-two-year-old winemaker, caterer and hotelier was elected unanimously for a three-year term and had no opponent.
Keller replaced Reinhard Grindel, who resigned in April over an affair involving undeclared income. His other predecessors, Theo Zwanziger and Wolfgang Niersbach, will again go on trial over possible bribery in the awarding of the 2006 World Cup.
Keller said one of his main goals will be to restore confidence in the federation and lead it out of the crisis. "It will not be a one-man show, many people will bear responsibility. The federation is better than its reputation," said Keller, who presented all his tasks under the slogan: Together we can do it.
Keller left his post in Freiburg after his election as head of the union.
Jockey Minařík is in artificial sleep after a heavy crash in Germany
"Filip is in the best hands now.
The institute is equipped for such cases, and fortunately we have part of the family in Hannover.
This makes the situation much easier for me and also the care of my daughter Finja," the Jezdci.cz server quoted a statement by Minarek's wife Katja.
"Everyone is doing their best, Filip needs time to recover now.
There is no point in giving any forecasts.
Anyone who has ever encountered the problem of head trauma and patients in artificial sleep knows that the situation can change.
Philip is a great fighter.
We all have to be patient now and give him time," said the wife of the 45-year-old jockey.
Star Frankie Dettori, who won the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes for the seventh time at Ascot on Saturday, matching the legendary Lester Piggott, also called for financial support for the injured Minarik on Twitter.
Nearly €70,000 has been raised on Gofundme to date.
The target is 100,000 euros (2.6 million crowns).
Video referee takes four goals from Sassuolo, they lose 0:2
The Sassuolo players got the ball into the opponent's goal four times in Saturday's match in Naples, but had to accept a 0:2 defeat.
The referee did not concede any of their goals after consulting the video due to offside.
According to the Italian media, this is a record-breaking technological disadvantage, as VAR has never prevented a team from scoring so many goals.
"VAR was tougher on Sassuolo than the road radar and punished them like no team has ever been punished before.
The new technology is breaking records," Gazzetta dello Sport wrote in a commentary.
"A festival of disallowed Sassuolo goals.
Never has VAR been so strict on one team," added the Corriere dello Sport newspaper.
Napoli took the lead in the 8th minute on Saturday, but after half an hour of play Sassuolo seemed to have equalised.
Filip Djuricic's goal, however, was disallowed due to offside after the video referee intervened.
For the same reason, Djuricic's next shot and goals by Francesco Caputo and Domenico Berardi were also disallowed.
The home team, on the other hand, added one more goal.
Electric cars set a new record.
The Czech Republic has the highest number of recharges in history
"The growth was driven by a 30% increase in the number of stations in our network and the trend towards more frequent charging at public stations, as well as the accelerated development of registrations of new e-cars," said Tomáš Chmelík, head of CEZ's clean technology unit.
Other big players, such as PRE and E.ON, electric car manufacturer Tesla, as well as supermarkets Billa and Lidl, are also claiming their share of the market.
The operators of conventional petrol stations are represented by MOL.
However, the latter does not have figures yet.
"We only started building our network for electromobility last year," explained company spokeswoman Jana Jusková.
However, the editors of Deník exclusively obtained data from all 216 electric stands operated by ČEZ.
It shows that drivers took an average of 13.5 kWh from the stations.
This corresponds to a range of about 100 kilometres for a smaller electric car.
Ignoring minor draws of up to 1 kWh, the average charging takes two and a half hours.
The vast majority of refuelling then took place on the free tariff.
If motorists were already paying for the charge, their typical spend was around CZK 330.
Electromobility is particularly strong in the capital.
All five of ČEZ's busiest charging stations are located in Prague, and their popularity overshadows that of entire regional cities.
Among the regions, Olomouc leads the way.
On the contrary, the least interest is in remote stations in the border region, for example in Bohumín or Prachatice, which often remain unused all day.
More than four thousand electric cars are currently registered in the Czech Republic.
In the first half of this year alone, 1,274 new e-cars were added.
In a large poll by the daily newspaper "Czechs on the Move", eight percent of readers said they were considering buying an electric car for their family.
However, only a third of respondents know where to find the nearest charging station in their area.
Epilepsy complicated his love of sport, surgery gives him new hope
The first time Honzik's parents noticed something was wrong with him was at a year and a half. He would always stare into space for a few minutes, become immobile and not respond to anyone. The paediatrician therefore sent him to the paediatric neurology clinic where, after a series of examinations, the doctors diagnosed him with epilepsy and immediately put him on medication, but it did not work immediately.
It took almost a year for the doctors to find the ideal combination of medications that stopped his seizures altogether. So at the age of five, the doctors took him off the medication, and because the seizures did not return, his parents assumed that Honza was healthy and started to encourage him to play more sports. He cycled, skied, played tennis and floorball, and spent his free time playing games with his sister and friends. But at the age of eleven he had another seizure and everything started all over again.
The doctors tried different combinations of drugs again, but this time nothing worked, and the seizures in the form of absences kept recurring. Since Honza always stopped perceiving during a seizure, his parents were terrified that he would get it during sports and get hurt. Gradually, Honza stopped cycling and replaced downhill skis with cross-country skis and a snowboard. Although the sport gave him a seizure from time to time, he never gave it up completely. He even fulfilled his dream and finished the Spartan Race, but together with a friend who was always on the lookout to help him in case of an emergency.
When Honz was 15 years old, his parents decided to try a change of doctor and turned to the specialists at the Motol Hospital. After a series of examinations, the doctors there decided that Honza was a candidate for surgery to remove the lesion - the source of his epileptic seizures - from his brain. "I had to undergo 2 operations in a row, first the doctors inserted probes into my brain, which sensed its activity, then only they could remove the deposit. It was hell for me for several weeks. I had to lie down and hardly move, wires were sticking out of my head, which were connected to the computer," recalls Honza.
The operation was successful and the doctors removed the rather large lesion. "The first days after the operation were very mentally difficult, Honza was apathetic, confused, sad and hardly spoke. Compared to how lively and communicative he normally is, it was a frightening change, but fortunately after a few days everything returned to normal," says the mother, adding: "A month and a half after the operation he had 1 seizure, but according to the doctors it happens. He has been seizure-free for 3 months since then."
This school year, Honza will graduate, besides sports he enjoys languages and has started working with the E Society, with whom he travels to schools to give talks about epilepsy. Honza is not yet fully engaged in sports activities, he is starting to return to sports slowly. "I'm learning how to do sports properly, how to breathe well so that I don't put my body under sudden stress, which is quite a challenge with my competitive nature," explains Honza.
This year, he will therefore not actively participate in the traditional EPPI paddling triathlon, which brings together epilepsy patients and healthy athletes and which will take place this weekend on 28 September 2019 at the Veselská sandpit. But hopefully next year it will be.

Not only for better water retention.
Environmental activists protested in Prague
According to the organizers, the government's actions so far in the issues of protection and recovery of the Czech landscape and solving the climate crisis are insufficient, the speakers called on the state for a more vigorous approach.
Representatives of large organisations such as the Duha Movement, Greenpeace and the Green Party, as well as smaller local associations, attended the event called The Last Drop.
"For example, we have people who have been speaking out against the expansion of the Turów mine for a long time, we have people who are speaking out against the gravel mining near Uherské Ostroh, we have people who are speaking out against the construction of senseless dams," said Marika Volfová on behalf of the organisers.
She said that the main demands of the protesters are the creation of a plan for water retention in the landscape, a drastic change in agricultural policy and the subsidy system towards the promotion of sustainable agriculture, and the fastest possible transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.
"The government is supposed to defend the interests of the people, not a reckless and devastating business," she said.
A stall was set up in Malostranské náměstí (Lesser Town Square) with a petition calling on Czech state leaders to push for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the restoration of Czech soil and landscape.
The people present were equipped with banners with slogans such as "No more depression from rape" or "Less coal, more boars".
Jan Škoda from the association Za vodu pro lidé, which protests against the plan to mine gravel in the Hodonín region, came to Prague from South Moravia.
"It threatens the source of drinking water for 140,000 people," he said.
He added that boreholes represent the fifth most productive source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
He said the planned gravel extraction is located only about 500 metres from the boreholes and according to assessments, the water quality is certain to be compromised.
Vojtěch Veselý came from the village of Valeč in the Karlovy Vary region on behalf of the so-called agroecological farmers.
He pointed out the advantages of small farms that do not chase yields and profits and supply the inhabitants on the spot.
"Small agro-ecological farms are able to feed the entire population in a completely normal way, and on top of that they do not wreak such havoc on the rural landscape and the environment," he said.
Kovosvit is selling an office building and other sheds. Expects worse times ahead
Due to the restructuring, Kovosvit ended last year with a consolidated loss of CZK 100 million, with a consolidated turnover of CZK 1.3 billion. Kuchař counts a lack of staff and shifts of subcontractors among the main problems last year. Demand for machine tools has fallen this year, down 10 to 20 percent year-on-year. "This is linked to an expected drop in turnover of the order of 10 percent," the CEO said. In 2017, Kovosvit had sales of CZK 1.3 billion and a profit after tax of CZK 40.1 million. The loss for 2016 was 719 million.
Kovosvit is now offering for sale several properties, halls and land that it either does not use or only minimally uses. This includes the office building, where it uses two of the five floors, and not yet fully. "Part of the long-term restructuring plan is to make Kovosvit leaner, more efficient. The sale of the assets is not part of some momentary solution, be it cash flow, for example, but part of a long-term plan where we want to devote all our resources to investment development," the CEO said.
Kovosvit exports about half of its production. Its standard markets are the EU and Russia, and to a lesser extent Asia last year. This year, Kuchař counts India among the most interesting, where Kovosvit won an order for machines enabling five-axis machining worth CZK 100 million. This year, the company also exported two five-axis machines worth CZK 30 million to China. "Another order in the same volume has been negotiated, which we would like to fulfil before the end of the year," Kuchař said. Kovosvit is facing restrictions on the Russian market and elsewhere due to sanctions.
Last year, the company sold two five-axis machining centres to France, a company that is a subcontractor to Airbus. It delivered another machine to it in May this year and is expected to deliver one more at the end of the year or in early 2020.
The company's main investment this year was a CZK 20 million switch from steam to hot water heating. Kovosvit employs 500 people and the average worker's wage is CZK 28,500. The company is looking for casting grinders for the foundry, machinists, turners and electricians.
The company has been owned by industrialist and armourer Jaroslav Strnad since September 2016. The company has a tradition in the production of machine tools. It was founded in 1939 by Tomáš Bat'a. The company had up to three thousand employees at the time.
Three people died when a plane crashed into a house in Germany
Three people died and two others were injured when an ultralight aircraft crashed into an apartment building in western Germany today.
The local emergency services reported that the dead are believed to include two crew members and one female resident of the house.
The plane crashed onto the roof of a building in the town of Wesel in North Rhine-Westphalia.
The penthouse, which was one of five units in the building, was subsequently engulfed in fire.
Firefighters have now managed to bring the flames under control.
Robert Meyboom, the deputy chief of the local fire brigade, said that both crew members of the aircraft had apparently died.
Police say the third victim is a woman who lived in the house.
The Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ), citing the mayor of Wesel, said the victim was a single mother whose two-year-old daughter was rescued from the flat with minor injuries.
An emergency parachute, which apparently served as a brake during landing, was found near the accident.
Police assume it came from the crashed plane.
There was room for two people in the plane.
The machine took off from an airport in the nearby town of Marl.
The Rheinische Post newspaper, citing eyewitnesses, said the plane collided with a hot air balloon before crashing.
However, this information has not yet been confirmed.
WAZ, citing other witnesses, wrote that the aircraft disintegrated in mid-air before hitting the ground.
Accident on D5: Highway closed by truck collision
The incident was reported at around 08:00 at kilometre 22 in the direction of Prague. "The motorway is closed, at least for freight traffic. Cars can go through the petrol station," police spokeswoman Michaela Richterová said this morning. Traffic was able to resume around 2:30 p.m. According to Richterová, the preliminary damage is at least CZK 2 million, and police are investigating the cause of the accident.
Petr Svoboda, a spokesman for the Central Bohemian firefighters, said one truck was transporting passenger vehicles and the other was carrying plastic granulate. "Due to the large impact, the transported vehicles were displaced, which firefighters first had to secure against a possible fall," he added.
One of the vehicles had a damaged fuel tank, which leaked about 200 litres of diesel. Firefighters managed to pump out another 200 litres. Staff from the environmental department of the Beroun town hall were called to the accident because of the fuel leak. The removal of the crashed vehicles and the clearance of the motorway was ensured by a private company, which also removed the contaminated soil.
Microplastics have reached human intestines, study confirms for the first time
Scientists have confirmed years of suspicions. A team led by Professor Philipp Schwabl of the University of Vienna has published a study that proves for the first time the presence of microplastics in human stool. The study is small, with eight participants from Europe, Japan and Russia - but tiny plastic particles measuring between 50 and 500 micrometres were found in the samples of all the people studied. None of the eight subjects were vegetarians, six avoided marine fish, and all drank water from plastic bottles and food packaged in plastic.
And it would actually be a bit of a miracle if nothing was found. We already know that microplastics - which are either produced directly, for example for the cosmetics industry, or created by the breakdown of larger pieces - are present in marine animals, insects, tap water and soda; in short, everywhere on the planet. So their entry into the human digestive tract is only officially confirmed. There were roughly 20 microplastic particles per ten grams of stool, and scientists estimate that more than half of the world's population will have them in them.
Of course, lay and scientific knowledge suspects that this is not good. But humanity still doesn't know how bad it is - and what effect microplastics have on "host" organisms. Small particles can reach the bloodstream or the lymphatic system and end up, for example, in the liver. "This is the first study of its kind and it confirms what we have long thought. Now that we have the first evidence of microplastics in the human body, we need to continue to investigate what exactly this means for human health," says Schwabl.
So far, it is known that microplastics in the gut can negatively affect the immune responses of the digestive system, thereby facilitating the absorption of toxic chemicals and other pathogens into the body. And so far, there is no known solution other than to reduce the use of plastics, especially polypropylene. But this will be difficult - the first task facing governments and authorities will be to at least halt its steep rise. As for plastic bottles alone, experts estimate that in three years' time humanity will be using a fifth more of them than today. The current rate is a staggering one million bottles bought per minute. Some eight million tonnes of plastic end up in the seas and oceans every year. The waste threatens marine ecosystems and contaminates the digestive systems of marine animals.
Some countries have already taken restrictions and other measures; Kenya, for example, has banned plastic bags under threat of draconian penalties. The European Commission is considering small bans (the well-known straws), and the domestic Ministry of the Environment is heading in the same direction. Critics, however, argue that such measures are nice, but totally inadequate.
Repair of the Krkonoše Museum will be delayed for a year
The administration of the Krkonoše National Park (KRNAP) has postponed by three weeks the deadline for submitting bids for the second tender for the repair of the Krkonoše Museum in Vrchlabí. The original deadline for opening the envelopes was 20 September, said Radek Drahný, spokesman for the national park. The reason for the postponement of the deadline for submitting bids is a reduction in the budget from CZK 110 million to CZK 83 million.
"We are currently working with prices that are on the market. There has been a change in the budget, it is the price we expect to be offered. If someone submits a bid that is acceptable, the work will start as soon as possible," Drahný said.
Compared to the original plans, the start of the museum's renovation is about a year late. KRNAP wanted to have a contractor selected for the construction part by the end of last year and to start work this spring. According to the national park administration, the CZK 123 million in European funding for the project is not in jeopardy.
The KRNAP administration has not been able to select a construction company for the museum repairs. It launched a second tender this summer because in the previous tender all the bids from companies significantly exceeded the then estimated price of CZK 65 million. The bids exceeded CZK 100 million.
The museum, which is housed in a former Augustinian monastery and belongs to the KRNAP Administration, has been closed since autumn 2017. The selected company should provide the construction part of the project. The total cost, including the construction of the new exhibition, is estimated at CZK 210 million. After the transformation of the expositions, a KRNAP visitor centre should be established in the now vacated building by the end of 2021.
The renovated museum with a new interactive exposition, which should be a story of nature and people settled in the mountains and build on the successful Stone and Life exposition, should serve as a representative gateway to the Krkonoše Mountains for visitors. The visitor centre should provide information about the past and present of the Giant Mountains in the most comprehensible way and motivate people to explore and protect the mountains. It should also take on the role of a traditional museum. The centre will also offer opportunities to organise concerts, festivals, theatre performances or lectures in the open air. There are plans to build a new entrance to the building, a research room or a café.
Česká spořitelna erroneously charged some card payments twice on Saturday.
The error has already been corrected.
Česká spořitelna erroneously charged its clients twice on Saturday afternoon.
According to the bank's spokesman Lukáš Kropík, the problem could have involved thousands of transactions.
The error has already been corrected and the money has been returned to the clients.
The problems with double billing of card payments were noticed by the savings bank on Saturday afternoon.
"We updated the system yesterday (Saturday) night and returned all these duplicate payments to clients immediately.
At the moment everything is working without any problems," Kropík said on Sunday afternoon.
The exact number of clients who had money deducted from their card payments twice was not known to the bank spokesman, who estimated that the number of transactions was in the lower thousands.
The savings bank is investigating the causes of the problems.
"It could be a combination of several factors," Kropík said.
Česká spořitelna is the largest bank in the Czech Republic by number of clients.
It had 4.6 million customers at the end of March.
The savings bank is owned by Austrian financial group Erste Group Bank, a key player in the Central and Eastern European banking market.
Vojtech to present three-stage coronavirus alert system on Monday
"The tiers will be according to the strength of community spread at the regional level.
We are working on this together with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics," Vojtech told CT.
It will be a so-called traffic light, with individual regions marked in green, orange or red according to the risk of coronavirus.
The minister added that he would still discuss the classification of individual regions with epidemiologists.
He admitted that currently only the Moravian-Silesian region would be orange and Prague would be close to it.
The map would also include individual measures for regional health stations, hospitals, social facilities and employers.
"We want to deal with this at the level of the regions, because the situation is not uniform," Vojtěch said.
"A scary result of the study." Islam does not belong in the West, overwhelming majority of Austrians think
1,200 respondents were surveyed, and the poll shows considerable distrust of Islam in Austrian society.
Almost 60 percent of Austrians fear that some Muslims are terrorists, and 48 percent would call for a ban on the construction of mosques. 80 percent of those polled are in favor of greater monitoring of Islamic centers.
A majority of Austrians also want Muslims to be restricted in their religious practices and say the presence of Muslims sometimes makes them feel like strangers in their own country.
"The result of the study is frightening," says study author Wolfgang Aschauer, adding: "Such a tendency towards ethnocentrism could lead over time to the adoption of discriminatory attitudes. The religious freedoms granted to Muslims are in danger of being curtailed."
For believers, the critical attitude is less pronounced. Aschauer argues that the conflict in Austria is not between religions, but between cultures. Dialogue and education could help blunt polarisation, the sociologist says.
According to the study, the most hostile attitudes towards Muslims are held by voters of the extreme right, people without a university education and seniors over 75. On the other hand, Green Party voters, people under 30 and university graduates are the most supportive.
The Austrian Ministry of the Interior estimates that there are around 700 000 Muslims in Austria, which has a population of around 8.7 million. The vast majority have Turkish roots. There are more than 400 Muslim prayer houses and mosques in the country and Islam has been officially recognised as a religion since 1912.
Which cities will disappear under the sea?
A vote by the upper house of the Canadian Parliament has confirmed a rumour that has been known for days: Canada is revoking the honorary citizenship of former human rights legend and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. The current leader of Myanmar (Burma), who spent years under house arrest for her efforts to bring freedom to her country, has lost her honorary title because of her involvement in the genocide against the minority Rohingya people.
The decision to strip Suu Kyi of her honorary citizenship was approved by the lower legislature a week ago and senators have now unanimously backed it. "This is the right message for her, for Myanmar and for the whole world," commented independent Senator Ratna Omidvar on her colleagues' decision. "We must make it clear that accomplices to genocide are not welcome here in Canada - even less so as honorary citizens."
The Canadian Parliament's verdict does not technically change anything for Suu Kyi, it is just an honorary title, but on a symbolic level it sends a strong message. The silence of a long-time human rights activist on the atrocities that the military in majority-Buddhist Myanmar has been committing for endless months against the Rohingya Muslim minority is intolerable.
The fact that officially organised genocide is taking place in Myanmar and that Suu Kyi - the de facto Prime Minister of that government - has utterly failed in her duty to protect her citizens was recently brought to light by a UN report. Specifically, it mentions the names of several army commanders who, according to the investigation team, should be brought to justice for crimes against humanity committed in actions which, the report says, 'are shocking both in the horror of their acts and in their sheer scale'. Suu Kyi and the administration she led, the UN said, were complicit primarily by covering up the soldiers' actions and releasing a protective fog of lies around them - for example, that it was an "anti-terrorist operation".
With Suu Kyi's removal, five individuals remain on Canada's list of honorary citizens: the Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, Nelson Mandela, Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, Karim Aga Khan IV, the 49th Imam of Shiite Muslims, and Malala Yousufzai.
Developments around the former icon of the struggle for freedom and democracy have also been reflected in the Canadian Museum of Human Rights, where Suu Kyi's profile has been updated to include information on atrocities against the Rohingya and the parliamentary decision to strip her of her honorary citizenship. "We have also dimmed the light on her photo on a board depicting the timeline of the human rights struggle and are thinking of replacing her face with a portrait of a member of the Rohingya minority," Canadian media quoted museum spokesperson Rorie McLeod as saying.
Thus, in the current upheaval, the only thing that remains for Suu Kyi - at least for now - is the Nobel Peace Prize, awarded to her in 1991 at the suggestion of Václav Havel for her enormous contribution to the struggle for democracy. "While Ms Suu Kyi's current actions are regrettable, her award will not be annulled," Nobel Foundation head Lars Heikensten told Canada's CBS.

Technology companies want to rule our cities
Francis Fukuyama has been somewhat burned by history. In 1992, at the height of the wave of liberalism that followed the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Iron Curtain, this political scientist wrote in his most famous book, The End of History and the Last Man: "What we may be witnessing ... is the final point in the ideological evolution of humanity and the universal acceptance of Western liberal democracy as the final form of government."
Twenty-six years later, we are witnessing rather illiberal models triumphing and various forms of nationalism and radicalism thriving from the US to Russia, from Turkey to Poland, and from Hungary to Italy. Fukuyama's current ninth book, Identity: The Demand for Dignity and the Politics of Resentment, attempts to counter these forces. As his interview by George Eaton for the New Statesman shows, he rethinks many of his former positions: he argues that the ideas of socialism should be brought back into the public sphere, and Marx was right in many ways. Though he also insists that his thought is still in line with the position of the 1990s and that critics of The End of History and The Last Man have misunderstood him.
"What I said even then was that one of the problems with modern democracy is that while it provides peace and prosperity, people want more than that... Liberal democracy doesn't even try to define what the good life is. It leaves that up to individuals who feel alienated, who don't see the point, and so they band together in identity-based groups that give them a sense of belonging."
In its day, The End of History and the Last Man was written as a powerful argument against Marxists who saw communism as the final stage of history. When Fukuyama is asked about how he now sees the rise of socialists in Britain and the US, he replies: "It all depends on what you mean by socialism. If we're talking about ownership of the means of production, then except when clear public services are demanded, I don't think it will work. But if you mean redistributive programs that attempt to address the huge income and wealth imbalances we are seeing, then yes. I think not only could it come back, it should come back. The long period that President Reagan and Prime Minister Thatcher started, in which certain types of ideas about the benefits of an unregulated market came into play, had a disastrous effect in many ways."
Finally, Fukuyama attempts to calm the current situation as well, warning all liberals that even the rise of new not-quite-democratic regimes will not be the end of history.
Civilization on borrowed time
I was recently reminded of a lovely "line" from one of the great short stories by Simek and Grossmann, set partly in a cemetery, which goes like this: "I pointed out to her that she was crying all right, but on someone else's grave!" It occurred to me that many of the world's politicians engaged in the senseless fight against climate change are now behaving very similarly.
They behave as if humans ruled planet Earth. In reality, we are but a speck on its surface, which it can blow away with its enormous forces like a gust of wind blowing out a candle flame. Probably few of them watch the famous British and American science documentaries about the destructive powers of our blue marble. After all, all it would take is for one of the larger active volcanoes to get a good "fart" and our advanced civilization would go down in flames.
And that this will happen in the near future is highly likely. A number of large volcanoes have, in the opinion of leading volcanologists, become "charged and armed" (Katla in Iceland, for example).
In a way, it would be ideal if the eruption, if it must happen one day, were to happen as soon as possible. Before trillions of dollars are wasted on measures to reduce the production of carbon dioxide, because any properly angry volcano, together with dust and poisonous volcanic gases, can release at least a hundred times more of it into the air than has been saved at the expense of the people of Europe.
It therefore makes no sense to forcibly limit CO2 production. Moreover, it has been scientifically proven that, with a significantly higher proportion of CO2 in the air, plants produce more biological matter and are also more resistant to drought. For humanity, any warming is much more favourable than, for example, a rapid return of the ice age.
If we take into account the as yet understudied influence of solar cycles on the Earth's climate, we have only one reasonable conclusion: let us try hard to keep the Earth as clean as possible, and let us try to adapt to other changes with which we cannot compare in strength at the lowest possible cost.
Waterman and Caroline
When Jonah the waterman and Caroline, the miller's daughter, fall in love with each other, it's not easy for them.
Jonáš is prevented from falling in love by his father, the uncouth waterman Hastrbuch, while Karolina has no idea that her beloved Jonáš is not human.
Luckily, there is Libor, the young man, who will do everything he can to protect the whole village, especially Karolina, from the watery villain.
What does it matter if he plots and lies?
Especially if he can get Caroline to reject Jonah in favour of the valiant Libor.
Soon it becomes clear to everyone in the village who is responsible for the drowning of the nightingale Konvička, the spoiled flour, the mill fire and other mischief.
The angry villagers organize a hunt for the waterman, and an irreconcilable waterman's curse falls on Jonáš's head.
And now, Konvick's little soul, advise Karolina!
How to soften old Hastrbuch, convince the neighbours of Jonah's innocence, find Jonah and free him from the curse?
The fairy tale was filmed in September 2010 in the studios of the Czech Television and in exteriors at the Brzina pond, in Obděnice in the Sedlčany region and in the beautiful surroundings of the historical mill in Hoslovice.
Kristýna Plíšková did not make it to the final, her second title eludes her
The environment in Tashkent suited Pliskova well, she won her first WTA tournament there in 2016 and this year she did very well.
After wins against Paolini, Kawa and Kuzma, she broke into the top four players.
But the match against Alison Van Uytvanck did not go well for Kristyna. The Belgian held her serve and broke Pliskova's serve twice in the first set. In the second set, Van Uytvanck went up 3:0 early and Kristyna couldn't reverse it, although she managed to convert one break point. In the last set she fought off one more break point, but the second one was the end.

Deliberate slander? Ústí Zoo is looking for a new vet, no one is interested
The last time was at the end of this month. The city management attributes it to the rumours that emerged around the former zoo director and veterinarian Václav Poživil that he purposely killed the exotic animals in his care. For example, the female rhinoceros Zamba, the elephant Kala or the orangutan Ňuňák.
The city council has therefore issued a new contract. "For veterinary care for the zoo with an estimated value of performance of CZK 3.5 million excluding VAT and for the city's Centre for Animals in Need with an estimated value of performance of CZK 2.8 million excluding VAT," said city spokesperson Romana Macová.
Deputy Mayor Věra Nechybová (UFO) explained that this is the third time the city has announced a competition for veterinary services. "Dr Poživil had to explain the unfounded suspicions. I consider it an outrageous dishonesty of such a high-quality professional," she noted.
She said there are very few experts specialising in exotic animals. "It's certainly not a nice thing to do. Meanwhile, the zoo is providing veterinary care through orders," she said. Orders and contract cost the same money. "But the zoo has to comply with the law on public procurement as far as financing is concerned," zoo spokeswoman Nikola Roštejnská explained.
Václav Poživil himself is a respected expert. For example, he took part in a unique operation in which the cheetah Jane from Ústí nad Labem received the world's first total endoprosthesis. He served as the zoo's director from 2009 to 2012. He has not commented on the anonymous defamation of his person. He did not take phone calls or respond to text messages yesterday.
As for the zoo contract, some zookeepers believe that the zero interest in it may not necessarily be due to fears of such purposeful accusations as in his case, but simply a lack of awareness. For example, Jiří Král, a veterinarian in Ústí nad Labem, has not heard of it yet. "This is the first time I have heard it from you. No one has approached us. I think this kind of thing will spread quickly," he said.
Mostecký autodrom launches new e-shop
Customers of the Mostecký autodrom can use a new e-shop on its website.
They can now also buy coupons for free and test drives by car or motorcycle on the large racing circuit, which was previously only possible in person at the autodrom employee in the starting tower.
"We have improved the e-shop to make it more user-friendly, while expanding the portfolio of products and services that can be purchased through it.
At the same time, on this occasion, we have prepared a bonus for our customers in the form of a CZK 1,000 discount on all safe driving courses from our offer.
The discount coupon can be found at www.autodrom-most.cz," explained Jana Svobodová, Sales and Marketing Director of AUTODROM MOST.
According to her, the e-shop website is now clear and easy to navigate.
"Visitors to the e-shop can select the focus they are targeting on the bar.
For example, sports, safe or sports driving courses, training, experiential programmes, gift items, gift vouchers, activities for children and more," the director listed.
Among the new products and services offered by the e-shop are, for example, the Racing Legends collection T-shirt with a surprise, a car track, a course for safe driving in low visibility, promotional and gift items of the domestic professional racing team Buggyra Racing or Engelmuller gloves from the limited edition of the watch manufactory BOHEMATIC, created on the occasion of the historic victory in the prestigious 24 Hours of Le Mans race in 1949.
"The offer is very varied, the customer can choose from more than 200 items," said Jana Svobodová.
When paying for the selected product or service, the customer can choose one of four options.
Payment by advance payment (bank transfer), cash on delivery, cash on collection or online via a payment gateway.
Two people did not survive the crash
Two people were travelling in the plane, a man (†63) and a woman (†38). "The plane asked for permission to land at the Chaloupky airport near Klatovy at 8.30 p.m.," said police spokeswoman Dana Ladmanová. That was also the last entry, and at that time it was supposed to be near Vojovice, near Žinkovy, according to GPS coordinates.
It never made it to the Klatovy airport. The search for the lost aircraft, which sent out a distress signal, began immediately. "In addition to the police, a military helicopter got involved," said police spokeswoman Martina Korandová. But the search did not have a happy ending.
A helicopter crew spotted the wreckage in the woods near Petrovice near Měčín, about six kilometres from where the plane was last seen, just before 9am. "We found the plane and two bodies with no signs of life," Korandova confirmed.
The crashed machine remained partially wedged in tree branches, with pieces also falling to the ground nearby. "The cause of the accident will be investigated in cooperation with expert experts and the Institute for the Expert Investigation of the Causes of Aircraft Accidents," Korandová added.
The course of the illness of the majority is mild, only three percent of those infected have to go to hospital
Either a milder form of the coronavirus is spreading through the Czech Republic or the summer dose of sunshine has significantly improved our immunity.
Infectious disease wards in hospitals are half-empty, even though the numbers are rising.
"The situation today and in April is completely different and it is mainly due to the number of people hospitalised," confirms Health Minister Adam Vojtěch.
It is worth remembering that on 11 April, when the first wave of the epidemic peaked in our country, everyone wore masks, the army carried out sampling, the republic was closed and the Czechs had used up their disinfectant for a year in advance.
Yet ten people a day were dying.
Now the daily increases in the number of infected are higher, but no more than two people die each day with covid-19.
The Karviná region still has the highest number of infected people per population, and Jihlava already has similar numbers due to an outbreak at the local Alzheimer's centre, where 57 people are already infected - 40 clients and 17 staff.
Another home for the elderly has been closed by health officials in Černožice in the Hradec Králové Region.
Tests have confirmed the disease in one of the nurses.
"We are shivering, we have restricted movement, we have all the hygiene measures in place," says Martin Scháněl, the director of the retirement home.
According to him, none of the home's clients have symptoms of the disease so far.
Hygienists will start testing tomorrow and then decide on further measures.
Hospitals are also responding to the increased number of infected people.
The Oncology Institute in Brno today launched an automatic camera system at the entrance, which will detect if people are wearing a veil when they enter.
South Bohemian sanitary workers have reported a record twenty-five cases of coronavirus - most of them foreign employees of a company in Prachatice.
In total, 131 people were infected on Saturday - half of Friday's number - but fewer are being tested over the weekend.
The only ones. Reproduction is not certain, but we don't need to be scared.
Some words have unfortunate connotations, even if they only convey the state of affairs. These include the word "only child. It refers to a child growing up without siblings, but it doesn't sound neutral. "You know, an only child," one says, with nothing to add. Interestingly, this is a trait that "only child" has carried since ancient times, back when terms like "demographic crisis" were not widely used.
Today, even people outside the scientific community know that a fertility rate of 2.1 children per woman is necessary to ensure simple reproduction of the population. It is also widely known that no country in Europe today achieves this figure. At most, France and Sweden come close, but European countries do not have a simple reproduction rate. (Within the West, only Israel stands out with a fertility rate of 3.1 children per woman.) It is a situation made for alarmism. "There are almost as many only children as two-child families," she told LN in an interview. But she left out the devil hidden in the details.
Yes, it is good when the problem is highlighted instead of being downplayed or ideologized. For example, as in Germany, where the campaign for more children can easily be labelled fascist (in the style of "Hitler supported it"). It's good to be reminded that many couples are directly planning for only children. It is good if politicians show a willingness to remove the barriers that lead to these decisions (for example, the poor uptake of working from home discourages women from further pregnancies). But despite all this, let's point out one thing.
When Minister Maláčová says that "there are almost as many only children", there is a grain of demagoguery. That statement was appropriate twenty years ago. Let us recall that fertility in the Czech Republic last ensured simple reproduction in 1980 ("Husák's children"). Then it declined to an appalling 1.14 in 2000. But since then it has risen by almost 50 per cent, to the current 1.70 children per woman, which is above the European average. This is still not enough for simple reproduction, so politicians need to be active. They can only tone down the alarmism a little.
Neckermann cancels all flights, five hundred Czech clients affected
Neckermann is cancelling flights in connection with the insolvency of British Thomas Cook and his German daughter.
"The Czech company Thomas Cook, s.r.o., operating under the business name Neckermann Travel Agency, has not filed for insolvency," Šrámek said in a press release.
"However, Neckermann CK is forced to continue to cancel scheduled departures of its clients," he added, adding that this currently applies to all departures from September 26 to October 6.
According to Šrámek, the cancellations will affect around 500 clients. The 800 Neckermann clients who are currently abroad, he said, "will be taken care of and their safe return to the Czech Republic on their scheduled flights is assured".
The travel agency admitted that some clients had been asked to pay for their stay. "In this case, it is necessary for clients to contact the SOS line of CK Neckermann immediately," Šrámek added.
Thomas Cook's collapse occurred on Monday. In August this year, the travel agency entered into a deal under which creditors were to inject £900m into the firm.
Half of the sum was to be obtained from the Chinese company Fosun Tourism, which was to become the majority owner. The other half was to be provided by bondholders and creditor banks. However, as early as 20 September, it was reported that the creditors had demanded that the travel agency obtain a reserve of £200 million or the deal would fall through. By then, on Monday, the company had already announced that it had gone bust.
Jaromir Soukup has spoken out about Gott: He wishes him peace of mind
Presenter and businessman Jaromir Soukup (50) does not shy away from any question. In his show "Call and Write to the Boss" he publicly comments on various topics. And he is no stranger to tabloid cases, which he glosses over in a sparkling and witty manner. Although he wasn't laughing this time.
Jaromír Soukup commented on the sad news of Karel Gott's very serious illness. He promised the singer one very considerate thing for himself.
"You know, Karel has fallen ill and he said it fairly, without the tabloid journalists poking around. I don't want to comment on it, it's a serious illness, we all respect Karel Gott immensely. And I wish him a successful treatment and, above all, peace! Peace, which he needs now," stated the owner of Barrandov television.
"I wish the media would leave him alone. And wait for the news that the Master himself decides to give to the media. I don't even like the various statements about what his old friends and various celebrities think about his health. And I can say for our media that we will only cover his illness and his person if he expresses interest in it. I think other media should consider a similar approach."
Mahulena Bochanova has broken her year-long detox and is sinning again!
More than a year ago, Mahulena Bočanová confided to Blesk that she had quit alcohol. "During the holidays, I decided to give my old 50-year-old body a breather. I gave myself a deadline of forever. I feel terribly rested, I have a lot of energy and, most importantly, my psyche has improved. I haven't been doing well mentally lately. I'm getting up better, I don't have a headache, I have more energy, more money."
A year's abstinence was reportedly enough and the actress found her way to alcohol again. "Sometimes I'll have a bubbly or a fine wine, but I don't drink what I used to. I'll have one drink and have fun until the morning. I might have a bottle of wine in my fridge for a week. I also like non-alcoholic beer, which I can drink anytime," boasted Mahulena, who is still a couple with Brno businessman Petr.
Bočanová has also returned to the theatre season after the holidays and will be joining the Ordinace in the Rose Garden series. "I'm ashamed of the first two performances, I was really bad, I overreacted. But it's getting better," smiles the actress critically.
The couple wrapped the bitch in tape and drowned her in the river, the children found the bag
The case took place at the end of July in a village around Valašské Klobouk. A 27-year-old woman brought home a donated dog, aged one to two years, which she wanted to take care of. However, her partner, who was ten years older, did not like the fact that it was a bitch, so he decided to get rid of it.
"He wrapped the animal with duct tape and rope and greatly eliminated its vocal expression. He placed the dog in a jute bag, which he tied up. Then they drove the animal together to the river, where they dumped it in the bag. At the moment when the dog was thrown into the water, the dog was demonstrably alive," said Zlín police spokeswoman Monika Kozumplíková.
The following day, children playing by the river found the jute bag on the bank. When they opened it, they discovered the body of a dead dog inside. They called out to a woman who was passing by and ran away. The woman reported the incident to the police emergency line 158.
"Thanks to the knowledge of the town's residents, the police have identified the likely perpetrator of this incredible act. And they weren't wrong. Both the man and the woman confessed to the crime and described how the incident took place," the police spokeswoman added.
An expert opinion from the field of veterinary medicine confirmed that the dog died in an unequivocally agonizing manner as a result of suffocation, with the animal suffering for several minutes before dying.
"The actions of the perpetrators undoubtedly show a clear intention to get rid of the animal at any cost in this despicable way, even though they could have donated or sold the dog. The criminal police commissioner from Zlín charged the pair with the crime of animal cruelty committed in complicity. If convicted, the two accused could spend up to three years behind bars," Kozumplíková said.
Declaration of the end of the right in the lower house or What kind of "right-wing" coalition of ODS, TOP 09, STAN and KDU?
Recently, media and commentaries have been reporting on the upcoming coalition of the aforementioned parties. Many are applauding the fact that the "right" is finally getting its act together, but I rather wonder why these parties still call themselves right-wing.
Leaving aside the new Trikolora movement, the Czech Chamber of Deputies no longer has a real right-wing party. And it doesn't matter what the entities call themselves or what labels the mainstream media parrot. ODS is hardly centrist in its average of top politicians of this party, TOP 09 is clearly a party of the urban pseudo-liberal left (which is ashamed of its leftism and so hypocritically labels itself as conservative or even right-wing). STAN is a party that in its conception, ideology and electoral targeting is basically merged with TOP 09 (the reason for its existence is simply not clear to me). And the KDU even labels itself as centrist for a long time - but their political compass is much more to the left than they say.
Do you feel I've taken everyone out of the same water? No, I'm basing it on the actual policy actions of these parties. If I consider myself to be a classically liberal right-wing voter, my highest value is individual liberty, the free market and minimal government interference in the lives of individuals and the economy. How do these parties fulfil this general assumption of right-wingness? How many laws chopping away at people's freedoms in a salami-slicing fashion, raising taxes, endorsing new regulations and increasing surveillance, increasing ties to the socialist EU, or promoting environmental and gender madness have they supported in recent years? A lot, really a lot. Not their own labels, but actions identify them. These parties, despite all sorts of declarations or partial concessions, want to strengthen the role of the state in our lives. And that has nothing to do with right-wingism.
I would not be surprised at all by the coalition cooperation of TOP 09, STAN and KDU, they simply belong together on the political map and, apart from the Christian or, on the contrary, homosexual and gender aspects, I do not see any obvious difference for voters in terms of the influence of the state on their lives. However, the ODS has long portrayed itself as "the only right-wing party" and by associating itself with these three entities it is already revealing its true political alignment in a disingenuous way.
By the way, since I briefly mentioned the labels. Have you noticed how often all these parties quite uniformly and cheaply label critics of the dirigisme and socialism coming from the European Union as pro-Russian agents? Can they not or just do not want to understand that there are many people who do not like Euro-socialism and growing unfreedom as much as they do the authoritarian regime in Russia? Are they not hiding their utter argumentative incompetence and their gratuitous or blind adoration of the EU?
In short, it is possible that in the Czech Republic politics other than centrist politics no longer has a chance of greater success. Perhaps this is the kind of association the voters really want. Perhaps they want left-of-centre politics under the guise of 'right' because they are ashamed of their political convictions (or cannot even identify them). I don't know. But I am certainly not one of those voters.
Debutant champion!
Van den Bergh finishes the tale, sweeps Anderson
The big surprise of the tournament, Dimitri van den Bergh, put in an outstanding performance against the player who won the second most prestigious event in the PDC in 2018.
The start of the match was evenly matched on both sides, with the break coming at 8:7 for the Belgian darter.
Van den Bergh took the break with a 13-dart leg and had the upper hand from then on.
He literally crushed his opponent with his game and the much more experienced "Flying Scotsman" had a hard time getting doubles.
The way the "Dream Maker" had him in his grasp was evidenced by the fact that the unhinged Anderson only played his first maximum in the 24th leg.
In addition, the young Belgian handled the high checkcuts superbly.
His last loss was in Leg 11, but he "caught a big fish" in the bad situation and closed with 170.
Anderson's frustration was evident at the end of the match.
He was throwing his darts away and his triumphant opponent was doing an absolute masterful job.
Van den Bergh converted the first of three match darts and lived up to his name - he wrote his big dream.
Winning the trophy named after Phil Taylor is all the more valuable for the Belgian darts player as it is his first major win.
It remains the case that the last player to beat van den Bergh was Karel Sedlacek.
Babiš called for security cooperation at the memorial to the victims of terror
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš and his wife Monika visited the Ground Zero memorial to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in New York on September 27, 2019.
Terrorism is the main enemy against which all countries of the world should fight together. Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš said this today at the end of a five-day visit to the United States at the New York memorial to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. On this occasion, the Prime Minister paid tribute to the memory of two victims of Czech origin.
"This is a very moving place," the Prime Minister said as he, accompanied by his wife Monika, laid a white rose at the names of Lukáš Rambousek and Czechoslovak emigrant Alena Sešínová. The two were among the more than 2,750 people killed in the attack by hijacked planes on the former twin skyscrapers of the World Trade Center (WTC). The WTC towers collapsed after the impact, and a memorial with a list of names of the victims now stands in their place.
"We need to remember what happened here, the horror," Babiš said. The prime minister described the September 11, 2001 attack on the United States as a reason why the UN should work together in a united campaign against international terrorism. In addition to destroying the WTC skyscrapers, the terrorists then crashed a hijacked plane into the Department of Defense building in Washington and planned another strike on a target in Washington, presumably the White House or Congress. But this plane crashed when the passengers confronted the hijackers.
"This is our main enemy, this is where all the countries of the world should unite and fight international terrorism in a coordinated way," the Czech prime minister said.

Czechs in Europe by Ondřej Houska: Should Czechoslovakia have rejected the Munich Agreement and gone to war with Germany in 1938? Three times NO
Undated image shows Adolf Hitler visiting Czechoslovak border fortifications. The role of the forts was never to stop the German army, but to slow its advance before the Allies became involved.
If, almost exactly 81 years ago, Czechoslovakia had rejected the Munich Agreement and subsequently faced a German attack, what would have taken the most Czechoslovak soldiers out of the fight? German tanks, air force, or perhaps artillery? Quite possibly it would have been none of these weapons, even though the Germans had overwhelming superiority over the Czechoslovaks in them. The Czechoslovak army would probably have suffered the greatest losses - because of the blisters.
In Nantes, a man confessed to the cathedral fire.
The Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul in the heart of Nantes caught fire last Saturday, and the fire severely damaged the original 16th century stained glass windows and destroyed the organ.
The suspected arson was being investigated by investigators due to the fact that the fire progressed through the cathedral from three different locations.
At the same time, police found no signs at the entrances that anyone had forced their way into the cathedral.
The accused is a volunteer with the local diocese, a thirty-nine-year-old Rwandan refugee.
Police arrested him shortly after the fire but then released him without prosecuting him.
Now the prosecutor's office has reported that based on new evidence, the man was re-arrested on Saturday, confessed and faces charges of arson.
If found guilty, he faces up to ten years in prison and a hefty fine.
According to his lawyer, the man regrets the crime and has decided to cooperate fully with investigators, Le Monde reported.
Zeman the monument keeper - Man straining constitution calls for law enforcement
Those who live in a camp-divided society and don't want to go completely mad will welcome situations where they don't have to root only for their own. When he can also give credit to those he otherwise criticizes. If only so that he does not feel that he is oriented only according to pre-assigned labels. Such situations include the list of badly damaged monuments that President Zeman uses during his favourite trips to the regions.
Everyone knows what it is. And anyone who occasionally wanders through the Czech Republic sees many of these devastated monuments - from the centres of historic towns to individual castles, monasteries, old houses, churches and estates - with their own eyes. Everyone suspects that demagoguery can come into play here too. That if we accuse the town hall of not caring for monuments or some horror in the zoning plan, it may be the work of former administrations. Or a privatised building whose owner is untraceable. The head of state challenges local politicians: "A section of the Landmarks Act allows you to fine owners of buildings who don't take care of their property." But even if the owner is untraceable, it must be admitted that the president is calling for law enforcement. Which even critics of his Constitution-bending should acknowledge as a plus.
Of course, Miloš Zeman would not be Miloš Zeman if he considered all the details and formalities of a complex issue. But he is standing up for a good cause, much like the squatters he himself does not recognize. Two years ago, we wrote: "For all the name-calling, the squatters draw attention to an issue that stands outside the current concern. That this or that building is in a state of disrepair." And let's face it, the president is de facto doing the same thing.
If you come to the historic centre of Jáchymov, you are amazed at how devastated it is - including the houses with Renaissance cores. At a time when Jáchymov is celebrating 500 years of silver mining and the minting of thalers (dollars to Americans). Why? Because of a quick-fire sale of houses in the 1990s, local officials say. But why is it that Ostrov, seven kilometres away, the seat of the Šlik family who minted the Jáchymov thalers, has its historic core nicely repaired? It is good if the president draws attention to these things.
Vojtěch: On Monday we will introduce a "traffic light" for epidemiological measures
The new system is supposed to act as a pandemic plan, for the absence of which the government and the Ministry of Health are facing criticism.
"The grades will be according to the strength of the community spread," the minister explained.
He added that currently, for example, the Moravian-Silesian region or Prague would reach the medium, orange level.
The system is designed to be regional because the situation varies significantly from region to region, he added.
The ministry worked with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (IHIS) on the system.
The minister said specific measures would be linked to the different levels, whether it was the obligation to wear masks or the organisation of special wards in hospitals.
Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) called for the creation of an epidemiological plan on the Prima Partie television programme, saying that people should have clear information on what measures they can expect if the epidemiological situation worsens.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has been rising in recent days, although the number of people hospitalised remains low.
Vojtěch commented that nothing major is happening and it is not appropriate to talk about declaring a state of emergency or reconvening the crisis staff.
In view of the rising number of infected people, the government has reintroduced the obligation to wear masks at indoor events of over 100 people since Saturday across the country.
From Monday, the capacity of such events will be limited to 500 people, currently at 1,000.
The government's action, which did not make it clear until the last minute what measures would take effect or when they would be announced, has been criticised.
"I think that in a situation that is quite tense, the main actors should create a sense of certainty and, on the contrary, straighten out the confusion," Senator Marek Hilšer said in his Questions.
The measures may already vary by region, for example, in Prague from Sunday the obligation to wear masks also applies in non-residential medical facilities, i.e. in pharmacies or in waiting rooms at the doctor's office.
Since Friday, the obligation to wear balaclavas when visiting health and social care facilities and pharmacies has also been introduced in the Liberec and Ústí regions.
In the Vysočina region of Jihlava, it has been compulsory to wear balaclavas in indoor public areas, public transport and health facilities since 14 July.
On the other hand, in the Moravian-Silesian Region, anti-epidemic measures have been relaxed, as well as in the Central Bohemian Region in Kutná Hora.
In early June, the Czech government also approved the so-called traffic light for Europe, which differentiates the level of risk of infection in individual European countries by colour and adjusts the rules for entry into the Czech Republic from these countries accordingly.
For low- and medium-risk countries, the authorities have not required Czech citizens to have a negative coronavirus test or ordered quarantine instead since 15 June.
These are compulsory when Czechs return from high-risk countries.
At the moment, all EU member states are now in the low-risk category.
Costa Rica is a champion in the fight against climate change
Costa Rica received the title for several reasons. For starters, for its plan to be carbon neutral by 2050 - something many countries have committed to under the Paris Agreement. The Central American nation, with a population of around five million, produces only 0.4 percent of the world's emissions. Costa Rica has also pledged to switch fully to renewable energy by 2030, with 70 percent of its buses or taxis running on electricity.
The official tourism organization says that roughly 95 percent of its energy already comes from renewable sources - in 2017, Costa Rica ran on them for a total of 300 days.
Costa Rica boasts nearly 30 national parks.
The density of forestation also contributes to reduced emissions. The rainforests with their diverse flora and fauna, which cover more than half of the country, are also one of the main tourist draws. "Costa Rica is a pioneer in conservation and sets an example for other countries in the region, as well as around the world. Climate change requires urgent action from all of us," the UN said in a statement.
Costa Rica boasts nearly 30 national parks, which is a lot considering the country's small size (51,100 square kilometers). Rain or mist forests, coral reefs or mangrove swamps are home to five percent of the world's biodiversity. The country also has volcanoes, pitoreal waterfalls and you would also find several rescue stations for sloths.
Spare the planet. Scientists' Night starts in Prague
"In Prague, I would definitely visit the CTU to see a model of what smart cities will look like. At Charles University, I would visit the Institute of Anatomy at the Faculty of Medicine, which is not open to the public at other times," advises Jitřenka Navrátilová, the national coordinator of the Night of Scientists.
The Institute of Anatomy offers a tour of the dissection room and the opportunity to try working with surgical instruments.
"Then I would go to the Czech University of Life Sciences and watch the film The Green Desert," Navrátilová adds. Guided tours will also be offered in nine laboratories. The motto of this year's Night of Scientists is "sparing the planet".
Wife swap: Ondra was cruelly abused by his parents! He ended up in an institution
It was nerve-wracking. The allegedly troubled son Ondrej (9) was severely punished by his father every moment. "He came home from school and lied with his snack. Lukáš looked at me and said he would kneel as punishment," Lucie described in Výměna. Dad Lukáš made little Ondra kneel in the corner for hours! Off-camera, he reportedly had to suffer like that on a wooden foot massage mat! "Ondřej came to me after the filming and told me - auntie, I'm only making these troubles and remarks so that I won't be here, because I want to go to an institution," Lucie described the moment when she fully understood what was going on behind the door of the studio apartment. And the boy's wish finally came true...
His condition was so serious that he was taken away from his family after the shooting and placed for a month in the Centre for Educational Care in České Budějovice. He returned briefly to his father and surrogate mother Aneta (28), but then he went to a diagnostic institute for troubled children. "When I came home, Aneta immediately added me on Facebook, we wrote for a while. She was mostly interested in whether we had received money. I hardly reacted to that at all. But then she texted me that the little one was in an institution, then they returned him to them, now he's in a diagnostic centre. They are both out of work," says Lucie, a mother from Plzeň.
Of course, Blesk also contacted the other side, but received only a vague answer. "I'm not in the mood, I'm sick, call back later," Aneta said and hung up the phone.
Přindiš, Prskavec and Fišerová safely advanced to the semi-finals of the World Championships
Kayakers Vít Přindiš and Jiří Prskavec and canoeist Tereza Fišerová safely advanced to the semi-finals of the World Slalom Championships in Seu d'Urgell. Prindiš was fourth, Prskavec fifth and Fišerová eighth in Friday's qualification. Three more Czech athletes will be in Spain to try to reach the semi-finals in the afternoon qualifying heat.
Vavrinec Hradilek failed to make it out of the strong group of national kayakers, receiving a fifty-second penalty for a misjudgement at the start of the heat. Přindiš and Prskavec, on the other hand, can rest and concentrate on Sunday's semi-final.
"I set myself the goal of making it to the top 30 in the first run, which I managed to do. It's not that I didn't care how I finished, because Sunday's start is very early in the morning, so I was hoping to be a little higher to get a better starting position," said Přindiš, praising his comfort in Seu. "Before the patrol race I felt the worst I've felt in the 14 days we've been here. But then during the race it was good and today it was better again. It's beautiful here all the time, nice races, the spectators came, so it's good," he smiled.
Prskavec was also happy. "In qualifying you don't want to make any unnecessary mistakes. In the first gates I was not good at all. Then I drove the middle very well, without any problems and I knew I had mileage, so the second mistake came when I wanted to go down the straight and I turned the wheel. Overall, I can't be unhappy. The form is there, let's see how it goes," said this year's overall World Cup winner.
Both athletes praised the fact that they will go for the start at the end of the semi-final block on Sunday. "I'm not an early bird, plus it's cold here in the mornings and when you're here at eight o'clock you need a jacket and a sweatshirt," said Prindiš. "All in all, the semifinals take an hour and a half, which is a pretty good difference in terms of sleep," Prskavec agreed.
Of the three Czech women's singles canoeists, only Fišerová succeeded, Eva Říhová finished two places behind the top 20, while Kateřina Havlíčková was 35th. "I did the upper part as I wanted, in the middle passage I felt like I was not keeping up and not going according to plan, but I managed to get into a comfortable track that I wanted to ride. I made two shuffles and I'm just behind the winner with a clear time. I have a good starting position for the semi-final," praised Fischer.

Thank you for the dance! Singer Leonard Cohen's final album to be released posthumously
The album Thank You for the Dance will include unreleased material and various musical collaborations put together by the singer's son. The album will be released on November 22.
In October 2016, You Want it Darker, an album Cohen collaborated on with his son Adam, was released. He asked him to help him finish each song. On the intimate recording, Cohen symbolically comes to terms with his impending death. He died a month after the album's release at the age of 82.
Seven months later, Adam Cohen began working on the material left over from his father. He brought in a number of musicians to collaborate with him - Damien Rice, Bryce Dessner, Javier Mas and singer Beck, to name a few.
"When we came up with the music for my father's words, we used his own distinctive musical techniques. So he's still with us," Adam Cohen said of the album. "What impresses me most about it is the reaction of those who have heard it. One by one they say Leonard is still alive," he added.
The album's first swallow is the short song The Goal. "I'm almost alive, I'm almost home," Cohen sings in his trademark honeyed voice. He was singing about death, sensing he wouldn't live to see the release of the new material. He admitted as much in an interview with The New Yorker magazine a month before his death. "I'm ready to die. I hope it won't be too unpleasant," he said.
In September 2018, Adam Cohen released a collection of his father's poetry called The Flame. It will be published in English as The Flame on December 31 by Argo.
On holiday with a credit card? NEO Account offers free ATM withdrawals worldwide!
According to surveys, about half of all Czechs who go abroad have already got used to paying directly by card. The main reasons include convenience, security, but also the possibility to use travel insurance, which is often associated with a payment card.
The convenience of paying by card can be appreciated by travellers in almost all parts of the world. This is especially true in popular tourist destinations, but today credit cards are accepted almost everywhere. "People who travel more frequently, for example for work, don't have time to go to exchange offices repeatedly to exchange cash. And even 'holiday makers' don't want to rely on cash to make ends meet. Moreover, some foreign currencies are not even available in Czech banks or exchange offices. Therefore, we have solved this with the NEO account so that its users can withdraw cash from all ATMs, wherever they are, free of charge," says Kateřina Petko, Marketing and Communications Director and Spokesperson of Expobank CZ.
Moreover, a payment card is a much more reliable way to avoid losing your money than cash. If a full wallet is lost, its owner may never see the money he or she was carrying in it again. However, if he loses only his payment card, he can easily block it instantly by phone or through online banking. By acting quickly, he may not suffer any financial loss at all. "Keeping money in a bank account has other advantages besides its reliable protection. In the case of the NEO account, for example, the interest rate of 1.6% per annum is one of the highest among current and savings accounts. It is set up and managed completely online without the need to visit a branch. In addition, the money in the bank account is insured up to EUR 100,000 and the maintenance of the account is completely free," adds Kateřina Petko.
Travel insurance should be a matter of course for anyone who is going abroad. Thanks to the possibility of arranging it and paying by card online, this can be done even at the last minute. However, the mere possession of a credit card often means insurance protection when travelling. "For example, with the embossed MasterCard Gold and MasterCard Business cards, travel insurance is an integral part of foreign travel to all countries around the world. Holders of these cards can also insure the family they are travelling with. This often eliminates the need for any additional arrangements," adds Kateřina Petko from Expobank CZ. However, it is always advisable to check the scope of the insurance, i.e. whether it covers all the activities that the travellers plan to undertake.
The Ministry plans to introduce a flat-rate meal allowance from 2021.
The Ministry of Finance is preparing an amendment to the Income Tax Act, according to which the employee would receive money for meals directly. According to the Ministry of Finance, a quarter of employees, i.e. about one million people who do not receive meal vouchers yet, will be eligible for food support.
However, according to David Rýc, chairman of the Association of Voucher System Operators, many small companies that do not have a canteen or meal vouchers provide their employees with meals, for example by importing food or by making agreements with restaurants.
"The essence of the intention is that we do not change anything about the tax advantage. Furthermore, it will not be used to pay health and social insurance," Schiller said on Friday. She added that the limit for the maximum employer contribution applicable as a tax credit would also remain.
The Income Tax Act allows companies to reimburse a maximum of 55 percent of the cost of a meal voucher. The remainder is paid by the employee, and in some cases the employer, but without the tax credit. The most favourable value of the meal voucher for both employees and employers this year is CZK 123.
Bloomberg: Venezuela has hidden bitcoins and doesn't know what to do with them
Venezuela's central bank is conducting internal tests to see if it can hold cryptocurrencies. It's responding to a directive from state-owned Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), which is seeking to be able to send bitcoins and ethers to the central bank and then have the bank pay the oil firm's suppliers in cryptocurrencies. The staff is also studying a proposal to allow the central bank to count cryptocurrencies against foreign exchange reserves, which are now near a 30-year low. Citing information from four sources, Bloomberg reported.
Sanctions imposed by the United States on President Nicolás Maduro's authoritarian regime have largely cut Venezuela off from the global financial system. This has exacerbated the economic crisis in the country. Meanwhile, the current crisis is one of the most serious in global comparison, which has forced officials to use a mixture of different methods to move money around. While Maduro's efforts to launch the world's first state-owned cryptocurrency have failed, the ongoing efforts to use digital currencies show how desperate the government is to find ways around the restrictions.
Neither the Venezuelan central bank nor PDVSA responded to a request for comment.
It is not clear how PDVSA came to own bitcoins and ether, nor how much value it holds in these currencies. The company has struggled to get payments from customers through conventional channels because large banks are unwilling to do business with sanctioned entities. Last month, the company received most of a $700 million (16.6 billion) payment in Chinese yuan because the parties were unable to find financial institutions to facilitate the transaction.
PDVSA may be reluctant to sell cryptocurrencies on the open market because it would require it to register with the exchange and undergo due diligence, so-called due diligence. Instead, it wants the cryptocurrency to be used by the central bank to pay the entities to which PDVSA owes money. Oil company officials believe that the central bank is less exposed to potential obstacles that could arise when paying with cryptocurrency.
Bitcoins and ethers use a decentralized internet ledger known as a blockchain to verify and record transactions. In some cases, relatively anonymous transfers are enabled without the need for an intermediary. Few banks are engaging in digital currencies because of the money laundering and customer information issues that come with them and complicate compliance.
Cryptocurrencies are experiencing a comeback this year after the debacle of 2018 due to expectations of greater adoption by institutions and Facebook's plan to come up with its own cryptocurrency. Even so, they remain volatile. Bitcoin is down nearly 20 percent in the last four days, but has gained about 130 percent since the beginning of the year.
Jan Sindelar's comment: Run the railways like a business
Sky's election, while apparently not entirely smooth, is the culmination of a sad tale of the state's inability to give the railways clear direction. The board has been incomplete for over a year and even after Wednesday night that hasn't changed, as one of the members has resigned. The standstill continues.
The selection process itself was a farce from the start, if only because the requirements for candidates, especially in terms of experience, were significantly relaxed. Compared to last year's selection, the requirements for the size of the company in which the candidate had worked in the past were reduced. First the members of the selection committee and then the supervisory board played only the role of pimps.
Nebeský submitted probably the weakest professional CV of the five finalists, yet without experience from a large company he beat out experienced fighters from the management of logistics giants and transport companies. It was the participation of interesting managers from the private sector that was probably the brightest aspect (and the best hope) of the whole process. Today, those involved know that they played only the role of stage sets in a political game.
Perhaps Nebeský will surprise, show great talent and eventually emerge as the best rail boss ever. At least in the beginning, however, he will be accompanied by the aftertaste of political embarrassment. The Czech Railways will not face an easy period, they have to cope with competition in the liberalisation of the market and with a shortage of staff in operations. There is a shortage of drivers, shunters and mechanics. How can they be motivated to continue working and respect the management if the state behaves like an elephant in the china shop in the top management?
The second important group is the creditors. We will see how they interpret the games at the top of the railways next spring when the railways defend their rating. What is certain is that creditors perceive instability. The sad thing is that someone else goes to Moody's every year to defend the rating on behalf of ČD. The agency has not escaped the frequent changes in the management of ČD and the political influence on the company, and has criticised them already this summer.
The ANO movement advocates, among other things, that the state should be run like a company. For a start, it would be enough if one large state-owned company were run like a company and not like a state. Czech Railways is still one of the largest companies in the country and it would be good if it were run by the best. They have applied, but the state has snubbed them. It can certainly be argued that the post of head of the railways has always been a political matter. But then we can forgive the antics of the selection process.
An unusually open and unique image of Karel Gott in Olga Špátová's feature-length documentary
This unique film from the work of Olga Špátová will premiere in Czech cinemas next spring.
"In mid-September last year, Ivanka and Karel Gott called me and asked me if I would make a documentary about his life with Karel again after ten years. I didn't hesitate a minute! It was and is a great honour for me to film with a man who endured more than half a century in the limelight of Czech culture thanks to his exceptional singing talent, artistic humility and immeasurable diligence. I accepted the challenge to make a feature-length documentary about Karel Gott, whose art has brought joy to three generations of listeners, as a commitment to this legendary singer," says director Olga Špátová.
The first day of filming took place on 22 October last year thanks to a quick arrangement and agreement, and the last shots with Karel Gotts were filmed a few days ago. The goal was and is absolutely clear - to capture authentically Karel Gott as a phenomenal singer who gives himself away to his fans, as a painter, but also as a loving husband and father of his children. A man who for sixty years has been giving joy to several generations with his songs, not only in this country, but also in Europe, and indeed all over the world. A man who has etched himself into the hearts and souls of his listeners by simply being.
The film is not meant to be a showcase of Karel Gott's undisputed fame and achievements. "That's why it's not even possible to compare my previous film, The Gott Phenomenon, with this current one. Each is different. At least in the fact that we filmed them at a different stage in Karel Gott's life, and this is very evident in the personal, almost intimate confession he gave us, which confirmed to all of us what a legend we have the opportunity to work with and spend time with, which is truly indescribable," adds Olga Špátová.
The filmmakers captured Karel Gott during his performances, during meetings with his fans in our country and in Hamburg, but especially in his home environment, whether in Prague, at his cottage in Czech Switzerland, in the village where he spent his childhood, and in other places that played an important role in his life. Thanks to Karel Gott's frank openness, the film will be completely authentic and unique.
"Olga has a great gift for filming with her close-knit team, so that we often let ourselves get carried away by the spontaneous atmosphere and naturally let her into our private lives, which allowed me to talk about quite intimate topics. With my husband, cinematographer Jan Malíř, they actually became part of our family. We originally wanted to release the film in 2019, when I celebrated my anniversary. But since I still had a wonderful summer with my family, I wanted us to film for as long as possible. Well, and since I was all over the place in 2019, my wish was to have it released in theaters next spring. This documentary is a thank you to my fans and everyone who has supported and accompanied me in my profession," says Karel Gott himself about the film.

Managers of state-owned companies are to go through a new selection process. Law will be circumvented, opposition claims
"This is a typical bill that is unnecessary," said Zbyněk Stanjura, chairman of the ODS parliamentary club.
After several unsuccessful attempts, the Chamber of Deputies has approved changes to prevent the future opaque distribution of functions - critics talk of "trafics" - in state-owned companies. Candidates would now have to go through a selection process at the relevant ministry and will also be considered by the government's personnel nominations committee.
However, this is a compromise solution, which ODS, for example, does not like because it will allegedly allow ministers to make excuses that the selection committees are responsible for any poor selection of state managers. Moreover, the opinion of the committee will not be binding on the minister. The amendment still needs to be approved by the Senate and signed by President Miloš Zeman.

The Library commemorates the anniversary of the death of Wenceslas IV with an exhibition of manuscripts
Six rare historical manuscripts from the turn of the 14th and 15th centuries, i.e. from the time of the Roman and Czech king Wenceslas IV, can be viewed today and Saturday in Prague's Klementinum. The National Library has released them from its vaults to commemorate the 600th anniversary of Wenceslas' death. This morning, librarians and restorers placed the rare originals in display cases in the Mirror Chapel. Admission to the exhibition is free, open both days from 10am to 6pm.
The exhibition of documents entitled Ad mandatum domini Regis: From the Royal Office and Library of Wenceslas IV was prepared by the library together with the National Archives. The National Archive looks at the written heritage from the reign of Wenceslas IV from the perspective of official documents and the National Library from the perspective of literary works, said Jan Vojtíšek, the author of the exhibition.
"Visitors can look forward to, for example, the work on agriculture by Peter de Crescentiis, which is basically a kind of encyclopaedia of agriculture, or the Breviary, a prayer book by one of the Benedictine nuns of St George's Monastery at Prague Castle, from the early 15th century," he listed the reasons why people should see the exhibition.
Also on display will be the Epistles of Peter of Blois, where the opening miniature H (enrico) depicts the semi-detached figure of King Henry II of England. The author of the decoration is most probably the Master of Samson's History, who, in addition to the two volumes of the Bible of Wenceslaus IV, also contributed to the decoration of a number of other manuscripts. Visitors will also see John Wycliffe's Latin collection of treatises from about 1411 to 1414.
Not a single book from the library of Wenceslaus IV has survived on Czech territory. According to experts, this library was one of the most extensive and also the most beautiful book collections in Central Europe at the time, because the young king longed to build a representative library to match the book collections of his French relatives. The library, however, disappeared soon after Wenceslas' death. Apparently it was stolen or destroyed during the Hussite conquest of the castle. A few codices were saved, however. Most of them are now owned by the Austrian National Library.
"We have a number of treasures in our collections and I am glad that they are in a condition that allows them to be displayed and made available to the public, so to speak, live and not only in the form of the digital library Manuscriptorium," said Martin Kocanda, director of the National Library.
On the day of Saturday's national holiday, a free exhibition entitled What Lies Beneath the Floor, which presents local archaeological discoveries, will also be open in Klementinum.
The Technoparty in the Benešov region continues.
It is playing at one-third capacity, it was supposed to end at noon
Hlaváčkova Lhota (Benešov Region) The Technoparty at Hlaváčkova Lhota in Benešov Region continues on Sunday evening.
A third of the original 12 music systems are still playing.
According to evening police estimates, about 500 people remain there after 8 p.m., while the original rough estimates spoke of three hundred, but in the morning there were 900, said police spokeswoman Lucie Nováková.
Originally, the technoparty was supposed to end at noon on Sunday, by which time some of the music systems had actually gone silent.
"Some have already left and others are preparing to leave.
The music production is still partly going on.
We expect that there will be a gradual disconnection and dismantling of the music systems," Nováková said.
"Police officers are still rigorously checking departing visitors to prevent drivers under the influence of alcohol or addictive substances from driving.
Drivers have the opportunity to take a preventive breath test before leaving," she added.
Dozens of riot police officers are overseeing the event, foreign police, traffic and riot police are on site and dog handlers with service dogs are also on standby.
"During today's event, police officers checked 470 people moving around the venue and 485 vehicles, 270 drivers were subjected to breath tests, six of whom got behind the wheel under the influence of alcohol," Nováková said.
A total of 95 drivers were tested by police for the presence of narcotic and psychotropic substances, of which one tested positive.
Officers also dealt with 14 traffic offences.
At the request of technoparty participants, police officers carried out 300 preventive breath tests and four preventive tests for the presence of narcotic and psychotropic substances.
About 2,000 people were at the event on Saturday morning.
If the number of participants did not decrease, the police would intervene.
Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) said this on the Prima Partie television programme.
However, the number of participants had fallen below 1,000, so the police assessed that there was no need for intervention, and neither the hygiene station nor the Ministry of Health asked for it.
Czech Television (ČT) reported on Sunday that the technoparty had spread to surrounding land whose owners had not agreed to its use for the technoparty.
It is possible that the owners of the surrounding land will seek compensation for damages.
Techno fans arrived at the meadow near Hlaváčka Lhota on Friday evening.
Police originally patrolled the meadow in Blažim, in the Benešov region, where the technoparty was held last year.
Blažim is located about 30 kilometres from Hlaváčka Lhota, where the technauts actually descended.
According to Nováková, no one came to Blažim.
Viper bite.
"The first case this year was recorded in the Železnáruda region.
A viper bit the leg of a girl, born in 2010, who was taken by her parents to the local emergency service base," regional emergency service spokeswoman Mária Svobodová told the daily, adding that the child was then taken to hospital in Klatovy.
The viper is the only venomous snake in the Czech Republic and these animals are found in higher numbers in Šumava, so it is good to be careful when walking.
However, there is no great danger from these animals.
The chances of being bitten by a viper are not very high, as they are afraid of normal contact.
And if it has the space to do so, it will happily crawl away with a loud hiss.
It will only attack if it feels very threatened - for example, if you accidentally step on it.
But even a bite is not a tragedy; its venom is very effective against small mammals, but it won't kill humans.
This can only happen if a person has a particularly weakened organism or suffers from allergies.
The risk of danger is therefore particularly high for children, the elderly and people with allergies.
"After a bite, a person often feels like vomiting, sweats, has an elevated temperature, thirst, abdominal pain and diarrhoea, and in weakened individuals and especially allergy sufferers, anaphylactic shock can occur," Miriam Gredová from the Klatovy Hospital described to the daily.
The man threatened to throw the infant out of the window.
He poured wine and threw dishes at a policewoman
After 23:00, a SWAT team entered the apartment and detained the man.
The infant was immediately taken into the care of paramedics, regional police spokeswoman Markéta Janovská said in a press release.
The man did not want to cooperate with the officers, throwing dishes, knives or pouring wine out the window at the police negotiator.
Several times during the negotiations, he intensified his threats by leaning out the window with the child in his arms.
On one occasion, he even climbed onto the window sill himself, where he growled.
Police are still investigating the man.
He does not want to disclose any further information.
Stosur will give her daughter a chance before the tennis season.
Australian tennis player Samantha Stosur will no longer take part in the coronavirus-affected season this year.
But the 36-year-old 2011 US Open champion, who became a mother in June, does not want to end her career just yet.
She plans to return to the courts next year and believes she will enjoy tennis even more than before thanks to her family and daughter.
Stosur announced on social media two weeks ago that her partner Liz Astling gave birth to daughter Genevieve in mid-June.
"I'm going to stay at home, spend time with my family, be there for all the little milestones our Evie is going to experience over the next six months and just enjoy it," the former world number one doubles player said on the Australian Open website.
The WTA Tour resumes its season, suspended since March, on August 3 with a clay tournament in Palermo.
Sapa market: raid reveals meat, fish and eggs of unknown origin
"One of the vehicles entering the premises was carrying 1,320 quail eggs of unknown origin, and in unsuitable conditions.
These eggs will also be disposed of at a rendering plant," the State Veterinary Administration said.
An inspection of the live fish stall then revealed that the seller did not have documents of origin and was not registered to sell live fish.
The market has long been considered a problem from a veterinary point of view.
Last autumn, for example, veterinarians discovered an illegal food outlet there, with nearly half a tonne of unlabelled food without proof of origin.
Most of them had no expiry date, some of the products were out of date and spoiled.
Five kilograms of cuttlefish had exceeded their expiry date by three years.
Last May, veterinarians and police officers seized 80 kilograms of food without proof of origin, including dried fish, squid and frozen ducks, some of which were mouldy.
Spilkova in steam. In Indianapolis, she's on the verge of advancing after the first round
Golfer Klara Spilkova is on the verge of advancing to the final rounds after the first round of the Tech Championship tournament in Indianapolis. On Thursday, she played two birdies and two bogeys at the LPGA series event and finished the opening day in par. With a score of 72, she is tied for 69th place, which is the projected cut.
Twenty-four-year-old Spilkova returned to the circuit a month ago after a two-month medical layoff and did not make the second half of the tournament in Portland. She took time off due to fatigue and exhaustion from her illness.
The first Czech winner of a professional tournament on the European LET series is in her first year on the LPGA Tour and so far she hasn't done too well. She has made the cut three times out of twelve tournaments, her best being 32nd in Hawaii. So she is fighting to keep her card for next season.
The tournament in Indianapolis was best played by Korean Hor Mi-chung. After the first round she has a score of -9 and a two-shot lead over her three opponents.
Police charged CzechTourism manager Ales Pangrac over promotion contracts
Police have charged former CzechTourism manager Ales Pangrac over promotion contracts. Pangrác confirmed to SeznamZprávy that he accepted the charges this week. Czech Television (ČT) reported last year that police officers were investigating contracts worth CZK 38 million in the case. Police said some of the money was going back to Pangrác, the server said. In the case, detectives were also interested in Regional Development Minister Klára Dostálová (ANO), under whose ministry CzechTourism falls. According to the server, the investigation into the case is still ongoing.
Detectives from the National Centre against Organised Crime secured evidence in the case in the second half of last November. They have been to the headquarters of the CzechTourism, the Czech Ministry for Regional Development, the Most Autodrom and the Sport Invest agency. They also took a service computer from the minister's apartment. The court order for the search of Dostalová's home, which was previously quoted by ČT, stated that in 2016, when she was deputy minister, the minister made decisions about CzechTourism's spending in favour of selected persons indirectly and outside of standard official procedure. At the time, Dostálová said she felt absolutely innocent, she had not made any mistakes, she could document everything and she was cooperating fully with the police.
According to the agency, this was misconduct by an individual. The media had previously reported that the former director of the Regional Partnership Department at CzechTourism, Ales Pangrac, had been dismissed because of the audit results. It showed that CzechTourism had concluded 48 problematic contracts.
"Yes, they accused me. But I don't want to comment any further," Pangrác told Seznam Zprávy North.

Shops destroyed, fires in the streets, riots accompanied the memorial parade
Five years ago, 43 Ayotzinapa college students went missing, despite extensive investigations, the case has not been solved. The students were allegedly detained by police in the Mexican state of Guerrero. It is unclear exactly what happened afterwards, but investigations suggest that the students apparently ended up in the hands of a local syndicate and were subsequently killed and burned, APTN reports.
A memorial parade was held in the Mexican capital on Thursday as families sought to express their frustration at the continuing failure to find answers and explain their children's disappearance.
But the mostly peaceful march was disrupted by small groups of vandals who destroyed everything in their path. Vandals destroyed shops and hotels, vandalised monuments, set fires and broke windows around the city.
Even before the march, President Andres Manuel López Obrador said he would do everything possible to catch them and asked the public for any information that would lead to clarification of the case.
More than 142 people have been arrested as part of the investigation, but not one of them has been convicted. Many of them had to be released because their human rights were violated, with investigators allegedly torturing suspects, APTN added.
Putin telephones Zelensky ahead of Donbass ceasefire, Kremlin criticises planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke by phone with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky about the situation in Donbass, where a new ceasefire is due to take effect from midnight.
According to a Kremlin statement, Putin criticised, among other things, the Ukrainian parliament's decision to hold local elections; Kiev reported that Zelensky called for the release of detained Ukrainians.
The new ceasefire was agreed on Wednesday evening by negotiators from Ukraine and Russia, backed by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
The ceasefire is due to begin after midnight on Monday night, is to be "complete and universal" and is intended to open the way for the implementation of other provisions of the peace accords.
In the interview, Putin told Zelensky that the Ukrainian parliament's decision to hold local elections contradicts the Minsk peace agreement and threatens the prospects for a settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
Ukraine's parliament decided last week that upcoming local elections would not be held in territories controlled by pro-Russian rebels.
The Minsk agreement stipulates that Kiev will regain control of the border of Ukrainian territories occupied by separatists with Russia after granting these regions broad autonomy and holding local elections there.
According to Unian, Zelensky's office said the two statesmen agreed on the usefulness of the upcoming ceasefire in Donbas as well as the need to implement other measures to promote peace in the region, such as demining areas of fighting or withdrawing some troops from the frontline.
Zelensky also called on Putin to release Ukrainians detained in eastern Ukraine, the occupied Crimea peninsula and in Russia itself.
The Minsk agreement has helped stop the fighting, but people continue to die on both sides of the front in sporadic gun battles and artillery attacks.
The conflict in Donbas has claimed over 14,000 lives since the spring of 2014.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of militarily supporting the separatists, a charge Moscow denies.
Zelensky has made ending the war in Donbas his priority, but there has been no major breakthrough in negotiations.
And where are the spectators? Doha can't be London
At the same time, however, the pilgrimage to Doha is a step backwards, as athletics voluntarily and knowingly renounced the thrilling atmosphere that prevailed in the sold-out stadium at London 2017 and at last year's European Championships in Berlin.
Giant banners on the walls of Doha's skyscrapers invite to "the biggest sporting event of 2019". However, concerns are growing about how dignified its backdrop will be.
"Tickets for the finish are sold out on all nights," say organisers.
Only that's too little.
The upper gallery of the Khalifa stadium, with a total capacity of 40,000 spectators, is already covered with colourful tarpaulins, which also display the flags of the 209 participating countries. Athletics has ventured into territory in Qatar where it has no roots despite the annual Diamond League meeting.
No wonder, then, that only 50,000 tickets were sold in total for the ten days of the championships last week, even though their price started at 60 Qatari rials, or less than 400 crowns.
The organisers have now set themselves the target of filling the uncovered parts of the stands at least half full. That is why, according to sources in the British newspaper Giuardian, they are reportedly (although the organisers themselves deny it) giving away free tickets to migrant workers and children. Sebastian Coe, the head of the IAAF Athletics Association, can comment positively: "This is how we can inspire the next generation."
Wealthy Qatar has won world championships in handball and cycling in the past, and after athletics comes football in 2022. The oil superpower's financial bids will always be lucrative even for wealthy sports federations. This is the reality of today's sporting world.
But even if we accept it, and ignore the absence of fans in the stadium, we cannot help but sigh in a purely sporting way that the experiment with the first outdoor World Athletics Championships in the Arabian Peninsula should have been better timed by IAAF leaders - and for a different year. The extremely late date, forced by the climate, upsets the whole scheme of the pre-Olympic season and thus the preparation for the crucial Olympic season, which would normally start in October for the athletes.
Hopefully Qatar will at least make up for it with technological innovations that promise to make the championships ultra-modern and attractive. Isn't it 37 degrees right now? Already the stadium area is artificially air-conditioned to twenty-four. And advanced cameras, built right into the blocks, are meant to give even TV viewers a close-up view of what is happening in the athletes' minds in the hundredths of a second before and just after the starter's shot.

Rykl is unexpected decathlon champion, Novotná dominates the heptathlon
Defending champion of the last two titles Dolezal failed to finish the 400 at the end of Saturday's program, Kopecky did not jump a base in the pole vault on Sunday.
The decathlon was long dominated by Latvian athlete Reinis Kregers, who is training in the group of coach Josef Karas, but withdrew after the discus.
Rykl had two bronze medals from the outdoor World Championships so far, and this time he was the only decathlete to break the 7,000 mark.
Other medals behind him went to Vilém Stráský and Petr Urbánek.
After the competition, Rykl recalled the absence of Adam Sebastian Helcelet and Jiri Sykora.
"It's a pity that the boys weren't here and Kope didn't set up, because then the results would have looked completely different.
But the title tastes very good, I especially appreciate the fact that I gave myself a personal best by 30 centimetres in distance.
Then I was also pleased with the pole vault and I guess the most disappointing was the discus, I was below average there," he admitted on the federation's Facebook page.
Katerina Cachova won the first day of the heptathlon with more than a hundred points advantage, despite being troubled by an injured ankle on her rebounding leg.
However, she then registered only 570 cm in the long-distance sector, failed to throw the javelin 40 metres and did not enter the final eight.
Novotná collected 5878 points and won by 241 points ahead of Kateřina Dvořáková.
Her best performance of the year was 631 cm.
"I really wanted it to be around 630.
My calf started to pull yesterday, but I am very happy that I didn't feel it at all and that it didn't limit me at all," Novotná said on the federation's Facebook page.
Bio LPG has arrived in the Czech Republic, promises environmentally friendly operation
Liquefied petroleum gas, abbreviated LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas), is a well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
It is popular mainly because of its substantially lower price compared to petrol or diesel, due to significantly lower excise duty, but it also has the benefit of lower CO2 emissions per kilometre travelled.
Like petrol and diesel, it also has an environmentally friendly variant - "bio LPG".
It is, however, quite new - it first appeared on the European market last year and arrived in the Czech Republic a few days ago, according to a press release from the Czech LPG Association.
"These days we have received the first fifteen tonnes of bio LPG, which will be distributed to our filling stations in a mixture with conventional fossil LPG," the association quotes Jiří Karlík from Primagas as saying.
However, bio LPG cannot be thought of as bioethanol or biodiesel.
According to the association, it is chemically identical to conventional petroleum LPG, which many motorists now fill their cars with.
Therefore, it is also possible to mix the two versions freely.
"The only difference with conventional LPG is the way it is produced," says Ivan Indráček, chairman of the association.
This is one of the big advantages of bio LPG over other alternative fuels.
It can be easily transported and stored, and the distribution infrastructure is also quite good, e.g. compared to hydrogen or electricity.
Currently, this gas is obtained as a by-product of the production of bioethanol from food residues and sugar cane.
In the future, it should also be produced in a targeted way, e.g. from cellulosic biomass, i.e. wood waste.
In contrast, conventional petroleum LPG is produced partly as a by-product of oil refining and partly by separation during natural gas extraction.
As a result, depending on the production technology and source, running a car on bio LPG is 40-70% more environmentally friendly in terms of carbon footprint than running on petroleum LPG and up to 90% compared to diesel.
However, it is not about CO2 emissions from the car's tailpipe, but about the ecology of fuel production, i.e. the "well-to-tank" part.
Some of the largest producers of bio LPG are currently the petrochemical companies Eni, Total and Neste.
According to a recent update of the National Action Plan for Clean Mobility (NAP ČM), Unipetrol is also exploring the possibility of production at its Litvínov refinery.
According to the association's estimates, about 170,000 vehicles run on LPG in the Czech Republic; the Ministry of the Environment states a slightly higher number in the CNMP, about 200,000.
According to statistics from the Ministry of Transport, almost 6,000 LPG conversions were carried out last year alone.
It is possible to fill up with LPG in the Czech Republic at about 950 stations of various operators.
Vojtěch revised the number of infected people, the number dropped by 1,775 cases
Health Minister Adam Vojtěch (ANO) ordered the ministry to revise the number of people infected with the coronavirus.
The new statistics were published by the Health Ministry on its website on Sunday.
The number dropped from 5,254 on Saturday afternoon to 3,479 cases, which is 1,775 fewer infected.
There are now 3,422 patients in the Czech Republic.
"The jump in the number of cured is due to a revision of data that health officials have not been able to update recently," said Jaroslav Dušek, the head of health statistics.
By Sunday afternoon, 15 212 people had contracted coronavirus in the Czech Republic, 11 419 had recovered and 371 had unfortunately succumbed to Covid-19.
Slovaks succeed, they will only pay a fine for racist insults
The Slovak Football Association has succeeded in its appeal against the closure of a stadium for racism by fans. The national team was originally supposed to play the European Championship qualifying match against Wales without spectators, but instead the federation will now only pay a fine of 15,000 euros (about 387,000 crowns).
The UEFA Disciplinary Committee punished Slovakia and Hungary for the behaviour of fans during their recent qualifying match in Budapest, which the visiting team of Czech coach Pavel Hapal won 2-1. It closed the stadiums of both associations for one match and fined Slovakia €20,000 and Hungary €67,000.
The Slovaks, on appeal, were only fined 15,000 euros for offensive political chants. The national team's next match in the European Championship qualifier against Wales on 10 October in Trnava will thus be open to fans.

Overview of bank accounts for children on the Czech market
Banks provide children's accounts free of charge. However, the offer should be considered, as some additional services to the accounts are already charged for. "The motivation for banks to offer accounts for children, whose basic maintenance is usually free, is straightforward. Financial houses are counting on the fact that the waived fees will one day come back to them. With the small migration of Czechs between banks, they are probably not wrong," says Kristýna Kuncová from dTest.
According to her, "small accounts" can do almost everything that adult accounts can. A child gets his or her own payment card, can enter payments, track account movements, and somewhere has his or her own electronic banking. Banks may set up the account, but it's up to parents to teach their children how to use them and also monitor their payments.
"In a relatively flexible way, the parent can set weekly or monthly limits, turn on and off individual services and so on. But above all, they can keep track of what's happening on the account, either by peeking online or through SMS information. Beware, these may no longer be free," Kuncová adds: "If a parent is considering an account for their child, they should consider their child's abilities and capabilities."
The Museum in Semily returns to the Velvet Revolution with an exhibition
An imitation of a normalisation room with a television showing footage of the brutal police crackdown on students in Prague on 17 November 1989. This is also the subject of a new exhibition at the museum in Semily, which is dedicated to the Velvet Revolution. "The basic idea is to present what happened in Semily after the events on Národní třída," said Tomáš Chvátal, the exhibition's curator.
"I would say that the atmosphere was basically the same everywhere, with the exception that the first demonstration in Semily was on 22 November, and then more people gradually packed in every day," he said. Among the most active at the beginning were a group of local dissidents around Miroslav Matěcha, who was the only one from the town and its immediate surroundings to sign Charter 77, and the Dědečks, who circulated a petition called "Several Sentences". According to Chvátal, the Civic Forum was formed relatively quickly. "One specific thing is that there was a very strong group of local doctors in the Civic Forum," the curator said.
Visitors should be drawn into what was happening in the town at the time by some 50 photographs taken 30 years ago by Karel Bárta. A video of the general strike on 27 November 1989, filmed by František Tomíček, has also survived and will be on loop throughout the exhibition. Ivan Hlas also spoke and sang at the demonstration. The Semily archive has also lent a number of preserved banners from that time for the exhibition. "On them were: Let's not get drunk on corn, From trough to trough, We don't want violence," Chvátal said. Some of the changes in the town were very rapid at the time, for example, in December the people voted in an all-Semily vote to make the square Riegrova Square and abolish the previous name Gottwaldovo.
The exhibition also depicts the events before the November events. "In the first part we present to the memorialists and students what was before, a kind of late normalisation. I think we have managed to collect unique documents from Semily, whether they are banners with various communist slogans or a bronze plaque from the then Museum of the Workers' Movement," Chvátal said. One room is meant to evoke a sense of what it might have been like in the living room of an ordinary household back then.
The last part of the exhibition is again dedicated to what was after the Velvet Revolution. It focuses on the first free elections. "We wallpapered one room with election posters. Those who lived through it will remember the posters of With Us to Europe or Václav Klaus still there under the OF banner with the beautiful motto Everyone for his village," the curator added.
A pike in a pond or a relatively prosperous open-air museum?
Babiš chose for his optimistic view statistics such as good security (the Czech Republic is seventh in the world), low unemployment, low national debt. Or the fact that our country is, according to a recent study, twenty-fourth in quality of life out of 140 countries evaluated.
However, developer Dušan Kunovský and architect Josef Pleskot, in a television interview on the occasion of the Architecture and Development Summit, also cited other, not so "rosy" data. For example, that the Czech Republic ranks 154th in the world in the speed of construction procedures. It may be that the current economic "boom" will not leave behind any significant construction legacy as it did in the past.
The biggest obstacle is not only the existing legislation, but also a slow, inefficient bureaucracy. This is also documented by comparative studies, in which the Czech Republic lags significantly behind developed countries in the overall quality and efficiency of public administration.
Our country has simply not yet managed to make good use of the potential of the good economic situation of recent years to invest in the future. While it is nice that salaries and pensions are rising, people with an improving standard of living will also want to have a place to live, modern and fast travel, quality cultural venues, and to live without unbearable environmental burdens.
But in the capital city of Prague, for example, it has been impossible for years to complete the inner and outer ring road or to build a rapid transit or metro to the airport. And Prague does not even have a modern, architecturally daring national library, concert hall or national gallery. The reason for this is not only the absurd tug-of-war over architectural competitions, zoning plans and building permits, but also a kind of specifically Czech conservatism that adheres to the slogan "every bolder change is for the worse".
And when it seems that something bolder might be possible, it is almost certainly thwarted by the conservationists or other somewhat conceited associations or politicians. In the absurd drama surrounding Jan Kaplický's "blob" designed for the new National Library building, even President Václav Klaus wanted to tie himself to the diggers.
But the list does not end with Prague. The Czech Republic is unable to complete its motorway network or start building high-speed trains, so Germany finally decided to run its superfast trains from Berlin to Vienna via a "detour" through Bavaria. Moreover, repairs to existing infrastructure are often drowned in shenanigans. Getting from Prague to Brno quickly is now a conundrum.
Babiš came into politics promising to "make things work". But in terms of meaningful investment and speeding up cumbersome bureaucratic procedures, not much has happened. An amendment to the law on accelerating the construction of transport infrastructure has been in force since 2018, but we will have to wait for more extensive positive effects of, for example, easier land expropriation. And the new construction law, approved by the government, which is said to reduce the current average length of construction proceedings from 5.4 years to one year, will, if we are lucky, start to apply from 2021. But many people would probably not bet on it.

Mobile polling units or correspondence voting.
A political scientist and a sociologist searched for options for the pandemic
A change in the law is needed to allow people quarantined because of coronavirus to vote in the October regional and senate elections, according to Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD).
Parliament could discuss it in August or September in an accelerated procedure.
He said this on Sunday on Prima TV's Partia.
On Tuesday, he plans to discuss possible solutions with representatives of parliamentary parties at the ministry.
"Whatever we do, it will have to mean changing the electoral law," Hamáček said.
The Senate on Wednesday called on the government to find a solution within the framework of the current legal rules.
But the minister said the law's provision that says people quarantined because of their health cannot vote would have to be amended.
For example, the ban on voting should remain for patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop told OVM that the possibility of voting by correspondence has been postponed since 2004.
Even the current bill in the lower house envisages its introduction for voting abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
At the same time, Prokop considers the fears of ANO or ČSSD (because, according to the experience from abroad, it would rather favour other types of parties) about correspondence voting to be overestimated.
Personally, he is against the possibility of electronic voting, where there is a significant possibility of abuse.
Michal Klíma said that it is now necessary to devise ad hoc mechanisms (of elections) that could be carried out already this year and with the least possible health risk.
The main thing is to be ready for 2021, when the parliamentary elections are to be held in the Czech Republic.
He considers the correspondence election (whether abroad or also in the Czech Republic) as one of the functional methods.
He sees the already mentioned electoral units or the possibility of proxy voting within the family as others.
He added that it is possible to learn from how similar situations - elections during the coronavirus - were dealt with in Croatia, Poland or France.
Various types of elections have already been postponed in 67 countries this year due to the spread of the coronavirus.
The Prague Stock Exchange rose slightly, Czech banks, O2 and Avast did well
The Prague Stock Exchange closed the trading week with a slight growth. The PX index rose 0.13 per cent to 1,038.45 points. It was driven up by Czech banks, telecommunications company O2 and technology firm Avast. On the other hand, Austrian titles and media company CME did not fare well. The results of trading on the exchange's website show this.
For most of Friday's session, the Prague Stock Exchange traded in slightly positive territory and eventually ended with a small profit. "However, it (the PX index) lost slightly over one percent for the whole week," noted Josef Dudek of Fio banka.
Domestic banks partially corrected the declines of the past few days. Komerční banka improved 0.82 percent to 803 koruna and Moneta Money Bank 0.41 percent to 72.80 koruna. Shares in Avast rose 0.89 percent to 113 koruna and operator O2 gained 0.46 percent to 216.50 koruna.
Kofola's securities rose the most, up 1.38 percent to 294 koruna. Tobacco company Philip Morris gained less than a percent, with its shares rising to 13,640 crowns.
The securities of energy firm CEZ stagnated at Thursday's value of 520 crowns.
Three titles were losers - Erste Bank wrote off 0.87 percent to 779.20 crowns, CME 0.73 percent to 109 crowns and insurer VIG 0.40 percent to 618 crowns.
The crown weakened slightly against both major world currencies. It lost four cents against the euro to 25.85 koruna/euro, and three cents against the dollar to 23.62 koruna/USD. It follows from data on the Patria Online server.
Protests in Buhari: Pigs' ears thrown by protesters at the government building
Demonstrators against Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov and his cabinet threw pig ears at the government building.
This was the latest in a series of protests against "mafia-style governance" that have been taking place in Sofia and other cities for almost three weeks.
Organisers are planning a nationwide blockade for Wednesday, DPA news agency reported.
Today's protest, the 18th in a row, had a weaker turnout than previous ones, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.
About 300 people had gathered by 20:00 and some streets had to be closed to traffic.
Demonstrators staged a theatrical skit in front of the government building, symbolically locking Prime Minister Borissov and Prosecutor General Ivan Geshev in a prison cell in connection with the arrest of two advisers to President Rumen Radev, a strong political opponent of the prime minister.
The resignation of both is one of the protesters' main demands.
They also demanded the cancellation of the announced health care reform and an end to corruption in construction on the Black Sea coast.
Protest organiser Nikolai Hadzhigenov said on public radio today that the "peak of escalation" was planned for Wednesday in the form of "a national rally in Sofia and blockades across the country".
He reiterated the demand for the resignation of Borissov and his government, as well as for early elections.
Ordinary ones should be held in March 2021.
Borisov has previously said that he does not intend to resign.
He justified this, among other things, by the need to guide Bulgaria through the covid-19 pandemic and the resulting economic crisis.
But on Friday he replaced five members of his government team, although the concession did not appease the demonstrators.
Earlier this week, Borisov's government survived a confidence vote in parliament.
Supreme prosecutor reinstates prosecution of mother who manipulated daughter against father
Supreme State Prosecutor Pavel Zeman disagrees with the acquittal of a mother who manipulated her daughter and damaged her relationship with her father over a long period of time. She faced charges of abuse and endangering her upbringing. The regional court acquitted her, but Zeman disagrees. His appeal to the Supreme Court suggests that such conduct may constitute a criminal offence.
The Supreme Court's decision could have wider implications for other cases. "A more specific definition of such a specific form of abuse can be considered necessary also in terms of guiding further application practice," Zeman's appeal states.
Last year, the district court in Svitavy initially found the woman guilty of both abuse of a ward and endangering the upbringing of a child. She had formed a strong, almost symbiotic bond with her daughter, even when she was supposed to be entrusted to her father.
The result was a pathological fixation on the mother and a markedly negative relationship with the father. The situation marked the emotional development of the daughter, who was even hospitalised. She had threatened to harm herself if she was handed over to her father's care.
The Svitavy court sentenced the mother to two years' imprisonment with a two-year suspended sentence. However, the Pardubice branch of the regional court acquitted the woman on appeal, saying it was not a criminal offence. The regional court repeated the same verdict after the Supreme Court ordered it to decide again.
The Regional Court stated that situations where one parent manipulates a child against the other are by no means exceptional. They are dealt with in custody proceedings, possibly with the help of psychologists or youth welfare authorities. Only rarely is criminal law the solution.
However, according to the Attorney General, the woman had committed both abuse and endangering the child's upbringing. "The accused acted quite purposely in arousing negative feelings in her daughter towards her father, and purposely reinforced those negative emotions. In doing so, she not only pursued the unlawful intention to restrict or exclude the father's contact with the minor, but she must necessarily have been aware that this would have negative consequences in the minor's psychosocial sphere," the appeal states.
Zeman asked the Supreme Court to send the case back to the regional court once more. The appeal states that the child is now in the custody of the father.
May the fans be positive, Hašek wishes. Sparta will play a game in Pilsen
"We will play to the limit, we will do everything in our power to succeed. We will do our best to get the game and the results," promised Spartan Martin Hašek in an interview for the club's television.
In the week he decided the cup match in Jihlava (2:1) with a goal. Sparta advanced to the next round, which was a must for them. They are relieved, but they continue to struggle.
Even though the season is slowly moving into the second period, Sparta is still looking for the face that coach Václav Jílek spoke about at the beginning of his engagement.
"But it is still Sparta that has very good players. It's going to be a difficult match," warns Roman Procházka of Plzeň.
The last time the Spartans came to Štruncové sady, in mid-May, it was a clear-cut affair in the extra time. The visitors left after a soulless performance with a 0:4 drubbing, the biggest in the history of the independent Czech league.
While the difference between the clubs in the table was eight points before the game, Sparta are now nine points behind after ten games of the new season. It is experiencing one of the worst starts to the season ever.
"It's not an easy situation for us, nor for the fans who would like to see their beloved club completely different than it is at the moment," Hašek feels. "But we would be happy if they would continue to support us, stay positive and get behind us."
Sparta doesn't know if it will be able to use Tetteh in Plzen, who received a two-game suspension for the sending off but appealed on Friday.
Costa, Dočkal, Drchal, Panák, Pulkrab, Zahustel, Krejčí and Kadlec, who is the only one of the squad who remembers Sparta's last win in Plzeň in 2011, remain on the injured list.
The home side, who have won their last five games including Wednesday's cup game in Hlucin, should only be missing midfielder Cermak. And defender Jakub Brabec, a Spartan alumnus, should lead them into the match as captain.
Milan Jakubů: The army stole the funeral for themselves! Says Andor Šándor
There is still confusion around the funeral of Brigadier General Milan Jakubů. Media speculated during the week that the army planned the last farewell to the deputy director of Military Intelligence as bombastic as soldiers can, despite the wishes of the family. There were also discrepancies over the date of the funeral. Defence Ministry spokesman Jan Pejšek denied this.
"It's nonsense! We have been in contact with the family from the beginning, the Friday date of the funeral has been agreed from the beginning, nobody has changed it. The same applies to the military honours. We are still discussing the possible participation of the media with regard to the family," Pejšek told Blesk on Wednesday. The funeral will finally take place on Friday and will not lack all the military honours, including a flyover by fighter jets.
But there is still a tense atmosphere around the final farewell to the popular general. The organizers have decided not to have people who worked with the general in the past attend the funeral ceremony!
This includes, for example, the former head of military intelligence Andor Šándor (62), who met Milan Jakubů 17 years ago. Šándor remembers his former colleague as hard-working, intelligent and a "good guy".
In addition, in recent years he regularly met him at the anniversary celebrations of the founding of the Military Intelligence. That is why he would like to say goodbye to Milan Jakubů. "I would personally go to Milan Jakubů's funeral," Šándor told Blesk. But he can't.
"I know of other people from the organization who would like to go, but they are unlucky because the potentates are usurping the funeral for themselves. I think it is not right to privatize a funeral in this way," the security expert said. He is also not happy with the alleged consideration of closing the ceremony to the public due to the secrecy of the army top brass.
"The leadership of the army is not classified and neither are the leaders of military intelligence, because they are promoted at Prague Castle, for example, we see them there. If the media information is true and the family has indeed been overlooked by the military, it is of course a family matter. I personally would never allow the army to overrule the family and its wishes," Šándor concluded.
Milan Jakubů died on Saturday near Špindlerův Mlýn in a car accident. The head-on collision between Milan's Rapid and a Ford Mustang was allegedly caused by the driver of the sports car, Vojtěch Ch. (31).
The amateur racer was about to enter the opposite direction in a curve, Milan Jakubů apparently had no chance to avoid the collision. His wife (47) sustained serious injuries in the accident and it is possible that she will suffer the consequences for the rest of her life. Police questioned the culprit in the accident on Thursday.
Boloni coach Mihajlovic no longer wants matches without spectators
Boloni football coach Siniša Mihajlovic has had enough of Italian league matches without spectators.
The Serbian coach hopes that from the new season onwards the fans will return to the stadiums.
"What we are currently doing here is not football.
I'm fed up with matches without spectators.
It's mindless football, it brings me no emotion, no joy.
The games are worse than training.
Playing like this is terrible and I think I'm not the only one who thinks so," Mihajlovic said ahead of today's game against Lecce.
After the coronavirus break, the Serie A matches follow in quick succession, and although they are played in the evening, the players are exposed to the heat.
"We play every three days in terrible heat.
In such conditions, you can't even tell how the teams are doing.
I wish this season was over.
These measures had to be taken to finish the competition, but I hope that from September the fans will be back," said the coach, who has also managed Fiorentina and AC Milan in the past.
This season is also unusual for Mihajlovic because he missed four months on the bench due to leukaemia treatment.
"Despite my illness, the interruption of the league and everything else, we managed to take our team to the next level.
We want to keep growing and for that we need the players to be mentally stronger," he said.

There is no threat to the launch of the new toll, reports Kremlik. But a change of operator is at stake
The Transport Ministry on Friday started preparations for a new tender for the operation of the new toll system. This is a backup plan that the state would use in case the current toll contract is finally cancelled. In addition, the state is also preparing another interim solution in case the tender cannot be completed on time. Transport Minister Vladimír Kremlík (ANO) said this on Facebook.
On Thursday, the Office for the Protection of Competition (ÚOHS) banned the performance of the toll contract between the state and the CzechToll/SkyToll consortium, with a one-year delay. The ministry will file an appeal against the decision.
"The launch of the new toll collection system is not at risk. Starting today, we are launching the preparation of a new transparent tender procedure, the subject of which will be the services for the operation of the new toll system, which is currently being completed by the consortium of CzechToll and SkyToll," the minister said.
The state would thus be looking for the operator of the toll system currently under preparation, which will be launched in December this year. It would therefore not be a competition for a completely new toll system, as was the case in the last tender, nor would it involve the use of the old system currently operated by Kapsch.
However, according to Kremlik, the ministry is also preparing for the fact that it would not be able to prepare the new tender in time. "Based on my experience with the toll tender process so far, I am deeply convinced that the Office is wrong and that it is objectively impossible to prepare and implement such a complex tender procedure and hand over the operation of the toll system to a new operator within the 12-month period set by the Office," he said.
The ministry will therefore prepare an interim solution in addition to a new tender procedure, which would solve the collection of tolls for a transitional period until the state finds a full-fledged solution.
Thus, the state will probably not yet use the offer submitted to it in recent days by the current toll administrator Kapsch. The Austrian firm offered to operate the current system for the state in case the toll contract is cancelled.
At the same time, Kremlik reiterated his belief that a back-up plan would not be needed. The ministry will therefore file an appeal against the decision of the antitrust authority.
On Thursday, the Office issued a decision banning the implementation of the toll contract. However, the ban will not take effect until a year after the authority's decision becomes final. It is not final and can be appealed to the president of the office. The ministry and CzechToll are therefore continuing to prepare the new toll, which is expected to be launched in December.
Last year, the CzechToll/SkyToll consortium won the tender for the new toll system and its operator. It won the toll tender with a bid of CZK 10.75 billion for a ten-year operation. The current operator, Kapsch, protested against the tender process and the validity of the toll contract, as it failed in the tender with a bid of over CZK 13 billion.
I have the heart of a bell and the lungs of a non-smoker. I'll just have a few infusions, joked Zeman
The head of state underwent a several-hour medical examination at the Central Military Hospital (ÚVN) on Tuesday. According to the director of the hospital, Miroslav Zavoral, doctors found no "morbid conditions" in the president. The president will celebrate his 75th birthday on Saturday.
Doctors checked the president and found slight signs of dehydration. His problems with low blood pressure were caused by insufficient hydration. "In order to fix the dehydration of my body, I will take several infusions to get minerals into my body," Zeman said.
But otherwise, he said, the director of the Institute of Veterinary Medicine stated that "the Czech state has a healthy president". In this context, the president mentioned that Zavoral had received several hate messages because of the medical examination.
According to the president, the doctors examined him thoroughly and did not miss a single spot on his body. "So, a brief recap: the heart is beating like a bell, the lungs are clean as if he were not a smoker, the liver is working as if I were a teetotaler, the kidneys are also fine and I can go on and on," Zeman said.
The editors of iDNES.cz contacted the military hospital to comment on Zeman's statement about his health.
The issue of Zeman's health became a topic especially during last year's presidential election or during some of Zeman's public appearances, during which he clearly has problems walking. According to Prague Castle, the president has difficulty walking due to diabetic polyfunctional neuropathy. He also has problems with low blood pressure and has difficulty hearing. He has cut down on smoking because of his health.

Sparta doesn't want to lose Tetteh in Plzen. It appealed against the two-match penalty
Football Sparta has appealed against the two-match punishment for striker Benjamin Tetteh, which the player received from the disciplinary committee for the expulsion in Sunday's derby with Slavia (0:3).
The Letná club announced this on its Twitter account and is now waiting for the verdict of the appeals committee.
Tetteh has already served half of his sentence in Wednesday's home cup match in Jihlava. Sparta is now seeking to get the 22-year-old Ghanaian striker to play in Sunday's round 11 First League clash in Plzeň.
It could be a repeat of last October. Back then, Olomouc appealed against the punishment for Simon Falta, who on Thursday was given a one-match suspension by the disciplinary committee for a sending-off against Liberec.
The appeals committee didn't have time to hear the case, so the punishment was postponed and Falta was allowed to start on Saturday, ironically against Sparta.
The commission finally confirmed the one-match punishment for the Olomouc midfielder the following week and Falta missed the next game against Zlín.
The disciplinary committee suspended Tetteh for a foul on Slavic player David Hovorka, for which he received a straight red card from referee Miroslav Zelinka in the 82nd minute.
The alleged spitting of the Ghanaian player on the opponent's captain Tomáš Souček was not proven.
We have become the target of a cyber attack by foreign states, Iran claims
Since late June, fires and explosions have been reported from a number of Iranian military, industrial and nuclear facilities, as well as oil refineries, power plants, factories and businesses.
Some Iranian officials have said the fire that broke out this month at the underground nuclear facility in Natanz may have been caused by cyber sabotage.
The cause of a number of other incidents has not yet been explained.
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Musavi told reporters that the Islamic Republic's infrastructure faces "thousands of cyber attacks" every day, according to Iranian media.
He added that this is not a new phenomenon and that most of them will be repelled.
In recent months, Musavi said, there have been several broader cyber attacks, which he said were behind "certain governments and groups".
However, he did not provide further details about the possible perpetrators, according to Reuters.
Musavi also added that fires in forests, refineries and other places are common in the summer.
An article by Iran's state-run IRNA news agency this month discussed how Iran's enemies, such as Israel and the U.S., may have been behind the recent incidents.
But neither country was directly blamed for the specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States severed diplomatic ties shortly after the 1979 revolution, when Iranian militant students attacked the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
Long-tense relations between the two countries escalated in 2018 after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers and imposed sanctions on Iran that have hit its economy hard.
Another major escalation came this year after the US military killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani and a member of the Iraqi militia leadership, Abu Mahdi Muhandis, on January 3.
Iran then fired a number of missiles on January 8 at bases in Iraq where the Americans are operating.
The US only admitted after the fact that dozens of American soldiers were wounded.
Israel regards Iran as its arch-enemy and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a major opponent of the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran.
According to the Israeli prime minister, Iran is trying to develop an atomic bomb, which Iran denies.
Harry in the footsteps of Princess Diana (†36)! Where is Meghan?
Diana was special in that she could grab people by the heart. In January 1997, she caused a stir when she visited Africa and, in particular, a minefield. Images of her wearing a protective suit and face shield became iconic. And even then, no one could have guessed that a few months later, the princess of human hearts would breathe her last in a tragic car crash in Paris.
Now, her younger son Harry has scored as well, as he sets off to the same place as her for the first time in 22 years. He went to a mine clearance site in Dirico, Angola, also wearing a special protective suit and looking very thoughtful. He certainly could not help thinking of his beloved mother, whom he had lost when he was only 13 years old.
Harry gave an on-the-spot speech praising the efforts of the Halo Trust, which works to defuse minefields and other explosives in countries where war has taken place. "Minefields are the unhealed wounds of war. By clearing them, we can help the community find peace, and with peace comes opportunity," he said, also calling for the preservation and conservation of wildlife and local rivers as a source of water. After this visit, the Duke of Sussex moved to Huambo to rename the local orthopaedic centre after his famous mother, Princess Diana.
He didn't forget to mention it on his official instagram account: 'The Duke is honoured to visit the place and community that were so important to his mother, to learn about their tireless mission and to speak out for all those who (Diana) felt most needed to be heard, even if the issue wasn't exactly a worldwide one,' appeared the Sussex Royal's instagram post.
But royal fans may be disappointed that he didn't take his wife Meghan (38) and their son Archie (4 months) on such a trip to remember Diana. In fact, both have had a separate agenda from Harry since Wednesday, presumably for their protection. After all, taking a small baby into a minefield doesn't sound very safe, and Harry doesn't want to put his beloved family in danger at any cost.
TPCA has extended the production shutdown, now until May 25th.
The Cologne-based carmaker Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile (TPCA) has again extended its production shutdown due to a coronavirus.
Production lines are due to restart on the morning of Monday 25 May.
The start-up will be accompanied by dozens of hygiene measures, said automaker spokesman Tomas Paroubek.
Production has been halted due to the coronavirus pandemic since the evening of 18 March.
The company originally planned to resume it on Monday, May 18.
The reason for the extended shutdown, according to Paroubek, is the closed borders and closed dealerships, so there is no one to sell the cars.
According to Paroubek, the company will be producing at 100 percent from the beginning, i.e. in two shifts.
The coronavirus has affected the company's key markets, such as Italy, the UK and Spain.
Mayor Michael Kašpar (Change for Cologne) said the TPCA production shutdown is not affecting life in the city.
"At the beginning it was noticeable, the city was empty.
But gradually the streets are filling up, especially now since Monday, when things have loosened up a lot.
So the city is full," Kašpar said.
According to him, there are no complications even with foreign workers who stayed in hostels.
"We have hardly had to deal with any problem in these two months," Kašpar said.
For example, Mladá Boleslav-based Škoda Auto, which also suspended production due to the coronavirus crisis, resumed it on Monday, April 27, at all three of its production plants in the Czech Republic.
None of the plants is operating at 100 percent capacity.
The resumption of production at Skoda was accompanied by more than 80 hygiene measures.
On the night from Monday to Tuesday, the third, i.e. night shift was held in Mladá Boleslav and Kvasiny for the first time after the resumption of production.
TPCA currently employs around 2,500 people and is one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and an employer in the Kolín region.
New metro architect to oversee D line, brings experience from London Underground
The Prague Transport Company has selected an architect to oversee the design of the metropolitan metro. From October, Anna Švarc will become the new architect.Her primary task will be the appearance of the new D line, but she will also be in charge of the existing stations. According to her, the metro should not only be seen as a transport structure, but also as an aesthetic experience.
The Czech architect, who has been involved in the reconstruction of three London Underground stations, won a tender announced by the Prague Transport Company (DPP).
In addition to her, 14 other candidates took part in the tender. "The selection procedure included a cover letter and a CV. Apparently, my previous experience in London, where I worked in a team of three people to create a kind of aesthetic manual for the underground there, was decisive," says the new metro architect. Her experience from the Institute of Planning and Development of the capital city could have also been a decisive factor. Prague.
She sees the metro not only as a functional transport structure. Stations should also have aesthetic value.
"I have ideas about how the metro will change, how the space will be improved. However, I will only know how it will actually work in the coming weeks, when the transport company will fill me in on its ideas," says Švarc.
"This is not a series of dogmas, but rather a series of recommendations, the main aim of which is to maintain the context of all the stations in case they are renovated," the design manual explains.
Whether a similar tool is also a way to improve the public space in the Prague metro is questionable. The Prague metro is specific. "Whether the manual is the ideal or whether a personality can cover it, I really don't know yet," concludes Švarc.
Cancer killed a bride shortly after her wedding.
For more than two years Gemma Sisson battled an insidious cancer, and just when it seemed she had beaten the disease, it struck again.
The thirty-nine-year-old woman who loved bodybuilding eventually ended up in a hospice bed, where she still managed to marry the love of her life.
Sadly, she succumbed to the disease.
A few hours after her death, a shocking message appeared on her Facebook account for those closest to her.
Gemma Sisson, from Leeds, England, loved bodybuilding.
She and boyfriend Ricky Moore, with whom she lived for more than 16 years, traveled to competitions held around the world.
The 39-year-old played sports and lived a healthy lifestyle, yet in April 2018 she was diagnosed with cancer.
Gemma began a gruelling treatment, radiotherapy, in the hope that she would recover.
After months of treatment, Gemma did indeed seem to have beaten the cancer, however in August 2019 the cancer returned and this time attacked her spine.
The bodybuilder and personal trainer underwent a ten-hour spinal surgery and then started the drastic treatment again, according to the UK's Daily Mirror.
However, it was all in vain.
Earlier this year, on her thirty-ninth birthday, doctors told her she had a few months to live.
In April, the pretty blonde finally decided to enter a hospice in Leeds, where she was visited every now and then by her family, who even arranged her wedding to her love Ricky.
The marriage lasted two months.
Ricky took Gemma to the restaurant one last time for their two-month anniversary.
Four days later, Gemma died in his arms.
Just hours after her death, a post Gema wrote for her family appeared on her social media account.
"If this has been posted it means I have finally died after weeks of fighting for too long.
Although I will be heartbroken to leave my loved ones behind, I will be so glad to be rid of what this terrible disease has done to me.
I can't thank Ricky enough, who has been by my side the whole time and has given me a tremendous amount of love and support during that horrible time," she wrote on social media, adding that the pain and suffering has finally stopped and she has found peace.
"I am also grateful for all the support I have received from all my followers on social media," she wrote, adding that everyone should appreciate their life and live it to the fullest.
The first Miss Christ has finally gone into herself: She lost a few pounds and immediately saw through
The first modern miss of 1989 Ivana Christová (49) had problems with being overweight for many years, which caused her not only physical problems, but mainly mental ones. She suffered from the fact that she had changed a lot since the days of Miss Czechoslovakia. But now she seems to have taken those criticisms to heart and has taken up the fight against the extra pounds. It's a long run, though.
She used to be a first-class beauty who conquered Paris. But 30 years have passed since then and Ivana Christova can only remember the beauty contest. Not only because of the fame, but also because of how thin she was.
Over time, she decided not to follow the strict rules of modelling, which required her to be as thin as possible and often not to eat. She decided to stop listening and started indulging in whatever she felt like.
But she went from fasting to overeating, which immediately took its toll on her figure. She tried to disguise the extra pounds with various loose clothes, which added dimension to her plump shape.
Now it looks like Ivana has really gone all out. She has visibly lost weight, started dressing tastefully and appropriately for her fuller figure.
She surprised everyone present at the book launch of Miloš Zapletal (75) by saying that she had seen through her looks again and had regained the features of the charming brunette who made history in 1989 not only as the first Miss winner after the revolution, but also by the controversy her victory caused.
Christová will always be the first beauty pageant winner, but also the very first one who was booed like a madwoman by the audience at the Palace of Culture and Sport in Ostrava when she put on her crown.
"A parody of justice." Scientist warned of cancer from pollution, sits in Turkish jail
Sik, along with other scientists, participated in a study commissioned by the Turkish Ministry of Health between 2011 and 2015. Its conclusion was that water, soil and food pollution in some industrial areas in the west of the country was linked to increased cancer rates among local residents.
The researchers mentioned in particular the Dilovasi industrial zone, which lies about 80 kilometres from Istanbul and is home to a number of chemical and metallurgical plants. People living in the area are far more likely to suffer from cancer than the international average, they said.
Erdogan retaliates for coup, despite international criticism
To Sik, the government appeared to take no action on the matter despite the study's clear conclusions. He therefore wrote several articles about the research for the opposition daily Cumhuriyet. The authorities subsequently began prosecuting him for disclosing classified information.
"The study clearly showed the extent to which water sources were contaminated with toxic substances," Sik told reporters after the verdict. "The court's decision shows that the results of studies that directly affect public health can be withheld. This is unacceptable," the scientist added.
"Instead of persecuting alarmists through the courts, the Turkish authorities should investigate this important public health issue," said Andrew Gardner of AI's Turkey office.
Environmental and human rights organisations have long accused the Turkish government of failing to enforce environmental regulations despite rapid industrial development in certain regions.
Following the foiled 2016 coup, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's regime launched a widespread wave of arrests. Nearly 80,000 people are now behind bars, including many employees of the Cumhuriyet newspaper. The authorities have also suspended or dismissed 150,000 civil servants and members of the armed forces.
The opposition and human rights organisations accuse the government of using the coup attempt to persecute its opponents. But the authorities defend themselves by saying that these are measures necessary to ensure national security.
Art vending machines sell a sweat book, a mushroom amulet and a memory game
For 100 crowns, a passer-by can get a pocket-sized work of art by mostly emerging Czech artists.
They create the pictures and other art directly for the artmat, so they know in advance that they have to fit into the 8.5 by 5.5 centimetre size.
Each piece is numbered and signed.
"The package always includes a curatorial text about the artist and then the work itself," said Petra Widžová, the project's curator.
Artmat works with the principle of chance.
The buyer can thus be surprised by what kind of artwork they get.
Currently, he or she can become the new owner of Alexandra Štoplová's fantasy illustrations or mini-views by Tereza Bonaventura, which can also be sent.
The artist Punx 23 in cooperation with Dora Dutkova has prepared a memory game connected with a walk through Prague.
The cards need to be paired with house signs.
Ilona Polanski created a collection of tattoos for Artmat.
Marie Ladrová and Juliána Chomová sell pocket packs of spirituality: the former offers a protective amulet made of tinder and divination cards, the latter a series of illustrations based on her comic book Spiritists.
The Slovenes also beat the Polish world champions and are in the final of the European Championship
Slovenia's volleyball players will sensationally play for the premiere title of European champions. With the support of nearly 12,000 roaring fans in Ljubljana, they beat the reigning double world champions the Poles 3-1 and are the first finalists.
Who they will challenge in Sunday's climax in Paris will be decided on Friday between France and Serbia.
The Slovenian team looked much more compact than the world champions Poland in the semi-finals. They owned only the beginning of the opening set and, with luck, the end of the second set, but the home volleyball team overcame themselves in defence and only Cuban-born León was actually scoring among the players in the red and white jersey.
However, the home line-up saw both smashers Cebulj and Urnaut in the form of their lives, as well as second all-rounder Stern, who soon replaced the lacklustre Gasparini. The Poles paid the price for winning all their previous matches at this Euro, while the Slovenes gained confidence after tough playoff battles with the Bulgarians and Russians.
The Slovenes lost 1-3 to the Poles in the Olympic qualifier in Gdansk this August, but avenged the defeat at home. But now they will leave the sold-out Ljubljana arena Stožica. However, after today they are already assured of their second medal in history and can improve on the unexpected silver from the European Championship four years ago in Paris.
The Slovenians finished eighth at the previous European Championships, behind the Czech team.
Traveler Zikmund or General Bocek. The Senate handed out commemorative medals
Boček, who was a fighter pilot in the British Air Force during the Second World War, thanked all the recipients for the medals. "The Senate was one of the first to remember and not forget war veterans," he said, among other things. "The award I received today also belongs to my comrades who are no longer with us," he added.
In his speech, Kubera warned against dividing society. "Let us not forget our roots, which unite and shape us all, whether we want to or not. It is from these values that our successful present is based," Kubera said.
The awardees were cardiologist and the most cited Czech scientist Renata Cífková, long-time rector of the Tomas Bata University in Zlín Petr Saha, geologist, writer, traveller and populariser of science Václav Cílek, chairman of the Czech Biathlon Association and vice-president of the World Biathlon Union Jiří Hamza and František Paštěka. The Upper Chamber appreciated his heroism - this January he saved the life of his neighbour and his two-year-old granddaughter when he pulled them out of a burning car. Medals were also awarded to former upper chamber presidents Libuše Benešová and Milan Štěch.
Zikmund, together with Jiří Hanzelka, undertook a number of travel expeditions around the world, during which they collected a lot of documentary material. Fištejn was a commentator and director of broadcasting at Radio Free Europe and now works with public media. Steigerwald has also worked as a playwright and screenwriter, and musician Kocáb was head of the parliamentary commission to oversee the withdrawal of Soviet troops.
The medal was awarded in advance to astronomer and head emeritus of the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs Lubos Perek on the occasion of his 100th birthday in July. By the end of the year, the same award is to be given to Czech-born Madeleine Albright, the first US Secretary of State, and British philosopher and political scientist Roger Scruton, who, among other things, was involved in the activities of the so-called underground university during the communist regime in the former Czechoslovakia.
There are up to 60 times fewer insects than 40 years ago
No other animal class is more abundant in nature than insects. Beetles, butterflies and other species make up more than half of life on Earth. But there are increasing reports that the insect kingdom is shrinking radically. Another scientific study on the subject came out just this week, and it says the situation is even more serious than humanity has realised.
The study is based on field research in the tropical rainforest of Puerto Rico, in which American scientists replicated a similar survey from 1976. As they write right at the beginning of the report, there are "ten to sixty times fewer insects in the rainforest today." This is a decline in the entire population, not in the number of species, and the survey covered all arthropods, not just insects. Because of the insect die-off, the population of other fauna that depend on insects in the food chain, such as birds, frogs and lizards, is also declining.
The authors of the research link their findings directly to climate change. According to them, the average air temperature in the rainforest has risen by two degrees Celsius over the past thirty years, and warming has become a driving force behind the collapse of the food chain. The study thus shows that the impact of climate change on tropical ecosystems may be much greater than previously thought, according to the authors.
The report was the subject of a major story in the Washington Post on Monday, which gave the new findings a hyper-alarming headline. "It's one of the most disturbing articles I've ever read," entomologist David Wagner of the University of Connecticut, whom the paper quotes as an independent expert, told the paper.
The insect die-off is also affecting Europe. "In our country, the decline is also of the order of magnitude," points out Lukáš Čížek of the Institute of Entomology of the Academy of Sciences. However, he says that in addition to climate change, it is also necessary to take into account the changes in the landscape, which play a significant role in Europe. "In our country, it has just been running for a significantly longer period of time than in Puerto Rico," Čížek adds to explain why scientists could measure such a rapid decline in the rainforest compared to the 1970s.
French Oscar nominee Les Misérables to open Be2Can show
The Golden Bear and both acting award winners from this year's Berlinale, the directing award and the jury prize from Cannes and much more will present the 6th edition of the Berlin, Venice and Cannes film festival. Once again this year, Be2Can will bring a selection of the most remarkable and stimulating work presented in competition at Europe's three most important film festivals.
The opening film of this year's festival will be the French drama Les Misérables, for which the filmmaker Ladj Ly won the Jury Prize at this year's Cannes Film Festival. The film is a French Oscar nominee. The premiere of the film in Prague will be personally introduced by the actors Alexis Manenti and Djibril Zonga, who play the two main roles of the police officers of the criminal unit. Alexis Manenti also co-wrote the film's screenplay.
This year, Be2Can will take place in Prague's Lucerna and Edison Filmhub cinemas, as well as in Brno (Art Cinema), Ostrava (Minikino) and Zlín (Golden Apple Cinema) from 2 to 8 October.
Ladj Ly's feature directorial debut has been screened and awarded at many festivals around the world after its success at Cannes. It won the Best Film and Best Screenplay awards at the Durban IFF, and has also screened at the Zurich, Shanghai, Munich, Melbourne, Sarajevo and soon to be screened in San Sebastian.
However, audiences can also look forward to Synonyms, Young Ahmed, Disruptor of the System, Goodbye My Son, Sorry We Didn't Reach You, Ghost Town Anthology and The Golden Glove. But they can also look forward to other fresh releases from this year's Venice, which will head to Czech distribution: the sci-fi Ad Astra, Joker, the Czech triumph The Painted Bird.

Police union chairman Štěpánek resigns, wants to live as a free man
Milan Štěpánek, chairman of the Independent Police Trade Union, has decided to resign from his post. Czech Radio - Radiožurnál reported this on Friday. Štěpánek had led the union since 2005. He will continue to be the union's chairman for two more months. He will remain with the police after his departure from the union.
"I can confirm that this week I have handed in my written resignation to the presidency, after which I will continue to hold the post for two more months," Štěpánek told Radiožurnál. "I have decided as a free man who does not want to be tied to the union forever. And who wants to live a quieter life," he said of his reasons for leaving.
The Independent Trade Union of the Police of the Czech Republic unites members and employees of the security forces or employees of the Ministry of the Interior. Among other things, the union has participated in police protests against budget cuts and petitions for better conditions for the security forces. It also got into a dispute with the then Interior Minister Radek John in 2011 and organised a petition for his resignation. The leadership of the governing coalition later agreed on John's departure.
Salaries in the health sector will rise by a maximum of five percent next year.
According to Vojtěch, a bigger increase is unrealistic
Healthcare salaries could rise by a maximum of five percent next year, Health Minister Adam Vojtěch (ANO) said on Czech Television's Václav Moravec Questions.
He considers the union's demand for an increase of up to 15 percent unrealistic.
He also said that the state should try to be self-sufficient in providing protective equipment.
Hospitals, he said, now have stocks of them.
"I think the increase (in salaries) can be somewhere up to five per cent," the minister said.
He said the current situation, where the coronavirus pandemic and government regulations against its spread since March have interfered with the collection of insurance premiums, needed to be reflected.
The income of insurance companies has fallen during that time.
"A 15 per cent increase seems unrealistic to me at the moment," Vojtech said.
The average monthly earnings of a doctor in acute inpatient care are likely to reach 88,312 crowns this year, according to data from the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (IHIS), and 47,498 crowns for a nurse.
The difference between the salary of nurses in state hospitals and the salary of nurses in other founders will be up to CZK 7 000.
The data from the IHIS also shows that the decline of nurses in hospitals has stopped.
The average wage in the Czech Republic in 2019 was 34,125 crowns, according to data from the Czech Statistical Office.
Union representatives said in June that they would demand a minimum increase of 10 percent for 2021, ideally 15 percent.
They criticise the long-standing significant difference between the earnings of doctors and nurses in state hospitals, which have to follow salary tables, and contractual wages in city, regional or private hospitals.
They are therefore also demanding that salary scales for health workers be uniform.
For nurses this year, the difference will be up to CZK 7,000 per month.
But for doctors, for example, wages rose faster than salaries last year.
According to Roman Šmucler, president of the Czech Chamber of Dentistry, trade unionists should take note of how the state is currently doing.
The House of Commons recently approved an increase in this year's state budget deficit to a record CZK 500 billion due to the impact of the epidemic, of which CZK 1.75 billion is to go towards the remuneration of health workers in hospitals and social services.
According to Šmucler, the Council of Health Care Providers does not agree with the across-the-board salary increase next year.
According to him, remuneration should be decided by hospitals and health care facilities themselves and the extra money should go to them through the reimbursement decree.
Vojtěch also said that hospitals currently have enough protective equipment.
Pavel Švagr, chairman of the State Material Reserves Administration (SSHR), said this week that the administration does not currently have a single protective medical device in its possession.
It is waiting for the completion of the tenders.
According to Vojtech, suppliers around the world are now better able to deliver the goods than in March when they were bought out.
However, he said the state should also try to be as self-sufficient as possible and buy from Czech companies.
Petra Černocká changed her image and did well! She has rejuvenated herself in her blonde hair
Film Saxana Petra Černocká (69) looks absolutely fantastic for her age. Although she will celebrate her jubilee in November, she has never looked like a pensioner. And now she has helped it even more. She changed her image until her colleagues didn't recognize her.
Actress Petra Černocká never looked like a typical grandmother, with her hair streaked with grey, wearing sedentary clothes and going out sporadically. She's always taken care of herself and the older she gets, the more she's able to let go of her image.
Fortunately, she hasn't succumbed to the plastic surgery trend and takes care of her skin with good old indulgence. And her anti-wrinkle prescription is paying off. But now she's changed her hair color and completely lost her mind.
When she arrived at a social event where celebrities were saying goodbye to summer, no one could recognize Petra. Not only was her hair lighter and shorter, but she was dressed in a yellow jacket that made her look even more radiant.
Ladies should learn from Saxana how not to underestimate themselves, that even on the threshold of seventy they can take risks with their appearance. And it paid off for Petra, she looks 50 at most.
Lucie White's father wasn't cheering her on at all. You won't believe what she did for a living!
Who does not know that the national treasure Lucie Bílá (53) is originally a seamstress and her own name is Hana Zaňáková, probably does not live in the Czech Republic. But the singer herself has now revealed that she almost worked in a glass factory!
Lucie Bílá knew from a relatively young age that she wanted to be a singer. Her love for singing was born when she was a little girl performing in the cultural centre in her native Otvovice, where she still lives.
"And I remember exactly where my mother was sitting. That's when the singer in me was born," she admitted to Impulse radio.
Her father, however, was a bit worried about his daughter's future and therefore advised her to follow the path of a craft that has a golden bottom.
"My dad always said, 'Craft girl, craft. Get your feet on the ground!' He even talked me into going to the local glass factory. The glassworks is no longer in business, but I kinda am. I am a trained seamstress and at home I make various rosaries and pendants out of beads, which I then auction off and use the money to buy wheelchairs," she added with a laugh.
Děčín Zoo is delighted with a small macaque
"Our troop currently has seven members. Its youngest member was born on 17 August, given birth by female Buffy and is her fifth cub, fathered by male Hitam. For the first few days after giving birth, the female carried the cub tightly pressed against her body and for a long time did not want to show the world whether she had given birth to a male or a female. However, at about three weeks of age, she gradually began to put the cub down for a little while and the keepers have known for a few days that it is a male," said zoo spokeswoman Alena Houšková, adding that the Děčín zoo has successfully raised 12 cubs of this species.
The macaques are so-called endemics of the island of Sulawesi, which means that they do not live anywhere else in the world in the wild. Their typical features are their black fur and the chocholka on their head, which gives them their name. Macaques live in rainforests, especially at lower altitudes.
Like most primates, they eat both plant and animal food. Their diet is dominated by the fruits of rainforest trees, supplemented by flowers and leaves. They meet their protein requirements by eating small arthropods, larvae and, to a lesser extent, bird eggs and chicks.
"Leaving aside the natural enemies, which are pythons, everything else is man's fault. Locals hunt macaques as a favourite prey with tasty meat and for their fur. Burning and cutting down of the rainforest is also fatal for these animals," the spokesperson added.
The unexplained death of a little girl (†8) in the Příbram region.
Unexplained cases are called "monuments" in criminal slang. However, even these are investigated if new information comes to light years later. Especially when the death of a child is discovered. In 1980, criminalist Jiří Markovič managed to investigate the murder of two girls in Prague's Prokopské údolí Valley, then already 12 years old. "A case from 1955? That will be difficult, very difficult. For a start, it would require finding a file that may no longer exist, talking to those who investigated it. There is always hope, but it would be really hard," Markovic said.
Under the previous regime, violent crimes were not widely reported to the public, but Markovic says that certainly does not mean they were investigated laxly. "It always depended on specific people," the criminologist believes. The problem may be that material from the 1950s may be destroyed, although cold cases should not be shredded.
Scrubbing smart quarantine could be taken over by the military.
We're ready, they say.
"Smart quarantine works, there is room for improvement of course.
We'll be discussing it with the army tonight.
The army is working perfectly well and the question is whether they should take charge of the whole thing again," the prime minister said on his Facebook show Hello People on Sunday.
He said there is a failure to adequately connect IT systems and health posts, which gradually need to move to more modern methods of functioning.
The Prime Minister said there were problems in the Moravian-Silesian region, which is one of the current outbreaks.
Defence Ministry spokesman Jan Pejšek told the Czech News Agency that he had no information about Sunday's meeting and that the government would discuss the matter on Monday.
He said the army was ready for the move.
The health ministry took over the smart quarantine project on 25 May.
Until then, the smart quarantine was run by a 90-member central management team set up under the army as an advisory body to the government, headed by former deputy minister Roman Prymula.
Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) criticised the crumbling project on Sunday.
He also raised the possibility that the army could take it over again.
The government's IT and digitalisation commissioner Vladimír Dzurilla, who is in charge of the project, also admitted shortcomings in the project earlier.
"The system works, but it is still being worked on.
For 20 years it was created separately and in a disjointed way, now we are trying to unify it within a few months.
It's not going by jet.
People are adapting these new systems as they go along, the poor people in the sanitation departments are actually tweaking the bugs," he said.
Ostrava mayor Macura will not run again because he doesn't want to "get stupid in politics"
Tomáš Macura (ANO), the current mayor of Ostrava, will not run in the next municipal elections.
The reason is that he wants "not to get lost in politics," he told Respekt.cz.
Macura, who is also a member of the board of the ANO movement, has been mayor of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the 2018 municipal elections, the ANO candidate he led won nearly a third of the votes in Ostrava.
Macura originally wanted to serve only four years.
"I told myself that I would last one term and with my experience in business I would be able to turn things around and get things back on their feet in that time," he told Respekt.
He added that he was persuaded to a certain extent to run for a second term.
"But for me this is the maximum.
I don't want to fool around in politics," said Macura, who in the interview described himself as a heavy introvert who is not comfortable with frequent contact with people.
According to Respekt, there has been speculation for some time about Macura's possible end in the ANO movement.
The server recalls that Macura has repeatedly criticised the ANO movement, for example for its alliance with the SPD or for supporting Miloš Zeman in the presidential elections.
He was one of the few ANO personalities to support Zeman's opponent Jiří Drahoš in the elections.
Macura does not plan to leave the ANO movement, which he joined in 2017.
"As long as I have the feeling that I can change something in the movement, that it is not a completely futile struggle and that no one is interfering with me, I have no immediate motive to quit," he told Respekt.
Macura, 67, graduated from the University of Economics in Prague.
Before he became Ostrava's mayor in 2014, Macura worked, among other things, as director of the pharmaceutical company Walmark.
He also sat on the boards of other companies.
Uber will return to Brno offering transportation services
Uber, a company offering transportation services, will return to Brno at the end of July.
This is a consequence of a change in the law, Petr Kratochvíl, Brno's councillor for transport (ODS), said in a press statement on Thursday.
Taxi drivers in Brno protested against Uber, pointing out that Uber does not meet conditions such as being labeled as a taxi or a taximeter.
However, a change in the law in July changed the conditions for operating regular taxis and alternative ones.
Kratochvíl has held several meetings with Uber representatives in recent weeks.
"On the basis of these discussions, the company decided to return to Brno at the end of July this year.
This move is a result of a change in the law that allows the company to operate legally.
The city has been informed of this change and we believe that the company will operate its services within the given limits," Kratochvíl said.
Uber has operated in Brno in the past.
Taxi drivers protested against it for not marking vehicles as taxis or the lack of a taximeter.
The court issued a preliminary injunction banning Uber from operating in the city.
Brno initially supported taxi drivers, but late last year Mayor Markéta Vaňková (ODS) said the city would like to take steps to make Uber work in Brno.
According to later court rulings, Uber was allowed to operate in Brno, but the company did not take advantage of this.
It will now return based on a change in the law.
Since July, it has been easier to operate a transport service ordered and paid for exclusively via mobile apps, in addition to the traditional taxis with a lantern and a meter.
Too exuberant celebration in Brno: a flying chair landed a meter away from a man on the sidewalk
An office chair flew out of the fourth floor of an apartment building in Brno on Saturday evening and landed about a meter away from the sidewalk.
A pedestrian was walking on it at the time and immediately called the police.
Upon arrival at the address in the western part of the city, the patrol noticed an open window with the chair still lying underneath and several cans and cigarette butts next to it.
"The noise coming from the fourth floor room indicated that a rather noisy party was going on inside.
Officers walked down the corridor to the apartment and asked the three young men present, aged between twenty-six and twenty-nine, for an explanation," said officers' spokesman Jacob Ghanem.
The young Czechs think they are good with money. The survey did not confirm this
"So it turns out that young Czechs are somewhat more confident in their knowledge of finances than is the reality. A significantly higher proportion of wrong answers were given by women and respondents without a high school diploma," said KRUK director Jaroslava Palendalová.
Men and young high school or university graduates are more likely to trust their knowledge about financial products.
Young Czechs learn the most about the workings of financial matters from their parents (37 percent), through self-study on the internet (23 percent) and only in third place from lessons at school (21 percent).
It is mainly women who consult their parents about financial matters, while men are more likely to look for information on the internet. Getting information about finances from parents is prevalent among young people of all ages, regardless of their educational attainment or personal income. Brochures from financial institutions, professional magazines and publications have practically minimal influence.
"Once again, the importance of children being brought up by their parents, who are the authority in all major areas of life, becomes apparent. Therefore, the level of financial literacy of parents, who pass on their knowledge and experience to their offspring, is crucial," Palendalova said.
Savings and investments are preferred by 94 per cent of young people.
Young people are unanimous on the question of whether it is better to save and buy, for example, their own house or apartment, or to enjoy and spend money rather than save and own a home.
The strategy of saving and investing in fixed assets is shared by 94 per cent of respondents. This is true across all age categories of young people, regardless of educational attainment, social status or current level of personal income.
The survey strategy is then 100 per cent held by married people with two or more children and public sector employees. On the other hand, people living alone and with an income above CZK 30,000 per month are more likely to want to enjoy themselves.
Strict but fair, the clock is ticking! That's how Benesov grammar school students see their favourite cantor, the writer
Humanism should be present in every good book, believes Pavel Hoza. The high school Czech and history teacher is also a poet, novelist and builder of literary life in a small town.
Bohuslav Reynek springs to mind over Pavel Hoza's texts. His poetry, his images. Bare trees, white-washed country buildings, quivering grass, shepherds, sheep and goats, old roads and the people who have walked them for centuries. Mourning, cursing, blessing. This contemporary successor of Reynek teaches Czech language, literature and history at the grammar school in Benešov, runs the equivalent of Prague's Viola in the local Café na slovíčko and organises the annual Benešov Literary Festival.
Babiš and ČSSD will discuss the demand to dismiss Rafaj
Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO) plans to discuss with the coalition Social Democrats on Monday the demand to dismiss the head of the Antimonopoly Office (ÚOHS), Petr Rafaj.
Non-profit organisations called for Rafaje's dismissal at a meeting of the government's anti-corruption council, as did the Ústí Region.
The Social Democrats say that a replacement at the head of the office is in order.
According to the Czech Press Agency, Rafaj was not invited to the Government Office on Monday.
His second term expires in the middle of next year and he cannot be appointed a third time under the law.
His removal is within the powers of President Miloš Zeman.
In addition to the call from NGOs, the prime minister also received a letter with a similar demand from the Ústí Region.
The reason is supposed to be, among other things, Rafaj's recent cases.
Last week, the prime minister refused to comment on the request, saying that he would get acquainted with the materials and the government parties would take "some position" on it.
He also said that he had not yet discussed the call with the President and had not arranged a meeting with him anytime soon.
According to a statement from the Office of the Public Prosecutor, there is no reason for the appeal because Rafaj has not been accused of anything.
Servers IHNED.cz and Aktuálně.cz reported last week that police are interested in Rafaj's meetings with the president.
The meetings were linked, among other things, to the decision on the tender for the controversial eight-billion project for a new hospital in Zlín, which Čunek is pushing hard.
Čunek admitted the meetings, saying they dealt with his "senate activities" together.
Rafaj speaks similarly.
The Ústí Region's assembly called on the government to dismiss Rafaj at the end of June.
It is also calling for a reform of the authority's decision-making mechanisms.
According to Jaroslav Kominek, the deputy governor for transport, the decision-making of the Office for Public Procurement is not transparent and has signs of arbitrariness.
Last March, police intervened at the antitrust office over a tender for toll collection.
In June this year, news server Aktuálně.cz pointed out that Rafaj was using flats signed over to the company of influential ČSSD backroom player Alexander Čuba.
The deposit of CZK 3.5 million for the Brno apartment was paid from Rafaj's account.
Rafaj has been chairman of the Office for the Protection of Competition since 9 July 2009, and the president appointed the former Social Democrat MP for a second term in June 2015.
Rafaj's second six-year term will thus expire in less than a year.
The law on the Antimonopoly Office states that the president can dismiss the chairman of the office on the proposal of the government.
He can only be dismissed if he fails to perform his duties for more than six months or seriously undermines the dignity of his office or the independence and impartiality of the office.

Staff collapsed in the Blanken library due to the heat.
Air conditioning will help
The new equipment will cost 740 thousand and will be in operation in the second half of August.
"This is good news for me.
With three children we go to the library in the centre of Blansko regularly.
But in the warm months it was practically impossible to stay there.
It was terribly hot and the air was bad.
The ventilation didn't help.
That's why I'm glad for the air conditioning," said Petr Novotný, one of Blansko's readers.
According to the library's director, Lukáš Dlapa, temperatures in the building often climbed to over 30 degrees.
The south wall of the building is glazed and on sunny days it acts as a greenhouse.
"Moreover, the curvature of the building allows the sun to hit it for a large part of the day.
At the same time, it is a big problem to ventilate the individual wards, because the windows have to be closed overnight for security reasons.
So we often have temperatures in the library in the early morning towards 30 degrees," said Dlapa.
The study and reading room on the third floor was the worst off.
And one floor up, the exhibition rooms and the director's office.
The climate was also uncomfortable in the children's department, which is located under the roof of the building.
"Several times it happened that librarians collapsed at work and ended up incapacitated.
There was also a regular problem in the cultural room during lectures, which are attended by dozens of people.
After a few minutes it was impossible to breathe," Dlapa noted.
Initially, city officials wanted to make air conditioning in all areas of the library this year.
In the end, there will be only three circuits out of five.
"Because of limited funding, only the most problematic areas will have air conditioning.
The study room and reading room on the third floor.
Then the cultural room and the children's department one floor up," said Jiří Svoboda from the Blansko Investment Department.
He added that in the first phase last autumn, workers installed air conditioning and modified the electrical wiring in the aforementioned areas.
It cost approximately CZK 360,000.
The Blansko Municipal Library has nearly three thousand registered readers.
Of these, about nine hundred are under fifteen years of age.

Chicago's resistance has banished the coronavirus.
Crawford is back in the game
Not every infected athlete comes clean.
Especially when it comes to players from the NHL, which is as silent as the grave about players' health and doesn't disclose anything at all.
Crawford was one of the few to step out of line.
The 35-year-old Montreal native was only present at the first practice and has been missing from the lineup since.
"I want to let you all know that I tested positive for Covid-19 and because of that I have spent the last fortnight locked up in my house," he revealed the reason for his absence.
Fans no longer have to worry about his health.
Crawford is ready to hit the ground running again.
"It's great to be back.
I'll do everything I can to get back in shape as soon as possible," he added.
The experienced goaltender has won two Stanley Cups with Chicago and has been a fixture in the crease for the 10th straight season.
The Blackhawks will play St. Louis first, then face Edmonton in the preliminary round.
Přerov: Driver crashed near Kokory: He died wedged in his Fabia
A tragic traffic accident occurred on Friday on a straight stretch between Přerov and the village of Kokory. The 28-year-old driver of the Fabia failed to control the steering and drove off the road. The car overturned on its roof and he was wedged underneath. He did not survive his injuries.
"According to the initial information found on the scene, a passenger car travelling in the direction of Kokory went off the road, where it overturned on its roof and the driver remained wedged under the vehicle," Miluše Zajícová, a spokesperson for the Přerov police, told news server novinky.cz.
Thousands of people protested in Israel against the prime minister
Thousands of Israelis protested in several parts of the country against unemployment, corruption and the way Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is handling the coronavirus crisis.
Demonstrations took place outside Netanyahu's private villa in Caesarea, near his official residence and in a park in Tel Aviv.
Protests have been held regularly in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv for several weeks.
They are demanding Netanyahu's resignation because of the trial in which he is accused of corruption and fraud, as well as the government's handling of the next wave of the coronavirus epidemic.
"Bibi, go home," one protester wrote on his banner, referring to Netanyahu's widely known nickname, according to the AP.
"Everyone can see that the emperor has lost his clothes," read another.
Netanyahu, 70, is Israel's first prime minister tried while in office.
He is charged in three cases of corruption, fraud and breach of trust.
He denies all the charges, calling them a witch hunt.
According to local media, the trial could take up to three years, with over 300 witnesses called.
The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has been confirmed in nearly 60,500 people in Israel, which has a population of about nine million.
About 455 people have died in connection with the infection.
The Israeli government introduced quarantine measures in March that have helped reduce the daily increases in infections.
However, after a gradual easing of restrictions from the end of April, the numbers of infected people began to rise again, particularly in late June.
Netanyahu's critics say the government has not sufficiently helped, for example, tradesmen affected by the quarantine measures.
Protesters are also concerned that the government is issuing sometimes contradictory instructions in the fight against the coronavirus.
Step aside, Schiller urged Czernin for talking about opposition scum
"I find it completely unacceptable for a member of the Czech government to use such totalitarian language anywhere, let alone on the floor of parliament," Czernin wrote in an open letter to Schiller.
Her words caused an uproar during the discussion of a draft constitutional lawsuit against President Miloš Zeman. The opposition could not muster enough votes and the draft constitutional action, which was presented to the Senate, was thrown off the table.
"I get dozens of messages from people I don't know. There is not a single vote in support of this lawsuit. There are messages in support of the president and messages like how taxpayer money is being spent here, how empty straw is being beaten. And I'll even take the liberty, I'm not using harsh language, of quoting one of them: It's opposition and senatorial dirt," the finance minister said.
"The Nazis used these terms to denigrate citizens of Jewish descent and the Communists used these terms to denigrate their political opponents. It is totalitarian rhetoric, without a shred of respect for people and their opinions," Czernin, the vice-chair of TOP 09, wrote to the minister.
"I was quoting one of the many messages I received dozens of during the House proceedings. Their common denominator was disgust at the constant personal dehumanization we witness daily in domestic politics, which was also the main motive for Thursday's House session. I am surprised that anyone would apply the term to themselves," Schillerová told the Czech Press Agency.
The driver smashed his car into a tree and died.
The body had to be cut out of the wreckage by firefighters
The tragic accident happened at around 23:00 near Neveklov on the narrow district road leading from the Slap dam.
The driver apparently drove down into the forest at a considerable speed and smashed the car into a tree.
He died on the spot.
The body had to be extricated from the wreckage by firefighters, who, among other things, cut off the roof.
Police are investigating the circumstances of the crash.
They have ordered a forensic autopsy, which should, among other things, clarify whether the man was driving under the influence of alcohol or another addictive substance.
No more wastage and churning out one collection after another.
Pietro Filipi abolishes discounts and bets on sustainability
Czech clothing brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and is embarking on a major change of strategy.
It is cancelling discounts and no longer wants to churn out one collection after another.
The fact that the fashion industry is one of the biggest polluters of the environment is nothing new.
Billions of garments end up in incinerators and landfills every year.
But the view of slow fashion, an often despised approach to dressing, has been changing quite rapidly over the past few years.
Around half of Pietro Filipi's goods have been sold at full price.
The other half, which sold through discounts, simply won't be bought that way.
The company does not want to churn out one collection after another and discount products below their production price at the end of each season.
Moreover, according to owner Michal Mička, the days of new and old collections and blindly following fast-changing fashion trends are over.
"Most retailers already count on discounts when buying goods, so the full price includes a much higher margin.
So it's actually a bit of a scam," says Pietro Filipi owner Michal Mička.
In addition, the company wants to support local business with its approach.
"Each of our products is made from carefully selected quality fabrics and designed by local designers.
We put emphasis on the fact that a large part of our collection is made up of so-called basic pieces - i.e. clothes that are timeless and timeless.
Globally, the segment of premium brands is typical in the absence of any discounts, the price of the product simply corresponds to its quality and so there is no need for a discount," adds Mička.
Giant graffiti features RAF airman Kurt Taussig
"The brief was to create something to mark the anniversary of the end of the war.
And I thought of our fighter pilot who fought in the ranks of the British Royal Air Force in the Second World War.
The city authorities liked the design," said Vacek, who finished his work after 14 days of intensive creation.
He used about 300 litres of paint and 50 spray cans.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplice-Shanów.
He left the town when he was 15 years old.
During the war, because of his Jewish origin, the Nazis took him to an internment camp where he was held for several weeks.
However, thanks to Nicholas Winton's organisation, he and his brother managed to avoid the concentration camp.
In 1939 Taussig made his way to the UK, where he volunteered to join the Royal Air Force (RAF), and subsequently underwent pilot training in Southern Rhodesia, Africa, and Palestine.
He joined combat operations in early 1945.
After the Velvet Revolution he visited the Czech Republic several times and his native Teplice, which granted him honorary citizenship.
Kamil Vacek, forty-six years old, who is known in the street graphic art industry as Camo, has been working with spray paint on the streets of Teplice for over 20 years.
He started out with graffiti on the areas that were set aside for this purpose by the then mayor Jaroslav Kubera (ODS).
Sparta is really busy this year, admits Hradecky back Nedomlel
In his case, the increased motivation is more than understandable. Hradec hockey defender Richard Nedomlel will play against the club where he recently played on Friday. But the former Spartan is convinced that his teammates will be in a similar position, even though they have never worn the Prague club's jersey.
"Everybody wants to go up against Sparta," says the Hradecky back before the game in the 5th extra league round.
Hradec Králové will try to extend its winning streak, which currently stands at three three-point wins in a row. After Kladno, Plzeň, the most appreciated by the fans came on Sunday, Mountfield went to the neighbouring Pardubice.
"But we can't look at the games that were. We need to focus on the games that await us now and play as well, if not better," the Hradecky defender warned.
Hradec shouldn't look back at last year's record against Sparta either. They lost three out of four games, taking points only once after winning in Prague after overtime. In addition, Sparta's management brought in several significant reinforcements in the summer and expects the team to return to the top.
"Sparta has always had quality players, but what can we say, this year they are really loaded," admits Nedomlel before the first game of the end of this week.
And the second one? Also a nice one, awaiting Mountfield on Sunday afternoon in Trinec.
XXX Lutz can buy rival Kiko, the authorities have allowed. But there's a catch.
"The Office for the Protection of Competition has cleared the merger of the competitors - XLCEE-Holding GmbH on the one hand, and Kika Nábytek and Lambda Properties Czechia on the other - subject to the fulfilment of structural commitments set in favour of maintaining effective competition," said Martin Švanda, spokesman for the Office for the Protection of Competition.
XLCEE-Holding owns Möbelix stores in addition to the XXX Lutz chain. If it absorbed the Kika chain, it would have too large a share of the Czech furniture and accessories market. Therefore, it has to divest part of the company it is buying.
XLCEE-Holding is also buying Kika branches in other countries where the chain operates, i.e. Hungary, Slovakia and Romania. The antitrust authorities have to approve the transaction there as well. The purchase of 22 foreign branches of Kika from Signa Holding was announced by XXX Lutz in May. Signa took over the bankrupt Kika last year for a symbolic price.
The Kika chain entered the Czech market in 2005 and is the number two after the Swedish company IKEA. Before it was taken over by Austria's Signa, it had been owned by South African firm Steinhoff International Holdings since 2013. The latter faced problems when it discovered irregularities in its accounting. Kika has nine stores in the Czech Republic.
XXX Lutz has been operating in the Czech Republic since 2010. Alongside IKEA, Sconto, Jysk, Asko-Nábytek and Kika, it is one of the largest furniture retailers on the domestic market. The Möbelix brand has the same owner. After taking over Kika's foreign branches, XXX Lutz will already operate over 300 stores in 12 countries. According to the company's website, its annual turnover is EUR 4.4 billion (about CZK 114 billion).
Storm Hanna has made landfall on the Texas coast
Hurricane Hanna made landfall on the southwest coast of the US state of Texas on Saturday afternoon local time (before midnight CEST tonight).
It struck Texas' Padre Island, about 24 kilometres north of the town of Port Mansfield, and weakened to a tropical storm as it moved over the mainland.
However, meteorologists say it still poses a great danger to coastal residents.
It has brought with it strong winds and intense rainfall; along with localised flooding, power outages and various material damage, including damaged boats, have been reported, according to the AP.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott had already declared a state of natural disaster for 32 counties in southwest Texas on Saturday and advised people to voluntarily evacuate.
The strongest warning was given to people in the coastal strip between Port Mansfield and Mesquite Bay, but in total the element is expected to hit an area nearly 500 miles long before gradually moving over northeastern Mexico.
"Although Hanna is now a tropical storm, heavy rain and wind, rising sea levels, dangerous surf and isolated tornadoes may pose a threat," the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) warned.
The storm was moving across the US-Mexico border this morning local time (afternoon CEST) and was accompanied by winds of 85 kilometres per hour.
Hanna became the first hurricane of this year's Atlantic hurricane season on Saturday.
It was accompanied by winds of up to 145 kilometres per hour over the Gulf of Mexico, but these gradually weakened to 112 kilometres per hour as it made landfall, taking Hanna out of the hurricane category again.
Authorities have urged local residents to wait out the storm at home, while taking hygiene precautions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
Texas is one of the US states most affected by the covid-19 pandemic.
Given the existing security measures and the need to maintain distances, evacuations are a major challenge.
Makeshift shelters have been opened in hotels, schools and gymnasiums.
In Hidalgo County, Texas, one building has also been adapted as a shelter after evacuees tested positive for coronavirus or were otherwise exposed to the disease.
Local authorities have urged all evacuees to take their masks and disinfectant gels with them to the shelter if possible.
"We are far from over it.
We're expecting catastrophic flooding," the AP quoted Chris Birchfield, who works for the National Weather Service (NWS) service in Brownsville, as saying.
Forecasts say that in some places it could splash as much as 300 millimetres of rain in a matter of hours, and in some cases nearly 500 millimetres, which, combined with sea level rise, could flood many settlements along the coast.
Toyota still believes in hydrogen, prepares second generation Mirai
The Toyota Mirai was never meant to be a concept. Toyota was so serious about it that even though there was virtually no hydrogen refuelling infrastructure in the world, it still put it on the menu. Not a completely standard one, the customer had to really target this car, but no one else was offering such an option at the time.
Toyota boss Takeshi Uchiyamada confirmed at an international hydrogen conference that a new generation will arrive next year. Indeed, Toyota still believes these cars have a future and will match hybrids in price within a decade. Of course, this is linked to the development of refuelling networks. But the future is as much about hydrogen as it is about electricity.
At the conference, the word hydrogen was often mentioned in connection with the need for environmentally friendly operation, not of passenger cars, but of large tractor-trailers, ships, trains, etc. Simply those means of transport that need to cover long distances on a single refuelling. Pure battery versions cannot offer that. Thanks to its vast experience and long development, Toyota could find new markets.
It remains to be noted that, like Toyota, Hyundai also believes in hydrogen propulsion and now offers the Nexo hydrogen crossover.

Zeman to confer general rank on Colonel Lipek
President Miloš Zeman will confer the rank of general on Colonel Pavel Lipka on Wednesday.
This follows from the overview of expected events of the Ministry of Defence.
The reason for conferring the rank of brigadier general is Lipka's assumption of the post of deputy commander of the allied multinational division Northeast in Poland in August.
Lipka has been serving as deputy commander of the Czech Army's ground forces.
The promotion was proposed to Zeman by the government at the end of June.
From the beginning of August, Lipka will replace Brigadier General Karel Rehka as deputy commander of the Multinational Division Northeast in Elblag, Poland, which commands units of the Alliance's forward presence in Poland and the Baltic States.
In March, Rehka became director of the National Cyber and Information Security Bureau (NCIS).
The government has proposed to the president that Lipka be given the rank of brigadier general.
According to the law on professional soldiers, a higher rank can be conferred on a soldier for the duration of the performance of an elected office or for the duration of a service task that requires the conferment of a higher rank.
The position of deputy commander of an allied division corresponds to the rank of general.
A Soldier to whom a rank has been conferred has the same rights and obligations as if he had been appointed to that rank.
However, he is not entitled to a pay adjustment commensurate with the rank.
The conferral of rank shall continue until the reason for which it was conferred has passed.
"Colonel Lipka demonstrates a high degree of professional readiness and is a role model for his subordinates.
He contributes significantly to the fulfilment of the tasks of the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic, including cooperation with foreign partners and securing the participation of the army in foreign operations," the defence ministry said in June on the promotion proposal.
Wednesday's promotion will take place at 12:30 pm at Prague Castle and will be attended by Defence Minister Lubomír Metnar and Chief of the General Staff Aleš Opata.
A technically perfect mess with a weak script. Gemini with Will Smith did not outrage critics
The dystopian sci-fi spectacle Gemini Man boasts an interesting premise - Will Smith takes on a younger version of himself in the film. But critics say the story is the weakest part of the film. The film will be released in Czech cinemas on 10 October.
Henry Brogan (Will Smith) is the absolute best in his field. He kills efficiently and without unnecessary questions. But one day he decides to hang up his career. Naturally, his employers don't like this, and send another hit man after Henry. The catch is that the assassin is Henry himself, or more precisely, a younger clone of him created from his DNA. Can one determined man win a fight against himself? This time, literally.
A sure guarantee of quality should have been three-time Oscar winner Ang Lee. This may be his first sci-fi film, but he has plenty of experience with dramatic action movies, as he demonstrated in the aforementioned Tiger and Dragon and the western Ride with the Devil. Six writers collaborated on the script. The most famous is certainly David Benioff, one of the creators of the highly successful Game of Thrones. But according to the first reviews, even all this was not enough to make a good film.
"While Ang Lee tries to do great things in technical filmmaking, the film itself doesn't have enough character to make it stand out," thinks Screen Daily's Fionnuala Hannigan.
"This underwhelming film is less than the sum of all the talents involved. The weak script and plot are held together only by the filmmakers' technological wizardry," Stephen Dalton of The Hollywood Reporter summed up his opinion.
"Gemini is a case where a huge amount of work has resulted in an incredibly frustrating action film," says Variety reviewer Peter Deburge.
"A confused product born of a bizarre idea," summed up IndieWire's Ella Kemp in her review of the film.
"It's hard to care that one man is a doppelganger of another when neither acts like a human," wrote Nicholas Barber of The Wrap website.

Hundreds of enslaved children freed from religious school in Nigeria
According to the BBC, there were nearly five hundred men and boys, Reuters, citing the police commissioner, said there were over three hundred children aged five and above. Some were chained together, while others were chained to iron rings in the wall.
Kaduna police chief Ali Janga told the BBC that the raid on the school was carried out following a tip-off. He described the school as a house of horrors. Starving people were held there by force, tortured and sexually abused. They could not leave, there was razor wire over the walls. He said it was a case of slavery.
Several people were arrested in the raid, according to police spokesman Yakubu Sabo, who was a teacher there.
The children told police they were taken to the school by their parents or relatives, saying it was a religious school. "We have identified two children who are from Burkina Faso, but most of them were brought here by their parents from the northern Nigerian states," spokesman Sabo said on the identity of the victims. The Nigerian states in the north are predominantly Muslim.
Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal's school masqueraded as a religious school focused on the study of the Koran.
The freedmen were taken to a stadium where they are being given aid and food. Some have already been reunited with relatives.
The fastest man on the planet missed the tests. I'm not taking anything, he's defending himself.
The traditionally high-profile battle for the fastest man on the planet will be a hunt for defending silver medallist Christian Coleman at the World Championships. The 23-year-old American leads the world charts with a time of 9.81 seconds and has lost only once this year. But his start at the top of the season has been jeopardised by a case of missed doping tests.
The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) closed his case in early September without filing charges on a technicality. Coleman did fail three doping tests last year and this year, but not in the space of 12 months. Indeed, his first offence was backdated by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to April 1, 2018, the start of the second quarter, but he did not miss the actual test until June 6. And because the third omission occurred on April 29, 2019, Coleman committed the misconduct of three failed controls in 12 months.
Coleman's defense was that he merely forgot to update the athletes' whereabouts on the app. "I don't do drugs or take anything legal. A lot of athletes take legal creatine or protein powder or various other supplements for faster recovery. And I don't take anything, I work hard and that's what it's all about," he said before the start of the World Championships.
He suffered his only defeat in six 100-miler starts this year right at the start of the season at the Shanghai Diamond League, where he was beaten by compatriot Noah Lyles by just six thousandths of a second. He took advantage of Coleman's absence to triumph in the Diamond League final, but will only run the 200 at the World Championships.
Twenty-two-year-old Nigerian Divine Oduduru is the second fastest on paper with a 9.86, but he has only been successful in American university competitions.
Thirty-seven-year-old American Justin Gatlin, who shone at Stanford in June with a 9.87, will defend his title. But he ran only 10.29 in his last 100 in Zagreb because he slightly injured his back thigh muscle.
South Africa's Akani Simbine, triple Olympic medallist from Rio Andre de Grasse and European champion Zharnel Hughes are also among the favourites. The fastest Jamaican is 2011 world champion Yohan Blake with a time of 9.96.
The men's 100 will start on Friday with prelims and heats. Semi-finals and finals are scheduled for Saturday. The medals will be awarded at 21:15 CEST.
EU countries have coronavirus standards for aviation
European Union countries have agreed on common hygiene standards for air travel to help curb the spread of a new coronavirus.
The announcement was made by German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer.
Among the agreed standards are keeping a distance or wearing a veil on the plane and at the airport, but the middle seats on planes will not have to remain unoccupied.
This was reported by Reuters.
"I am pleased that my colleagues have accepted the German proposal for Europe and that we could agree on these uniform standards," Scheuer told the European Aviation Conference.
The German transport ministry then added that the agreement had been concluded by officials and still needed to be formally approved by ministers.
The agreed measures include a requirement for passengers aged six and over to cover their mouths and noses, and to keep a recommended distance during security checks and airport check-in.
Plans must also guarantee sufficient fresh air and all information must be available in several languages.
Airlines will also be able to occupy middle seats.
The common rules agreed by officials meet at least some of the airlines' requirements.
Different standards have caused confusion.

The Lessee shall be entitled to reimbursement of costs reasonably incurred in preventing further damage, unless the damage or defect was caused by circumstances for which the Lessee is responsible.
If the Landlord fails to fulfil his obligation to remove defects and obstacles that do not prevent normal living, or by which the exercise of the right of tenancy is endangered, the Tenant shall have the right to remove the defects to the extent necessary and to claim compensation from the Landlord for the costs reasonably incurred, after prior notice to the Landlord.
This right must be exercised with the Lessor without undue delay; the right shall lapse if not exercised within one month of the removal of the defects.
If the Lessee does not notify the Lessor of the damage or defect without undue delay after he should and could have discovered it with due diligence, he shall not be entitled to compensation for the costs; if he removes the damage or defect himself, he shall not be entitled to a reduction in the rent.
The Tenant shall not be entitled to carry out structural alterations or other substantial changes in the apartment without the Landlord's consent, even at the Tenant's own expense.

The Landlord reserves the right not to grant consent to the admission of another person to the apartment.
Visits by the same person or by several persons consecutively lasting more than 30 days in total per year must be reported by the Tenant to the Landlord.

The deposit for services shall be payable together with the rent.
The Landlord is entitled to unilaterally set a new amount of advance payments for services to the Tenant, taking into account the services taken by the Tenant in the previous period, so that the amount of advance payments corresponds to the approximate monthly consumption of services by the Tenant according to the previous period; similarly, the Landlord may do so in the event of a change in price regulations or circumstances decisive for determining the amount of payments for the use of the apartment or the price of services taken.
The change in the amount of the advance payments shall be effective as of the 1st day of the month following the month in which the notice of the increase in the advance payments is delivered to the Lessee.
The Lessee agrees to such method of determining the advances.

b. makes structural alterations or other substantial changes without the Landlord's consent,
c. fails to notify the Lessor of the need for repairs beyond normal maintenance and to allow the Lessor to carry out such repairs, as a result of which damage to the Lessor's or third parties' property in the amount of ten times the monthly rent is incurred,

If the apartment or its equipment has been damaged or excessively worn out, the Lessee shall be liable for damage caused by him or caused by persons whom he has unknowingly negligently allowed access to the apartment.
In the event of the Tenant's delay in vacating or handing over the apartment, the Landlord shall have the right to vacate the apartment at any time at the Tenant's expense, to which the Tenant expressly agrees.
The Parties agree that if the Lessee does not collect the items left in the apartment even within 30 (thirty) days after the end of the lease, the Lessor is entitled to dispose of these items in a suitable manner and satisfy its claims against the Lessee from the proceeds.
The Lessor shall send any surplus funds to the Lessee to the account provided by the Lessee.
Minor repairs and costs associated with the routine maintenance of the apartment, the need for which arose before the end of the lease, shall be provided by the Lessee no later than the date of handover of the apartment (end of the lease).
If the Tenant fails to do so, the necessary repairs and routine maintenance shall be provided by the Landlord at the expense of the Tenant.
The Lessee agrees to this.

Where several repairs are carried out on the same item which are related and linked in time, the sum of the costs of the related repairs shall be decisive.
The cost of transport and other costs associated with the repair, if stated on the tax receipt for the repair, shall not be included in the cost of that repair, but shall be part of the annual limit set out below.
The total cost of the minor repairs referred to in paragraphs 2 to 5 shall not exceed CZK 70 per square metre of the floor area of the dwelling per calendar year, including the cost of transport and other costs associated with the repairs, if they are included in the tax document for the repair.

Soldiers rehearse, draw the curtains. China plans celebrations at the site of the massacre
The army rehearsed the parade over recent weekends. Shops in downtown Beijing had to close and residents near the square were ordered to draw curtains. Military vehicles rolled down the empty streets to the square and warplanes circled in the sky.
Several Chinese told Reuters they were proud that their country was putting its military might on display. But one woman said it was hard to deny that the celebrations would make other countries uneasy.
She was apparently referring to Taiwan, which China claims and where elections are coming up. But there may also be concerns in the semi-autonomous city of Hong Kong, where thousands of people have repeatedly demonstrated against the Chinese-installed administrator.
Celebrations are also afoot outside Beijing. The southern Chinese port of Xiamen has already put on a special light show on Thursday night. Sia-men lies across from island Taiwan and is one of China's top ten most innovative cities.
Ahead of the anniversary, the list of banned items is growing. It already includes drones, balloons, kites, alcohol, walkie-talkies and devices that use radio waves, the Guardian pointed out. China's popular social network Weibo is deleting "harmful political information", it added.
"It's another milestone, another opportunity to show that the Chinese Communist Party remains (at the helm) despite all the predictions," said Maura Cunningham, a historian who studies China. "It's a moment when the party can demonstrate order, control and power," she added.
The People's Republic of China was formed in 1949 when the Communists, led by Mao Zedong, won their battle with Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists, who retreated to Taiwan.
In the second half of the 1960s, China underwent a disastrous communist experiment in the form of the so-called Cultural Revolution. In June 1989, the regime massacred thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators, both students and workers, in Tiananmen Square with tanks.
Since the late 1970s, China has increasingly adopted elements of a capitalist economy. Critics say it is now a mixture of the worst of communism (one party monopoly and persecution of the opposition) and (Dickensian) capitalism (exploitation of workers).

Germany reports the first case of West Nile fever from a mosquito on its territory. It's linked to climate change
In addition to West Nile fever, mosquitoes can also transmit diseases such as malaria.
Germany on Friday reported the first case of a person contracting West Nile fever on German territory after being bitten by an infected mosquito. DPA news agency reported. So far, all the patients have contracted the virus while travelling or through contact with sick animals. Experts say the groundbreaking case of infection is linked to climate change.
The Robert Koch Institute said a 70-year-old man from Saxony had contracted the virus. He had a severe illness and was treated for brain inflammation at a hospital in Leipzig. He is now well.
The West Nile virus was first detected in 1937 in Uganda. It has since spread to large parts of Africa, Asia and Europe and, in the 1990s, to the United States. It is carried mainly by birds and also by mosquitoes that become infected with their infected blood.

Trump considers canceling registration of Chinese stocks in the U.S.
US President Donald Trump's administration is considering revoking permission for Chinese firms to trade on US stock markets. An informed source told Reuters today. Such a move would be a radical escalation of trade tensions between the US and China. Shares of the affected companies on the New York Stock Exchange immediately headed down after the news, taking the entire market down with them.
The stock withdrawal would be part of a broader effort to curb U.S. investment in China, the source added. It confirmed a Bloomberg report that had sent shockwaves through financial markets shortly before. Shares of Chinese firms Alibaba Group Holding, JD.com, Pinduoduo, Baidu, Vipshop Holdings, Baozun and IQIYI lost between two and four percent.
Shares of 156 Chinese companies are traded on the Nasdaq and NYSE exchanges in the US, according to government data from February. They include at least 11 state-owned enterprises.
Bloomberg pointed out that the exact mechanism to withdraw Chinese companies' shares from the US exchanges has not yet been worked out. A possible plan would have to be approved by Trump, who has given the green light to negotiations on the matter.
China and the US have been engaged in a trade war for more than a year, imposing tariffs on each other. The dispute between the two countries is having a negative impact on the world economy and has raised fears of a global economic recession. Washington is using tariffs to try to get Beijing to change its trade practices and reduce China's trade surplus with the US.
According to CNBC television, trade talks between the US and China are expected to resume on October 10. Its goal is to end the trade war.
Former French President Chirac to be buried on Monday, public memorial service on Sunday
The funeral of former French President Jacques Chirac, who died on Thursday at the age of 86, will take place on Monday evening at the Montparnasse cemetery in Paris. French media reports citing Chirac's family. The ceremony will be private.
The public will be able to bid farewell to the former head of state on Sunday afternoon at a memorial service at the Invalides in Paris, where Chirac's coffin containing his remains will be displayed, the Elysee Palace announced.
Crowds have been streaming into the presidential residence since Thursday evening to sign the book of condolences, according to AFP. This will be possible until Sunday. Then on Monday, President Emmanuel Macron declared a state of mourning.
Meanwhile, more reactions are pouring in from around the world and from France to the death of the former mayor of Paris and president from 1995 to 2007, whom Prime Minister Édouard Philippe today described as "a Frenchman in the true sense of the word".
Chirac was remembered by the Japanese, for example, as the politician was known for his love of his country and the sport of sumo. The news of the former French President's death has appeared on the front pages of all the Japanese newspapers, including the sporting ones, the French press notes.
The museum of tribal art on Paris' Quai Branly, which Chirac founded, will not charge admission for ten days in honour of the former head of state.
Arctic Svalbard hits temperature record of almost 22 degrees
"A 41-year-old record has fallen in Longyearbyen," the Norwegian Meteorological Institute said on Twitter.
The temperature there rose to 21.7 degrees Celsius in the afternoon, breaking the 1979 record by 0.4 degrees, it added.
The roughly 2,000-strong Longyearbyen is the largest town in Svalbard, located about 1,300 kilometres from the North Pole.
Svalbard is warming faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This fact highlights the dangers of warming elsewhere in the Arctic - from Alaska to Siberia, according to a report last year by the Norwegian Centre for Climate Studies.
The average temperature in Svalbard has risen by three to five degrees since the 1970s, it said.
By 2100, it could rise by as much as ten degrees if greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere are not reduced.
Rising temperatures in Svalbard may result in the thawing of permafrost, which will threaten the stability of many buildings, roads and airports, and may cause more avalanches and landslides.
Climate warming also threatens Arctic fauna such as polar bears and seals, which depend on the ocean's ice cover.
Failure to qualify. Czech athletes fail to do well in Doha
The World Championships in Doha started with qualification failures for Czech athletics. Diana Mezuliáníková dropped out in the 800m heat and neither pole vaulter Romana Maláčová nor hammer thrower Kateřina Šafránková, who was defending her eighth place which surprised her in London last year, qualified.
On Friday, hurdler Vít Müller will run the heats and Marcela Joglová will run the night marathon race.
Šafránková threw 65.46 metres on her third attempt, falling almost six metres short of her best this year, which she would need to improve to advance. Maláčová jumped 435 cm, 450 cm was already beyond her strength. To participate in the final she needed to clear the 460 cm limit.
Mezuliáníková, who only got to the championships at the last minute thanks to an invitation from the IAAF, finished sixth to last in the fourth heat and her time of 2:03.48 minutes was not enough to advance to the semi-finals. She was one and a half seconds behind her best this year. "It was quite fast for me, unfortunately I was fighting with my opponent in the turn there, which took quite a toll on me. I thought I still had the strength, but it slowed me down there. I almost stopped and had to start again, so it was a bit uncomfortable at that point. I can't be completely satisfied," said the Czech representative.
She was happy to have overtaken at least one rival in the home straight. "She wasn't really doing well, so every opponent I beat was good. But I think it was enough for the fifth place. Unfortunately," she added. Winnie Nanyondo of Uganda was the fastest half in the heats in 2:00.36.
Missing in Doha is South Africa's Caster Semenya, the best eight miler in recent years, who has too high a level of testosterone in her body but, like some other runners, is refusing treatment mandated by IAAF rules from this year.
In the 100m heats, American Christian Coleman confirmed his role as the number one favourite with a time of 9.98, the only one to go under ten seconds. His compatriot Justin Gatlin, who at 37 years old is seeking to defend his title, also advanced to the semi-finals. Nigerian Divine Oduduru, who is the number two on this year's charts with 9.86, did not start and was expected to face Coleman, who has a 9.81 this season.
The Cuban Juan Miguel Echevarría showed great form in the qualification of the long jumpers, as he reached 840 cm with his first jump. No athlete has jumped that far in a World Championships qualification in the last 20 years. The 21-year-old Cuban leads this year's tables with 865 cm.
Berlin is responding to public pressure to solve the housing crisis. It will buy 6,000 flats from a private company
Berlin will buy 6,000 former social housing units that the city sold 15 years ago for 920 million euros (CZK 23.8 billion) from a private Luxembourg firm, ADO Properties SA. The move comes in response to public pressure, which is rebelling against skyrocketing rent prices. Berlin Senator Katrin Lompscher of the Left Party (Die Linke) said it was the biggest such buyout in the history of the German capital. The opposition has criticised the move.
"The intention is to keep rents stable in Berlin and give tenants security," said Berlin Mayor Michael Müller (SPD) in a statement. "At the same time, we will continue to build new apartments and legally treat the rent freeze," he added. The municipal firm Gewobag will take over the thousands of apartments located in the Spandau and Reinickendorf districts in the western part of the city this December.
According to Jefferies analyst Thomas Rothäusler, the city bought too expensively. Rothäusler told Bloomberg that he estimates that it overpaid for the units by about 10 percent above their book value.
The German opposition Liberal Party (FDP) says the Berlin authorities are contributing to real estate speculation by their actions. The FDP said this in a tweet on Friday. The Alternative for Germany (AfD) protest party called the move a "waste of money".
Already in mid-July, the Gewobag took back 670 apartments in Berlin's Karl-Marx-Allee, the weekly Der Spiegel recalled on its website. The council did not disclose the price at the time. The dispute over the flats on the former GDR-era exhibition street was accompanied by protests and filled the front pages of the German press. It has become a symbol of the plight of tenants in major German cities, the paper said.
The German capital used to be famous for its low cost of living and low rents. In recent years, however, it has become more attractive. Rental prices have doubled in the past decade, according to AFP, making it difficult for some residents to find affordable housing.
Britons returning from Spain face a mandatory two-week quarantine
The British cabinet has also urged citizens to avoid all non-essential travel to mainland Spain because of the risk of the spread of covid-19.
The Canary and Balearic Islands are therefore not mentioned, but even after returning from them, people must go into isolation for two weeks.
The new rules come into force at midnight.
"'Protecting public health is our absolute priority.
We have taken this decision to prevent the possible spread of the virus in Britain," the British diplomatic service said in a statement.
"We have always made it clear that we will immediately remove a country from the safe list should the need arise," it added.
As the British newspaper Metro noted, the latest announcement will affect the travel plans of thousands of Britons.
Indeed, Spain is one of the most popular holiday destinations.
Among other things, Britons are worried about whether they will be paid sick pay if they have to end up in isolation for 14 days when they return from holiday.
Neil Hunter from Sittingbourne, for example, has booked a ten-day holiday in Lanzarote and was due to leave on Tuesday.
They have been booked on the trip since December.
"We were supposed to go as a family, my wife Amanda and daughter Bethany, but to be honest after this announcement I don't know what's going to happen.
I work as a machinist and I don't think my employer will agree to me being quarantined for two weeks when I return from holiday," the Metro quoted Hunter as saying.
In relation to Spain, there are fears that the country is at the beginning of a second wave of the epidemic.
Over 900 newly infected people have been reported there in each of the last two days in a 24-hour period.
Authorities in some areas are already tightening coronavirus measures, with Catalonia, for example, trying to restrict all nightlife to prevent people from gathering in large numbers.
The Czech Foreign Ministry has now warned of an increased risk of infection in Catalonia, Aragon, the Basque Country and the Madrid area.
No Czechs or children allowed. The CTIA has detected discrimination in restaurants
These included misinformation on prices and failure to comply with the principles of fairness in sales.
In one case of discrimination, a restaurant in Prague refused to allow smaller children into the establishment. According to the CTIA, its website states that the establishment is not suitable for children under the age of eight. "When asked electronically by a consumer whether it was possible to order a table for four adults and one child aged four at that restaurant, an employee of the restaurant replied electronically that they do not accept the presence of children under eight," Fröhlich added.
In the second case, another Prague establishment refused to allow Czech speakers to sit at the table, while allowing English speakers to do so. "The Czech-speaking inspectors, in their capacity as consumers, were not allowed to sit down at the restaurant and place an order. English-speaking consumers were allowed to do so," a spokesman for the CTIA described the situation.
Both cases are now being dealt with in administrative proceedings. As they have not yet been definitively concluded, the spokesperson for the inspectorate could not provide further information on the restaurants in question.
However, discrimination was found only in a very small part of the restaurants inspected in the second quarter. In total, the CTIA carried out 139 inspections. In addition to the two cases of discrimination mentioned above, it detected other irregularities in 64 cases. Most of these were failures to comply with the principles of fairness in sales and to inform consumers about the prices of products and services in accordance with the regulations.
Already on Wednesday, the Inspectorate reported on cases of discrimination against foreigners in two Prague restaurants, Clock Caffé and Café Restaurant. In both establishments, foreigners were charged higher amounts than Czech-speaking clients. Fines of CZK 60,000 have already become final in these cases.
Model for buying electricity from Dukovany to be discussed by the government
The government will discuss on Monday a model for buying electricity from the planned new unit of the Dukovany nuclear power plant.
The draft law foresees that if the purchase price is higher than the price of power electricity on the market, all consumers will pay the difference through tariffs.
In the second case, where the purchase price is lower than the market price, the impact on consumers will be the opposite.
Power electricity is the unregulated part of the final price of electricity for consumers.
Deputy Prime Minister and Industry Minister Karel Havlicek (ANO) and the energy company CEZ have previously stated that the more likely option is that people will save money on electricity thanks to the construction.
Analysts, on the other hand, point out that the long-term outlook for electricity prices on the markets is always uncertain, as developments in the past have shown several times.
Environmental organisations have previously criticised the plan.
"The feed-in tariff can be below or above the market price of power electricity.
Thus, the final impact at the time of the rule's applicability can be both negative and positive.
The impact will be distributed among customers according to the size of the circuit breaker - when electricity consumption is lower - or according to the electricity consumption - when electricity consumption is higher," the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MIT) said in the documents accompanying the material.
Havlicek said in May that he expected the wholesale price of electricity to rise and people to make a profit from the construction of Dukovany.
Otherwise, the impact will be in the tens of crowns per year per family, which he said is far less than what people pay annually in electricity bills to support so-called supported resources.
He has previously estimated that the feed-in tariff could be between 50 and 60 euros (about CZK 1,320 to 1,600) per megawatt hour (MWh).
The submitted material does not contain any proposal for the amount, which is to be included in the power purchase agreement.
The price of electricity on the Prague Power Exchange for 2021, the year for which traders are now mostly stocked, is currently around €45 (about CZK 1,190) per MWh.
"With a difference of 10 euros between the purchase price and the market price of power electricity, the additional payment for an average household with a consumption of 3.3 MWh per year - which may correspond to a four-person household, equipped with standard electrical appliances including an electric hob and oven, but which does not use electricity for heating and hot water - could be less than 100 CZK/year," the MIT wrote in its documents for the government.
"We live in extremely turbulent times.
The coronavirus pandemic has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider a long-term prediction of market prices to be a purely speculative matter," Tomas Voltr, executive director of the Energy financial group, told the Czech News Agency earlier.
The proposed law foresees that the purchase would be carried out by the MIT, or by a legal entity owned by the state, at a predetermined price.
The contract between the investor and the state, guaranteeing the terms of the power purchase, would be concluded for a minimum of 30 years, with a possible extension of ten years, even repeatedly, but no longer than until the low-carbon production is completed.
The proposal defines low-carbon generation as nuclear reactor power generation connected to the electricity grid with an installed capacity of at least 100 megawatts (MW) after 2030.
Havlicek previously said the new Dukovany unit would have a capacity of 1,200 MW and produce nine terawatt-hours of electricity annually, equivalent to one-tenth of expected Czech consumption.
The unit should be commissioned in 2036.
The financing model for the new Dukovany unit was approved by the government on Monday.
The state should finance the plant without interest during construction, while during operation it is expected to pay 2% interest.
The opposition disagrees with the financing model and is also concerned about the possibility of Russian or Chinese companies building Dukovany.
The state should participate in 70 percent of the construction.
The rest should be paid by ČEZ, which will also cover any additional costs.
ČEZ CEO Daniel Beneš told ČTK in May that the expected sum for the construction of the unit at current prices is about six billion euros (approximately 162 billion crowns).
Contracts between the state and CEZ for the construction of the new Dukovany unit will be signed on Tuesday.
There was a fire in the underground of the CSA mine in Karviná, no one was injured
There was a fire in the underground of the CSA mine in Karviná this morning. The cause of the fire is not yet known. However, no one was injured, the mining company's spokesman Ivo Čelechovský told ČTK.
The fire broke out at 04:25 in the tunnel at a depth of about 1,200 metres. "None of the employees were hurt, no one was injured. Bánsk rescuers immediately intervened at the site and eliminated the fire by direct intervention and also carried out a survey of the area. The workplace was immediately closed and made inaccessible," the spokesman said. The exact cause of the fire will now be investigated by a special commission.
In the former Ostrava-Karviná district, coal is mined only in the Karviná part, in the mines of ČSA, Lazy, Darkov, ČSM-North and ČSM-South. Mining at the Lazy Mine is expected to end this year, while the other mines are also expected to gradually decline. OKD is the only producer of hard coal in the Czech Republic, with last year's production of 4.62 million tonnes. About 9,000 people work in the mines.
The Brno Grand Prix? Ticket prices threatened
The most expensive item before the Grand Prix every year is the entry fee. This year it was about one hundred and fifteen million crowns. "The mass of people who come to Brno during the Grand Prix spend money on accommodation, food and entertainment, which should more or less balance the costs associated with the event, including the entry fee," said Petr Pelc, an economist.
According to him, the importance of the race is also in attracting tourists to the city. "Brno does not have that many world-class tourist attractions. The Grand Prix attracts visitors from abroad. It is as important for Brno as, for example, the Turin airport or the exhibition centre. And these are projects that are supported by public money," the economist added.
The Grand Prix in Brno
- Cost over the past five years: CZK 686 million
- profits from the past five editions: 682 million crowns
- problem: lack of money for the organisation, increasing registration fee for the Dorna promotion company
- possible solutions: more money from the state, use of advertising space, increase in ticket prices
- current status: negotiations on a new contract for the next five years
According to Filip Hrůza, director of the Institute of Public Administration, the organisers must now evaluate whether the race is profitable for Brno. "The Grand Prix siphons money from public budgets for other matters. To some extent, however, this is a political question, not an economic one," he said.
In the future, the costs of the motoring event could be even higher. The option of almost doubling the registration fee is in play.
"The situation is not closed, we have to try to negotiate the best possible conditions with Dorna. It also depends on the extent to which the state is prepared to contribute to the organisation of the race. If the worst scenarios come true, I am afraid it is not realistic for the city and the region to pay the amount," admitted Brno Mayor Markéta Vaňková.
As Deník Rovnost has already reported, representatives of the South Moravian Region and Brno are also discussing the possibility of using advertising because of the difficulties in raising money for the Grand Prix. "Dorna's condition is that advertising must be placed in places that are not occupied by cameras. The choice of companies is also limited, because if Dorna has a general sponsor, the second sponsor cannot be a company from the same area," Vaňková explained.
The organisers can also raise more money from tickets in the coming years. "We have to sit down and say what the costs will actually be. And we have to adjust the re-pricing of tickets to that," said Brno's opposition ANO deputy and former mayor Petr Vokřál.
Ministry for Regional Development withdraws material on tourism support in media for two billion
The Ministry of Regional Development planned to spend CZK 2 billion on advertising holidays in the Czech Republic in the media, on the internet and on billboards, according to the material, which was withdrawn from the comments procedure.
Minister Klára Dostálová (ANO) told SeznamZprávy.cz that the material is still being worked on.
Zdopravy.cz pointed out the document in eKlep (an electronic library of the legislative process) on Friday.
The ministry justified the plan on the grounds of a drop in tourism due to the coronavirus.
During the coronavirus crisis, the media also saw a drop in revenue.
The proposal drew criticism from the opposition and tourism representatives.
According to the proposal, which can now be viewed on the hlidacstatu.cz website, the MMR planned to give money for advertising on television, radio, in the press, on the internet, on billboards and on station areas through the state agency for tourism promotion CzechTourism.
The largest part of the money, CZK 700 million, would go to television stations.
Most of it would go to the private Nova and Prima TV stations.
Print newspapers and weeklies would receive 400 million and the same share would be given to the Ministry of Culture for PR articles, advertising banners and videos on websites.
Radio stations would receive 350 million for the media campaign, most of which would again go to private stations.
The remaining 150 million would be used for outdoor advertising on billboards, LED screens and surfaces in stations or in the metro.
The campaign to promote tourism in the Czech Republic was due to start in mid-August and last for a year.
"The material is still being worked on, it is definitely not yet in the form that should be presented," Dostálová told SeznamZprávy without giving further details.
The material has been criticised by the opposition, with TOP 09 chief Marketa Pekarova Adamová saying that media outlets from the trust funds of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO) would benefit from the advertising.
"I firmly believe that this spectacular contempt will get a punch between the eyes in the autumn elections," she tweeted.
Dostálová denies that this is actually about helping the media hit by the crisis.
"It could be a coincidence, I know nothing about supporting the media," she told the Daily N on Friday.
According to her, the budget of two billion is indicative.
"Of course, we are still counting it, it could be less or more.
It's working material," she added.
The Save Tourism Initiative's media campaign to promote domestic tourism makes no sense.
"We want two billion for tourism companies, not an unnecessary advertising campaign," Tomáš Barčík, chairman of the initiative, said on Sunday.
If the two billion crowns are in the state budget, they should go to companies, not to the media, the initiative wrote in an open letter to the government.
The end of political trafices? Critics say the new law won't help anyway!
But some opposition MPs say the law is more likely to absolve ministers of their responsibility for the choice while they continue to choose their candidates.
Greater transparency in selection procedures for positions in state-owned companies is one of the goals of the nomination law. 119 MPs voted in favour. The law passed thanks to the votes of ANO, KSČM, Social Democrats and even Pirates.
Candidates for state companies will have to go through a selection procedure before a government committee. For example, it was the Pirates who sought to make the recommendation for the minister binding. This ultimately failed.
The Civic Democrats and the SPD fear that the nomination law will be a sop to ministers. "The minister will now be able to hide behind a decision of the commission and thus will not have clear transparent responsibility," SPD leader Tomio Okamura believes. Martin Kupka, vice-chairman of the ODS party, says similar things.
The government committee should completely reject candidates who do not meet the conditions. These would include criminal record, no debts, a minimum age of 25 years and the main selection criteria should be professionalism.
The law will still have to pass the Senate and then be given to the president to sign.
Auto tune-up has brought the voice of the digital soul
Everything you know about obesity is wrong, proclaims the headline of a lengthy text written for the Huffington Post by Michael Hobbes and photographed by Finlay Mackay. The provocative afterword then goes on to say that for decades the medical community has ignored the facts about obesity and waged a fierce (and also unnecessary) war on overweight people that has not only tainted public opinion but also destroyed many lives. But now it is time for a new paradigm.
What Hobbes states right at the outset is that there is often a very long and tedious road from knowing and understanding the facts to putting them into practice. He mentions the case of scurvy, where some captains as early as the seventeenth century gave lemons, limes and oranges to their crew in the belief that they would prevent disease. However, the British navy abandoned this practice because of fears of increased costs. The clear effect of fruit in preventing and treating disease was then demonstrated in the mid-18th century, but it took another fifty years for the navy to take note. Even seat belts existed long before the invention of the automobile, but only became compulsory in the 1960s, just as the first confirmed asbestos-related death dates from 1906, yet its first ban came in 1973.
"Every public health discovery - no matter how significant - has always had to compete with traditions, prejudices, and financial incentives within the society in which it was to be implemented," Hobbes writes. In American society today, nearly 80 percent of the adult population and about one-third of children meet the definition of overweight or obese. More Americans are now living with obesity than with breast cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and HIV combined.
Yet obesity is seen as a uniquely personal failing of the individual, which is said to burden the health care system and reduce GDP. The fear of fatness is so great in the population that Americans now spend more money on diets than they spend on computer games and movies. But the truth is that diets don't work. As early as 1959, research showed that 95 to 98 percent of attempts to lose weight end in failure, and two-thirds of people on diets subsequently gain more weight than they lose.
Armed with statistics, Hobbes goes on to describe the lifestyles and traumas of overweight people. The personal meets the systemic here, with faculties teaching future doctors, for example, devoting only 19 hours of their entire studies to nutrition. Which at a time when 60 process calories that Americans take in come from ultra-processed food - that is, overly processed food.
How obesity is stigmatized is again illustrated by reports from doctors' offices, where overweight people typically experience shorter appointments, are treated with less empathy by doctors, and are considered more problematic patients.
But obesity is far from just an American problem, as Hobbes writes, Since 1980, obesity rates have doubled in 73 countries and increased in 113. And in that time, no country has been able to reduce or stop the increase. Absolutely none.
Simona Krainova: Fuck the Age! Then she kissed Lucie Bílá!
The day before the launch of the Fuck The Age calendar, Simona Krainová released her latest photos of herself completely naked! "I was a bit afraid that people would judge me for taking pictures of myself naked at my age. I'm a very shy person. But so far I've had only positive reactions. I wanted to show women that if you want to, you can have a firm figure even at 46. Of course, there is hard work and sacrifice behind it, but there is no other way."
"Lukáš Dvořák and I have taken about three thousand photos, selected about a hundred and there are twelve in the calendar, so the rest are still waiting for their moment. It's definitely not the last time I'll be naked," the model confided to Blesk, who also came very naked to her christening.
She wore an extended jacket from Bernhardt and shorts underneath, but they were not visible, so it looked like she forgot her underwear. Running every day has firmed up her legs, so she can afford similar models.
Simona was so happy with her success that she kissed everyone she met at the christening. Her husband, her friends, even Lucia Bílá.
The broth of life, the rooster of beer and death like a blade of grass
Posthumous is also the third album entitled And Death is a blade of grass by the Brno poet, tireless organizer of cultural activities and publisher Jaroslav Erik Frič, who also passed away a year ago, on 24 May.
It is the fifth entry in Frič's discography and, as with his previous titles, the main emphasis here is on Frič's poetry, of which he himself is an excellent interpreter.
Frič, born in 1949, was understandably influenced by the American Beat Generation, but he passes this inspiration through his own distinctively rendered experiences as well as very intimate expressions of faith.
However, he was far from any agitation, if he spoke or wrote about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, non-aggressive, absolutely tolerant.
Bohuslav Reynek comes to mind (in contrast to Jan Zahradníček, for example), the masters will forgive me.
Frič's album offers recordings of readings from 2006, as well as performances with musicians who always accompanied him very sensitively, whether it was the cellist Josef Klíč or Honza Barton and Vítězslav Holata.
Let me help myself - gladly - with the words of the Ostrava poet Petr Hruška about Frič's long poetic compositions.
"They radiated a proud and unending bitterness," Hruška writes, "over the state of our world threatened with extinction.
A world that is sinking further and further into numbed consumer vanity and avarice, becoming more and more distant from what its soul was made of - the mysteries of faith, humility and human intimacy.
They echoed the longing of one who knows that the values for which he was created are of little interest to anyone, but who also knows that it is only through general disinterest that they cannot be renounced.
The poems were reminders that one may have to lose everything dear, but it is not unimportant how one loses it.
Whether he sells out to general decline, resigns skeptically, falls fearfully silent, or remains to the last moment in calm and proud insistence on what he believes and loves."

Paroubek is not my adviser, said Hamáček
Former Prime Minister and ČSSD chairman Jiří Paroubek is not a paid adviser to the Social Democrats.
Party chairman and Interior Minister Jan Hamáček only communicates with him and reads his opinions and articles.
Hamáček said this today on the Prima Partie television programme.
The server SeznamZprávy.cz reported on Friday that Paroubek would be Hamáček's advisor.
"From time to time we text each other, he sometimes sends me some material and I read it," Hamáček said today.
However, he added that this is not an official and paid cooperation.
He said the CSSD does not have the resources to waste on such purposes.
"The fact that I occasionally read his opinion, there are plenty of such people," he said.
In a subsequent discussion with ODS deputy Jana Černochová, the minister said many ODS members still "listen to Václav Klaus' opinions disingenuously".
He said this is fine because he is an experienced politician and former party chairman, which is also the case with Paroubek.
He described the fact that the media are making an affair out of it as a sign of this year's cucumber season.
The server SeznamZprávy.cz wrote on Friday that Paroubek is acting as Hamáček's unofficial consultant.
It also wrote that the fourth place on the party's list of candidates in the Ústí nad Labem region goes to Petr Benda, the former chair of the party's local cell, who is associated with Paroubek and served as vice-chair of his LEV 21 party.
Hamáček said today that he would not comment on the composition of the candidate list until it is finalized and approved.

Duplantis has a mile lead, it's a kick up the arse, laments Swede's challenger
It is the 22-year-old American pole vaulter who has the ambition and potential to be one of the new ruler's most serious competitors.
He already knows what it's like to beat the two years younger Duplantis, having overpowered him at the NCAA Universities Association meet last year.
"We had a battle the year before, he won then and I was second, then we switched.
Both times it was a very good battle," describes Nilsen, who secured the win with a 5.95m performance.
But Duplantis has shot up steeply since then and is currently alone in the highest pole vaulting spheres.
At just 20 years of age, he became the world record holder, breaking the 6.17m bar in Torun on 8 February this year and adding a centimetre a week later in Glasgow.
"He was already jumping six metres when he finished high school at the age of 18," his peer Nilsen recalled to the World Athletics website.
"It was clear that once he matured from a boy into a man, he would decimate all his potential and talent.
Twenty is a pretty good age to jump a world record," he believes.
Although Nilsen's list of achievements is much thinner than that of Duplantis, the American has similar goals.
He has so far hinted at his potential at NCAA events, which he has regularly won, improving his indoor personal best to 5.93m at one of them this February. He won a gold medal at the Pan American Games in Lima last August, and back in 2017 he made the US team to the world championships, where he finished 13th.
The next milestone for him then is to get his first taste of the Diamond League.
"Definitely my priority is to get on the professional circuit and compete in the Diamond League as much as possible because that's where you can make a name for yourself," he realizes.
"If you can succeed at that level, you can undoubtedly do the same at events like the Olympics, World Championships or Pan American Games."
But because of the pandemic, those top festivals have been postponed, giving Nilsen and other pole vaulters time to improve.
But will it be enough to catch up with Duplantis, who could easily turn a race under five rings into a mere battle for silver?
"Everyone is trying to catch him, but I don't think it will be possible anytime soon," Nilsen muses.
"The kid has been jumping for 16 years and in training he has a mile lead over everyone else."
And before Tokyo 2021 begins, he'll be looking to increase it.
For their study, the researchers are looking for toddlers with a birth defect called ankle valgus
Valgusity (misalignment) of the ankles is a birth defect that affects five to 10 percent of children. It is standardly treated with intensive exercise. Scientists are trying to help these children even more, so they have developed special shoes that should speed up treatment considerably.
"We have two prototypes of the shoes, which will be worn by healthy children and children with the diagnosis, to map the effect in both groups. At the same time, participation in the research will have no risks for the children and the measurements will be completely painless," explains Marta Gimunova, head of the research from the Faculty of Sports Studies at MU.
Parents of both groups of children can apply for the study via the website, where a registration form and all information is available.
The researchers are looking for fifty children with the diagnosis and fifty healthy children. Of each group, half will always wear medical shoes and half will not.
"The point at which parents should sign their child up is when they take their first independent steps, typically letting go of, for example, furniture that they are holding on to when trying to walk. Taking part in the research involves three measurements over the course of seven months from the child's first steps, each lasting about 20 minutes, and for half of the participants, it also involves wearing the shoes being tested," Gimun points out.
The opening of Pumpkin World has delayed the ripening of pumpkins
Nová Ves u Leštiny (Havlickobrod Region) - The farm in Nová Ves u Leštiny in the Havlickobrod Region opened the Pumpkin World today for more than a month. The decorations made of thousands of freshly harvested pumpkins are dominated by huge orange pyramids in the garden. The autumn event, which is becoming a tradition, starts a week later this year because the pumpkins in the surrounding seven hectares of the Pipek family's fields took longer to ripen. There are still a lot of them in the field, Jaroslava Pipková told ČTK today.
The Pipkas grow many types of pumpkins, but the weather has been against them for the last two years. This year's harvest was delayed and some varieties did not come out. "We have enough orange pumpkins for Halloween as usual, but some of the gourmet varieties have failed," Pipková said. Still, there are several varieties to choose from at the farm, from the aforementioned large pumpkins suitable for carving and carving decorations to hokkaido cooking pumpkins or elongated "spaghetti" pumpkins to ornamental gourds of various colours and shapes.
Growing pumpkins is laborious. Farmers hand hoe the plants and harvest their fruit, cutting the stem of the pumpkin with scissors. The Pipkas have been opening the Pumpkin World regularly since 2010, and past editions have attracted thousands of people. Pumpkin decorations are complemented by straw attractions or log mazes. Visitors can also see the animals raised on the farm. It will be open daily until 3 November.
Details of the event are on the farm's website, where the growers also offer some recipes for pumpkin dishes, such as pumpkin muffins or juice. Visitors tell them about other ways to adapt pumpkin in the kitchen. "A lot of cooks have tried their recipes, and we get inspired too," Pipkova said. She noted that some housewives also pickle pumpkins like cucumbers.
We are looking for motivated immigrants. The head of the children's clinic is building an international team of doctors, we bring you their stories
Albanian Ledjona Toni studied medicine in Czech and today few people know she is a foreigner.
There are hundreds of foreign doctors studying in the Czech Republic who could stay and work here. The paediatric clinic in Motol, Prague, has tried to recruit some of them.
Tara Hussein Tayeb had to sleep a lot to arrive at the Motol hospital in Prague at around 5 p.m. The Kurdish woman with short-cropped hair flew to the Czech Republic from Suleimaniyah, a city in northeastern Iraq, where she works as a paediatrician in a hospital and treats young patients in private practice in the afternoons. In addition, she teaches at the university.
Strawberry, plum and invisible. Choose the right shade of lipstick: There's more than one red
When choosing a red lipstick, you should first determine whether you are a warm or cool type. Try a simple test - examine the veins on your wrist. If they are blue, you are a cold type, if they are green, you are a warm type. When choosing a new red lipstick, the first thing to do is to sort based on undertone. Only next consider the texture.
If you are a woman with a cool undertone, then purple, plum, cherry or mauve lipsticks are suitable for you.
If you fall into the category of warm skin undertones, choose lipsticks that are like that too. You can tell by the fact that they gravitate towards orange, coral, gold or brown shades.
You may find that some veins look green and others look blue. If that's the case, congratulate yourself - you don't have to look at the undertone and can just focus on your colour preferences.

Nečesaný wants 45 million from the state
According to spokesman Vladimír Řepka, the Justice Ministry has received six requests in this regard and is now analysing them. The young man was in prison for two years for assaulting the woman, but the judiciary eventually acquitted him.
Neither the Supreme State Prosecutor Pavel Zeman nor Justice Minister Marie Benešová filed an appeal in the case.
The attempted murder of the hairdresser in Hořice happened in February 2013. The Hradec state prosecutor's office accused Nečesaný, a 20-year-old student at a grammar school at the time, of the crime. The prosecution claimed that he hit the woman several times on the head with a log and then took over ten thousand crowns from her. The woman was found seriously injured by her son and her life was saved by doctors at a hospital in Hradec Králové.
Nečesaný denied any guilt from the beginning. "I am innocent and I swear it. I am sincerely sorry for what happened to the victim, but I am not the perpetrator," the young man, who did not deny having been in the hairdresser's on the fateful day, said in court earlier. He said he wanted to get a haircut. However, he left after the woman told him that she was closing. He then turned himself in to the police as a witness.
The hairdresser did not recognize him as the aggressor when she questioned him, but later identified Nečesaný as the attacker. According to forensic experts, she suffered memory lapses after the attack.
The Hradec Králové Regional Court handed down five verdicts in the case. First, it found Nečesaný guilty twice and sentenced him to 16 years in prison; the Supreme Court of Appeal reduced his sentence to 13 years. Nečesaný went behind bars twice, but each time he was released after the Supreme Court intervened. After a change of the trial chamber was ordered, repeated acquittals were eventually handed down, the last of which was upheld by the Supreme Court in March this year.
At the same time, however, the president of the appeals chamber, Jiří Lněnička, said in his reasoning that the decision was wrong, but said he had no better option given the procedural situation. He said he dismissed the prosecutor's appeal against the acquittal verdict even though her appeal objections were legitimate.
"The problem with this case is not that there is a lack of evidence, but the evaluation of the evidence. We consider that sufficient evidence was gathered in the preliminary proceedings, which in another criminal case would have been abundantly sufficient for a guilty verdict," Lněnička said.
However, both the Hradec Králové and Supreme Courts viewed the case differently and their opinion would probably not be changed by further reversal of the acquittal.

A woman spent hundreds of thousands of her disabled son's disability pension.
She's going to court
The money the 33-year-old man receives from the state as a disability pension is primarily intended to improve his quality of life.
The woman faces up to eight years in prison for embezzlement.
Because of his poor health, the court stripped the sick man of his legal capacity and appointed his mother as guardian, who was to manage her son's money, among other things.
"Between mid-November 2013 and January this year, the woman used part of her son's disability pension funds for her own use, depriving him of CZK 440 000," police spokeswoman Dana Ladmanová said, adding that the accused woman was aggravated by the fact that as guardian she had a special duty to protect the interests of the victim.
The woman had set up an account for her son, as ordered by the court, but had his pension sent to her own account.
"After paying the costs of her son's stay in a medical facility and paying for necessary medication, she used the remaining funds to purchase a vehicle, electrical appliances and to run the household," the indictment states.
The woman admitted that she could not use her son's money for her own use.
But she defended herself by saying she used the money to help pay for family expenses.
"We had problems to run the household on our income.
We never bought anything extra.
It was always on things my son would approve of buying.
I considered it family money.
I had no idea that I was committing a crime," the woman explained to the police.
She promised to return the money to her son.
North America has been inhabited for 30,000 years, scientists say after finding tools
The finds from the Chiquihuite cave in the Mexican state of Zacatecas include 1,930 tools made of limestone, including fine blades that may have been used to cut meat and pointed objects that could have served as spearheads or spears.
The researchers found that the oldest of the tools date from 33,000 to 31,000 years ago.
"There are only a few products of this age.
But they are here," said Ciprian Ardelean, an archaeologist at the University of Zacatecas and lead author of one of two studies on the subject published in the journal Nature.
The youngest tools are 12,500 years old.
According to the experts, people have inhabited the Chiquihuite cave, located at high altitude, for 20 000 years.
Until now, the generally accepted theory was that the first representatives of the species Homo sapiens crossed the land bridge from the area of present-day Russia to Alaska about 13,500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including unique spearheads used to kill mammoths and other prehistoric animals, has shown that this Clovis culture subsequently spread across much of North America.
But this model has been cracked in recent decades, with the discovery of several ancient settlements that date back two to three thousand years.
A second study published in the journal Nature reports on 42 different sites across North America that show evidence of human presence on the continent as early as 26,000 to 19,000 years ago.
Scientists believe that a small number of people may have arrived on the North American mainland earlier than previously thought.
Some may have reached the Americas by boat.
"It is clear that people were in the Americas long before the development of the so-called Clovis culture," said anthropologist Ruth Gruhn of the University of Alberta in Canada, commenting on the new findings.
So far, interest in tickets is fulfilling an optimistic scenario, sellers say.
Prices are gradually coming down
Ticket sales in the Czech Republic are rising every week.
Compared to last summer, interest is still roughly half of what it was last year, but demand is growing by up to 20 percent every week.
According to retailers, the post-crisis development is thus fulfilling the most optimistic scenarios.
Ticket prices are also gradually falling.
According to the retailers, the most popular destinations are mainly southern European countries.
According to Kiwi.com data, Spain, Italy and Greece are leading the way.
At Letuška.cz, flights to Split, Croatia, are the most popular.
Of the other countries, the UK is the most popular, but it has always been one of the busiest destinations.
The average ticket price is also decreasing.
At the Letuška.cz portal, it was around CZK 6,250 in the middle of the month, down CZK 3,000 year-on-year.
This is mainly due to an increase in demand for European destinations, which now account for about 85 percent of sales.
However, prices to some European destinations themselves are also falling, with prices to Spain and Italy, for example, down by about a fifth in recent weeks.
The crisis has also affected consumer behaviour, with customers now buying tickets much less in advance than before, fearing further developments in the coronavirus situation.
According to earlier Kiwi.com information, the time taken to buy a ticket before departure has fallen by around ten days year-on-year.
"This confirms to us the future trend, when people will book airline tickets with much less advance notice, demand more flexibility, take less risk," said Michal Šindelář, Kiwi.com's vice president for products.
Currently, the average booking time before departure is 21 days.
Along with the growth in sales, the number of renewals from the Czech Republic is also increasing.
Prague Airport currently operates scheduled flights to more than 60 destinations.
Compared to last year's summer season, the number of destinations has increased by approximately half.
A hunter injured in a fall from a perch was carried to an ambulance for three hours
The unfortunate accident occurred just before 7.30 pm in the hills near Čertova mlýn.
"It was a very difficult and inaccessible terrain, so we sent five of our rescuers with proper equipment to the injured man. At the same time, we asked for the cooperation of the Moravian-Silesian Regional Health Service. The paramedics then dispatched an ambulance to the accident," described the circumstances of the intervention Libor Kluz, dispatcher of the Beskydy Mountain Service.
The rescuers found the hunter in the selected locality with multiple injuries. They immediately treated him and then gently, but with difficulty, transported him on a so-called Austrian trolley across the rough terrain.
"The transport over a route of about one and a half kilometres was slow and difficult. The injured nimrod was therefore handed over to the ambulance crew after about three hours," added Libor Kluz.
According to Radan Jaškovský, the chief in charge of the Beskydy Mountain Service and also an intervening rescuer, the hunter's colleague was fortunately able to describe in detail where the injured was.
"We found him relatively quickly. However, if he had had the Záchranka app on his phone, our rescuers would certainly have been with him sooner, and the 155 dispatcher would have known about the accident and his situation immediately," Radan Jaškovský noted.
He added that a charged mobile phone with the Záchranka app activated should be a matter of course in the mountains today.
The grand finale is tonight!
Watch the darts battle live on Nova Sport
The second most prestigious tournament in the PDC organization has reached the grand finale.
It will feature the experienced forty-nine-year-old Scottish darter Gary Anderson and the surprise of the tournament, twenty-six-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh.
Gary Anderson knocked out Justin Pip in the first round, then ran into his neighbour in the leaderboard.
He also handled James Wade, however, and in the quarter-finals he had a good fight with Simon Whitlock, who had earlier sent the world number one home.
The "Flying Scotsman" had a tough time in the semi-finals when he faced Michale Smith.
However, he escaped the gravedigger's shovel at the last moment, dominated in the extra time and after a score of 18:16, earned his place in the final of the tournament he had already dominated in 2018, beating Mensur Suljovic 21:19 in a stunning battle.
The biggest surprise of the World Matchplay is Dimitri van den Bergh.
The Belgian talent is enjoying the tournament and it is perhaps the knowledge that he has nothing to lose that has helped him to play in an absolutely fantastic way.
The twenty-six year old darts player first knocked out world number six Nathan Aspinall in a surprising fashion, then outlasted Joe Cullen in a dramatic battle, and even beat Adrian Lewis in the quarter-finals after a sharp start.
The semi-final was the big test.
Glen Durrant showed his strength right from the start, but the Belgian, playing calmly, then used an excellent series to take the lead, which he then held more or less easily to the end.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in high scoring, which he used to counter the occasional uncertainty on doubles.
The number of coronavirus cases was the lowest since the beginning of the week, and the number of tests was reduced.
Since the beginning of March, when the new coronavirus was first discovered in the Czech Republic, 15,212 people have been proven to have contracted it.
Almost 9 600 of them have been cured, while 368 have died.
Currently, 5 254 people are ill.
This is according to data on the website of the Ministry of Health.
The daily number of newly confirmed cases this week exceeded two hundred four times in a row.
The peak was Friday's 281 cases.
On Thursday, 235 people tested positive, 246 the day before and 206 on Tuesday.
On the first working day of this week, 169 infected people were added.
Already 9,590 people have been cured of covid-19 in the Czech Republic, 63 percent of all those infected so far.
Most have had a mild course of the disease.
According to the latest figures from the Ministry of Health, 151 people with coronavirus are in hospital, with doctors assessing the condition of 19 of them as serious.
There are several outbreaks of covid-19 in the Czech Republic.
Karviná still has the highest number of infected people per 100,000 inhabitants over the last seven days, with almost 59.
This is followed by the Jihlava district with 56 and the Frýdek-Místek district with 36 infected per 100 000 inhabitants in the last week.
Due to the increased number of infections, new measures against the spread of the coronavirus have been in force in the Czech Republic since Saturday.
People must wear masks at indoor mass events of more than 100 people, including cultural and sporting events, as well as weddings and funerals inside buildings.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be reduced by half from the current 1,000 people.
Worldwide, the number of people proven to have contracted the new coronavirus has already passed the 16 million mark.
The US Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking the pandemic globally, said.
The balance of victims who have died with the covid-19 disease is close to 645 thousand, according to this source.
The latest one million infected were added to the statistics in just three days; the 15 million mark fell on 22 July.
The largest contributors to the rapid rise in cases in recent days have been the United States, which has already registered over 4.1 million infected, Brazil with 2.4 million and India, where authorities say nearly 1.4 million people have been infected.
Infections are now increasing at a record pace.
The World Health Organization said this week that more than 284,000 new cases were added globally from Thursday to Friday, the highest daily tally since the pandemic began.
The development can be attributed to the fact that the spread of the disease is at its peak in populous countries such as the US, Brazil and India, but according to Reuters, the number of new cases rose in nearly 40 countries around the world in the past week.
These include Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium and Israel.
The outbreak has already appeared in almost every country in the world, with the first case officially announced today by the DPRK.

Indoor air is up to five times worse than outdoor air.
Air fresheners and deodorants are bad for your health
Health is not only threatened by poor air quality outdoors, but also at home.
Israeli human health expert Carol Abraham, quoted by The Jerusalem Post, warned of this.
According to Abraham, who was instrumental in the creation of Israel's Environmental Protection Ministry, the need to focus on pollutants in the home comes at a time when many people are spending more time working from home.
Abraham mentioned research by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that found that home air quality is up to five times worse than outdoor air.
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 3.8 million people die prematurely each year because of poor air quality in their homes.
"Because of the coronavirus epidemic, which has forced and continues to force many to work from home, people are having to spend more hours in their homes than before, so it's time to focus on indoor air quality," Abraham said.
In Israel, she said, almost no one is concerned about the quality of "home air."
Yet things that people come into contact with on a regular basis - paints, air fresheners, disinfectants, deodorants or pesticides - can be dangerous.
"Even the clothes we regularly wear to the dry cleaners give off poisonous gas," Abraham said.
Children, elderly household members and people with respiratory problems are most at risk, she said.
Even otherwise healthy individuals can begin to suffer problems such as headaches, fainting, nasal irritation, nosebleeds, vomiting or skin allergies.
With prolonged exposure to unhealthy substances, internal organs and the central nervous system can become damaged.
But not all pollutants come from objects inside the home; the material from which houses are built can also be a source.
Tough competition for the Skoda Kamiq. Kia XCeed bets on rich equipment, at what price?
The Kia XCeed is a relatively difficult model to classify. It falls squarely in the compact SUV category, but doesn't offer all-wheel drive. That leaves this item to its larger Sportage sibling, which is a direct answer to cars like the Skoda Karoq, Opel Grandland X or Volkswagen Tiguan. Compared to these, the XCeed also relies on more dynamic body shapes that, by sloping down the rear, can remotely resemble the world of SUV coupes, popular in this part of the market especially among premium brands such as Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz.
On the other hand, the XCeed can't just be placed alongside the plasticky versions of classic compacts, which include the Ford Focus Active. Compared to it, the Koreans have made a much larger number of changes to the bodywork, so those who don't want to may not see the Ceed in the shape of the newcomer.
Unlike the Ceed compact hatchback or wagon, the XCeed is also offered exclusively with turbocharged engines, so don't expect a base atmospheric 14-cylinder. The XCeed starts with a supercharged litre and also offers a 150kW turbocharged sixteen, reserved for the sibling GT version. Don't expect a sporting gear here. The 1.6 CRDi turbodiesel is only offered in mild-hybrid form, meaning the combustion engine is assisted by an electric system that helps with fuel consumption and emissions. From 100 kW onwards, it is also possible to pay for a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic alongside the manual.
The range will soon expand to include a plug-in hybrid, a variant that can travel around sixty kilometres on electricity alone. The batteries can also be charged from a normal socket.
Václav Havel quiz: How long he spent in prison and what made him write Charter 77
Fuenlabrada lost its chance to qualify for the top Spanish football league due to a coronavirus infection in the team.
The management of the competition cancelled the originally postponed game of the last round of the second league, in which the team could have secured participation in the play-offs.
Fuenlabrada reported 12 more people infected on Saturday, bringing the total number of positive tests for covid-19 at the club to 28.
Monday's game against La Coruna, in which Fuenlabrada needed a point to make the playoffs, was postponed due to the team's infection.
The competition's management said today that the duel against La Coruna had been definitively called off in view of force majeure due to the fact that there was no time to play it.
Fuenlabrada accepted the decision.
La Coruna, on the other hand, is rebelling against the non-playing of the match.
In the end, given the results of their rivals, even a win against Fuenlabrada would not have been enough to save them, but they consider it unfair that the last round was not played on a single date, as is customary.
The management of the former elite Spanish club is threatening to sue over their relegation to the third division.
The top two teams in the table, Huesca and Cadiz, are guaranteed promotion to the elite.
Zaragoza, Almería, Girona and Elche will face off in the play-offs for the remaining third promotion place.
Karel Gott didn't like Václav Havel?!
His daughter Dominika revealed
"Dad didn't have to like him for many years," Gott's eldest daughter Dominika revealed to Aha!, adding that the Master couldn't think of Havel's name and whenever the subject came up, Karel was always upset.
It's hard to say what they did to each other, but according to Dominika, the feud started sometime in the mid-1990s.
"Dad said in an article after the revolution that he had it easier than him.
That Havel could write in a drawer during the dark ages, but if he somehow rebelled, his career was over," Gott says.
She adds that the Czech greats found their way to each other in the end.
"I know that he couldn't even hear the word Havel until his 60th birthday.
But then the president congratulated him with a birthday letter and suddenly my father's relationship with him began to change," Dominika recalls.
In fact, ten years later, Gott even invited the then former president to celebrate his seventieth birthday at the Ambassador Hotel on Wenceslas Square.
"And there began a new era in their relationship, because my father regularly invited Mr Havel to his home in Bertramka," added the blonde, whose father died last October.
Slavík said he was also sorry that he never received a state decoration from Václav Havel.
He did receive one in 2009, although it was from his successor in office, Václav Klaus (79).
He will receive another honour in memoriam, as the current President Miloš Zeman (75) is to award him the Order of the White Lion to honour his memory.
Czech weathermen warn of fires
Meteorologists are warning of high temperatures for Tuesday afternoon for the whole of Bohemia, except for the Karlovy Vary region, as well as for southern and central Moravia.
"Exceptionally, temperatures may exceed 34 degrees Celsius, especially in central Bohemia," they said.
They advise people to drink in the heat and limit physical exertion in the afternoon and midday.
Due to the warm weather with minimal rainfall, there will be a risk of fires from Tuesday morning.
Windy weather could contribute to their rapid spread.
Meteorologists are warning of the risk of fires in central Bohemia, including Prague, Liberec, Ústí nad Labem, Karlovy Vary and Pilsen.
The fire warning will remain in effect until further notice.
"We do not expect any significant precipitation to mitigate the danger in northwest and western Bohemia until at least the end of the week," the Czech Hydrological Office said.
The Prague City Hall has responded to the meteorologists' warning by banning bonfires in risky places, which is due to take effect from Tuesday.
People in the capital will not be allowed to build open fires in parks, gardens or forests, for example, up to 50 metres from the edge of forest cover.
Smoking and the use of pyrotechnics are also banned in these areas.
The measure will remain in force until further notice, Prague City Hall spokesman Vít Hofman said.
A French chef is suing Michelin for taking away his star. I suffer from depression, he claims
Renowned French chef Marc Veyrat lost his third Michelin star this January, a year after he won it. He plans to sue the publisher of the red guide to receive the exact reasons for the demotion. Veyrat also questions the competence of the Michelin inspectors, who he says mistook saffron for cheddar. The first trial is due to take place in November.
The chef of the famous restaurant La Maison de Bois in the Alpine region of Haute Savoie lost one of his three Michelin stars in January this year. He will be taking the publisher of the prestigious Le Guide Michelin to court because he believes the commissioners' conclusion was not properly justified. In addition, he said, the withdrawal of the star had taken place without any notice. "I have been suffering from depression for six months. How dare you mess with the health of the chefs?" Veyrat told the commissioners.
Michelin reportedly gave the chef only vague reasons, such as that the chef had put cheddar in the soufflé, which the inspectors did not like. "I put saffron in it and the gentlemen thought it was cheddar because it was yellow. I've been lovingly working with Savoyard ingredients since the beginning," Veyrat objected to the decision. He is convinced of the strong incompetence of the Michelin commissioners: "You are frauds who are just stirring up controversy for commercial reasons." An outraged Veyrat does not understand "how they could have dared to say we put cheddar in our soufflé". "They insulted our region, my staff were mad about it. We have eggs from our own chickens, milk from our own cows, gardeners pick fresh herbs every morning," he fumed.
The distinctive chef, always wearing a black hat and dark glasses, is an opponent of the new generation of Michelin commissioners and is calling for his restaurant to be removed from the red guide. But the publisher refuses. "As long as the business remains open and our inspectors select it again, we will continue to recommend it," says Gwendal Poullennec, Michelin's international director.
According to Michelin, the chef's lawsuit shows that he has no meaningful charge yet and his lawyer has yet to help him formulate one. "We regret Mr Veyrat's rude communication with us. But we will examine his comments carefully," he said.
In addition to La Maison de Bois, Marc Veyart owns two other three-star restaurants.
