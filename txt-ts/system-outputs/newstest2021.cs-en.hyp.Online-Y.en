Women's under-17 medal basketball players fell short, finishing fourth
The third World Cup was won by the American women, who beat Spain narrowly 77:75 in the final despite 40 points by Angela Salvadores' Spaniard.
“We really wanted to win and not be potato, but maybe we wanted it too bad. We caught the start, but it failed to keep up because they rolled us under the basket,” regretted captain Karolína Malečková. “Playing in front of such an audience was a surreal experience,” she praised fans in Klatovy and Pilsen.
The Czechs started very well, taking an 8:0 lead thanks to two 3s and dominating on the field throughout the first quarter. At that point, the opponents seemed to be repaying defeat from the 85:88 base group after extra time. But the referees whistled them with 15 fouls for half-time, helping Hungary get back into the game with a 12:2 cord.
'I'm convinced it was enough to put in two more baskets, run away on 20 points and we wouldn't let it go again. But instead, our mistakes came. I'm not interested in the referees, but what we did wrong, and there were mistakes that helped the opponent get caught,” assessed coach Richard Fousek.
“It wasn't the first time we had a lapse in concentration. But the girls are fighters, they didn't release anything and fight to the end. The opponent was a lot of quality though,” he added.
In particular, Petra Holešínská was kept in the game by precise shooting from distance and pivotal Tereza Šípová. The top Czech scorer, however, had fouls problem, missing much of the third quarter on the field. The Hungarians took advantage of that, gaining a slight lead they had already held, despite the Czechs struggling until the final seconds.
'For us the first five games were a lot of challenging, we rotated matches in a close rotation and it cost us a lot of power. Already against Spain you could see the girls were tired and there was nowhere to take. Because of physicists, we haven't been consistent in defence. We didn't play a quick counter-attack, we lacked rebounding. And the Hungarians are of good quality that if you don't slide everything together, you're hard to win,” added Fousek.
He believes a promising future awaits his fiduciary. “In two years the girls were able to win the Youth Olympics, be second at the European Championship of 16 year olds and now they are fourth in the world. On our basis, this is a quality team with good character and needs to work with it and develop talent. Now it's up to the federation, which coach they will assign to them in the higher categories,” Fousek added.
Thomas Cook: Czechs kicked out of hotel in Majorca. Guarantee wasn't enough
The group's Austrian, German and Polish divisions also filed a proposal for insolvency in the week. The future of the Czech branch is currently being discussed, it should be decided by the end of September.
According to Vice President of the Association of Travel Agents of the Czech Republic Jan Paš, there are three variants of possible solutions at play - liquidation will be announced or the company will be sold or the team from the Czech branch will be established a new travel agency. “Which one it will be, but cannot be predicted, it will matter to the German owner,” he told the CTK today.
In addition to two premature tours, CK also deals with cases where clients have had to pay their stay, although the company tries to provide guarantees to hoteliers. CK promised its clients to reimburse the payments, according to Pope, the firm has sufficient security to do so.
Problems in hotels arose primarily in Majorca, where the company also requested assistance from the Czech consulate. In this context, the Pope described one of the cases where the hotel had sacked all the tourists of the office. “Hotelier failed to determine who belongs under German and who under Czech society. Therefore, he threw everyone out of the hotel despite the fact that the domestic Neckermann provided guarantees,” he stated. According to Šrámek, the situation was eventually resolved.
The Czech arm of bankrupt British group Thomas Cook last year increased its sales to 995 million kronor, nearly 21 per cent more year-on-year, the company's annual report shows. It covers the financial year from October 2017 to the end of September 2018. The company's net profit, on the other hand, decreased by roughly seven million to 15.3 million kroner. However, from previous years the company remained an outstanding loss of almost 103 million crore. The branch includes two basic divisions - next to CK Neckermann it is still the firm Global Travel Lufthansa City Center.
Novák helped Trabzonspor to second place, and Škoda hit
Defender Filip Novák helped a goal in the last round of the Turkish Football League Trabzonspor to the title of vice champion.
His team won 2:1 on the Kayserisporo pitch, keeping the third Besiktas behind.
Milan Škoda striker put in his 10th goal for Rizespor after January's transfer from Slavia, who saved himself even though he succumbed 1:3 on the Fenerbahce pitch.
Novák confirmed excellent productivity at fullback with a seventh goal in this league edition.
In the 63rd minute, the Kayserisporo goal-scooped only a surging shot and the Czech footballer powered the ball into the net from an angle.
Home managed five minutes before the end to equalise but Trabzonspor snatched victory to his side in the sixth minute of set-up as he successfully capped a four-on-one shot.
Skoda in the opening second half match with Fenerbahce equalised after a solo at 1:1.
While Rizespor did not hold the indecisive state for long, he did not have to be sorry, as he remained three points above the relegation band thanks to his opponents” results.
The competition will conclude Sunday's duel of the masterful Basaksehir at the Kasimpasy Course.
The well-concealed cavern at the hermit in the woods near Nový Bor was not actually habitable
In the north of Bohemia in the foothills of the Lusatian Mountains, near Nový Bor in Českolipsk, several sandstone rock formations are sheltered in the forests through which the Count Road led.
Natural and man-made.
And we will go after that human hand created.
The place is called the Cave at the Hermit.
In fact, no hermit ever lived here, and the cave served as a shelter, more precisely a hiding chamber apparently for grain.
The cave is carved from its side into a rock promontory and accessed by stairs from above.
But it is practically not visible until the last moment.
He gives it up the narrow steps leading to a kind of rock gallery, from where it is yet to enter the rock.
Although the chamber appears to be considerably far from human habitation, at the time of formation there may have been a field on the plateau where the forest is today.
“The fact that this object does not have a window and even a firebox located in a traditional place demonstrates unequivocally that no hermit here could ever survive the winter,” explains historian Kamil Podroužek of Faculty of Philosophy of Jan Evangelista Purkyně in Ústí nad Labem.
The single-space object has only a stone bench at the rear used apparently to put away the vessels.
“I see it as a chamber to store some food or produce from the field,” adds Kamil Podroužek.
Tool marks are noticeable on the walls of the cave.
The declamation of sandstone by the canine was quite simple and fast for the insiders.
It was enough to make good use of the joints and gradually deglaze the sandstone.
Depending on the length of the canine trace and even the method of chopping, the period of formation of the cave can be determined in a framework
According to the historian, this is probably about the end of the 18th century.
The cave is freely accessible and, according to the disorder that appears in it, someone occasionally sleepovers there in today's times.
If you approach the cave from above from one of the forest roads and you are taken under the cave running the creep and the nearby Count Road, you will definitely find the trail down.
And on the way out of the woods, you may still be captivated by the nearby Raven Rocks.
Under the bridge, someone killed a non-conflicted homeless woman. Police are seeking witnesses
According to Prague police, the murder occurred sometime during the early evening to the night from Tuesday to Wednesday. It is at this time that the police call for possible testimony applies.
“Some of the drivers who passed on the bridge connecting Libeň and Žižkov or Pod Krejcárkem Street could film the killer on a dashboard camera, for example. Some witness might have just seen him and could describe him. We will simply welcome any testimony on this case and accept it on line 158,” Jan Danek, a spokesman for the regional directorate of police, said.
According to a spokesman for Daxek, the murdered homeless woman was non-conflicted, did not drink alcohol and did not seek out the company of other people. At the scene, the woman lived. “She was most often in the vicinity of Krejcárk, Palmovka and Holešovice, when she had large blue shopping bags with her,” added Daněk's description of the victim, which could also help any witnesses.

Nokia is suing the Brno firm over the Lokia name. People don't mistake us, believe Moravians
Nokia has lodged objections to the Lokia brand application to the Industrial Property Office. According to CCV, however, product confusion is not likely.
A Brno firm developing CCV software is facing legal action from Finnish telecoms equipment maker Nokia. Finns don't like the fact that a Brno warehouse management firm's program is called Lokia WMS, the newspaper E15 wrote. Nokia has therefore lodged objections to the Lokia brand application to the Industrial Property Office. CCV judges that confusion is not likely.
Marketing director Petr Ondrášek said that the program is already used by two dozen customers, the market has been on since last September.
“The Nokia brand enjoys recognition and confidence around the world. When someone attempts to register a stamp that we believe may lead to confusion or weakening of our brand, we take steps to protect our valuable asset,” Nokia spokesman Mark said Durrant.
Brno developers say they did not think of a brand made famous in the past by mobile phones when creating a warehouse program. The Lokia designation by CCV is based on the Latin name for one species of dragonfly whose rapid movement is intended to be an analogy of the movement of storekeepers around the warehouse.
“In the Czech market, the possibility of confusion is little likely. We sell modern cloud software, with which companies equip their warehouse operations, and we're not really heading into the mobile phone manufacturing business. And we do not stand for comparing it to brandy, which may leave a train in his field,” responded CCV manager Tomáš Kormaňák in E15.
CCV applied for brand protection even in August before the program was brought to market with the Industrial Property Office. “Protection sought for products and services belonging to Class 9, 35 and 42, as the software belongs to Class 9, related business management services in the warehouse belong to Class 35 and the development of computer software to class 42 according to international classification,” Ondrášek said.
Nokia's objection is based on the fact that the older Nokia trademark is valid in all classes of products and services and thus applies to the widest possible range of products and services and therefore, of course also overlaps in classes 9, 35 and 42. 'The CCV does not dispute the objectors' claim as to conformity on these classes of products and services. Really, however, it is quite different brands aimed at other target groups,” said Ondrášek.
The brand dispute can take months, according to E15, and it can complicate the firm's activities.
Coal gives way to both gas and core. Renewables won't cover increased demand, says head of Europe's ExxonMobil
Renewables will not be enough for the Czech Republic to meet future energy demand. Because of unsuitable climates, wind and solar power plants need to be replenished with other alternatives, such as those using natural gas.
In an interview with HN, Philippe Ducom, president of the European branch of US concern ExxonMobil, one of the largest global oil miners, claims this. At the same time, he mentions that large repositories to store unconsumed energy for later days when both sun and wind are enough are still too expensive.
Ducom visited the ExxonMobil Centre in Prague, where 1200 people work and whose task is to support the business activities of the company and ensure logistics and other services needed for functioning companies.
From Sydney to London in four hours? In 2030, perhaps reality
Sabre combines a classic aircraft engine with a rocket. It is designed to propel the aircraft at twice the speed that the Concords were flying. “When the Sabre engine is put into service, it could allow us to fly to Australia in around four hours,” stated Turnock. And, for example, the distance between London and New York could make a plane offend in one hour.
The Independent server notes that so-called hypersonic flights, in which the speed of sound is five times exceeded, are complicated because of engine overheating. But Sabre (Synergetic Air Breathing Rocket Engine) should deal with this problem thanks to the use of super cold helium, which should prevent temperatures from rising.
“The most important thing about Sabre is that it is a hybrid of a rocket and aircraft engine that is powered by a stream of exhaust gases generated from the air,” claims Shaun Driscoll of the company Reaction Engines. “Rockets have not undergone such great development in the last 70 years, whereas the aircraft ones have. So when you combine the engines, you can have a very light and efficient propulsion system and basically create a space plane,” he added.
The engine is currently being tested, with test flights expected to begin around the middle of next year. Commercial flights then around 2030.
I still see myself as a boy who's just looking around so far, says Jan Cina
“That was a big school for all those who did on it. I fell in love with afro dancing there. The way I have something Romani in me after my dad, it completely made me feel,” said Jan Cina, who mainly considers himself a musical actor.
Much fresher memories than the series First Step has of the role of the presser in the new film National Class. Cina reveals that director Stepan Altrichter must have enticed him a lot. “It was challenging work, but the result is worth it. The film was created a year ago. Heavily and honestly, but amusing at the same time. It was spinning at National Avenue where, as a non-driver, I rode the car. A lot was also spinning on the South City of Prague,” he stated to the Czech-German co-production film.
Although he is a Thalia Award nominee for his role in a production of The Little Prince, he does not consider it the pinnacle of his career. “I don't feel that way. I still see myself as a kid who's just looking around so far. But the nomination is very enjoyable and surprising. I can see the top all the way in front of me,” he revealed, saying he didn't even think beyond the thank-you speech in case of victory. “Not really, but as a kid, when I listened to discussion shows on the radio, that's what I always imagined speaking to people.”
Jan Cina has lived with his colleague Petr Vančura for thirteen years. What's his recipe for a contented relationship? “To like each other and to see problems as a challenge and a good thing to solve,” he revealed, reminiscing about the Czech Lions bestowing when his friend fell on the stairs.
“Yes, it actually happened. He had new slippery shoes and the red carpet was slippery too. So it did not last long and lay on the ground. He was able to make it a preference. He had a workshop of Vanchur's Stairs where he taught how to fall safely down stairs at VIP events.”
Germans elected to head football union Keller
As expected, Bundesliga Freiburg boss Fritz Keller has become the new chairman of the German Football Union. The 62-year-old winemaker, gastronom and hotelier was elected unanimously for three years; he did not have an opposing candidate.
In office, Keller replaced Reinhard Grindel, who stepped down in April over an affair with unacknowledged earnings. His other predecessors Theo Zwanziger and Wolfgang Niersbach will in turn go on trial over possible bribing in the allocation of the 2006 World Cup promotions.
Keller said one of the main goals will be to return confidence to the union and drive it out of the crisis. 'It's not going to be any One Man Show, many people will bear responsibility. The union is better than its reputation,” said Keller, who presented all his tasks under the slogan: Together we can do it.
After his election to head the union Keller left the post in Freiburg.
Jockey Minařík is in artificial sleep after heavy fall in Germany
“Philip is in the best hands now.
The Institute is furnished for similar cases, in addition, luckily we have part of the family in Hanover.
This greatly eases me the situation and also the care of daughter Finju,” the server Ridci.cz quoted a statement from Minařík's wife Katja as saying.
“Everybody's doing their utmost, Philip now needs time to convalesce.
There's no point in giving any forecasts.
Anyone who has ever encountered the issue of head trauma and patients in artificial sleep knows that the situation can change.
Philip is a great warrior.
We all have to be patient now and give him time,” stated the 40-year-old jockey's wife.
Also called on Twitter for financial support for the injured Minark, star-studded Frankie Dettori, who won the obsessive King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot on Saturday, levelling evened the legend of Lester Piggott.
Nearly 70 thousand euros have been raised on the Gofundme server to date.
The goal is 100 thousand euros (2.6 million kronor).
Video referee took Sassuola footballers four goals, lost 0:2
Sassuola's footballers, while getting the ball into their opponent's goal four times in Saturday's game in Napoli, eventually they had to put up with a 0:2 defeat.
Neither of their goals was acknowledged by the referee after consulting the video due to offside.
According to Italian media, this is a record adversity of technology, so many interventions have never been thwarted by VAR to one team.
“The VAR was stricter on Sassuolo than the road radar and punished him like no team yet.
New technology is tearing up records,” Gazzetta dello Sport newspaper wrote in a commentary.
“Festival of unrecognized goals by Sassuola.
Never before has VAR been so strict on one team,” added the Corriere dello Sport sheet.
Napoli took the lead as early as the 8th minute on Saturday, but after half an hour of play Sassuolo seemed to have equalised.
But Filip Djuričič's goal was not acknowledged after the video referee's intervention due to offside.
For the same reason, then, successively, Djuričič's other hit and the hits of Francesco Caputo and Domenico Berardi did not apply either.
Home, by contrast, they added one more goal.
Electric cars report a new record.
In the Czech Republic, the most rechargeable in history
“Growth has been dragged both by a 30 per cent increase in the number of stations on our network and the trend of more frequent charging at public stations, as well as the accelerated development of new e-car registrations,” said the head of the Clean Unit technology ČEZ Tomáš Chmelík.
Other big players, such as PRE and E.ON, Tesla electric car maker, but also Bill and Lidl supermarkets, are also reporting their part on the market.
In turn, the operator of classic petrol stations is represented by MOL.
But she doesn't have numbers yet.
“We started building our electric mobility network only last year,” explained Jana Jusková, a spokeswoman for the firm.
However, the editorial staff of the Diary exclusively obtained data from all 216 electric stands operated by CEZ.
It follows that drivers took an average of 13.5 kWh from stations.
This corresponds to the range of roughly a hundred kilometers of a smaller electric car.
If small pumping up to 1 kWh, the average charge takes two and a half hours.
The vast majority of refueling then took place in a free tariff.
If motorists were already paying for the take-out, their typical spans were around 330 kronor.
Electric mobility stretches primarily in the capital.
All five of ČEZ's most busiest rechargers are located on the territory of Prague, which are overshadowed by all regional cities.
Between the regions, Olomouc leads.
On the contrary, the least interest is in remote stations in the borderlands, such as in Bohumin or Prachatice, which often remain unused throughout the day.
More than four thousand electric cars are currently registered in the Czech Republic.
For this year's first half alone, 1274 new e-cars added.
In a wide-ranging poll by Diary “Czechs on the Move,” eight percent of readers said they were considering buying an electric car into the family.
Only a third of respondents, however, know where to look for the nearest charging station in their area.
Epilepsy complicated his love of sport, thanks to surgery he has new hope
For the first time, Honzik's parents recorded that something was wrong with him, in a year and a half. He always looked into the space for a few minutes, immobilized and did not respond to anyone. Therefore, the pediatrician sent him to the pediatric neurological clinic, where doctors, after a series of examinations, made him a diagnosis of epilepsy and immediately put on drugs that did not work immediately.
It took almost a year for doctors to find the ideal combination of drugs that made him stop having seizures altogether. At the age of five, doctors dropped off his medication, and because the seizures didn't return, the parents thought Honza was healthy and started leading him more towards sports. He rode his bike, skied, played tennis and floorball, spending his free time playing games with his sister and mates. But he got another seizure at the age of 11, and everything started at once.
Doctors tried different combinations of drugs again, but this time nothing took up, seizures in the form of absences were constantly repeated. Since during the seizure Honza always stopped perceiving, his parents dreaded that he would get it while doing sports and get hurt. Gradually, Honza stopped cycling and swapped the downhill skis for cross-country skiing and snowboard. Although the sport provoked him a seizure from time to time, he never completely gave it up. He even made a dream come true and completed the Spartan Race, but along with a friend who kept him in plain sight to help in an emergency.
When Honz was 15 years old, his parents decided to try changing doctors and turned to experts at the FN in Motola. After a series of examinations, the doctors there considered that Honza was a candidate for surgery to remove a bearing from his brain - the source of epileptic seizures. “I had to do 2 surgeries in a row, first doctors put probes into my brain that sensed his activity, then they could only remove my bearing. It's been a multi-week hell for me. I just had to lie down and almost not move, wires were sticking out of my head that were connected to the computer,” Honza recalls.
The operation was successful and doctors removed the relatively extensive bearing. “The first days after the operation it was very mentally challenging, Honza was apathetic, confused, sad and almost not talking. Compared to how alive and communicative he is normally, it was a terrifying change, but luckily after a couple of days everything was back to normal,” the mum describes, adding: “He had 1 seizure a month and a half after the operation, but according to doctors, it happens. It's been three months without a seizure since then.”
This school year, Honza will graduate, besides sports, he enjoys languages and has started working with Company E, with whom he drives around schools for epilepsy beseda. Honza is not fully engaged in sports activities yet, starting to return to the sport a little time. “I'm learning how to play sports properly, how to breathe well so that I don't expose the body to sudden stress, which, though, is quite a nut with my competitive nature,” explains Honza.
This year, therefore, he is not actively participating in the traditional EPPI boating triathlon, at which patients with epilepsy and healthy athletes meet, which takes place this weekend on 28 September 2019 at Merry sandbox. But next year, I hope it will.

Not just for better water retention.
In Prague, environmental activists protested
According to the organizers, the government's actions to date on the protection and healing of the Czech landscape and the resolution of the climate crisis are insufficient, the speakers called on the state to take a more vigorous approach.
The event, titled The Last Drop, was attended by representatives of major organisations such as the Rainbow Movement, Greenpeace or the Green Party, as well as smaller local associations.
“We have people here, for example, who have been speaking out against the expansion on the Turów mine for a long time, there are people who are speaking out against gravel mining near Uherský Ostroh, there are people who stand out against the construction of senseless dams,” Marika Volf said behind the organizers.
It stated that the protesters' main demands were the creation of a plan for water retention in the landscape, a sharp change in agricultural policy and the subsidy system towards promoting sustainable agriculture; and as fast as possible transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.
“The government is supposed to defend the interests of the people, not a reckless and devastating business,” she said.
A stand was placed in the Malostransky Square with a petition calling on the leaders of the Czech state to push for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and restoring Czech soil and landscape.
People present were equipped with banners with slogans such as “End of rapeseed depletion” or “Less coal, more newts.”
Jan Škoda came from South Moravia to Prague from the company Za water for people, protesting against the gravel mining plan in Hodonínsk.
“It threatens the source of drinking water for 140,000 people,” he said.
He added that wells represent the fifth most hearty source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
The planned gravel mining operation, according to him, is only about 500 metres from the wells and, according to reports, it is certain that water quality will be compromised.
The so-called agroecological farmers came from the village of Valeč in Karlovy Vary Vojtěch Veselý.
He drew attention to the pros of small farms that don't get behind yields and profit, supplying residents on site.
“Small agro-organic farms are capable of feeding the whole population completely normally, in doing so they do not put such destruction on the form of the countryside and the environment,” he said.
Kovosvit sells the administration building and other halls. Expecting worse times
Due to restructuring, Kovosvit ended last year with a consolidated loss of 100 million kronor, consolidated turnover was 1.3 billion. Among last year's problems are Cook's lack of workers and subcontractor shifts. This year, demand for machine tools has fallen, by between 10 and 20 percent year-on-year. “Associated with this is also the expected decline in turnover of the order of ten per cent,” the chief executive said. In 2017, Kovosvit had sales of 1.3 billion kronor and profit after tax of 40.1 million. The loss for 2016 was 719 million.
Kovosvit now offers for sale several properties, halls and land, which either does not use or only minimally. It also applies to the administration building, where it uses two of the five floors, and not quite yet. “Part of the long-term restructuring plan is to slimmer Kovosvit, streamline its operations. Selling property is not part of some momentary solution, whether it's cash-flow, for example, but part of a long-term plan where we want to devote all resources to investment development,” he said chief executive.
Roughly half the production Kovosvit exports. Its standard markets are the EU and Russia, Asia last year to a lesser extent. This year Kovosvit ranks among India's most interesting, where Kovosvit was awarded a contract for machines enabling five-axis machining worth 100 million kroner. This year, the firm also exported two five-axis machines for 30 million kroner to China. “The negotiated is another contract in the same volume that we would like to meet before the end of the year,” Cook said. In the Russian market and elsewhere, Kovosvit faces restrictions because of sanctions.
Last year, the firm sold two five-axis machining centres to France, a company that is a subcontractor to Airbus. This May, she delivered another machine, one more she should deliver at the end of the year or the short of 2020.
The main corporate investment this year was the transition of heating from steam to hot water for 20 million kronor. Kovosvit employs 500 people, the average worker's wage is 28,500 kronor. The company seeks cast grinders for foundry, machining, turning machines and electricians.
The company has been owned since September 2016 by industrialist and armourer Jaroslav Strnad. The enterprise has a tradition in the production of machine tools. It was founded by Tomáš Bata in 1939. The company had up to three thousand employees of its time.
Three people died in plane crash on house in Germany
Three people died in the fall of an ultralight plane on an apartment block in western Germany today and two others were injured.
They informed local emergency forces about this, according to which two crew members and one resident of the house are believed to be among the dead.
The aircraft crashed onto the roof of a building in the town of Wesel in North Rhine-Westphalia.
The penthouse, which was one of five housing units in the house, subsequently engulfed the fire.
Firefighters have already managed to bring the flames under control.
Local Fire Department Deputy Chief Robert Meyboom disclosed that apparently both members of the aircraft crew had died.
The third victim, according to police, is a woman who lived in the house.
Citing the mayor of Wesel, the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ) newspaper wrote that it was a single mother whose two-year-old daughter was rescued from the flat with light injuries.
An emergency parachute was found near the accident, which apparently served as a brake on landing.
Police are based on the fact that it came from a crashed plane.
There was room for two people in the aeroplane.
The machine kicked off from the airport in the nearby town of Marl.
Citing eyewitnesses, the Rheinische Post newspaper said that before crashing, the plane collided with a hot air balloon.
However, this information has not yet been confirmed.
WAZ, citing other witnesses, wrote that the aircraft disintegrated in mid-air before impacting the ground.
Accident on D5: Motorway shut down by lorry collision
The event was reported around 08:00 on the 22nd kilometer in the direction of Prague. “The highway is closed, at least for freight traffic. Passenger cars can drive through the gas station,” police spokeswoman Michaela Richter said in the morning. Traffic managed to recover around 2:30 p.m. Preliminary damage is at least two million kroner, according to Richter, the cause of the accident police officers are investigating.
Central Bohemian fire department spokesman Petr Svoboda stated that one truck was carrying passenger vehicles and the other a plastic granulate. “Due to the large impact, there was a displacement of vehicles carried, which firefighters had to first provide against any potential fall,” he added.
One of the cars had a damaged fuel tank, from which about 200 litres of diesel leaked. Another 200 litres, firefighters managed to drain away. Workers of the Environment Department of Beroun City Hall were called to the accident due to the fuel leak. The release of the crashed vehicles and the highway was secured by a private firm, which also extracted contaminated earth.
Microplastics have made it all the way to human intestines, study confirms for first time
Several years' suspicions have been confirmed to scientists. A team led by University of Vienna professor Philippe Schwablo published a study proving, for the first time, the presence of microplastics in human stool. While the study is small, with eight participants from Europe, Japan and Russia - however tiny particles of plastic measuring between 50 and 500 micrometres were found in samples of all those surveyed. None of the eight subjects were vegetarian, six of them did not shy away from sea fish, all drinking water from plastic bottles and food packaged in plastic.
And it would actually be kind of a miracle if nothing could be found. We already know that microplastics - which are produced either directly, for example, for the needs of the cosmetics industry, or arise from the decay of larger pieces - are present in marine animals, insects, tap water and sodas; in short, everywhere on the planet. Thus, their entry into the digestive tract of a person has only been officially confirmed. About 20 microplastic particles accounted for ten grams of stool, and scientists estimate that more than half of the world's population will have them in them.
Both lay and scientific awareness, of course, suspect that this is not well. But humanity still doesn't know how wrong it is - and what effect microplastics have on “host” organisms. Small particles can get up to the bloodstream or lymphatic system and end up in the liver, for example. 'It's the first ever study of its kind and confirmed what we've thought for a long time. Now that we have the first evidence of microplastics occurrence in the human body, we need to continue to investigate exactly what this means for human health,” Schwabl says.
So far, it is known that microplastics in the intestines can negatively affect the immune reactions of the digestive system and thus facilitate the absorption of poisonous chemicals and other pathogens into the body. And so far there is no known solution other than to limit the use of plastics, primarily polypropylene. But this will be difficult - the first task facing governments and authorities will at least be to stop its steep increase. As for plastic bottles alone, experts estimate that in three years mankind will consume a fifth more of them than it does today. The current pace is a riveting million bottles bought per minute. Each year, roughly eight million tons of plastic end up in the seas and oceans. The waste threatens marine ecosystems and infests the digestive systems of marine animals.
Some states have already acceded to restrictions and other measures, Kenya, for example - under threat of draconian punishments - has banned plastic bags. The European Commission is thinking about minor bans (well known straws), in the same direction the domestic Ministry of the Environment is heading. Critics, however, argue that such measures, while nice, are completely inadequate.
Repair of the Krkonoše museum will be a year late
The administration of the Krkonoše National Park (KRNAP) by three weeks pushed the bidding deadline to the second tender for the repair of the Krkonoše Museum in Vrchlabi. The original opening date for envelopes was September 20, Radek Dear National Park spokesman said. The reason for shifting the deadline for submitting bids is to reduce the budget from 110 million kronor to 83 million kronor.
“We are currently working with prices that are on the market. There's been a change in the budget, it's about the price we expect to be offered. If someone makes an offer that is acceptable, then the works will begin as much as possible,” Dear said.
Opposite the original plans, the museum's repair start is about a year late. KRNAP wanted to have a selected construction part contractor by the end of last year and start construction work this spring. According to the management of the National Park Administration, European subsidies of 123 million crowns for the project are not at risk.
The administration of KRNAP is failing to choose the construction company to repair the museum. It listed the second competition this summer because, in the previous tender, all of the firms” offerings significantly exceeded the then-projected price of 65 million. Offers exceeded 100 million kroner.
The museum, which is housed in a former Augustinian monastery and belongs to the KRNAP Administration, has been closed since autumn 2017. The selected company should arrange the construction part of the project. The total cost including building a new exposure is estimated at 210 million kroner. A KRNAP visitor centre should be created in the now-vacated facility by the end of 2021 after the conversion of the exhibitions.
The repaired museum with a new interactive exhibition, which should be the story of nature and people settled in the mountains and build on the successful exhibition Stone and Life, should serve for visitors as representative entrance gate of the Giant Mountains. The visitor center should provide information about the past and present of the Giant Mountains and motivate people to explore mountains and protect them in the most comprehensible way. It should take on the role of a traditional museum as well. The centre will also offer opportunities for concerts, festivals, theatre performances or open-air lectures. The plans include building a new entrance to the building, creating a research house or café.
The Czech savings bank erroneously charged some card payments twice on Saturday.
Already removed the error
The Czech Savings Bank erroneously charged some card payments twice on Saturday afternoon.
According to the bank's spokesman, Lukas Kropík, the problem could have covered thousands of transactions.
The error has already been eliminated by the savings bank and returned the money to clients.
Problems with the double billing of card payments the savings bank noted on Saturday afternoon.
'We still made an update to the system yesterday (Saturday) night and returned all these double payments to clients immediately.
At the moment everything is working without problems,” Kropík told the news on Sunday afternoon.
The exact number of clients to whom the bank has deducted money from card payments twice, a bank spokesman does not know, in his estimation it was lower thousands of transactions.
The causes of problems the savings bank is finding out.
“It could have been a combination of multiple factors,” Kropík said.
Česká spořitelna is the largest bank in the Czech Republic by number of clients.
It had 4.6 million of them at the end of March.
The owner of the savings bank is the Austrian financial group Erste Group Bank, which is a key player in the central and eastern European banking market.
Vojtěch on Monday will present a system of three emergency stages against coronavirus
“Degrees will be region-level according to the strength of community spread.
We work on this together with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics,” Vojtěch said in CT.
It will be a so-called traffic light, individual regions will be marked green, orange or red according to the risk of coronavirus.
The minister added that he would still talk to epidemiologists about the inclusion of individual counties.
He accepted that only the Moravian-Silesian Region would currently have the orange colour and Prague would be close to it.
The map will also include individual arrangements for county sanitation stations, hospitals, social facilities and employers.
“We want to address this at the level of the regions, because the situation in them is not one-centered,” Vojtěch said.
“Terrifying study result.” Islam doesn't belong in the West, the vast majority of Austrians think
1,200 respondents were surveyed, the survey shows considerable distrustfulness of Islam in Austrian society.
Nearly 60 percent of Austria's population fear some Muslims are terrorists, and 48 percent would call for a ban on the construction of mosques to be imposed. For greater surveillance of the centers of Islam, 80 percent of those polled are.
Most Austrians also want Muslims to be restricted in their religious practices, saying they sometimes feel outsiders in their own country because of the presence of Muslims.
“The outcome of the study is terrifying,” argues study author Wolfgang Aschauer, adding: “Such a propensity for ethnocentrism could lead over time to the adoption of discriminatory attitudes. Religious freedoms, accorded to Muslims, threaten to narrow.”
In believers, the critical attitude is less pronounced. Aschauer argues that in Austria it is not about conflict between religions, but between cultures. Dialogue and education could help blunt polarization, according to the sociologist.
The most hostile attitudes towards Muslims are held by voters of the extreme right, people without higher education, or seniors over 75, according to the study. Most amiable, on the other hand, are Green voters, people under 30 and college students.
Some 700 thousand Muslims live in Austria, which has a population of roughly 8.7 million, according to estimates from Austria's Interior Ministry. The vast majority have Turkish roots. There are more than 400 Muslim prayers and mosques in the country, and Islam has been officially recognized as a religion here since 1912.
Which cities disappear under the sea?
The vote by the upper house of Canada's parliament has been a familiar rumor for days: Canada is taking away honorary citizenship from former human rights legend, Nobel Peace Prize winner Do Aung San Suu Kyi. Myanmar (Burma)'s current leader, who spent years under house arrest for trying to bring freedom to her country, lost her honorary title because of her part in genocide against the minority Rohing nation.
The decision to take Suu Kyi's honorary citizenship was already agreed by the lower legislative body a week ago, and senators have now unanimously backed him. “It is the right message both for her and for Myanmar and for the whole world,” independent Senator Ratna Omidvar commented on her colleagues' decision. 'We need to make it clear that the accomplices of genocide here in Canada are not welcome - all the more like honest citizens. '
By the verdict of the Canadian Parliament, technically, nothing changes for Suu Kyi, it is just an honorary title, however, on a symbolic plane, it is a strong message for her. The longtime human rights campaigner's silence on the atrocities the army of majority-Buddhist Myanmar has been committing for endless months on the Rohings' Muslim minority is unyielding.
The fact that there is officially organized genocide in Myanmar, and that Suu Kyi - the de facto prime minister of the government there - has utterly failed in her duty to protect her citizens, a UN report recently brought in. Specifically, the names of several army commanders who, according to the investigation team, should stand trial for crimes against humanity committed in actions that - as the report says - “they shock both by the exquisitance of their actions and by the enormous scope.” Suu Kyi and her led administration, according to the UN, committed complicity primarily by covering the soldiers' actions and releasing a fog of lies around them with protection - for example, that it is about” counter-terrorism operation”.
After Suu Kyi's cross out, five personalities remain on Canada's list of honorary citizens: Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, Nelson Mandela, Tändzin Gjamccho, 14th Dalai Lama, Karim Aga Khan IV, 49th Imam Shiite Muslims and Malala Yousufzaj.
Developments around the former icon of the struggle for freedom and democracy were also reflected by the Canadian Museum of Human Rights, with information on the atrocities against the Rohingians and on the parliamentary decision to take away her title of honorary citizen. “We also muted the dedication of her photo on a tablet that depicts the timeline of the struggle for human rights and think about replacing her face with a portrait of some member of the Rohingian minority,” they quote Canadian media museum spokesman Rorie McLeod.
The only thing that will remain so in Suu Kyi's current upheaval - at least so far - is the Nobel Peace Prize, awarded to her at the suggestion of Vaclav Havel in 1991 for a huge contribution to the struggle for democracy. “While Ms Suu Kyi's current venue is regrettable, her award will not be annulled,” Nobel Foundation chief Lars Heikensten told Canada's CBS.

Technology firms want to rule our cities
Francis Fukuyama's history has bittered somewhat. In 1992, at the height of the wave of liberalism that followed the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Iron Curtain, this political scientist in his most famous book The End of History and the Last Man wrote: “That, what we may be witnessing... is the final point of humanity's ideological evolution and the universal acceptance of Western liberal democracy as the ultimate form of governance.”
Twenty-six years later, we are rather seeing how, from the US to Russia, from Turkey to Poland, and from Hungary to Italy, more illiberal models and thrive on different forms of nationalism, and radicalism. Fukuyama's current ninth book, Identity: The Demand for Dignity and the Politics of Resentment, is attempting to cope with the onset of these forces. As his interview by George Eaton for the New Statesman shows, he is reassessing many of his former positions: he argues that ideas of socialism should be rolled back into public space and Marx he was right in many ways. While at the same time, he insists that his thought development is still consistent with that of the 1990s, and critics are said to have misunderstood The End of History and the Last Man correctly.
“What I was already saying at the time was that one of the problems of modern democracy is that while it provides peace and prosperity, people want more than just that... Liberal democracies don't even try to define what a good life is. It leaves it up to individuals who feel alienated, see no point, and therefore associate themselves into groups according to identity that give them a sense of belonging.”
In its time, the book The End of History and the Last Man was written as a strong argument towards Marxists who viewed communism as the final stage of history. When asked about how he now views the socialists” boom in Britain and the US, Fukuyama replies: “It all depends on what you mean by socialism. If we are talking about owning the means of production, then except when clear services to the public are in demand, I think it will not work. But if you are referring to redistribution programs that attempt to solve the huge imbalance in income and wealth that we are seeing, then yes. I think not only could he come back, he should come back. That long period kicked off by President Reagan and Prime Minister Thatcher, and in which certain types of ideas about the benefits of an unregulated market, had in many ways disastrous effect.”
Ultimately, Fukuyama attempts to calm even the current situation, warning all liberals that even the onset of new not entirely democratic regimes will not mean the end of history.
Civilization in time bestowed
Recently, I remembered a beautiful “spelt” from one of the great short stories of Šimko with Grossmann set partly in the cemetery, which reads like this: “I alerted her that she cries well, but on a foreign grave!” It occurred to me that many of the world's politicians engaged in a senseless fight against climate change are now acting very similarly.
They act as if the planet Earth is ruled by humans. In fact, we are just a speck on her surface, which she can blow out with her enlightened powers like a fierce whiff of wind a candle flame. Probably few of them look at the famous British and American natural history documents discussing the destructive capabilities of our blue ball. After all, it would be enough for some of the larger active volcanoes to get really “screwed up” and our advanced civilization will be reprimanded.
And that this will happen in the immediate future is highly likely. A number of large volcanoes have, in the opinion of leading volcanologists, “charged and uninsured” (such as Katla in Iceland).
In a way, it would be ideal if the eruption, if it must happen once, happened as soon as possible. Even before trillions of dollars are completely needlessly thrown away on measures to reduce carbon dioxide production, because any properly angry volcanic has him along with dust and poisonous volcanic gases can emit into the air at least 100 times more than has been spared at the expense of the people of Europe.
So forcibly limiting CO2 production doesn't make any sense. Moreover, it has been scientifically proven that at its significantly higher proportion in the air, plants form more biological matter and are also more drought resistant. For humanity, eventual warming is considerably more favorable than the rapid return of the Ice Age, for example, would be.
If we are aware of this yet inadequately explored effect of solar cycles on Earth's climate, we must come to only one reasonable conclusion: Let us try hard to keep the Earth as clean as possible, and To other changes with which we can not deal with force, let us try to adapt with as little cost as possible!
Vodník and Carolingka
When the waterman Jonah and the miller's daughter Carolingka look into each other, they don't have it easy at all.
Jonah is defended in love by his father, the unrefined waterman Hastrbuch. Carolingia has no idea that her dear Jonah is not human.
Well, there's a Libor guy who'll do everything he can to protect the whole village, and especially Carolingka, from the watershed villain.
What about him scheming and lying?
Especially when he can make Carolingia dismiss Jonah and prefer him, the burly Libor.
Before long, it is clear to everyone in the village who is responsible for the drowning of the slipping Konvika, the spoiled flour, the fire of the mill and other lotrovina.
The villagers arrange a hunt for the waterman, and in order to do so, the irreconcilable water curse falls on Jonah's head.
Now advise Konviček's soul to Carolingian!
How to soften the old Hastrbuch, convince the neighbors of Jonah's innocence, find Jonah and deliver him from the incantation?
The fairy tale was filmed in September 2010 in ČT studios and in exteriors near Brzina pond, in Obděnice in Sedlčansk and in the beautiful surroundings of a historic mill in Hoslovice.
Kristýna Plíšková did not go through to the final, second title so far eludes her
Plíšková environment in Tashkent testified, she won her first tournament on the WTA circuit in 2016, and also this year she was very sovereign.
After wins with Paolini, Kawaova and Kuzmova, she fought her way through the top four female players.
But the match with Alison Van Uytvanck didn't go well for Kristýna. The Belgianwoman kept her serve and broke the serve of Plíšková twice in the first set. In the second set, Van Uytvanck went early to lead 3:0 and the reversal was no longer able to give Kristýna even though she managed to eventually turn into one shot. In the last one she still turned away one swordbol, but the second came the end.

Purpose-built slurs? The Ústí zoo is looking for a new vet, no one is interested
Most recently late this month. The management of the city alludes to the slander that swarmed around the former director of the zoo and at the same time Václav Poživil veterinarian, that he purposefully killed the exotic animals he cared for. For example, it was the female rhino Zamba, the elephant of Kalu or the orangutan of Něuňák.
The city council therefore declared a new contract. “For veterinary care for a zoo with a projected performance value of 3.5 million crore without VAT and for a municipal Centre for Animals in Need with a projected performance value of 2,8 million crowns without VAT,” approached city spokeswoman Romana Macová.
Deputy Mayor Věra Neerová (UFO) explained that the city was declaring a competition for veterinary services for the third time. “Doctor Invigorated must have explained those unfounded suspicions. I consider it an egregious dehonestation by such a quality expert,” she noted.
Experts specialized in exotic animals, according to her, are very few. “It's definitely nothing pleasant. The zoo so far provides veterinary care in the form of orders,” it said. Orders and contract cost the same money. “The garden has to comply with the public procurement law,” explained zoo spokeswoman Nikola Roštejnská.
Václav Poživil himself is among the recognized experts. He participated, for example, in a unique operation in which Jane, the mouth cheetah, was given a total endoprosthesis as the world's first cheetah. He held the position of director of the zoo from 2009 to 2012. Anonymous slurs made no comment on his person. Yesterday he was not receiving phone calls or responding to text messages by SMS.
As regards the procurement for the zoo, some zodiacists mean that, in zero interest in it, there are not necessarily concerns about similar purpose indications, as in its case, but simply a small outreach. For example, the mouth vet Jiří Král has not heard from her before. “I hear it from you for the first time. No one approached us. Such a thing will, I think, spread quickly,” he added.
Bridge Autodrome Launches New E-Shop
Customers of the Mostec Autodrome can use a new e-shop on its website.
It also purchases coupons for free and test rides by car or motorcycle on a large racing circuit, which was previously possible only in person at the autodrome worker in the starting tower.
“We have moved to improve the e-shop to make it user-friendly, while expanding the portfolio of products and services that can be procured through it.
At the same time, on this occasion we prepared a bonus for our customers in the form of a discount of 1,000 kronor for all safe driving courses from our offer.
The discount coupon can be found on www.autodrom-most.cz,” explained sales and marketing director of AUTODROM MOST Jana Svobodová.
The e-shop website, according to her, is now uncluttered, and the customer is easy to navigate.
“An e-shop visitor chooses the focus on the bar to target.
For example, sports, safe or sports courses, training, experience programs, gift items, gift vouchers, children's activities and more,” the director enumerated.
The novelties in the e-shop products and services offered include the Racing Legends T-shirt with surprise collection, car track, safe driving course in reduced visibility, advertising and gift objects of domestic professional racing team Buggyra Racing or Engelmuller gloves from limited edition watchmaking manufactory BOHEMATIC, created on the occasion of historic victory in the prestigious 24 Hours of Le Mans race in 1949.
“The offer is very varied, the customer can choose from more than 200 items,” Jana Svobodová specified.
When paying for a selected product or service, the customer can choose one of four options.
Payment by advance (bank transfer), delivery, cash on personal withdrawal or online via payment gateway.
Plane crash near Žinkov in Pilsen: Two people did not survive accident
Two people were travelling on the plane, a man (†63) and a woman (†38). “The plane at half past nine in the evening sought permission to land at Chaloupky Airport near Klatov,” police spokeswoman Dana Ladman said. This was also the last record, at which time according to GPS coordinates it was to be located near Vojovice near Žinkov.
But it hasn't reached Klatov Airport. A search began immediately after the lost aircraft that sent a distress signal. “He engaged, in addition to the police, a military helicopter,” police spokeswoman Martina Korand said. But the search action didn't have a happy ending.
In a forest near Petrovic near Minchia, which is about six kilometres from where the plane last caught a glimpse, a helicopter wreckage noticed the wreckage before 9am. “We found a plane and two bodies with no signs of life,” Korand confirmed.
The crashed machine remained partially wedged in tree branches; pieces also hit the ground nearby. “We will be ascertaining the cause of the accident in cooperation with expert experts and staff at the Institute for Expert Detection of Causes of Aviation Accidents,” Korand added.
The course of the disease of the majority is mild, only three per cent of the infected
Either a milder form of coronavirus is spreading through the Czech Republic, or the summer dose of sunshine has greatly improved our immunity.
Infection wards of hospitals are half-empty, though numbers of those infected are rising.
“That situation today and in April is quite different and it's mainly due to the number of hospitalized,” confirms Health Minister Adam Vojtěch.
It is worth remembering that on April 11, when the first wave of the epidemic peaked, all the guise was worn by the army, the republic was closed, and the Czechs consumed disinfection for a year forward.
Yet ten people a day were dying.
Now the daily increases in the number of infected are higher, but every day with covid-19 a maximum of two people die.
Karvinsko still has the highest number of infected per population, Jihlava already has similar numbers due to the outbreak at the local Alzheimer's Centre, where 57 are already infected - 40 clients and 17 employees.
Another home for the elderly was closed by hygienics in Chernožice in Královéhradeck.
The disease was confirmed by tests in one of the nurse practitioners.
“We are routing, we have restricted movement, we have all the hygiene measures,” says the director of the retirement home, Martin Scháněl.
According to him, none of the home's clients have symptoms of illness yet.
Area testing will begin to be carried out by hygienists tomorrow, and then decide on the next measure.
Hospitals also respond to the increased number of infected.
The Institute of Oncology in Brno today launched an automatic camera system at the entrance, which can tell if people have a cloth on their entry.
The record is reported by South Bohemian hygienists, who have recorded twenty-five cases of coronavirus - most of them being foreign employees of the prachatice company.
Overall, 131 infected - half of Friday's number - over the weekend, added for Saturday, but fewer are tested.
They're only child. We don't have reproduction, but we don't have to haunt
Some words have egregious connotations, if only they convey the state of affairs. They include the word only child. It denotes a child growing up without siblings, but doesn't sound neutral. “You know that, an only child,” it is said, with nothing to add. Interestingly, “only child” bears this trait long ago, even from the days when terms such as demographic crisis were not widely used.
Today, even people outside the scientific community already know that a fertility rate of 2.1 child per woman is required to ensure simple reproduction of residents. It is also widely known that no state now achieves this value in Europe. At most, France or Sweden are close to it, but the European States are not assured of a simple reproduction rate of population. (Within the West, only Israel has a total fertility rate of 3.1 child per woman.) It's a situation like done for alarmism. Therefore, it is no wonder when the Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, Maláčová, falls for him: “There are almost as many children as two-child families,” she said in an interview with LN. But she neglected the devil hidden in detail.
Yes, it's a good thing to draw attention to the problem, instead of dredging or ideologizing itself. Like in Germany, where campaigning for more children easily gets the label of fascism (in the style of “that's how Hitler supported it too”). It's good when it's reminded that many couples are planning only children directly. It is good if politicians show the will to remove the obstacles that lead to those decisions (for example, a weak extension of work from home discourages women from further pregnancies). But through all this, let's draw attention to one thing.
If Minister Maláčová says that “there are almost so many only kids,” there is a turkey demagoguery. That statement was 20 years ago. Recall that fertility in the Czech Republic last provided simple reproduction in 1980 (“Husák's children”). Then it dropped down to a menacing 1.14 in 2000. But it has since risen nearly fifty per cent, to the now 1.70 child per woman, a European above average. It is not enough for simple reproduction, so the activity of politicians is a point. Just with the alarmism, they can take a little bit away.
Neckermann cancels all flights, involves five hundred Czech clients
Neckermann flights are cancelling in connection with the insolvency of both Britain's Thomas Cook and his German daughter.
“The Czech company Thomas Cook, s. r. o., acting under the trade name Neckermann Travel Agency, did not file an insolvency proposal,” Šrámek said in a press release.
“However, CK Neckermann is forced to continue to cancel its clients' scheduled departures,” he added, saying that this currently applies to all departures between September 26 and October 6.
According to Šrámek, flight cancellations affect roughly 500 clients. Neckermann's 800 clients who are abroad at the moment “will be looked after and assured of their safe return to the Czech Republic by their planned flight.”
The travel agent admitted that some clients had been asked to pay for their stay. “In this case, it is necessary for clients to contact CK Neckermann's SOS line without delay,” Šrámek added.
The Thomas Cook crash occurred on Monday. In August this year, the tour operator struck a deal whereby creditors were to inject £900m into the firm.
It was to receive half the sum from Chinese firm Fosun Tourism. The latter was to become majority owner on the basis of this. The other half was to be provided by bondholders and creditor banks. However, already on September 20, information surfaced that creditors were asking for the travel agent to raise a £200m reserve or else the deal falls. Then on Monday, the company had already announced that it had gone bankrupt.
Jaromír Soukup spoke about Gott: Wishing him peace of mind
Moderator and entrepreneur Jaromír Soukup (50) does not see any questions. On his show Call and write to the boss, he publicly comments on various topics. And strangers to him are not even tabloid caucuses, which he glosses around and humorously. Although this time he wasn't into laughter.
Jaromír Soukup commented on the sad news of Karl Gotta's very serious illness. He promised the singer for himself one very thoughtful thing.
“You know, Charles got sick and said it fair without any tabloid journalists having to poke it somewhere. I don't want to comment on this, it's a serious illness, we all appreciate Karl Gotta immensely. And I wish him, of course, successful treatment and especially peace of mind! The peace that he needs now,” the owner of TV Barrandov found.
“I wish the media would let him be. And she awaited the news that the Master himself decides to provide to the media. I don't even like the different expressions that all his old acquaintances and various celebrities think about his medical condition. And for our media, I can say that we will attend to his illness and his person only if he shows interest in it himself. To me, other media should consider a similar approach.”
Mahulena Bočanova interrupted the annual detox and sinned again!
Just over a year ago, Mahulena Bočanova confided in Lightning that she had taken alcohol. “On holiday, I said to myself that I would give my old bruised 50-year-old body a breath. I've given myself a deadline forever. I feel terribly rested, I have a lot of energy and especially my psyche has improved. I haven't been well off mentally lately. I get up better, my head doesn't hurt, I have more energy, money.”
A year's abstinence was said to have been enough and the actress once again found her way to alcohol. “Sometimes I'll have bubbles or fine wine, but I don't drink what I used to. I'll have one drink and have fun till morning. I have a bottle of wine in the fridge for a week. I found a soft beer that I can drink at any time,” boasted Mahulena, who still forms a couple with Brno entrepreneur Petro.
Bočanová also returned to the theatre season after the holidays and will be new to the series Ordination in the Rose Garden. “I'm ashamed for the first two shows, I was really bad, I was retelling myself. But it's getting better now,” the actress smiles critically.
The pair wrapped the fen around with tape and drowned in the river, the bag found by the children
The case took place in late July in the village around Wallachské Hat. A 27-year-old woman brought home a donated dog one to two years old that she wanted to look after. But her ten years older partner didn't like the fact that she was a fen, so he decided to get rid of her.
“He wrapped the animal around with duct tape and rope, greatly eliminating his vocal speech. He stored the dog in a jute bag he obliged. Then they took the animal together to the river, where they threw it in a bag. At the moment they threw the dog into the water, the dog was demonstrably living,” Zlín police spokeswoman Monika Kozumplková said.
The following day, children playing by the river found a jute sac on the bank. When they opened it, they discovered the body of a dead dog inside. They therefore called to the woman walking by and ran away. The woman's event announced to the Police 158 emergency call hotline.
“Police officers, through the knowledge of the townspeople, have established who is likely to be the perpetrator of this incredible act. And they weren't wrong. Both the man and woman confessed to the act and described how the event went,” a police spokeswoman added.
Expert observations from the field of veterinary medicine confirmed that the dog died clearly in a harrowing manner as a result of suffocation, where before death the animal suffered on the order of a few minutes.
“The actions of the perpetrators undoubtedly show a clear intention to get rid of the animal at all costs in this reprehensible way, even though they could donate or sell the dog. The Criminal Police Commissioner of Zlín accused the pair of committing an offence of animal cruelty committed in complicity. Both not yet punished charges could spend up to three years behind bars in case of conviction,” noted Kozumplkova.
Declaration of the end of the right in the House or any “right-wing” coalition of ODS, TOP 09, STAN and KDU?
There have been reports of a forthcoming coalition of said parties in the media and comments recently. Many applaud that the “right” is finally getting together, but I'm more asking why these parties still label themselves as right-wing.
When I miss the new Tricolor movement, the Czech Chamber of Deputies no longer has a real right-wing party. And it absolutely doesn't care how the subjects in question self-label or what label the mainstream media parrots. ODS is hardly centre-back in its average of that party's top politicians, TOP 09 is clearly the party of the urban pseudo-liberal left (which is ashamed of its leftism and thus hypocritically denotes as conservative or even right-wing). STAN is a party that, by its concept, ideology and voter targeting, basically blends into TOP 09 (the reason for its existence is simply not clear to me). And the KDU even labels itself as centre-back for the long term - but their political compass is far more to the left than they themselves say.
Do you feel like I took everyone out of one water clean? No, I'm based on the real political steps of these parties. If I consider myself a classically liberal right-wing voter, to me the highest value is individual freedom, the free market, and minimal state interference in the lives of individuals and the economy. How do said parties fulfill this general assumption of rightwingness? How many laws slashing people's freedoms with the Salami method, raising taxes, confirming new regulations and increasing surveillance, increasing the link to or supporting the socialist EU environmental and gender craze have fostered in recent years? A lot, really a lot. Not custom labels, but actions identify them. These parties, through all kinds of declarations or partial concessions, want to strengthen the role of the state in our lives. And that has nothing to do with right-wing.
I would not be surprised at the coalition cooperation of TOP 09, STAN and KDU at all, on the political map they simply belong together and except Christian or vice versa homosexualist and gender aspects in them for voters in the sense of the state's influence on their lives, I basically don't see the obvious difference. Nevertheless, ODS portrays itself as the “only right-wing” for a long time, and by associating with the three entities no longer blankly reveals its true political inclusion.
By the way, when I mentioned the stickers briefly. Have you noticed how often all these parties quite congruently and cheaply refer to critics of dirigism and socialism coming from the European Union as pro-Russian agents? Can't they or just not want to understand that there are many people to whom Eurosocialism and growing non-freedom do not smell as strongly as the authoritarian regime in Russia? Do they not, by any chance, hide their utter argumentative incompetence and gratuitous or blind adoration of eurounion ratios?
In short, it is possible that in the Czech Republic, other than centerpiece politics no longer has a chance of greater success. Maybe that kind of bonding voters really want. Perhaps they want left-center politics under the mantle of the “right” as they are ashamed of their political beliefs (or can't even identify him). I don't know But I'm certainly not among those voters.
Debutant champion!
Van den Bergh finished fairytale, swept Anderson away
The great surprise of the tournament named Dimitri van den Bergh gave an excellent performance even in a duel with the player that the second most prestigious enterprise within the PDC won in 2018.
The opening of the match was two-sided, the break coming at 8:7 status for the Belgian dart.
Van den Bergh took his shot with a 13-dart legem and has had the upper hand ever since.
He was literally crushing his opponent with his game, and the significantly more experienced “Flying Scotsman” was just hard to get to the doubles.
The way “Dreammaker” had it in a handful is evidenced by the fact that the dismembered Anderson played his first maximum in the 24th Leg.
Plus, the young Belgian handled superbly high checkouts.
Last time he lost in the eleventh lego, but he “caught a big fish” and closed 170.
There was huge frustration to see on Anderson at the conclusion of the match.
He was rather just throwing the darts away, and his behind the triumph the striding opponent was perfectly sovereign.
Van den Bergh turned into the very first of three match darts and lived up to his name - he wrote his big dream.
The gain of a trophy named after Phil Taylor makes it all the more valuable to the Belgian darter that this is his first major won.
It continues to be the case that the last player who was able to defeat van den Bergh is Karel Sedlacek.
Babiš at terror victims memorial called for security co-operation
Prime Minister Andrei Babiš and wife Monica visited Ground Zero's September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks memorial in New York on September 27, 2019.
Terrorism is the main enemy that all states of the world should fight against together. At the conclusion of a five-day visit to the United States, Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš declared it today at a New York memorial for the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. On this occasion, the Prime Minister honored the memory of two victims of Czech origin.
“It's a very touching place,” the prime minister said as he laid a white rose at the names of Lukas Rambousek and Czechoslovak émigré Alena Sešínová, accompanied by his wife Monica. Both were among the more than 2750 dead that an attack by hijacked planes on a former pair of World Trade Center (WTC) skyscrapers claimed. The WTC towers collapsed after impact; there is now a memorial in their place with a name list of victims.
“There is a need to be reminded of what happened here, that horror,” Babiš stated. The September 11, 2001 attack on the US was identified by the Prime Minister as a reason why the UN should cooperate in a unified campaign against international terrorism. In addition to destroying the WTC skyscrapers, the terrorists crashed into the Defense Department building in Washington on a hijacked plane and planned to strike another target in Washington, apparently the White House or Congress. But this aircraft crashed when the passengers confronted the hijackers.
“This is our main enemy, that's where all the states of the world should come together and fight international terrorism in a coordinated way,” the Czech prime minister added.

Ondrej Housky's Czechs in Europe: Should Czechoslovakia have rejected the Munich Agreement in 1938 and gone to war with Germany? Three times NO
The undated image depicts Adolf Hitler visiting a Czechoslovak border fortification. The task of the fortresses was never to stop the German army, but to slow its advance before the Allies became involved.
If almost exactly 81 years ago Czechoslovakia had rejected the Munich agreement and subsequently faced a German attack, what would have taken the most Czechoslovak soldiers out of the fight? German tanks, air force, or perhaps artillery? Perhaps it would not be one of these weapons, even though the Germans had an overwhelming upper hand over the Czechoslovaks. The Czechoslovak army would probably suffer the greatest casualties — due to blisters.
Charges fell over cathedral fire in Nantes, man confessed
The Cathedral of St Peter and Paul in the heart of Nantes started burning last Saturday and the fire severely damaged the original 16th-century stained glass windows and destroyed the organ.
Suspected arson investigators were looking into due to the fire advancing through the temple from three different locations.
At the same time, police found no signs at the entrances that anyone had reached the cathedral by force.
The accused is a volunteer with the local diocese, a 33-year-old Rwandan refugee.
Police arrested him already shortly after the fire, but then released him without initiating a criminal prosecution.
Now the prosecutor's office has informed that, based on new evidence, the man was arrested again on Saturday, confessed and faces arson charges.
He faces up to ten years in prison and a high fine if he is found guilty.
According to his attorney, the man regrets the act and has decided to cooperate fully with investigators, Le Monde wrote.
Zeman monument - Man straining constitution calls for law enforcement
Whoever moves in a camp-divided society and doesn't want to go completely stupid, will welcome situations where they don't have to cheer only on their own. When can he admit pluses even to who he otherwise criticizes. No longer so that he does not feel that he is oriented only by pre-allocated stickers. Such situations include a list of badly damaged monuments that President Zeman sworms on his favorite trips to the regions.
Everybody knows what he's going. And who sometimes travels through the Czech Republic, a number of those devastated monuments - from the centers of historic cities to individual castles, monasteries, old houses, churches or estates - see for themselves. Everyone knows that even here can come to the word demagoguery. That if we call City Hall out of care for monuments or some horror in the master plan, it may be the work of former administrations. Or an object privatized whose owner is not traceable. The head of state of local politics urges: “The monument law section allows you to fine object owners who do not care for their property.” But even if the owner is inconceivable, it must be acknowledged that the president is calling for law enforceability. Which even critics of his bending of the Constitution should acknowledge as a plus.
Of course, Milos Zeman would not be Milos Zeman if he considered all the details and formalities of a complex issue. But he positions himself for a good cause much like squaters, which he himself does not recognize. Two years ago, we wrote: “Despite all the swearing squateers highlight a problem standing outside of current interest. To the fact that this or that construction is in disrepair.” And let's admit that the president is doing de facto the same thing.
If you come to the historical center of Jáchymov, you are amazed at how devastated it is - including houses with Renaissance cores. At the time Jáchymov celebrates 500 years of silver mining and tollar minting (for Americans dollars). Why? It said it was because of quick-haired home sales in the 1990s, officials there say. But what is that seven kilometres away Ostrov, the seat of the Šliks who raided Jáchymov's talars, has the historical core nicely repaired? It's good, if the president draws attention to these things.
Vojtěch: On Monday we will introduce a “traffic light” for epidemiological measures
The new system is meant to fulfil the role of a pandemic plan, due to whose absence, the government and the Department of Health have faced criticism.
“Degrees will be according to the strength of community spread,” the minister explained.
He added that at present, for example, the Moravian-Silesian Region or Prague would reach a middle, orange degree.
The system is designed as regional because the situation from county to county varies significantly, he added.
On the system, the ministry cooperated with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (ÚZIS).
According to the Minister, specific measures will be linked to the individual grades, whether it is the obligation to wear the guise or the organisation of special departments in hospitals.
To create an epidemiological plan on Prima Partie TV, Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) called on the basis of which people should have clear information about what measures they can expect, if the epidemiological situation worsens.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has grown in recent days, although the number of hospitalized remains low.
Vojtěch commented on this by saying that nothing major happening is in place to talk about declaring a state of emergency or reconvening a crisis staff.
In view of the growing number of infected since Saturday across the Czech Republic, the government has again introduced a duty to wear guise at indoor events above 100 people.
From Monday the capacity of these events will be limited to 500 people, now totalling 1,000 people.
The government's procedure, when it was unclear until the last moment what measures and when they would start to apply or when they would be announced, has come to criticism.
“I think that in a situation that is quite tense, the main officials should create, on the contrary, a sense of certainty and straighten the confusion out on the contrary,” Senator Marek Hilšer said in Questions.
Measures may already vary by region, for example in Prague since Sunday the obligation to wear guise even in non-residential medical institutions, such as pharmacies or waiting rooms at the doctor.
The obligation to wear the guise when visiting health and social facilities or pharmacies have also been established in the Liberec and Ústí Region since Friday.
In Vysočina Jihlavsk, it is necessary to wear guises in indoor public areas, public transport and medical facilities from 14 July.
Conversely, in the Moravian-Silesian Region, anti-epidemic measures relaxed, as in the Central Bohemian Region of Kutnohorsk.
In early June, the Czech Government also approved a so-called traffic light for Europe, which colourfully distinguishes the level of disease risk in individual European countries and adjusts the rules to enter the Czech Republic from these countries.
For low- and medium-risk countries, authorities do not require a negative test for coronavirus or quarantine instead of Czech citizens from June 15.
These are mandatory when returning Czechs from high-risk countries.
For the moment, all EU member countries are now in the low-risk category of contagion.
Costa Rica is champion in combating climate change
Costa Rica received the title for several reasons. For starters, for a plan to be carbon neutral by 2050 - however, plenty of countries have committed to that under the Paris Agreement. The Central American state, with a population of around five million, produces only 0.4 percent of the world's emissions. Costa Rica has also pledged to fully switch to renewable energy by 2030, with 70 percent of buses or taxis cars expected to run on electricity.
The official tourist organisation says that already roughly 95 per cent of energy comes from renewable sources - in 2017 Costa Rica worked for them for a total of 300 days.
Costa Rica prides itself on nearly 30 national parks.
The density of forestation also contributes to the reduction of emissions. Rainforests with diverse fauna and flora, covering more than half of the country's territory, are also one of the main tourist hauls. “Costa Rica is a pioneer in conservation and sets an example to other states in the region but also around the world. Climate change requires urgent action from all of us,” the UN said in a statement.
Costa Rica can boast almost 30 national parks, which, given the country's not-large expanse (51,100 square kilometers), is really a lot. Rainfall or misty forests, coral reefs or mangrove marshes are home to five percent of the world's biodiversity. The country also has volcanoes, pitoreque waterfalls, and you would also find several salvage stations for sloths.
Thrifty to the planet. The Night of Scientists Begins in Prague
“In Prague, I would definitely visit CTU and look at the model of what smart cities will look like. At Charles University I would visit the Institute of Anatomy at the Faculty of Medicine, which at other times there is no public access,” advises National Coordinator of the Night of Scientists, Jitřenka Navratilova.
The Institute of Anatomy offers a tour of the autopsy room and a chance to try out work with surgical instruments.
“Then I would go over to the CZU and see the film Green Desert,” Navratilova adds. Nine labs will also offer commentated tours. The slogan for this year's Scientist Night reads “planet thrifty.”
Wife Exchange: Parents cruelly mistreated Ondra! Ended in an institute
It was about nerves. Allegedly troubled son Andrew (9) was punished harshly by his father every moment. “He came from school and lied with a snack. Luke looked at me and said he would kneel for punishment,” Lucie described in the Exchange. Dad Luke made little Ondra kneel in a corner for several hours! Besides the camera, he said he had to suffer like that on a wooden mat for foot massage! 'Ondrej came to me after the shoot and said to me - aunt, I'm making those trouble and notes just so I'm not here because I want to go to the institution, 'Lucie described the moment when she fully understood what she was behind the studio door going on. And the boy's wish finally came true...
His condition was serious enough that he was taken from his family after filming and placed in the Centre of Educational Care in České Budějovice for a month. He returned to his father and surrogate mother Aneta (28), but then went to a diagnostic institute for troubled children. “When I got home, Aneta immediately added me on facebook, we texted each other for a while. She was most interested in whether we got the money. I almost didn't respond to that at all. But then she texted me that little man was at the institution, that then he returned it to them, now he's in the diagnose. They are both out of work,” claims mum Lucie from Pilsen.
Lightning, of course, also addressed the other side, but only got a nebulous response. “I'm not in the mood, I'm sick, call later,” Aneta spoke out, hanging up the phone.
Přindiš, Srskavec and Fišerová safely advanced to the semifinals of the World Cup
Kayakers Vít Přindiš and Jiří Prskavec as well as canoeist Tereza Fišerová safely advanced to the semifinals of the Canoe Slalom World Championships in Seu d'Urgell. Přindiš was fourth in Friday's qualifying, Srkavec fifth and Fišerová eighth. The other three Czech representatives will be aiming for a semi-final start in the afternoon's corrective qualifying run.
From the strong representative group of kayakers, Vavřinec Hradilek, who received a fifty-second penalty right at the start of the drive for incorrectly passing the goal. On the contrary, Srskavec can already rest and concentrate on Sunday's semi-final.
“I set my goal to get it down on the first drive to 30, which I managed. Not that I don't care how I turned out, because on Sunday it starts very early in the morning, so I was hoping to be a little higher to have a better starting position,” said Přindiš, praising himself well being in Seu. “Before the patrol race, I felt the worst in the 14 days we've been here. Then in the race it was good and today better again. It's beautifully here the whole time, pretty races, the spectators have come, so fine,” he smiled.
Srkavec was satisfied, too. “In qualification, one mainly does not want to make an unnecessary mistake. It didn't quite miss me in the first wickets. Then I pulled the middle perfectly, with no problems and I knew I had a mileage, so the second mistake came when I wanted to drive down directly and I turned my erka. Overall, I can't be displeased. The form is, we'll see how it goes on,” said this year's overall World Cup winner.
Both representatives lauded each other that they will not go to the start until the conclusion of the semifinal block on Sunday. “I'm not a morning bird, it's cold after the morning, and when you're here for eighth, it wants to have a jacket and a hoodie,” said Přindiš. “Overall, it takes the semi-final an hour and a half, which is a pretty good difference in terms of sleep,” Srkavec agreed.
Of the trio of Czech singcanoeists, only Fišerová succeeded, Eva Říhová finished two places behind the advancing twenty, Kateřina Havlíčková was 35. “I rolled the upper part to my liking, in the middle arcade I thought I wasn't prosecuting and going as planned, but I was able to get into the comfort track I wanted to ride. I made two pokes and I'm just behind the winner by pure time. I have a good starting position for the semi-finals,” Fizerová praised herself.

Thank you for dancing! Singer Leonard Cohen's latest album to be released posthumously
The album Thank You for Dancing (Thanks for the Dance) will feature unreleased material and various musical collaborations put together by the singer's son. The album will be released on November 22.
In October 2016, the album You Want it Darker was released, on which Cohen collaborated with his son Adam. He begged him to help him finish the individual songs. On the intimate recording, Cohen symbolically comes to terms with impending death. He died a month after the album's release at the age of 82.
Seven months after that, Adam Cohen began working on materials left for him after his father. He invited a variety of musicians to collaborate - Damien Rice, Bryce Dessner, Javier Mas or the singer Beck.
“When we were inventing music for our father's words, we used his own distinctive musical practices. That's how he's always with us,” Adam Cohen said to the album. “What amaze me most about him is the reactions of those who have heard him before. One by one, they say Leonard is still alive,” he added.
The first swallow of the album is the short song The Goal (Goal). “I'm almost alive, I'm almost home,” Cohen sings in his characteristic honeyed voice. He sang about death, suspecting that the release of new material would not live to see. He admitted it even in an interview with The New Yorker magazine a month before his death. “I'm ready to die. I hope it won't be too uncomfortable,” he declared.
In September 2018, Adam Cohen released a collection of his father's poetry called The Flame. Czech will be published under the name Plamen on 31 December at Argo Publishing House.
For holidays with just a credit card? NEO account offers withdrawals from ATMs around the world for free!
According to surveys, roughly half of all Czechs who go abroad have become accustomed to paying directly by card. The main reasons include comfort, safety, but also the opportunity to use travel insurance, which is often associated with a credit card.
Travelers in almost every corner of the world can appreciate the convenience of paying with a card. This is especially true in popular tourist destinations, but today credit cards are accepted almost everywhere. “People who travel more often, like for work, don't have time to go to currency exchange machines repeatedly to exchange cash. And even “vacationers” don't want to rely on cash to suffice them. In addition, some foreign currencies do not even have Czech banks or exchange offices. For the NEO account, we have resolved this so that its users can withdraw cash from all ATMs, wherever they are, free of charge,” says Kateřina Petko, Director of Marketing and Communications and press secretary Expobank CZ.
Moreover, the credit card represents a much more reliable way to not lose your money against cash. Losing her full wallet, her owner no longer has to wait for the money he carried in it. But if he loses just his credit card, he can easily block it over the phone or via online banking immediately. Thus, when acting quickly, it may not suffer any financial loss at all. “Keeping money in a bank account has other benefits in addition to its reliable protection. For an NEO account, for example, it is 1.6% per annum interest, which is among the highest among both current and savings accounts. Its establishment and administration takes place completely online without the need for a visit to the branch. In addition, the money in the bank account is insured up to 100 thousand euros and the management of the account is completely free,” Kateřina Petko adds.
For anyone about to head abroad, travel insurance should be commonplace. Thanks to the ability to arrange it and pay by online card, you can do so even at the last minute. However, only owning a credit card often means insurance protection when travelling. “For example, for embossated MasterCard Gold and MasterCard Business cards, travel insurance is an integral part when travelling abroad to all countries in the world. Holders of these cards can also insure their family with whom they travel. They often waste any further arrangements,” adds Kateřina Petko from Expobank CZ. However, it is always appropriate to verify the scope of the insurance in question, i.e. whether it applies to all activities that travellers plan to undertake.
The Vastenk lump sum is planned by the ministry starting in 2021. Tax-wise, nothing changes
The MF is preparing an amendment to the Income Tax Act under which an employee would receive food money directly. According to MF, a quarter of employees, or about a million people who do not yet receive meals, reach food support.
However, according to the chairman of the Association of Voucher Systems Operators David Rýc, a number of small companies that do not have canteen or food voucher provide their employees with meals, for example by importing food or by agreement with restaurants.
“The essence of intent is that we don't change anything on the tax benefit. Further, it will not be paid for by health and social insurance,” Schiller said on Friday. She added that the limit for the maximum employer contribution redeemable as a tax rebate would also remain maintained.
The Income Tax Act allows firms to reimburse a maximum of 55 percent of the price of a vouch. The remaining part is paid by the staff, in some cases also paid by the employer, but without a tax discount. The most advantageous value of the voucher for both employees and employers this year is CZK 123.
Bloomberg: Venezuela has hidden bitcoins and doesn't know what to do with them
Venezuela's central bank is conducting internal tests to see if it can hold cryptocurrencies. This responds to an instruction from the state-owned company Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), which seeks to send bitcoins and ethers to the central bank and to then pay suppliers of this oil firms cryptocurrencies. Employees are also studying a proposal to allow the central bank to count cryptocurrencies in foreign exchange reserves, which are now near lows in 30 years. Citing information from four sources, the Bloomberg agency reported it.
Sanctions imposed by the United States on President Nicolás Maduro's authoritarian regime have largely cut Venezuela off from the global financial system. This has deepened the economic crisis in the country even further. Meanwhile, the current crisis is one of the most serious in global comparisons, forcing officials to use a mix of different ways to move money. While Maduro's bid to launch the world's first state-owned cryptocurrency has failed, ongoing efforts to use digital currencies show how desperate the government is to find ways in which to circumvent restriction.
Neither Venezuela's central bank nor PDVSA responded to a request for comment.
It is unclear how PDVSA came to its own bitcoins and ethers, nor how much value these currencies own. The business is having trouble obtaining payments from customers through conventional channels because big banks are unwilling to do business with entities subject to sanctions. Last month, the firm received most of a $700m (£16.6bn) payment in Chinese yuan because the parties failed to find financial institutions to allow the transaction.
PDVSA may not have the appetite to sell cryptocurrencies on the open market because it would require it to register on an exchange and undergo due diligence, so-called due diligence. Instead, he wants the cryptocurrency to be used by the central bank and paid with it to entities whom PDVSA owes. Officials at the oil firm believe the central bank is less exposed to any hurdles that might arise in payment by cryptocurrencies.
Bitcoins and ethers use a decentralized Internet ledger known as a blockchain to verify and record transactions. In some cases relatively anonymous transfers are allowed without the need for an intermediary. Few banks engage in digital currencies because of problems with money laundering and client information that goes with them and complicates compliance.
Cryptocurrencies are experiencing a return to the high ground this year after the 2018 debacle thanks to expectations of their greater adoption by institutions and Facebook's plan to come up with its own cryptocurrency. Even so, they remain unstable. Bitcoin has fallen nearly 20 percent over the past four days, however, since the start of the year it has a gain of about 130 percent.
Comment by Jan Šindelář: Manage the tracks as a company
Heavenly's election, while apparently not entirely smooth, is a round off to a sad tale of the state's failure to give the runways a clear direction. The board has been incomplete for over a year, and even after Wednesday night, that's not changing because one of the members has resigned. The provisionary lasts.
The selection process itself was a farce from the beginning because the requirements for candidates were significantly mitigated mainly in the field of practice. Compared to the selection last year, demands on the size of the firm in which the candidate had a history of working. First the members of the selection committee and then the supervisory board played only the role of pimprlat.
Celestial submitted apparently the weakest professional résumé of the five finalists, yet without practice from the big firm, he needed experienced bors from the management of logistics giants as well as transport businesses. It was the participation of interesting executives from the private sector that probably was the brightest side (even the best hope) of the whole process. Today, those in question already know that they have played only a role in the political game.
Perhaps Celestial will surprise, show great talent and eventually prove to be the best run boss of all time. At least in the beginning, however, it will be accompanied by an aftertaste of political tradition. Czech Railways does not expect a light period, they have to cope with competition in the liberalisation of the market and with the lack of staff in operation. They miss train drivers, shunters and mechanics alike. What motivation are they supposed to have for further work and respect for management when the state behaves in top management like an elephant in porcelain?
The second important group is lenders. As the runways get laid, we'll see next spring when the runways defend the rating. What is certain is that lenders perceive instability. The sad thing is that someone else comes to Moody's agency for Czech Railways to defend the rating every year. The agency's frequent changes in track management and political influence on the firm have not escaped, criticizing them already this summer.
The YES movement raps, among other things, the slogan that the state needs to be run as a firm. For starters, it would be enough to run one large state-owned firm as a firm and not as a state. The Czech Railways are still among the largest companies in the country and it would be good if the best led them. They reported, but the state scorned them. Surely one can argue that the post at the head of the runways has always been a political issue. Then we can forgive each other for the tendering buffoons.
Unusually open and unique image of Karel Gotta in Olga Špatová's documentary feature film
This unique film performance from Olga Šátová's workshop will premiere in Czech cinemas next spring.
“In mid-September last year, Ivanka and Karel Gott called me, and they approached me whether I would make a documentary about his life with Karl again after ten years. I didn't hesitate for a minute! Filming with a man who has endured more than half a century in the eminent Czech culture thanks to his exceptional singing talent, artistic humility and immeasurable industriousness was and is a great honour for me. The call to make a feature documentary film about Karl Gott, who has been bringing joy to three generations of listeners to his art, I accepted as a commitment to this legendary singer ,” director Olga Špátová describes her feelings.
Thanks to quick arrangements and agreement, the first filming day was already on 22 October last year, and the last footage with Karl Gott was shot a few days ago. The goal was and is abundantly clear - to capture authentically Karl Gotta as a phenomenal singer who gives himself away to his supporters, as a painter but at the same time a loving husband and father of his children. A man who for sixty years gives out joy with his songs to several generations not only in us, but also in Europe, and in fact around the world. A man who enrolled himself in the hearts and souls of his listeners by simply being.
The film is not meant to be a showcase for Karl Gotta's undisputed fame and his achievements. “Therefore, it is not even possible to compare my previous film Phenomenon Gott to this present one. Everybody is different. At least by filming them in a different stage of Karl Gotta's life, and this will be very much reflected in his personal, intimate confession that he gave us and which has put us all in what legend we have the opportunity to work and spend time, which is indeed indescribable,” adds Olga Špátová.
The creators captured Karl Gotta during his performances, during meetings with his fans in Hamburg, but especially in his home environment, whether in Prague, on a cottage in Czech Switzerland, on a villa in the Czech Republic , where he spent his childhood, and in other places that played an important role in his life. Thus, the film will be completely authentic and unique thanks to Karl Gotta's sincere openness.
“Olga has a great gift to film with her close-knit team so that we often got carried away by the spontaneous atmosphere and naturally let her into our privacy, which made me talk about topics fairly confidential. With her husband, cinematographer Jan Painter, they actually became part of our family. We originally wanted to feature the film in 2019, when I celebrated my life's jubilee. But because I had a beautiful summer with my family, I wanted us to shoot as long as possible. Well, and since there was a lot of me everywhere in 2019, my wish was that it be screened into cinemas in the spring of next year. This documentary film is a thank you to my supporters and everyone who supported and accompanied me in my profession,” Karel Gott himself says to the film.

Managers of state-owned firms are to newly go through the tender process. Law will be circumvented, opposition claims
“This is a typical bill that is unnecessary,” said ODS MP club chairman Zbyněk Stanjura.
After several failed attempts, the Chamber of Deputies approved changes designed to prevent opaque distribution of functions in the future - critics talk about trafics - at state-owned firms. Newly candidates should go through a selection process at the ministry and will also be judged by the government's staff nominations committee.
But it is a compromise solution that ODS, for example, does not like because it will supposedly allow ministers to make excuses that selection panels may be responsible for any poor selection of state managers. Moreover, the opinion of the said Committee for the Minister will not be binding. The news has yet to be approved by the Senate and signed by President Milos Zeman.

Library marks anniversary of death of Wenceslaus IV with exhibition of manuscripts
Six rare historical manuscripts from the turn of the 14th and 15th centuries, that is from the time of the Roman and Bohemian king Wenceslaus IV, can be viewed today and Saturday by people in Clementin Prague. The National Library released them from its vaults to commemorate this year's 600th anniversary of Wenceslaus's death. This morning, librarians and restorers placed rare originals in display cases at the Mirror Chapel. Admission to the exhibition is free; it is open for both days from 10:00 to 6:00 p.m.
An exhibition of charters entitled Ad mandatum domini Regis: From the royal office and library of Wenceslaus IV was prepared by the library together with the National Archives. The written heritage from the time of the reign of Wenceslaus IV is viewed by the National Archives from the point of view of official documents and the National Library from the point of view of literary works, its author Jan Vojtíšek said for the exhibition.
“Visitors can enjoy, for example, a work on agriculture by Peter de Crescentiis, which is essentially a kind of encyclopedia of agriculture, or a breviary, that is, a prayer book of one of Benedictine Monastery of St. George at Prague Castle, from the beginning of the 15th century,” enumerated the reasons why people should look at the exhibition, according to him.
The Epistles of Peter of Blois will also be exhibited, where a semi-figure of King Henry II of England is depicted in the introductory miniature H (enrico). The author of the decoration is most likely the Master of Samson's History, who also participated in the decoration of a number of other manuscripts alongside two volumes of the Bible of Wenceslaus IV. Visitors will also see John Wycliffe's Latin anthology of tractates dating from the period about 1411 to 1414.
Not one book has been preserved from the library of Wenceslaus IV in the Czech territory. This library was, according to experts, among the most extensive and also the most beautiful book collections in Central Europe at the time, because the young king was eager to build a representative library that would equate to the book collections of his French relatives. However, the library became defunct soon after Wenceslaus's death. Apparently, it was stolen or destroyed in the conquest of the castle by the Hussites. Several codes have been saved, though. The Austrian National Library owns the most today.
“We have a range of treasures in our collections and I am pleased that they are in a state that allows them to be displayed and made available to the public so called live and not just in the form of a digital library Manuscriptorium,” stated National Library Director Martin Kocanda.
On the day of Saturday's public holiday, an exhibition called What Hides Under the Floor will be open free of charge in Clementin, representing the archaeological discoveries of the area.
Technoparty in Benešovsk continues.
Playing at one-third capacity, finish was due at noon
Hlaváčkova Lhota (Benešovsko) Technoparty near Hlaváčkovy Lhota in Benešovsk continues on Sunday evening.
A third of the original 12 music systems still play.
According to evening estimates by police, about 500 people remain here after 8 p.m., the original rough estimates spoke of three hundred, in the morning they were at 900, said police spokeswoman Lucie Novákova.
Originally, the technoparty was supposed to end at noon on Sunday, at which time a part of the music systems had gone silent.
“Some have already left and others are about to depart.
Music production partly still lasts.
We expect that there will be gradually disconnection and dismantling of music systems,” Novákova said.
'Police officers still consistently check departing visitors in order to prevent drivers from driving while intoxicated or substance.
Drivers have the opportunity to submit to a preventive breath test before leaving,” she added.
Dozens of police officers oversee the event, foreign police, traffic and order police are on the scene, and handlers with service dogs are also on standby.
'During today police officers have checked 470 people moving at the venue and 485 vehicles, 270 drivers have been subjected to a breath test, six of which got behind the wheel under the influence alcohol,” Nováková said.
A total of 95 drivers were tested by police officers for the presence of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, of which one was positive.
Police officers dealt with 14 traffic offences as well.
At the request of technoparty participants, police officers conducted 300 preventive breath tests and four preventive tests for the presence of narcotic drugs and psychotropic agents.
About 2,000 people were at the event on Saturday morning.
If the number of participants did not decrease, the police would intervene there.
On the Prima Partie TV show, Interior Minister Jan Hamacek (ČSSD) said it.
But the number of participants fell below 1000, the police so assessed that there was no need for intervention, and neither was requested by the sanitation station or the health ministry.
Czech Television (ČT) said on Sunday that technoparty had spread to surrounding land, whose owners did not agree to use for technoparties.
It is possible that the owners of surrounding land will claim damages.
Techno supporters at the meadow near Hlaváčkovy Lhota arrived on Friday night.
Police initially guarded a meadow in Blažimi, Benešovsk, on Friday, where the technoparty took place last year.
Blažim is located roughly 30 kilometers from Hlaváčko Lhota, where the technars eventually went down.
According to Nováková, no one came to Blažimi.
Viper bites: Little girl ended up in hospital!
“The first case of this year was recorded in Železnorudsk.
The adder had smitten a girl in the leg, 2010, who had been imported by her parents to the emergency services base there,” Mária Svobodová, a regional spokeswoman for the medical emergency service, told the newspaper. that the child was then transferred to a hospital in Klatovy.
Viper is the only venomous snake in the Czech Republic, and it is on Šumava that these animals occur in higher numbers, so it is good to watch out for walks.
But there is no great danger from these animals.
The chance of a viper being smitched is not very high, with normal contact it itself is afraid.
And if she has room to do that, she likes to crawl away for a loud hiss.
She will only attack if she feels threatened a lot - such as if you accidentally step on her.
Nor is her bites a tragedy, although its venom is very effective against small mammals, but it will not kill humans.
This can only happen if a person has a particularly weakened organism, or suffers from an allergy.
Thus, the risk of danger is primarily among children, seniors and allergy sufferers.
“A person often feels vomiting after biting, sweats, has an elevated temperature, thirst, abdominal pain and diarrhea, weakened individuals and especially allergists may experience anaphylactic shock,” described for Diary by Miriam Gredová from Klatov Hospital.

Sapa Market: Raid revealed meat, fish and eggs of unknown origin
“One of the vehicles entering the premises was carrying 1320 pieces of quail eggs of unknown origin, in addition, in unsuitable conditions.
Also, these eggs will be disposed of at the resanation enterprise,” the State Veterinary Administration said.
When inspecting the live fish stall, it was then found that the vendor did not have evidence of the origin of the goods and was not registered for the sale of live fish.
The market is considered a problem from a veterinary perspective for the long term.
Last fall, for example, vets uncovered an illegal food store in it, it had nearly half a ton of unmarked food undocumented origin.
For most, the date of consumption could not be found, part of the products had an expired shelf life and was spoiled.
For five kilograms of sepia, the shelf life date was exceeded by three years.
Last May, vets with police officers on the grounds of the market hall detained 80 kilograms of food without documents of origin, among other dried fish, squid or frozen duck, with part of it moldy.

Police have charged CzechTourism manager Aleš Pangrác over promotion contracts
Police charged former manager of the state agency CzechTourism, Aleš Pangrác, over contracts for promotion. The pangrac of the ListNews server confirmed that he took over the charges this week. Czech Television (ČT) said last year that police officers in the case were looking into contracts worth 38 million kroner. Some of the money was going back to Pangrác, according to police, the server reports. In the caucuses, criminalists were also interested in the Minister for Regional Development Klara Dostálová (for ANO), whose resort CzechTourism falls. The investigation into caucuses, according to the server, continues.
Detectives from the National Anti-Organised Crime Headquarters were providing evidence in this caucuses in the second half of last November. For example, they were at the headquarters of the Ministry of Regional Development, at the headquarters of CzechTourism, at the Autodrome in Most or at the agency Sport Invest. The service computer was also taken from the minister's apartment. In the court order for a house search at Dostál, which she had previously cited ČT, it said that the Minister decided in 2016, when she was deputy, on the expenses of CzechTourism in favour of of the chosen persons vicariously and outside the standard official procedure. At the time, Dostal said she felt absolutely innocent, did not doubt, she can document everything and fully cooperates with the police.
According to the agency, it was individual misconduct. Media has previously reported that it is the former director of the CzechTourism Regional Partnership Department, Aleš Pangrác, who was recalled because of the audit results. It showed that CzechTourism had concluded 48 problematic contracts.
“Yes, they charged me. But I don't want to comment more on it,” Pangrác of the North told List News.

Destroyed shops, fires in the streets, a commemoration procession accompanied riots
Five years ago, 43 students at Ayotzinapa college disappeared, despite extensive investigations so far failing to clarify the case. Allegedly, the students were to be detained by police in the Mexican state of Guerrero. It's not exactly clear what went on after that, according to the investigation, but the students apparently ended up in the hands of a local syndicate and were subsequently killed and burned, the APTN agency reported.
A memorial procession was held in Mexico's capital on Thursday, families wanted to express frustration at still failing to find answers and explain their children's disappearance.
But the largely peaceful march was disrupted by smaller groups of vandals destroying everything in their path. Vandals were destroying shops and hotels, brandishing or destroying monuments, setting fires around the city and discharging windows.
Even before the march, President Andres Manuel López Obrador had indicated that he would do everything to capture and asked the public for any information that would lead to clarification of the case.
Over 142 people have been detained as part of the investigation, but neither has managed to convict. Many had to be released because their human rights were violated, investigators alleged to have tortured suspects, APTN adds.
Putin on phone with Zelensky before ceasefire begins in Donbass, Kremlin criticizes planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke by telephone with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky about the situation in the Donbass region, where a new ceasefire is due to begin to apply from midnight.
Putin, according to a statement from the Kremlin, criticized, among other things, the Ukrainian parliament's decision to hold local elections; Kiev informed that Zelenskyi had called for the release of detained Ukrainians.
The new arms lull was agreed on Wednesday night by negotiators of Ukraine and Russia, backed by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
The ceasefire is due to begin after midnight on Monday night, is meant to be “complete and general” and is intended to open the way for meeting other provisions of the peace accords.
Putin said in an interview to Zelensky that the Ukrainian parliament's decision to hold local elections contradicted the Minsk peace agreement and threatens the prospect of settling the conflict in Ukraine's east.
Ukraine's parliament decided last week that forthcoming elections for local councils would not take place in territory controlled by pro-Russian rebels.
The Minsk agreement envisages Kiev bringing back under control the border of Ukrainian separatist-occupied lands with Russia after giving these regions broad autonomy and arranging local election.
Zelensky's office said, according to the Unian agency, that the two statesmen agreed on the benefit of the forthcoming ceasefire in the Donbass region as well as the need to implement further measures to promote peace in the region such as de-mining areas of combat or withdrawing part of units from the front.
Zelenskyi also called on Putin for the release of Ukrainians detained in Ukraine's east, in the occupied peninsula of Crimea, as well as in Russia itself.
The Minsk agreement helped stop the fighting, but people are further dying on both sides of the front in occasional firefights and artillery attacks.
The conflict in Donbass has claimed over 14,000 dead since spring 2014.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of militarily supporting the separatists, which Moscow denies.
Zelenskyj has made ending the war in Donbass his priority, a more fundamental breakthrough in negotiations but has not yet occurred.
And where are the viewers? Doha Can't Be London
At the same time, however, it is a step backwards, as the pilgrimage to Doha has voluntarily and consciously renounced the riveting atmosphere prevailing in the sold-out stadium in London 2017 as well as last year's European Championships in Berlin.
Giant banners on the walls of skyscrapers in Doha invite for “the biggest sporting event of 2019". However, concerns about how dignified her backdrops will be are growing.
“Target tickets are sold out for all evenings,” the organisers claim.
But that's too little.
The upper echelon of Khalifa Stadium with a total capacity of 40 thousand spectators is already overlaid with brightly colored sails on which the flags of 209 participating countries are displayed. Athletics have gone into territory in Qatar where, despite the annual Diamond League meeting, it has no recessed roots.
So let's not be surprised that last week only 50 thousand tickets were sold for ten days of the Championship, although their price started at 60 Qatari rials, which is to be less than 400 crowns.
Organisers have now set a goal for the uncovered parts of the bleachers to be filled at least half. That is why, according to sources from the British newspaper, Giuardian allegedly (though the organisers themselves deny this) give away free tickets to migrants who work here as labourers, as well as children. Which Sebastian Coe, head of the IAAF athletics association, can also do positively: “That is how we can inspire generations to come.”
Rich Qatar has in the past won world championships in handball and cycling, after athletics will come football in 2022. The oil power's financial offerings will always be lucrative for rich sports federations, too. Such is the reality of today's sporting world.
But even if we approach it and miss the absence of fans in the stadium, we do not resist the purely sporting sigh that experiment with the first outdoor athlete world championships in the Arabian The peninsula should have timed IAAF leaders better - and for a different year. Extremely late term, enforced by climate, hacks up the whole scheme of the season in the pre-Olympic year and thus preparation for the crucial Olympic season, which would normally be athletes already in October was beginning.
Perhaps Qatar will make up for this at least with technological novelties, with the help of which it promises ultra-modern and attractive mastery. That it's 37 degrees right now? Already, the stadium area is artificially air-conditioned to twenty-four. And the advanced cameras, built right in the blocks, are supposed to zoom in on even TV viewers in detail what takes place in athletes in hundredths of a second before and just after the starter's shot.

An unexpected champion in the decathlon is Rykl, sevens champion was dominated by Novotná
Defending champion of the last two titles Doležal did not run a four-hundred at the conclusion of Saturday's program, Kopecký did not jump foundation in pole on Sunday.
The decathlon was long ruled by Latvian representative Reinis Kregers, who prepares in the group of coach Josef Karas, but resigned after the disc.
Rykl has had two bronze medals from the outdoor MCR so far, this time being the only decathlete to make it over the seven-thousandth boundary.
Other medals behind him were won by Vilém Stráský and Petr Urbánek.
Rykl recalled the absence of both Adam Sebastian Helcelet and Jiří Sýkora after the competition.
“Too bad the boys weren't here and Kope didn't set up because that would make those results look completely different.
But the title tastes very good, I especially appreciate the fact that I put a person 30 centimeters in the distance.
Then I was still pleased by the pole and I was most disappointed about the disc, there I was below average,” he acknowledged on union facebook.
On the first day of the sevens, Kateřina Cachová won with more than a hundred-point superiority despite being tormented by an injured ankle on the rebound leg.
However, she entered only 570 cm in the distance sector, did not throw 40 metres in the javelin and did not enter the final eight.
Novotná collected 5878 points and won by 241 points ahead of Kateřina Dvořáková.
Her distance came out, 631 cm is the best Czech performance of the year.
“I really wished it was around those 630.
Yesterday my calf started pulling, but I'm very glad I didn't feel it at all and that it didn't limit me at all,” Novotná said on union facebook.
Organic LPG arrived in Czech Republic, promises eco-operation
Liquefied petroleum gas, abbreviated LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas), is a very well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
In particular, it is popular for its fundamentally lower price versus gasoline or diesel, given by a significantly lower excise tax, but its benefit is also in lower CO2 emissions per kilometre travelled.
Like gasoline and diesel, it has its environmentally friendly option - “bio LPG.”
But it is quite a novelty - it first appeared on the European market before last year and arrived in the Czech Republic according to a press release from the Czech LPG Association a few days ago.
“In these days, we received the first fifteen tons of bio LPG, which, mixed with classical fossil LPG, will be distributed to our gas stations,” the association of Jiří Karlík quotes from the company Primagas.
However, bio LPG cannot be taken as bioethanol or biodiesel.
According to the association, the chemical side is identical to the classic oil LPG, which a number of motorists are refueling into their cars now.
Therefore, it is also possible to mix both versions arbitrarily.
“The only difference over the classic LPG is the method of production,” Ivan Indráček, chairman of the association, says of the bio LPG.
This means one of the great advantages of organic LPG over other alternative fuels.
It is easy to transport and store, and also the distribution infrastructure is quite good, e.g. compared to hydrogen or electricity.
Currently, this gas is obtained as a byproduct in the production of bioethanol from food residues and sugarcane.
In the future, it should also be purposefully produced, e.g. from cellulosic biomass, i.e. wood waste.
In contrast, classic petroleum LPG arises partly as a byproduct in oil refining, partly by separation in natural gas extraction.
As a result, depending on the technology of production and source, the operation of the car on bio LPG is 40 -70% more environmentally friendly in terms of carbon footprint than the operation on petroleum LPG and up to 90% compared to diesel.
But it is not about CO2 emissions from car exhaust, but about the ecology of fuel production, hence the so-called “well-to-tank” part (Czech “from source to tank”).
Some of the largest organic LPG producers currently include petrochemicals firms Eni, Total and Neste.
According to a recent update of the National Clean Mobility Action Plan (NAP ČM), Unipetrol is exploring the possibility of production in its Litvinov refinery.
According to estimates of the association in the Czech Republic, about 170 thousand vehicles run on LPG; the Ministry of Environment reports a slightly higher figure in NAP ČM, roughly 200 thousand.
According to statistics from the Department of Transportation, nearly 6 thousand LPG-powered car rebuilds were carried out last year alone.
It is possible to refuel LPG in the Czech Republic at about 950 stations of different operators.
Vojtěch revised the numbers of infected, the number fell by 1775 cases
Health Minister Adam Vojtěch (for ANO) ordered the Ministry to revise the numbers infected with the coronavirus virus.
The new statistics were published on Sunday by the Health Ministry on its site.
The number on Sunday afternoon fell from Saturday's 5254 to 3479 cases, about 1775 fewer infected.
Thus, there are currently 3422 sick people in the Czech Republic.
“Behind the jump increase in the number of cured is a data review, which recently hygienists have not prosecuted to update,” said Jaroslav Dušek, the head of health statistics.
By Sunday afternoon, 15,212 people had become infected with coronavirus in the Czech Republic, 11,419 had healed and 371 had sadly succumbed to Covid-19 diseases.
Slovaks succeeded, for racist insults only pay a fine
The Slovak Football Union succeeded with an appeal against the closure of the stadium for fan racism. Representation was originally intended to play a European Championship qualifier match with Wales without spectators, instead now the union only pays a fine of 15 thousand euros (about 387 thousand kronor).
UEFA's disciplinary committee punished Slovakia and Hungary for fan behaviour at a recent mutual qualification match in Budapest, which the visiting fiduciaries of Czech coach Pavel Hapal they won 2:1. The two unions closed the stadium for one match and fined Slovakia €20 thousand, Hungary €67 thousand.
Slovaks, upon appeal, were only fined 15 thousand euros for insulting political rants. The closest national team match in qualifying to progress to the European Championship with Wales on 10 October in Trnava will thus be made available to fans.

Overview of bank accounts for children on the Czech market
The bank's child accounts provide for free. However, the offer should be considered because some other accounts services are already charged. 'The motivation for banks to offer accounts for children whose basic guidance tends to be free is straightforward. Financial houses are counting on their forgiven fees being returned someday. In a small migration of Czechs between banks, they are probably not wrong,” says Kristýna Kuncová of DTEST.
“Small bills”, according to her, can do almost everything that adult accounts. The child gets his own credit card, can enter payments, track movements on the account, somewhere he has his own electronic banking available. Banks will set up an account, but it is up to parents to teach children how to handle them and also control their payment.
“Quite flexibly, the parent can set weekly or monthly limits, turn individual services on and off, and the like. But above all, it can monitor what is happening on the account, whether by viewing the Internet or by information SMS. Attention, these may no longer be free,” adds Kuncová, adding: “If a parent is thinking about a bill for their child, they should consider his abilities and options.”

An imitation of a normalization room with a TV running footage of the brutal crackdown on students from November 17, 1989, in Prague. That, too, is in the museum's new exhibition in Semily, which is dedicated to the Velvet Revolution. “The basis is to imagine what was happening in Semiles after the events at the National Class,” stated the exhibition's curator Tomáš Chátal.
“I would say that the atmosphere was fundamentally the same everywhere with the fact that there was the first demonstration in Semiles on 22 November, and then more people were gradually getting packed every day,” he stated. Among the most active were from the beginning a group of local dissidents around Miroslav Matěcha, who signed Charter 77 as the only one of the city and the nearest surroundings, and the couple of Grandfaeček, who were expanding the petition A few sentences. Quite quickly, according to Chvátal, the Civic Forum also formed. “One specifics is that there was a very strong group of local doctors in the Civic Forum,” the curator said.
Around 50 photographs should draw visitors into the town at the time, pictures 30 years ago were taken by Karel Bárta. A video of the general strike on 27 November 1989 made by František Tomíček was preserved, which will be in a loop throughout the exhibition. At the demonstration at the time, Ivan the Voice spoke and sang as well. The Semilsky archive also lent a number of surviving banners at the time. “On them was: Let's not get drunk with a roll, From trough to trough, We do not want violence,” Chraval stated. Some changes in the city were very rapid at the time, for example, already in December, people in an all-Semilic vote ruled that the square would be Riegrovo and abolished the previous name Gottwald.
The exhibition also chronicles the happenings ahead of the November events. “In the first part, we present both witnesses and students, what was before, such a late normalization. I think we managed to collect unique documents from Semil, whether it be banners with various communist slogans or a bronze plaque from the then museum of the labor movement,” said Chvátal . One room has just got a sense of what it might have looked like in the living room of an ordinary household at the time.
The last part of the exhibition, in turn, is devoted to what was after the Velvet Revolution. The focus is on the first free elections. “We papered one room with election posters. Whoever experienced this will remember the posters With us to Europe or there is Václav Klaus still under the heading of OF with the beautiful motto Everyone for his village,” added the curator.
A pike in a pond, or a relatively blissful open-air museum?
Babiš chose statistics such as good security (CR is seventh in the world), low unemployment rate, low national debt for his optimistic view. Or the indication that our country is the twenty-first in quality of life out of 140 countries assessed, according to one recent study.
However, developer Dušan Kunovský and architect Josef Pleskot also presented other, not so “pink” data in a television interview on the occasion of the Architecture and Development Summit. For example, the Czech Republic is ranked 154th in the world in the speed of construction management. It may so be that the current economic “boom” will leave no significant builder legacy in its wake as it has in the past.
The biggest obstacle is not only existing legislation, but a slow, underperforming bureaucracy. This is also documented by comparative studies in which the Czech Republic is significantly in the overall quality and performance of public administration behind developed countries.
Our country has simply not yet been able to use the potential of good economic situation of recent years to invest in the future. It is nice to see salaries and pensions increase, but people with improved standards of living will also want to have a place to live, travel in modern and fast fashion, have quality cultural stalls, live without unyielding ecological burden.
But for years, the capital city of Prague has failed to complete the inner and outer ring or build a speedway or subway to the airport. And Prague doesn't even have a modern, architecturally bold national library, concert hall, or national gallery. The reason for this is not only absurd works about architectural competitions, zoning plans and building permits, but also a kind of specifically Czech conservativism, which adheres to the slogan “every bolder change is for the worse”.
And when it seems that something bolder might be done, it will almost certainly frustrate memorials or other rather lambasted associations or politicians. In the absurd drama surrounding Jan Kaplicky's “blobu” designed for the new National Library building, even President Vaclav Klaus wanted to tie himself to the dredgers.
However, the enumeration does not end with Prague. The Czech Republic is unable to reach its backbone motorway network or start building train speedways, so Germany finally decided to run its tracks for superfast trains from Berlin to Vienna” by detour” through Bavaria. In addition, in the schlendrian, repairs of existing infrastructure are also drowned. Getting quickly from Prague to Brno is now a rebus.
Babiš came into politics with a promise to “make things happen.” When it comes to meaningful investment and accelerating cumbersome bureaucratic procedures, but not much has happened yet. As of 2018, an amendment to the Acceleration of Transport Infrastructure Construction Act applies, but we will have to wait for more extensive favourable impacts, for example, easier expropriation of land. And a new building law, passed by the government, which it said should reduce the current average length of building management from 5.4 years to one year, will, if we are lucky, start to apply from 2021. Many people probably wouldn't bet on it though.

Mobile polling units or correspondence choice.
Political scientist and sociologist sought variants for pandemic era
In order to allow even people quarantined for coronavirus to vote in October's regional and senate elections, according to Vice Premier and Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (CSSD), a change in the law is needed.
Parliament could discuss it in August or September in an accelerated regime.
He stated this on Sunday on Partii television Prima.
On Tuesday, he wants to discuss possible solutions in the ministry with representatives of parliamentary parties.
“Whatever we do, this will have to mean a change in the electoral law,” Hamacek said.
The Senate on Wednesday urged the government to find a solution within applicable statutory rules.
But the minister said there would be a need to adjust the provisions of the law, under which people quarantined because of a medical condition cannot vote.
The ban on voting should remain maintained, for example, for patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop said on the OVM programme that the possibility of a correspondence choice has been postponed since 2004.
Even the current bill, which is in the House, then envisages its introduction for voting abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
At the same time, Prokop considers the concerns of the correspondence or of the Czech Republic (because it would rather record other types of parties, according to experience abroad) to be overstated.
Personally, he is then opposed to the possibility of electronic voting, where there is considerable possibility of abuse.
Michal Klíma said that now there is an ad hoc need to devise mechanisms (elections) that could be carried out already this year and with as little health risk as possible.
He then considers the main one to be ready for 2021, when parliamentary elections are due to be held in the Czech Republic.
He considers correspondence choice (whether abroad or also in the Czech Republic) as one of the functional methods.
They see the already mentioned electoral units or, for example, the possibility of proxy voting within the family.
He added that there was a chance to learn how similar situations - elections at the time of coronavirus - they handled in Croatia, Poland or France.
Due to the spread of coronavirus disease, various types of elections in 67 countries have already been postponed this year.
The Prague Stock Exchange grew slightly, with Czech banks, O2 or Avast thriving
The Prague Stock Exchange closed the trading week with moderate growth. The PX index rose 0.13 percent to 1038.45 points. He was dragged upstairs by Czech banks, telecoms company O2 or technology firm Avast. Conversely, Austrian titles and media company CME did not fare well. It follows the results of trading on the exchange's website.
For most of Friday's session, the Prague Stock Exchange traded in moderately positive territory and eventually topped off with a small profit. “However, for the whole week, the (PX index) lost marginally over one per cent,” Josef Dudek of Fio Bank pointed out.
Domestic banks have partially corrected declines from days gone by. Commercial Bank improved 0.82 per cent to 803 kronor and Moneta Money Bank up 0.41 per cent to £72.80. Avast shares appreciated 0.89 per cent to 113 kronor and operator O2 tacked up 0.46 per cent to £216.50.
Kofola's securities grew the most, up 1.38 percent to 294 kronor. Less than a percentage was acquired by the tobacco company Philip Morris, whose shares saluted to 13,640 kronor.
Securities from energy firm CEZ stagnated at Thursday's value of 520 kronor.
The loss-making were three titles - Erste Bank wrote down 0.87 percent to 779.20 kronor, CME 0.73 percent to 109 kronor and insurer VIG 0.40 percent to 618 kronor.
The krona weakened slightly against both of the world's major currencies. On the euro, it lost four pennies to CZK25.85 per euro, three pennies to CZK23.62 per USD on the dollar. It follows from the data on the Patria Online server.
Buharsk protests: Pig ears thrown at government building by protesters
Participants in a demonstration against Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov and his cabinet threw pig ears on the government building.
It was another in a series of protests against “mafia-style governance” that have been taking place in Sofia and other cities for nearly three weeks.
Organizers are planning a nationwide blockade for Wednesday, the DPA agency said.
Today's protest, which took place for the 18th consecutive day, had a weaker turnout than the previous one, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Freedom station.
As of 8 p.m., roughly 300 people had gathered; some streets had to be closed to traffic.
Protesters outside the government building played down a theatrical scene in which they symbolically locked into both Prime Minister Borisov's prison cell and Prosecutor General Ivan Geshev in connection with the arrest of two advisers to President Rumen Radev, who is a strong political opponent of the Prime Minister.
The resignations of both are among the protesters' basic demands.
They also demanded the repeal of announced health reform and the end of corruption in construction on the Black Sea coast.
Protest organizer Nikolai Hajigenov said on public radio today that a “peak of escalation” in the form of a “nationwide manifestation in Sofia and blockades across the country” was going for Wednesday.
He reiterated the demand for the resignation of Borisov and his government, as well as the write-out of early elections.
The proper ones should take place in March 2021.
Borisov has previously disclosed that he does not intend to step down.
He justified this, among other things, by the necessity of implementing Bulgaria with the covidu-19 pandemic and the resulting economic crisis.
But he swapped five members of his government team on Friday, though the concession did not appease the protesters.
Earlier this week, Borisov's government stopped a confidence vote in parliament in parliament.
Top prosecutor resumes prosecution of mother who manipulated daughter against father
Top prosecutor Pavel Zeman disagrees with the acquittals of a mother who had long manipulated her daughter and eroded her relationship with her father. She faced an indictment of mistreatment and endangering upbringing. The regional court acquitted her of the indictment, Zeman disagrees with that. In a similar act, an offence can be seen, according to his invocation to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court ruling could have a broader impact on other caucuses. “A more specific definition of such a specific form of mistreatment can also be considered needed in terms of regulating other application practice,” it stands in Zeman's invocation.
The district court in Svitava last year first acknowledged the woman guilty of mistreating a vested person as well as endangering the upbringing of a child. She was forming a firm, to symbiotic bond with her daughter, even in a situation where she was to be entrusted to her father.
The result was a pathological fixation on the mother and a significantly negative relationship to the father. The situation marked the emotional development of a daughter who was even hospitalized. She threatened self-harm in case of being handed over to the care of her father.
The Svitava court imposed two years in prison on the mother with a two-year parole reprieve. But the Pardubice branch of the regional court acquitted the woman in the appeal process, it said it was not a criminal offence. The same verdict was repeated by the county court even after the Supreme Court had already ordered it to rule again once.
The Regional Court found that situations in which one parent manipulates the child towards the other are not exceptional. It is dealt with in custody proceedings, possibly with the help of psychologists or youth social protection bodies. Only exceptionally, the solution is criminal law.
According to the top prosecutor, however, the woman committed both mistreatment and endangering upbringing. “The accused felt completely purposefully when she aroused negative feelings towards her father in her daughter, and purposefully compounded these negative emotions. In such actions, she not only pursued the illicit intention to restrict or exclude the father's contact with a minor, but must necessarily have been aware that it would cause negative in the psychosocial sphere of the minor consequences,” he stands in invocation.
Zeman asked the Supreme Court to return the case once more to the regional court. The invocation implies that the child is now in the care of the father.
Whatever the fans are positive, Hasek wishes. Sparta awaits the Šlágr in Pilsen
'We're going to play at the limit of possibility, we're going to do everything we can to succeed. To manage the match both gamely and scoreboard,” Spartan Martin Hašek promised in an interview on club television.
In the week the goal decided the cup duel in Jihlava (2:1). Sparta advanced to the next round, which was a duty for her. She's relieved, but she continues to fret gamely.
Even as the season slowly spills over into the second period, Sparta football is still looking for the face that will cut back on their engagement coach Václav Jílek.
“But it's still Sparta that has very quality players. A tricky match awaits us,” warns Pilsner Roman Stroll.
The last time the Spartans arrived in Štrunc's orchards, in mid-May it was a definite affair in the superstructure. The guests departed after a soulless performance with a 0:4 spanking, the largest in the history of the separate Czech league.
While the difference between clubs in the table was eight-point before the match, Sparta now loses nine points after ten games of the new season. He is experiencing one of the worst season entries ever.
“It's not a simple situation either for us or for fans who would love to see their beloved club completely elsewhere than it currently is,” Hasek feels. 'But we would love to see them continue to support us, stay positive and stand behind us. '
Sparta do not know if he will be able to use Tetteh in Pilsen, who although given a two-match penalty for being ruled out in Pilsen, but appealed against him on Friday.
Costa, Dokkal, Drchal, Panák, Pulkrab, Zahustel, Krejčí and Kadlec remain on the numerous marodka, who remembers the last Spartan victory in Pilsen from 2011.
Domestic, who including Wednesday's Cup in Hlučín have won their last five matches, should meet only midfielder Čermák. And as captain, defender Jakub Brabec, the Spartan outfielder, should lead them into the match.
Milan Jakuby: The army stole the funeral for themselves! Says Andor Shandor
There is still obscurity surrounding the funeral of Brigadier General Milan Jakubs. Media speculated in the week that the army had a final farewell to the deputy director of Military Intelligence planned despite the family's wishes as bombastic as only soldiers can. There were discrepancies regarding the date of burial as well. Ministry of Defence spokesman Jan Pejšek denied this.
“It's rubbish! We have been in contact with the family from the beginning, the arranged Friday funeral date applies from the beginning, no one has changed it. Just like military honors pay. We will also address possible media participation with respect to the family,” Pejšek told Lightning on Wednesday. The funeral will eventually take place really on Friday and there will be no missing all military honours including the flyover of fighter jets.
But there is still a tense atmosphere around the final farewell to the favorite general. The mourning ceremony will not be attended by people who have worked with the general in the past!
For example, it is about former head of military intelligence Andor Shandor (62), who met Milan Jakub 17 years ago. Shandor remembers the former colleague as hardworking, intelligent and “a good guy.”
Moreover, he has regularly met him in recent years at celebrations of the anniversary of the founding of Military Intelligence. That's why he would like to say goodbye to Milan Jakub. “I personally would go to the funeral of Milan Jakubs,” Šándor said. But he can't.
“I know of other people in the organization who would like to go, but they're unlucky because potentates usurp the funeral for themselves. I think that to privatise the funeral in this way is not right,” the security expert said. Nor does he play the supposedly considered closing the ceremony to the public because of the secrecy of army top brass.
“The leadership of the army is not classified, and the leaders of military intelligence are not, because they need to be promoted at Prague Castle, we see them there. If the media information is true and the family has indeed allowed themselves to be put in place by the military, that's obviously a family thing. I personally would never allow the army to roll over the family and its wishes,” Shandor concluded.
Milan Jakuby died on Saturday near Spindlerova Mlýn in a car accident. Milan Rapid's head-on clash with Ford Mustang was allegedly caused by sports driver Vojtěch Ch. (31).
The amateur cornered racer should have driven into the opposite direction, Milan Jakuby apparently had no chance of preventing the clash. His wife (47) suffered serious injuries in the crash and it is possible he will bear the consequences for the rest of his life. Police heard the culprit in the crash on Thursday.
Bologna coach Mihajlovich no longer wants matches without spectators
Bologna footballers coach Siniša Mihajlovich already has enough Italian league games without spectators.
The Serbian coach hopes that from the new season, fans will return to the stadiums.
“What we're running here at the moment is not football.
I'm already full match-teeth with no spectators.
It's genderless football, it brings me no emotion, no joy.
Those fights are worse than training.
Playing like that is terrible and I think I'm not the only one who thinks that,” Mihajlovic stated ahead of tonight's match against Lecce.
The coronavirus pause is followed by Série A matches in quick succession, and although they are not played until the evening, their actors are exposed to heat.
“We play every three days in terrible heat.
In conditions like that, he doesn't even know how teams are.
So this season is over.
These measures had to be approached in order to finish the competition, but I hope that from September the fans will be back,” said the coach, who has managed Fiorentina or AC Milan in the past.
For Mihajlovich, this season is extraordinary even because he missed four months on the bench because of leukemia treatment.
“Despite my illness, league interruption and everything else, our team managed to move a level higher.
We want to keep growing and to do that we need the players to be mentally stronger,” he said.

The launch of a new myth is not at risk, reports the Kremlin. However, there is a change of operator at play
The Department of Transportation on Friday began preparations for a new tender to operate a new toll system. At issue is a fallback plan that would be used by the state in case the current toll agreement is rightfully rescinded. Alongside this, the state is also preparing another makeshift solution should the tender fail to finish on time. On Facebook this was stated by Transport Minister Vladimir Kremlík (per YES).
The Office for the Protection of Competition (IOHS) on Thursday banned the performance of the toll contract between the state and the Czechtoll/Skytoll consortium, with a one-year postponement. The ministry will file a decomposition against this.
“The launch of a new myth-selection system is not compromised. Starting today, we are starting the preparation of a new transparent procurement procedure, the focus of which will be the services of the new toll system, which is now being completed by the CzechToll consortium and SkyToll,” the minister stated.
Thus, the state would look in the tender for the operator of the currently forthcoming myth, which will be launched from this December. So it would not be a contest to an entirely new toll system, as was the case with the last tender, nor to use the old system now run by Kapsch.
But the ministry, according to the Kremlin, is also preparing for the fact that it would not be able to prepare the new tender in time. “On the basis of my experience with the course of the toll tender, I am deeply convinced that the OHS is wrong and that it is not objectively possible to prepare and implement such complex within the specified period of 12 months tender and hand over the operation of the toll system to a new operator,” he said.
In addition to the new procurement process, the Resort will also prepare a provisional solution to resolve the toll collection for a transitional period until the state finds a full-fledged form of solution.
Thus, the state will not yet take advantage of the offer made to it by the current administrator of the Kapsch myth in previous days. An Austrian firm to the state offered to operate the existing system in case the toll contract was cancelled.
At the same time, Kremlin reiterated that he believed a backup plan would not be needed. The Ministry will therefore file a breakdown against the Antitrust Authority's decision.
The OHS on Thursday issued a ruling in which it banned the performance of tolls contracts. But the ban will not begin to apply until a year after the authority's legal power decision This is not true, and a dither may be brought against him to the President of the Office. Both the ministry and CzechToll are therefore continuing to prepare a new myth, which is expected to be launched in December.
Last year's tender for the new toll system and its operator won the Czechtoll/Skytoll consortium. It succeeded in the toll tender with a bid of 10.75 billion kronor for a 10-year operation. The course of both the tender and the validity of the toll contract was protested by the current operator Kapsch, which failed to offer over 13 billion kronor in the competition.
My heart is like a bell and a non-smoker's lungs. I'll just have a few infusions, joked Zeman
The head of state underwent a several-hour medical examination at the Central Military Hospital (UVN) on Tuesday. According to hospital director Miroslav Zavoral, doctors found no “disease conditions” with the president. The president will celebrate his 75th birthday on Saturday.
Doctors at the president detected mild signs of dehydration at the check-up. His low pressure problems were caused precisely by the lack of roll-off. “To fix that dehydration of the organism, I'll have a few infusions that get minerals into my body,” Zeman stated.
Otherwise, however, according to him, the director of the UVN noted that “the Czech state has a healthy president.” The president mentioned in this context that Zavoral had received several hate messages because of a health check.
According to the president, doctors inspected him thoroughly and did not leave out a single spot on his body. 'So a brief recap: the heart beats like a bell, the lungs are clean like it's not a smoker, the liver works like I'm abstinent, the kidneys are fine too and I can go on and on, ' stated Zeman.
The editorial staff of IDNES.cz approached the military hospital to comment on Zeman's statement about his health.
The issue of Zeman's health became a topic primarily at the time of last year's presidential election or at some public appearances in which Zeman has distinct walking problems. According to Prague Castle, the president is walking badly because of diabetic polyfunctional neuropathy. He also has problems with low pressure and hears worse. Because of his health, he restricted smoking.

A link to both games is on the Epic Store here. Games can be included in your library directly via the web, but you need to download the Epic Games Launcher client to play. You have time until October 3.
Metro 2033 Redux is a modified version of the original 2010 game, adding both graphic and gameplay changes from the Last Light sequel.
The story on the motifs of Dmitry Glukhovsky's book of the same name is set in 2033 in Russia after a nuclear war. The Earth's surface as we know it no longer exists. Humanity had to take refuge under the ground, in our case to the vast complexes of the Moscow Metro.
“Take the post-apocalyptic world and oppressive atmosphere from an unfamiliar environment, take on the vastness of the world and add a lot of spectacular scripts and action passages and track: Metro 2033 is on world,” we wrote on Bonusweb in a period review.
Everything, by contrast, is a relaxing game-neplay in a procedurally generated world that carries the message of English writer and philosopher Alan Watts. The player can become anything, from animals to trees to the planet.

Sparta doesn't want to lose Tetteh in Pilsen. She appealed against a two-match penalty
Football Sparta have appealed against a two-match penalty for striker Benjamin Tetteh, which the player received from the disciplinary panel for exclusion in Sunday's derby with Slavia (0:3).
The Letensky Club reported on this on its twitter page and is now awaiting the verdict of the appeals panel.
He had already served half of his sentence in Wednesday's home cup match in Jihlava. Sparta are now aiming for the 22-year-old Ghanaian striker to be able to mount in Sunday's 11th round of the First League in Pilsen.
The situation from last October could be repeated. That's when Olomouc appealed against the penalty for Šimon Falta, who received a one-match distance from the disciplinary committee on Thursday for exclusion against Liberec.
The appeals panel failed to discuss the case, so the effectiveness of the sentence delayed and Falta was allowed to step in on Saturday, ironically against Sparta.
The commission finally confirmed the one-match penalty for the Olomouc midfielder in the next week and Falta missed the following duel with Zlín.
Disciplinarian Tetteh stopped activity for a foul on Slavist David Hovorka, for which he received a straight red card from referee Miroslav Zelinka in the 82nd minute.
The Ghanaian player's alleged spat on the captain of rival Tomas Souček has not been proven.
We have become targets of cyberattack by foreign states, Iran claims
Since late June, fires and explosions have been reported from a number of Iranian military, industrial and nuclear facilities, as well as oil refineries, power plants, fabrics and businesses.
Some Iranian officials said a fire that erupted earlier this month in the Natanz underground nuclear operation may have caused cyber sabotage.
The cause of a number of other incidents has not yet been explained.
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Musavi told reporters, according to Iranian media, that the Islamic Republic's infrastructure faces “thousands of cyber attacks” daily.
He added that it is not a new phenomenon and that most of it will succeed in fending off.
Several wider cyberattacks have been recorded in the past months, according to Musavi, behind which “certain governments and groups,” according to analyses.
However, he did not share closer details of possible offenders, according to Reuters.
Muáví also added that fires in forests, refineries and other places are frequent during the summer.
An article this month by Iran's state agency IRNA discussed that enemies of Iran, like Israel and the US, may have been behind recent incidents.
But neither of those countries was accused directly of the specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States cut off diplomatic relations shortly after the 1979 revolution when Iranian militant students stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held hostage for 444 days 52 Americans.
Long-tense relations between the two countries sharpened in 2018 after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers and imposed sanctions on Iran, that have a hard impact on its economy.
Another major escalation came this year after the U.S. military killed Iranian General Qasem Soleimani and a member of Abu Mahdi Muhandis, an Iraqi militia leadership member.
Iran then fired scores of missiles at bases in Iraq, where the Americans operate, on January 8.
The US only acknowledged with the stand-off that dozens of US troops had been wounded.
Israel regards Iran as its archenemy, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is the main opponent of the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran.
According to the Israeli prime minister, Iran is trying to develop an atomic bomb, which Iran denies.
Harry in Princess Diana's footsteps (†36)! Where's Meghan?
Diana was special in that she could grab people's hearts. In January 1997, she raised a bust when she visited Africa and especially a minefield. The images, showing him wearing a protective suit and a shield on his face, have become iconic. And then no one could have known that a few months later the princess of people's hearts in a tragic car accident in Paris would breathe one last time.
Now her younger son Harry has boarded up, too, as he made his way to the same spot as her after 22 years. He went to the mine removal site in Diric, Angola, and he also put on a special protective suit and was very thoughtful. Surely he has not resisted the memories of his beloved mum, whom he lost at just 13.
Harry gave a speech on site where he praised the efforts of the Halo Trust organization, which works to defuse minefields and other explosives in countries where the war took place. “The minefields are the unhealed wounds of war. By clearing them, we can help the community find peace with which opportunities come,” he said, appealing also to save and maintain wilderness and local rivers as a source of water. After this visit, the Duke of Sussex moved on to Huambo to rename the local orthopaedic centre just after his famous mum, Princess Diana.
He didn't forget to mention it on his official Instagram account either: 'The Duke is honoured to be able to visit the place and community that were important enough to his mother, to familiarize himself with their relentless mission and speak out for everyone who (Diana) was under the impression they needed most to be heard, even though the issue wasn't exactly popular globally, 'it appeared in an instagram post Sussex Royal.
But it may freeze on royal fans that he didn't take his wife Meghan (38) and their son Archie (4 months) on such a quest for memories of Diana. Both have had a separate programme towards Harry since Wednesday, apparently for their protection. After all, taking a little baby to a minefield doesn't sound very safe, and Harry doesn't want to put his beloved family at any cost.
Automaker TPCA extended production shutdown, now until May 25
Cologne carmaker Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile (TPCA) has extended production shutdown again due to coronavirus.
Production lines are expected to restart on Monday, May 25 in the morning.
The raid will accompany dozens of sanitary measures, said Tomas Paroubek, a spokesman for the automaker.
Production stands due to the coronavirus pandemic from the evening of March 18.
Originally, the firm intended to restore it on Monday, May 18.
According to Paroubko, the reason for the extension of the shutdown is closed borders and closed dealerships, so he has no one to sell cars.
According to Paroubko, the company will produce at 100 percent from the start, that is, two shifts.
Koronavirus is the firm's key markets affected, such as Italy, the UK or Spain.
Mayor Michael Kašpar (Change for Cologne) said the production shutdown at TPCA was not signing off on life in the city.
“In the beginning it was to know, it was empty in the city.
But gradually, the streets are filling up, especially now from Monday, when it's unleashed a lot.
So the city is full,” Kašpar said.
According to him, there are no complications even with foreign workers who stayed in hostels.
“We didn't have to address almost any problem in those two months,” Kašpar said.
For example, Mědoboleslav Škoda Auto, which also discontinued production due to the coronavirus crisis, resumed it on Monday 27 April at all three of its production facilities in the Czech Republic.
Neither plant operates at 100 per cent capacity.
The resumption of production in Škoda was accompanied by more than 80 sanitary measures.
On the night of Monday to Tuesday, a third, i.e. night shift, was held in Mladá Boleslav and Kvasiny for the first time after the resumption of production.
About 2500 people currently work in TPCA, and the company represents one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and an employer in Cologne.
New Tube architect will see to Line D, bringing London Underground experience
The Prague transport company has selected an architect to oversee the form of the metropolitan metro. From October, Anna Švarc will become her primary task will be the appearance of the new D line, but the existing stations will also be in charge. According to her, the subway cannot be viewed as just a traffic construction, underground travel should also bring an aesthetic experience.
The Czech architect, who participated in, for example, the refurbishment of three London Underground stations, won a tender written by the Prague Transport Enterprise (DPP).
In addition to her, 14 other contenders participated in Tendra. “Part of the selection process was a cover letter and a biography. Apparently my previous practice decided from London, where in a team of three people I was creating a kind of aesthetic manual for the subway there,” the new subway architect approaches. Similarly, according to her, her practice from the Institute of Planning and Development of Prague could also decide.
Metro doesn't just see it as a transportation fuknoll construction. Stations should have aesthetic value as well.
“I have ideas about how the subway will change, how the space will improve, However, I will find out how it will take place in the following weeks, when the transport business introduces me to my liking,” says Švarc.
“This is not a series of dogmas, but rather recommendations designed primarily to maintain the context of all stations in case they are reconstructed,” the design manual approximates.
Whether a similar instrument is also a way for improving public space in the Prague Metro is a question. Prague Metro is specific. “Whether the manual is an ideal or whether it can be covered by some personality, I don't really know yet,” concludes Švarc.
Cancer killed bride shortly after wedding: She left message to family
For more than two years she battled Gemma Sisson's insidious cancer, and when she already seemed to have beaten the cancer, the disease heard back again.
A 33-year-old woman who loved bodybuilding eventually ended up on a bed in a hospice where she was still enough to marry her life's love.
Unfortunately, the disease succumbed.
A few hours after the death, a shocking message appeared on her social network facebook account for those closest to her.
Hailing from Leeds, England, Gemma Sisson loved bodybuilding.
She and boyfriend Ricky Moore, with whom she lived for more than 16 years, toured competitions taking place around the world.
The 33-year-old woman sported and lived healthy, yet she was diagnosed with cancer in April in 2018.
Gemma began gruelling treatment, radiotherapy, in the hope of healing herself.
After months of treatment, it really seemed that Gemma had managed to win over cancer, but in August 2019, the cancer returned and this time attacked her spine.
The bodybuilder and personal trainer, according to information from Britain's Daily Mirror newspaper, underwent a ten-hour spinal operation and afterwards began drastic treatment again.
But everything was in vain.
Earlier this year, on her 31st birthday, doctors notified her that she had a few months left to live.
In April, the eventually handsome blonde decided to board a hospice in Leeds, where she was visited every now and then by her family, who even arranged her wedding to her love Ricky.
The marriage lasted two months.
Ricky took Gemma to the restaurant for the last time on their two-month anniversary.
Four days later, Gemma died in his arms.
Just hours after the deaths, a post Gema had written for her family appeared on her social network account.
“If this has been published, it means that I have finally died after weeks of fighting too long.
Although I will be heartbroken to leave my loved ones here, I will be so glad to get rid of what this terrible illness has caused me.
I cannot thank Ricky enough, who has been by my side throughout and given me a huge amount of love and support during that terrible time,” she wrote on the social network, saying pain and suffering finally stopped and she found peace.
“I am also grateful for all the support I have received from all my watching on the social network,” she wrote, saying everyone should value their life and live it to the fullest.
First Miss Christová finally went into herself: She dropped a few pounds and immediately peeked through
First modern-day miss from 1989, Ivana Christová (49), had problems with being overweight for years, causing her not only physical problems, but especially psychological ones. She suffered because of the fact that she had changed a lot since the days of Miss Czechoslovakia. But now it looks like she's taken the rebukes to heart and, with excess pounds, she's gone into battle. Even if it's a long haul run.
She used to be a world-class beautiful who conquered Paris as well. But thirty years have passed since then, and Ivana Christová can only remember the beauty pageant. Not just because of fame, but also because of how skinny she was.
Over time, she chose not to submit to strict modeling rules, which instructed her to be as slender as possible and often not to eat. She decided to stop listening, and started indulging in what she was just looking for.
But from hunger strikes, she switched to overeating, which immediately signed on her character. Moreover, the kilos tried to disguise with a variety of loose clothes, but also added to the size of the cuprus shapes.
Now it looks like Ivana went really into herself. Visibly losing weight, she began to dress tastefully and appropriately to her fuller figure.
She surprised all those present at the christening of Miloš Zapletal (75) that she once again peeked through and already has the features of the charming brunette, who in 1989 entered history not only as the first Miss winner after revolution, but also by what controversy her victory has provoked.
Christová will forever be the first beauty winner, but also the very first to whom the audience at the Palace of Culture and Sport in Ostrava whistled as senses deprived when she put on her crown.
“A parody of justice.” Scientist warned of cancer from pollution, sits in Turkish base
Sik, along with other scientists, participated between 2011 and 2015 in a study commissioned by the Turkish Ministry of Health. Its conclusion was that pollution of water, land and food in some industrial areas in the west of the country was related to an increased incidence of cancer among locals.
Scientists mentioned mainly the Dilovasi industrial zone, which lies about 80 kilometres from Istanbul, and which houses a number of chemical and metallurgy plants. People living in her area, they say, suffer from cancer far more often than the international average.
Erdogan takes verge for putsch, international criticism despite
To Sik, the government seemed not to take any action on the matter, notwithstanding the clear conclusions of the study. He therefore wrote several articles on the research to the opposition daily Cumhuriyet. Authorities subsequently began prosecuting him for divulging classified information.
“The study clearly showed the extent to which water sources were contaminated with toxic substances,” Sik told reporters after the verdict was handed down. “The court's decision shows that the results of studies directly related to public health can be clouded. This is unacceptable,” the scientist added.
“Instead of pursuing people sounding the alarm through the courts, Turkish authorities should investigate this significant public health issue,” claimed Andrew Gardner of the Turkish branch of AI.
Environmental and human rights organizations have long accused the Turkish government of not enforcing regulations in certain regions despite the rapid development of industry in certain regions protection of the environment.
After the thwarted 2016 putsch, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's regime launched a widespread wave of arrests. There are now nearly 80,000 people behind bars, including a number of staff at the daily Cumhuriyet. Authorities have also put off-duty or outright laid off 150,000 public servants and members of the armed forces.
The opposition and human rights organisations accuse the government of using the attempted putsch to persecute its opponents. But the authorities defend themselves by saying the measures needed to ensure national security.
Art machines sell sweat dating, mushroom and pexeso amulet
For one hundred crowns, a passer-by gets a pocket work of mostly budding Czech artists.
Images and other creation create directly for artmat, so they know that they must fit in size 8.5 by 5.5 centimeters.
Each piece is numbered and signed.
“There is always a curatorial text about the artist and then the work itself,” stated the project's curator Petra Widžová.
Artmat works with the principle of chance.
Thus, the buyer can let himself be surprised at what artwork he acquires.
Currently, perhaps the new owner of fantasy illustrations by Alexandra Štoplová or mini-views by Tereza Bonaventurova, which can also be sent.
Artist Punx 23 in collaboration with Dora Dutková prepared a pexeso associated with a walk through Prague.
The cards need to be paired with home signs.
Ilona Polanski created a collection of tattoos for Artmat.
Marie Ladrová and Juliána Chomová sell pocket-packs of spirituality: the first of the women artists offers a protective amulet of troudnatice and oracle cards, the second a series of illustrations based on her comic book Spiritists.
Slovenes beat Polish world champions too and are in ME final
Slovenia's volleyball players will sensationally play for the European Champions Premiership title. Supported by nearly 12 thousand storming fans in Ljubljana, they defeated the reigning two-time world champions Poles 3:1 and are the first runners-up.
Who they challenge in Sunday's climax in Paris will be decided between France and Serbia on Friday.
The Slovenian team operated much more compactly in the semi-finals than the Polish world champions. These were only the beginning of the opening set and with luck the end of the second set, but the home volleyball players were outperforming themselves in defence, with only the native of Cuba essentially scoring from the players in the red-and-white jersey Leon.
But the home line-up featured both Chebulj and Urnaut as well as the second universal Štern, who soon replaced the lacklustre Gasparini. The Poles paid off winning all previous matches at this Euro sovereignly, while the Slovenians gained confidence after heavy battles in the play off with both Bulgarians and Russians.
With the Poles this August, the Slovenians lost 1:3 in the Olympic qualifier in Gdańsk but repaid them the defeat at home. But now the sold-out Arena Stožica will leave Ljubljana. They still have a certain second medal in history after today, in Paris they can improve on an unexpected silver from the ME four years ago.
At the previous European Championships, Slovenes finished eighth, only behind the Czech national team.

The 65-year-old Bochek, who was a British Air Force fighter during World War II, gave thanks on behalf of all those awarded for the medals awarded. “The Senate was one of the first to be oblivious and oblivious to war veterans,” he stated, among others. “The award I took on today also belongs to my mates who are no longer among us,” he added.
Kubera, in his speech, warned against splitting up the company. “Let us not forget our roots, which, whether we want or not, unite and shape us all. After all, it is from these values that our successful present is based,” Kubera said.
The award was cardiologist and most cited Czech scientist Renata Cífková, long-time rector of Tomáš Bati University in Zlín Petr Sah, geologist, writer and traveller and popularizer of science Václav Cílek, Chairman of the Czech Biathlon Union and Vice President of the World Biathlon Union Jiří Hamza and František Paštěka. The upper house appreciated his heroism - this January he saved the life of his neighbour and his two-year-old granddaughter when he pulled them out of a burning car. The former presidents of the upper house Libuše Benešová and Milan Štěch also received medals.
Sigismund undertook a number of travelling expeditions around the world together with Jiří Hanzelka, in which they collected a number of documentary material. Fištejn was both commentator and director of broadcasting at Radio Free Europe, now working with public media. Steigerwald also acts as a playwright and scriptwriter, musician Kocáb was head of the parliamentary commission for overseeing the withdrawal of Soviet troops.
The medal was given in advance by astronomer and head emeritus of the United Nations Office for Space Affairs, Luboš Perek, in July on the occasion of his 100th birthday. By the end of the year, the same award is still given by Czech author and the first secretary of state of the US Madeleine Albright and the British philosopher and political scientist Roger Scruton, who, among others, participated in activities of the so-called underground university during the communist regime in the former Czechoslovakia.
Insects are up to sixty times less than 40 years ago
No other animal class is more represented in nature than insects. Beetles, butterflies and other species make up more than half the life on Earth. But reports are growing, according to which the insect empire is radically shrinking. Another scientific study on the subject came out just this week, and the situation, according to it, is even far more serious than mankind has so far been aware of.
The study is based on a field inquiry in tropical forest on Puerto Rico, in which American scientists copied a similar 1976 survey. As they write right away in the report's introduction, insects are “ten to sixty times less” in the forest today. This is the decline of the whole population, that is not the number of species, with the inquiry concerned not only insects but all arthropods. Due to insect extinctions, the population of other fauna that is dependent on insects in the food chain, such as birds, frogs or lizards, is also thinned.
The authors of the research put their conclusions in direct connection with climate change. The average air temperature in the forest has risen by two degrees Celsius over the past thirty years, according to them, and warming has become the driving force behind the collapse of the food chain. Thus, the study shows, according to the author's team, that the impact of climate change on tropical ecosystems may be much greater than previously predicted.
A big article in the Washington Post newspaper came out on Monday about the report, which makes the new findings right away in the headline as hyperalarming. “It's one of the most disturbing articles I've ever read,” entomologist David Wagner of the University of Connecticut, whose paper cites as an independent expert, told the paper.
Insect extinction affects Europe as well. “With us, the decline is also an order of magnitude,” points out Lukáš Čížek of the Institute of Entomology of the Academy of Sciences. However, in addition to climate change, the landscape changes that play a substantial role in Europe must also be taken into account. “We are just running for a significantly longer time than in Puerto Rico,” adds Čížek, explaining why scientists could measure such a rapid decline in the forest compared to the 1970s.
French Oscar Candidate Miserers Kicks Off Be2Can Show
The Golden Bear and both acting award holders from this year's Berlinale, the directing prize and the jury prize from Cannes and much more will present the 6th edition of the festival film from Berlin, Venice and Cannes.

Chairman of police unions Štěpánek resigned, wants to live as a free man
Chairman of the Independent Trade Union of Police Milan Stepanek decided to leave office. This was stated on Friday by Czech Radio - Radiožurnál. Štěpánek has led the union since 2005. He will be the union's chairman for two more months. He will remain with the police force even after leaving the head of the union.
“I can confirm that I handed over my written resignation to the Bureau this week, after which I will hold the full office for two more months,” Stepanek told Radiožurnál. “I have decided as a free man who does not want to be forever attached to a trade union. And who wants to live a quieter life,” he stated the reasons for leaving.
The independent trade union of the Police of the Czech Republic brings together members and staff of the Security Corps or employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Among other things, the union has been involved in police protests against budget cuts or petitions for better conditions for the security force. He also got into a dispute with the then Home Secretary Radek John in 2011, for example, organising a petition for his resignation. The leadership of the governing coalition later agreed on John's departure.
Healthcare salaries will rise by a maximum of five per cent next year.
The larger increase is unrealistic according to Vojtěch
Salaries in health care could rise by no more than five percent next year, Health Minister Adam Vojtěch said (for Václav Moravec's Questions on Czech Television.
He considers unionists' demand for increases of up to 15 per cent unrealistic.
He also said the state should strive to be self-sufficient in providing protective equipment.
Hospitals, he says, now have their supplies.
“I do think the increase (in salaries) may be somewhere within five per cent,” the minister stated.
According to him, the current situation has to be reflected, where coronavirus pandemic selection and government regulations against its spread have intervened since March.
Insurance companies' incomes fell at the time.
“By 15 percent, I find the increase unrealistic at the moment,” Vojtěch said.
The average monthly earnings of a doctor in acute inpatient care according to data from the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (UZIS) is likely to reach 88,312 crore this year, nurses 47,498 crore.
The difference between the salary of nurses in state hospitals and that of other constituents will be up to seven thousand crowns.
The UZIS data also shows that the decline of nurses in hospitals has stopped.
The average wage in the Czech Republic was 34,125 crore in 2019, according to data from the Czech Statistical Office.
Trade unionist representatives had already indicated in June that for 2021 they would call for a minimum increase of ten per cent, ideally 15 per cent.
They criticize the long-standing significant difference between the earnings of doctors and nurses in state hospitals, which must follow pay tables, and contractual wages in hospitals of cities, counties or private.
They therefore also demand that pay tables be uniform for paramedics.
For nurses this year, the difference will be up to seven thousand crowns per month.
For example, for doctors last year, wages grew faster than salaries.
According to the president of the Czech Dental Chamber Roman Šmucler, trade unionists should see how the state is at present.
The House recently, due to the effects of the covid epidemic, approved an increase in this year's state budget deficit to a record 500 billion kronor, of which 1.75 billion is to go to the remuneration of health professionals in hospitals and social services.
According to Shmucler, the Council of Healthcare Providers does not agree with next year's flat pay increases.
According to him, remuneration should be decided by hospitals and medical facilities themselves, and the extra money should go to them via the reimbursement decree.
Vojtěch also stated that hospitals currently have enough protective equipment.
The chairman of the State Tangible Reserves Administration (SSHR), Pavel Brother-in-law, said this week that the administration does not have a single protective health aid in the property at the moment.
Waiting for the finalization of tenders.
According to Vojtěch, suppliers in the world are now able to deliver goods better than they were in March when they were bought out.
According to him, the state should try to be as self-sufficient as possible and buy from Czech companies as well.
Petra Černocká changed her image and did well! In light-colored hair
Movie Saxana Petra Černocká (69) looks absolutely fantastic for its age. Although she celebrates life's jubilee in November, she never looked like a pensioner. And now she's helped it. She changed her image until her colleagues didn't recognize her.
Actress Petra Černocká never looked like a typical grandmother who would have her hair interwoven with greyish paint, wear homesteaded belongings and head into society sporadically. She's always looked after herself and the older she gets, the more she can untie herself in looking at her image.
Fortunately, she hasn't succumbed to the trend of plastic surgeries and is looking after her skin using good old indulons. And her anti-wrinkle recipe is paying off. But now she's changed her hair colour and totally peeked through.
When she came to a social event where celebrities were saying goodbye to summer, no one could recognise Petra. Not only did she have lighter and shorter hair, but she was still dressed in a yellow coat that shone through her even more.
Ladies should learn from Saxana how not to underestimate themselves, that even on the cusp of the 70s, they can take risks with appearance. And Peter's paid off, he looks like fifty at most.
Lucia White's father didn't cheer her at all. You won't believe what she was supposed to do for a living!
Who does not know that the national treasure Lucie Bílá (53) is the original profession of seamstress and in her own name Hana Zaňáková, probably does not live in the Czech Republic. But the singer herself has now revealed that she almost worked in a glassworks!
Lucie White knew from a fairly early age that she wanted to be a singer. Her love of singing was born when, as a little girl, she performed in a cultural house in her native Otvovice, where the foam still lives.
“And I remember exactly where Mommy sat. Back then, a singer was born in me,” she admitted for Impulsu radio.
But her father was a little worried about his daughter's future and advised her to take the path of a craft that has a golden bottom.
“Dad always said, 'Craft girl, craft. Walk your feet on the ground! ' He even cajoled me to see if I wanted to go to the local glass factory. Glassworks no longer, I pretty much do. I'm a learned dressmaker and at home I make various rosaries and pendants out of beads, which I then auction at auctions and buy wheelchairs for money,” she added with a laugh.
Děchina zoo rejoices in small macaque
“Our number currently numbers seven members. Her youngest member came into the world on 17 August, she gave birth to a female Buffy and is her fifth young children, her father being a male Hitam. For the first days after giving birth, a female cub wore tightly pressed against her body and for a long time did not want to show the world if she had given birth to a male or female. At about three weeks of age, the cub has already started to procrastinate for a little while, and the attendants have known for a few days that it is a male,” said Alena Houšková, a zoo spokeswoman, saying that The Děchina Zoo has successfully reared 12 chicks of this species.
Crested macaques are the so-called endedemities of Sulawesi Island, that is, they do not live elsewhere in the world in the wild. A typical feature is black fur and a crested on the head, according to which they have a name. Crested macaques live in rainforests, primarily at lower elevations.
They thus feed, like most primates, on both plant and animal food. In the diet, the fruits of forest trees predominate very significantly, complementing the flowers and leaves. They address the need for protein by eating small arthropods, larvae and, to a lesser extent, bird eggs as well as pups.
“If we miss natural enemies, which are pythons, everything else is written down by a man. Locals hunt macaques as popular prey with tasty meat and for fur. The burning and felling of rainforest is also fatal for these animals,” the spokeswoman added.
Unclarified death of baby girl (†8) in Příbram: The culprit punishment does not await
Unclarified cases are called “memorials” in criminalist slang. But even those are being investigated if new information emerges years later. Especially when it comes to death of a child. In 1980, the criminalist Jiří Markovic was able to investigate the murder of two girls in Prague's Prokopský valley as old as 12 years old. “The 1955 case? That's going to be tough, very hard. It would like to find a file for starters, it may no longer exist, to talk to those who investigated. Hope is always, but it would be really hard,” Markovic says.
Under the past regime, the public was not very informed about violent crimes, but according to Markovic, it certainly does not mean that they would be laxly investigated. “It always mattered to specific people,” thinks the criminalist. The problem may be that materials from the 1950s may be ruined, although unsealed cases should not be shredded.
Scrubbing a smart quarantine could be taken over by soldiers.
We are ready, they message
“Clever quarantine works is what to improve of course.
We're going to discuss this tonight with the military.
The military is working perfectly and there is a question if again they should not manage the whole thing,” the Prime Minister said on Sunday in his Facebook show Hi People.
According to him, IT systems and sanitation stations are failing to adequately connect, which gradually have to switch to more modern methods of operation.
The problems were, according to the prime minister, in the Moravian-Silesian region, where there are some of the current outbreaks of the epidemic.
Ministry of Defence spokesman Jan Pejšek said for ČTK that he did not have information about Sunday's negotiations and that the government should discuss the matter on Monday.
The military is ready for this step, according to him.
The smart quarantine project was taken over by the Department of Health on May 25.
Until then, the shrewd quarantine was led by a 90-member central management team set up under the army as an advisory body to the government, which was led by the minister's former deputy Roman Prymula.
The scrubbing project was criticised on Sunday by Interior Minister Jan Hamacek (ČSSD).
He, too, stated that the army might take it again.
The shortcomings in the project were previously admitted by the government's IT and digitisation agent Vladimir Dzurilla, who is in charge of it.
“The system works, but it's still being worked on.
Twenty years it was created separately and non-systemically, now within a couple of months we're trying to unite it.
It doesn't go nozzle.
People on the march, the poor people on the sanitation march adapt those new systems and take actually the bugs,” he stated.
Ostrava Mayor Macura won't run again, because he doesn't want to “go crazy in politics”
Ostrava's current mayor, Tomas Macura, will not stand in the next local elections.
The reason is to try “not to go mad at politics,” he told the Respect.cz server.
Macura, who is also a member of the Bureau of the ANO movement, has been Mayor of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the 2018 municipal elections, the candidate of the ANO movement in Ostrava won almost a third of the electoral votes.
Macura wanted originally to be in office for only four years.
“I was like, I'm going to last one term and with that business experience, I can roll everything over here in that time and get it on my feet,” he told Respect.
He added that for a second term he had let himself be talked down to some extent.
“But for me, it's the maximum.
I don't want to jerk about that politics,” added Macura, who in an interview referred to himself as a heavy introvert who doesn't suit frequent contact with people.
According to Respect, there has been speculation about Macur's possible end in the ANO movement for a long time.
The server recalls that Macura criticized the ANO movement several times, such as for alliances with the SPD movement or for supporting Milos Zeman in the presidential election.
As one of the few figures, ANO supported Zeman's anti-candidate Jiří Drahoš in the election.
From the YES movement, which he joined in 2017, Macura does not plan to leave.
“As long as I feel like I can make a difference in the movement, that it's not a completely futile fight and that no one is camfing into it, I have no immediate motive to end,” he told Respect.
The 6-year-old Macura graduated from the University of Economics in Prague.
Before becoming Mayor of Ostrava in 2014, Macura served as a director of the manufacturer of the pharmaceutical company Walmark, among other things.
He also sat on the bodies of other firms.
Uber to return to Brno offering transport services
Uber, which offers transport services, will return to Brno at the end of July.
It is a consequence of a change in the law, Brno Councillor for Transport Petr Kratochvíl (ODS) said in a press statement on Thursday.
Taxi drivers protested against Uber in Brno, pointing out that Uber does not meet conditions such as designation as a taxi or taxameter.
However, by changing the law, conditions for operating ordinary taxis as well as alternative ones have changed since July.
Kratochvíl has undergone several negotiations with Uber representatives in recent weeks.
“On their basis, this company decided at the end of July this year to return to Brno with its services.
The move is a result of a change in the law that allows that company to operate legally.
The city was acquainted with this change and we believe that the company will operate its services within the given limits,” Kratochvíl said.
Uber has operated in Brno in the past.
It was protested by taxi drivers over not labelling vehicles as taxis or missing taxameter.
The court issued a preliminary measure banning Uber from driving in the city.
Brno initially supported taxi drivers, but Mayor Markéta Vaňková (ODS) said the city would like to make moves to make Uber work in Brno.
According to later court rulings, Uber was allowed to ride in Brno, but the company did not take advantage of it.
He will now return based on a change in the law.
As of July, alongside classic taxi-lamp and taxameter taxameter taxis, it is easier to operate a transport service ordered and paid exclusively via mobile apps.
Too exuberant celebration in Brno: a flying chair hit a meter from a man on the pavement
An office chair came out of the fourth floor of the apartment building building in Brno on Saturday night and hit about a metre from the sidewalk.
After him at that point was a pedestrian who immediately called the officers.
The patrol noticed an open window immediately upon arrival at the said address in the western part of the city, under which a chair still lay and several cans and butts next to it.
“The rub carried from the room on the fourth floor suggested that a rather noisy celebration was taking place inside.
Officers walked down the corridor to the flat and asked the three young men present, aged between twenty-six and twenty-nine, for an explanation,” said Jakub Ghanem, a spokesman for the constables.
Young Czechs think they can do it with money. The survey did not confirm this
“So it turns out that young Czechs have somewhat more confidence in their knowledge of finance than the reality. In this case, women and non-graduation respondents had a significantly larger share of the wrong answers,” said KRUK director Jaroslava Palendalova.
Rather, men and young high school students or college students believe their knowledge of financial products.
Young Czechs learn the most about the functioning of financial affairs from parents (37 percent), self-study on the Internet (23 percent) and only in the third row from teaching in school (21 percent).
Questions around finances are consulted by parents primarily by women, while information on the internet is sought by men rather. Getting information about finance from parents prevails across all ages of young people, regardless of their educational attainment or personal income. Prospectuses of financial institutions, professional journals and publications have virtually minimal influence.
“Once again, the importance of raising children is shown by their parents, who represent authority in all major areas of life. Therefore, the financial literacy level of parents who transfer their knowledge and experience to their offspring is key,” Palendal said.
Savings and investment prefer 94 per cent of the young.
Unambiguously, the young are asked whether it is better to save and buy their own house or apartment, for example, or enjoy and spend money, without savings and their own housing.
The strategy of saving and investing in fixed tangible assets is professed by 94 per cent of those surveyed. This applies across all ages of young people, regardless of educational attainment, social status or the current amount of personal income.
The inquiry strategy is then 100 per cent held by people in a marriage union with two or more children and public sector employees. Rather, people living alone and with an income above 30,000 kronor per month want to enjoy.
Strict but fair, the clock amuses us! That's how Benešov gymnasts see their favorite cantor writer
Humanism should be present in every good book, Pavel Hoza is convinced. The high school teacher of Czech and history is also a poet, prose writer and builder of literary life in a small town.
Above the lyrics of Pavel Hoza, Bohuslav Reynek springs to mind. His poetry, his paintings. Bare trees, whitish rural builds, quivering grass, shepherds, sheep and goats, old paths and people who have been after them for centuries. Grieving, kneeling, blessing. This Reynk's contemporary continuator teaches Czech language in Benešov grammar school, literature and history, in the Café there he runs the parallel to the Viola of Prague and annually organizes Benešovský literary festival.
Request to appeal Rafaj discusses Babiš with CSSD
Prime Minister Peter Rafaj plans to discuss with the coalition Social Democrats on Monday a demand to draft an appeal by Antitrust Authority (ÚOHS) chief Petr Rafaj.
For Rafaj's appeal, non-profit organizations called for the anti-corruption council of the government, as well as the Ústí Region.
The Social Democrats state that the exchange at the head of the office is spot on.
According to ČTK information, Rafaj was not invited to the Cabinet Office for Monday.
A second mandate will expire for him in the middle of next year, under the law he cannot be appointed for a third time.
His appeal is within the purview of President Milos Zeman.
In addition to the challenge of non-profit organizations, the Prime Minister also received a letter with a similar request from the Ústí Region.
The reason is to be, among other things, Rafai's caucuses of recent times.
In the past week, the Prime Minister has refused to comment on the demand, saying that he would be familiar with the materials and government parties would take “some position” on it.
He also stated that he had not yet discussed the challenges with the President, a meeting with him at the earliest.
According to the comments of the OHS to appeal, there is no reason because Rafaj has not been charged with anything.
The servers Ihned.cz and Aktuálně.cz have written in the past week that the police are interested in Rafai's meetings with Hetman Jiří Čunk.
The meetings were linked to, among other things, deciding on a competition for a controversial new eight-billion Zlin hospital project, which Čunek has been pushing hard.
Chunek acknowledged the meeting, according to him, they jointly handled his “Senate activities.”
Similarly, Rafaj speaks.
The representative of the Ústí Region to appeal Rafaj called on the government at the end of June.
It also asks for reform of the authority's decision-making mechanisms.
The decision of the OHS regarding public contracts according to the Deputy Hetman for Transport Jaroslav Komínek is not transparent and has features of arbitrary.
Last March, police intervened at the Antitrust Authority over a myth collection tender.
This June, the server Aktuálně.cz pointed out that Rafaj was using apartments written to the company of influential backroom player ČSSD Alexander Chuba.
The deposit of 3.5 million for an apartment in Brno was paid from Rafajova's account.
The President of the Office of Competition Protection has been Rafaj since 9 July 2009, for the second term the President of the former Social Democracy MP appointed in June 2015.
In less than a year, Rafai's second six-year mandate expires.
The Antitrust Authority Act states that the President may dismiss the President of the Office upon a proposal from the Government.
He can only be revoked if he has not held office for more than six months or undermines the dignity of his office or the independence and impartiality of the office in a serious way.

In the Blanenian library, the people collapsed with heat.
Air conditioning will help
The new technique will cost 740 thousand and will be operational in the second half of August.
“For me, it's good news.
With three children, we go to the library in downtown Blansko on a regular basis.
In the warm months, though, it was practically impossible to stand there.
It was terrible heat and bad air.
Ventilation didn't help.
That's why I love for air conditioning,” said one of Blanensian readers Petr Novotný.
According to the library's director, Lukas Dlapa, temperatures in the building often climbed up to over thirty degrees.
The south wall of the property is glazed and functions as a greenhouse on sunny days.
“In addition, the sun leans into it because of the curvature of the building for much of the day.
At the same time, it is a big problem for individual departments to air because overnight windows have to be closed for safety reasons.
We often have that way from morning in the library to thirty degrees,” stated Dlapa.
Worst off was the study room and reading room on the third floor.
And a floor up the exhibition room and the principal.
An unpleasant climate was also in the children's ward located under the roof of the building.
“It happened several times that librarians at work collapsed and ended up on sick leave.
The problem also regularly occurred in the culture room at lectures attended by dozens of people.
After a few minutes, there was no longer a breath there,” Dlapa noted.
Originally, city representatives wanted to do air conditioning this year on all premises of the library.
In the end, only three circuits out of five will
“Due to limited funding, only the most troubled spaces will have air conditioning.
Study room and reading room on the third floor.
Then the culture room and the children's department a floor higher,” Jiří Svoboda from the Blanenian Investment Department informed him.
He added that in the first phase, workers had already installed HVAC and modified wiring in said premises last fall.
Approximately 360 thousand crowns.
The Blansko Municipal Library has almost three thousand registered readers.
Of these, about nine hundred are under fifteen years old.

Opora of Chicago drove out the coronavirus.
Crawford bounces back into the game
Not every single one of the infected athletes comes out with the truth.
Especially when it involves an NHL player who keeps quiet about the health of players like a grave and doesn't publish anything at all.
As one of the few, he stepped out of the line Crawford.
The 35-year-old Montréal native was present at just the first training session, missing from the line-up since.
“I would like to announce to all of you that I tested positive for Covid-19 and have spent the last fortnight locked up in my home because of that,” he revealed the reason for his absence.
Fans no longer have to worry about his medical condition.
Crawford is ready to throw himself into full ballast again.
“It's amazing that I'm back.
I'll do everything I can to get in shape as soon as possible,” he added.
The experienced goalie earned two Stanley Cups with Chicago, a solid part of the crease being for the tenth season in a row.
The Blackhawks await first a prep duel with St. Louis, then they will face Edmonton in the preround.
Přerov: The driver crashed near the village of Kokory: He died wedged in his Fabia
The tragic road accident occurred on Friday on a straight section between Přerov and Kokory village. The 28-year-old chauffeur fabie couldn't handle the hurtling and went off the road. The car flipped onto the roof and he remained wedged underneath. He did not survive the injuries sustained.
'According to initial information identified at the scene, a passenger vehicle travelling in the direction of Kokory went out of communication where it flipped onto the roof and the driver remained wedged under the vehicle, 'she said Přerovská police spokeswoman Miluše Hazacová for the server novelky.cz.
Thousands of people protested in Israel against the prime minister
Thousands of Israelis in several places of the country have protested against unemployment, corruption and the way Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is handling the coronavirus crisis.
Manifestations took place outside Netanyahu's private villa in Caesarea, near his official residence or in a park in Tel Aviv, among others.
Protests have been held regularly in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv for several weeks.
Their participants are demanding Netanyahu's resignation because of the process in which he is indicted on corruption and fraud charges, as well as over the government's handling of the next wave of the coronavirus epidemic.
“Bibi, go home,” one of the protesters wrote on his transparent, referring to Netanyahu's commonly known nickname, according to the AP agency.
“Everyone sees that the emperor has lost his clothes,” another said.
The 70-year-old Netanyahu is Israel's first prime minister on trial while holding office.
He is indicted in three counts of corruption, fraud and abuse of trust.
He rejects all charges, calling them a witch hunt.
According to local media, the trial can take up to three years, with over 300 witnesses being called.
Sars-COV-2 coronavirus has been confirmed in nearly 60,500 people in Israel, which has a population of about nine million.
455 people have died in connection with the disease.
The Israeli government imposed quarantine measures in March that helped reduce daily increases in those infected.
However, after a gradual easing of restrictions since the end of April, in particular, the numbers of infected began to grow significantly again at the end of June.
Netanyahu's critics say the government has not adequately helped, for example, business owners affected by quarantine measures.
Protesters are also bothered by the government issuing contradictory guidelines in the fight against coronavirus.
Step aside, challenged Schiller for words about opposition squalor Czernin
“I find it completely unacceptable that a member of the Czech government anywhere, the less on the floor of parliament, enjoy such totalitarian expression,” Czernin wrote in an open letter to Schiller.
Her words raised a stir when discussing a draft constitutional action for President Milos Zeman. The opposition didn't get enough votes, and the draft constitutional action that the Senate came up with, MPs threw off the table.
“I get dozens of messages from people I don't know. There's not a single vote there to support this lawsuit. There are messages of support for the president and messages of the type of how taxpayer money is being spent here, the empty straw being beaten around here. And I'll even allow myself, I don't use hard terms, one of them to quote: It's opposition and senatorial scum,” the finance minister said.
“With these expressions, Nazis were frequent citizens of Jewish origin and communists their political opponents. It is a rhetoric of totalitarian, without a modicum of respect for man and opinion,” wrote to the minister TOP 09 Vice President Czernin, who will confront the post of party chairman in the autumn with a previously first Vice-President Margaret Pekar Adam.
“I cited one of the many messages I received dozens during the course of the House proceedings. Their common denominator was disgust at the constant personal dehonestation we witness daily in domestic politics and which was also the main motive behind Thursday's House hearing. The fact that someone applies to themselves surprises me,” Schiller responded for ČTK.
The driver smashed the car against a tree and perished.
Body had to be cut out of wreck by firefighters
The tragic accident happened around 23rd hour near Neveklov on a narrow district leading from the Slapska Dam.
The driver flew apparently at no small speed down into the woods and smashed the car against a tree.
He perished on the spot.
The body had to be extricated from the wreck by firefighters, cutting off the roof, among other things.
The circumstances of the crash are being checked by police officers
They ordered a court autopsy, which should clarify, among other things, if the man was driving under the influence of alcohol or any other addictive substance.
End with waste and spouting one collection after another.
Pietro Filipi cancels discounts and bets on sustainability
Czech clothing brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and is embarking on a major change in strategy.
It cancels discounts and no longer wants to spew one collection after another.
The fact that the fashion industry is among the biggest environmental polluters is no news.
In incinerators and landfills, billions of items of clothing end annually.
But the sight of slow fashion, a much-despised approach to dressing, has been changing quite rapidly during recent years.
Approximately half of Pietro Filipi's merchandise sold at full price.
The other half, which sold thanks to discounts, simply won't buy.
The firm doesn't want to spew one collection after another and cheapen products below their production price at the end of each season.
Moreover, according to owner Michal Mičky, the times of new and old collections and the blind following of rapidly changing fashion trends are gone.
“Most discount dealers count already when buying goods, so the full price includes a much higher margin.
So it's actually kind of a scam,” says Pietro Filipi owner Michal Mička.
Moreover, with its approach, the firm also wants to support local business.
“Each of our products is made of carefully selected quality fabrics and designed by local designers.
We place emphasis on making sure that much of our collection is made up of so called basic pieces - i.e. clothing that is timeless and over-season.
Globally, the premium brand segment in the absence of any discounts is typical, the price of the product simply corresponds to its quality and the discount is not needed,” adds Mička.
Giant graffiti features RAF airman Kurt Taussig
“The assignment was to create something for the anniversary of the war's end
And I remembered our fighter pilot who fought through the ranks of Britain's Royal Air Force in World War II.
The design was liked by the city's leadership,” said Vacek, who finished his work after a fortnight of intensive work.
He consumed roughly 300 litres of paint and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplích-Šanov.
He left town when he was 15 years old.
During the war, due to his Jewish ancestry, the Nazis dragged him to an internment camp, where they held him for several weeks.
However, he and his brother managed to avoid a concentration camp thanks to Nicholas Winton's organization.
In 1939, Taussig reached the UK, where he voluntarily joined the Royal Air Force (RAF), and afterwards underwent pilot training in African Southern Rhodesia and Palestine.
He became involved in combat operations in early 1945.
After the Velvet Revolution, he visited both Czech Republic and his native Teplice several times, which granted him honorary citizenship.
The 46-year-old Kamil Vacek, who is known by people in the street graphic art business by the nickname Camo, has been working with sprays in warm streets for over 20 years.
He started with graffiti on surfaces set aside for these purposes by the then Mayor Jaroslav Kubera (ODS).
Sparta is really loaded this year, recognizes Hradec bek Nedomlel
In his case, the increased motivation is more than understandable. Hradec's hockey defender Richard Nedomlel will go in Friday's game against the club where he worked recently. But the former Spartan is convinced that his team-mates will also be on it, even though they have never dressed the jersey of the Prague club.
“Against Sparta, everyone wants to pull themselves out,” says Hradecký bek before the 5th Extraliga round match.
Hradec Králové will try to stretch his series of wins, which at the moment is three three-point wins in a row. After Kladno, Pilsen came to the most appreciated fans on Sunday, Mountfield went to neighbouring Pardubice.
“But we can't watch the matches they were. We need to concentrate on the matches that await us now and play in them as well, if not better,” points out the Hradec defender.
Nor should the Hradec look back on last year's balance with Sparta. They lost in three of the four games, taking points only once after winning in Prague after extra time. In addition, Sparta's management has brought in several distinctive moribents over the summer and expects a return from the team among the top.
“Sparta have always had quality players but what we'll talk about, they're really charged this year,” admits Nedomlel ahead of the first game of the end of this week.
And the other one? Also nice shaking, waiting at Mountfield on Sunday afternoon in Třinec.
XXX Lutz can buy competitor Kika, the bureau allowed. It's got a catch
“The Competition Protection Authority authorised, on condition of compliance with the structural obligations set out in favour of maintaining effective competition, the merger of competitors - XLCEE- Holding GmbH on the one hand, and Kika Furniture and Lambda Properties Czechia on the other hand,” said IOHS spokesman Martin Švanda.
XLCEE- Holding, in addition to the XXX Lutz chain, owns Möbelix stores. If it absorbed even the Kika chain, it would occupy too much of the Czech furniture and accessories market. Therefore, part of the company being bought must divest.
XLCEE-holding buys Kika branches in other countries where the chain operates, namely Hungary, Slovakia and Romania. There, too, antitrust authorities must allow the transaction. The purchase of 22 foreign branches of the Kika chain from Signa holding was announced by XXX Lutz in May. Signa took over the failing Kika last year at a symbolic price.
The Kika chain entered the Czech market in 2005 and is deuce after Swedish firm IKEA. Before it was taken over by Austrian company Signa, it belonged to South African firm Steinhoff International Holdings since 2013. The latter faced problems when it exposed discrepancies in its accounting. Kika has nine stores in the Czech Republic.
XXX Lutz has been active in the Czech Republic since 2010. In addition to IKEA, Sconto, Jysk or Asko-Furniture and Kika, it is one of the largest furniture retailers on the domestic market. The Möbelix brand has the same owner. After taking over Kika's foreign branches, XXX Lutz will already operate over 300 department stores in 12 countries. According to the company's website, its annual turnover is 4.4 billion euros (about 114 billion CZK).
Storm Hanna reached Texas coast
Hurricane Hanna on Saturday afternoon local time (before midnight CEST night to today) arrived on the southwest coast of the U.S. state of Texas.
It struck Texas's Padre Island, roughly 24 kilometres north of the small town of Port Mansfield, and weakened to a tropical storm on its move over land.
But it nevertheless poses a major danger to coastal residents, according to meteorologists.
Indeed, it brought with it strong winds and intense rainfall; along with local flooding, power cuts and various material damage, among other damaged ships, are reported, according to the AP agency.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott had already declared a state of natural disaster for 32 counties in southwest Texas on Saturday and recommended people voluntary evacuation.
The strongest warning was received by people from the coastal strip between Port Mansfield and Mesquite Bay, in total it has but the element to hit a territory almost 500 kilometres long before gradually moving above northeastern Mexico.
“Although Hanna is now a tropical storm, heavy rain and winds, level rises, dangerous surf and isolated tornadoes can pose threats,” the US National Hurricane Center warned ( NHC).
This morning local time (afternoon CEST), the storm was moving in the area of the US-Mexican border and was accompanied by winds of 85 kilometres per hour.
Hanna on Saturday became the first hurricane of this year's hurricane season in the Atlantic region.
It was accompanied by winds of up to 145 kilometres per hour over the Gulf of Mexico, but it gradually weakened to 112 kilometres per hour as it progressed to land, bringing Hanna out of the hurricane category again discarded.
Authorities urged locals to weather the storm at home, oblivious to the hygiene measures associated with preventing the spread of coronavirus.
Texas is among those U.S. states that the covid-19 disease pandemic plagues the most.
Given existing security measures and the need to comply with stand-off clearances, eventual evacuations are also a major challenge.
Makeshift shelters were opened in hotels, schools and gyms.
In Hidalgo County, Texas, one of the buildings was also set up as shelter after evacuees who tested positive for coronavirus or were exposed to the disease in other ways.
Local authorities urged all evacuees to take their guise and disinfectant gels with them to shelter if possible.
“We don't have it nearly behind us yet.
We expect catastrophic flooding,” the AP agency quoted Chris Birchfield, who works for the National Weather Service (NWS) service in the city of Brownsville, as saying.
Forecasters claim that in some places, up to 300 millimetres of rainfall could rain in just a few hours, in some cases nearly 500 millimetres, which would go along with a rise in levels the sea may have flooded a number of settlements on the coast.
Toyota Hydrogen Still Believes Preparing Second Generation of Mirai
The Toyota Mirai was never meant to be just a kind of concept. Toyota was so serious about her that even though there was virtually no hydrogen pumping infrastructure in the world, it nevertheless put it on offer. So not quite standard, the customer had to really purposefully go after this car, but no one else offered such a variant at the time.
Toyota boss Takeshi Uchiyamada confirmed at an international hydrogen conference that a new generation will arrive next year. Indeed, Toyota still believes that these cars have a future and will be priced to hybrids within a decade. Of course, this is linked to the development of pumping networks. But the future is as much associated with hydrogen as it is with electricity.
In fact, the conference often inflected the word hydrogen with the needs of eco-operation not of passenger cars, but on the contrary of large tractors, boats, trains, etc. Just those means of transport that need to overcome on one refueling long distance. This purely cordless versions can not offer. Toyota could thus find new outlets through great experience and long development.
It remains to be reminded that, like Toyota, it trusts hydrogen-powered Hyundai, which now also offers the Nexo hydrogen crossover.

Zeman bestows general rank to Colonel Lipka
President Milos Zeman will lend the general rank to Colonel Pavel Lipka on Wednesday.
It follows from a review of expected events by the Ministry of Defence.
The reason for bestowing the rank of brigadier general is Lipka's August ascension to the post of deputy commander of the Alliance Multi-National Division Northeast in Poland.
Lipka still serves as Deputy Commander of the Land Forces of the Czech Army.
Promotion to Zeman at the end of June was proposed by the government
Lipka from the beginning of August will replace Brigadier General Karel Řehka as Deputy Commander of the Northeast Multi-National Division in Elblag, Poland, which commands the units of the alliance forward presence in the territory of Poland and the Baltics.
Řehka became director of the National Bureau of Cyber and Information Security (NÚKIB) in March.
The government proposed to the president that he bestow Lipka the rank of brigadier general.
Under the Occupational Soldiers Act, a higher rank may be bestowed upon a soldier for a period of time of execution of an elected office or for the period of performance of a service task that bestowing a higher rank requires.
The post of Deputy Commander of the Alliance Division is the responsibility of a general rank.
The soldier to whom the rank has been bestowed has the same rights and duties as if he had been appointed to that rank.
However, he is not entitled to a salary adjustment that would match the rank.
The granting of rank lasts until the remission of the reason for which it was granted.
“Colonel Lipka demonstrates high professional readiness and is a model for subordinates.
It participates significantly in the performance of the tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic, including cooperation with foreign partners and securing the participation of the military in foreign operations,” it said in June Ministry of Defence to proposal for promotion.
Wednesday's promotion will take place at 12:30 in Prague Castle, and will be attended by Defence Minister Lubomir Metnar or Chief of Staff Ales Opata.
Technically perfect confusion with a weak scenario. Gemini with Will Smith criticisms didn't swell
The dystopian sci-fi spectacle Gemini (Gemini Man) prides itself on an interesting premise - Will Smith faces his younger version in the film. According to critics, though, the story is the weakest part of the film. The film will look to Czech cinemas on 10 October.
Henry Brogan (Will Smith) is a total cutting edge in his field. It kills effectively and without unnecessary questions. One day, though, he decides to hang his career at the nail. That understandably doesn't appeal to his employers, who send another hitman on Henry. The catch is that the killer is Henry himself, more precisely his younger clone created from DNA. Can one determined person manage to win a fight over himself? Literally this time.
Three-time Oscar winner Ang Lee should have been a certain guarantee of quality. It may be his first science fiction, but he has a wealth of experience with dramatic action films, as he demonstrated, for example, in the aforementioned Tiger and Dragon or Western Riding with the Devil. Six screenwriters collaborated on the script. The most famous one is certainly David Benioff, one of the creators of the successful Game of Thrones. According to the first accounts, even this wasn't enough for a good movie.
“Even when Ang Lee tries for big things in technical filmmaking, the film itself doesn't have enough character to bring it up,” thinks Fionnuala Hannigan of Screen Daily's server.
“This disappointing film is less than the sum of all the talents involved in it. Only the technological magic of filmmakers hold together,” Stephen Dalton of The Hollywood Reporter magazine summarized his opinion.
“Gemini is a case in which a huge amount of work has resulted in an impossibly tired action movie,” Variety server reviewer Peter Deburge does not hide disillusionment.
“A confused product made up with a bizarre idea,” Ella Kemp of the website IndieWire summarized the film in her review.
“It's hard to be interested in one man being another's doppelganger when neither one behaves like a human,” wrote Nicholas Barber of The Wrap website.

Hundreds of enslaved children freed from religious school in Nigeria
According to the BBC station, there were nearly five hundred men and boys, the Reuters agency, citing the police commissioner, said there were over three hundred children from the age of five above. Some were handcuffed with chains to each other; others were chained to iron circles in the wall.
Kaduna police chief Ali Janga told the BBC that the raid at the school was carried out on the basis of the denunciation. He labeled the school a house of horror. Starved people there were held by violence, tortured and sexually abused. They couldn't leave, there was razor wire above the walls. According to him, this is a case of slavery.
Several people were detained in the raid, according to police spokesman Jakubu Saboa.
The children told police they were taken to school by parents or relatives, saying it was a religious school. “We have identified two children who come from Burkina Faso, but most have been brought here by parents from Nigerian states in the north,” a Sabo spokesman said on the identities of the victims. Nigerian states in the north of the country are predominantly Muslim.
Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal's school was posing as a religious school focused on the study of the Koran.
The freed were taken to the stadium where they are provided with help and food. Some have already met relatives.
The planet's fastest man missed tests. I'm not taking anything, defending myself
The traditionally much-watched duel for the planet's fastest man will be a hunt for defending silverware Christian Coleman at the World Championships. The 23-year-old American is the world table leader with a time of 9.81 seconds and has only lost once this year. But his start at the top of the season was in jeopardy because of the caucuses with missed doping exams.
The US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) closed his case in early September without pressing charges due to formal reasons. Coleman did not take three doping exams last year and this year, but not within 12 months. In fact, his first wrongdoing was dated back by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to 1 April 2018, the beginning of the second quarter, but he did not miss the test itself until 6 June. And since the third omission occurred on April 29, 2019, Coleman did not commit wrongdoing in the form of three uncarried checks within 12 months.
Coleman defended himself that he merely forgot to update the data in the app about athletes' whereabouts. “I don't do drugs, nor do I take anything legal. A lot of athletes take legal creatine or protein powder or various other supplements for faster regeneration. And I don't take anything, I work hard and that's what it's about,” he declared before the start of MS.
He suffered his only defeat from six starts this year on a hundred straight away entering the season at the Diamond League in Shanghai, where he was outscored by just six thousandths of a second by compatriot Noah Lyles. The latter used Coleman's absence to triumph in the Diamond League final, but he will run only a two-hundred at Worlds.
Paper's second fastest competitor, with a performance of 9.86, is the 22-year-old Nigerian Divine Oduduuru, who has done so far only at US university competitions.
Defending the title will already be 37-year-old American Justin Gatlin, who flashed a time of 9.87 at Stanford in June. He ran the last hundred in Zagreb but only 10.29 because he slightly injured his back thigh muscle.
Also included in the circuit of favourites are South African Akani Simbine, three-time Olympic medallist from Rio Andre de Grasse or European champion Zharnel Hughes. The fastest Jamaican, with a time of 9.96, is 2011 world champion Yohan Blake.
The men's hundred will start the pre-round and run-ups on Friday. Semifinals and finals are on the agenda Saturday. The medals will be run at 21:15 CEST.
EU countries have coronavirus standards for aviation
European Union countries have agreed common hygiene standards for plane travel to help curb the spread of the new coronavirus.
It was announced by German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer.
Among the agreed standards is compliance with the stand-off or wearing of guise on both the aircraft and at the airport, but the middle seats on planes will not have to remain unoccupied.
Reuters reported on this.
“I am pleased that my colleagues accepted the German proposal for Europe and that we could agree on these uniform standards,” Scheuer said at the European Aviation Conference.
The German transport ministry then added that officials had made the deal and that it had yet to be formally approved by ministers.
The measures agreed include a requirement to cover one's mouth and nose for passengers as young as six, observe a recommended stand-off during security checks and check-in at the airport.
Aircraft must also be guaranteed enough fresh air and all information must be available in several languages.
The airline also will be able to occupy middle seats as well.
The common regulations agreed to by officials meet at least some of the airline's requirements.
Indeed, the differing standards were causing confusion.

Soldiers rehearse, pull down the curtains. China prepares celebrations at massacre site
The army rehearsed during recent weekends. Shops in central Beijing had to close and residents near the square were ordered to pull the curtains. Along the emptied streets, military cars rolled toward the square, and combat aircraft circled the sky.
Several Chinese told Reuters that they were proud that their country would put its military might on display. But one woman said it was hard to deny that the celebrations would unsettle other states.
She was apparently alluding to Taiwan, which China claims and where elections are looming. But there may also be concerns in the semi-autonomous city of Hong Kong, in which thousands of people repeatedly demonstrate against the China-based caretaker.
Celebrations are being prepared outside Beijing as well. The southern Chinese port of Xiamen had already put on a special light show on Thursday night. Xiamen lies across from island Taiwan and is among China's ten most innovative cities.
Ahead of the anniversary, there is a growing list of forbidden things. It already has drones, balloons, kites, alcohol, walkie-talkies and equipment using radio waves, The Guardian newspaper warned. He added that Weibo, a popular Chinese social network, erases “damaging political information.”
“It's another milestone, another opportunity to show that the Chinese Communist Party remains (at the oar) despite all the predictions,” said historian Maura Cunningham, who covers China. “It's a moment when the party can demonstrate order, control and power,” she added.
The People's Republic of China was formed in 1949 when the Communists led by Mao Zedong won in a fight with Chiang Kai-shek's nationalists who retreated to Taiwan.
In the second half of the 1960s, China underwent a disastrous communist experiment in the form of the so-called Cultural Revolution. In June 1989, Tiananmen Square regime massacred thousands of pro-democracy protesters from among students and workers alike.
Since the late 1970s, China has increasingly taken on elements of the capitalist economy. According to critics, it is now a mixture of the worst of communism (one-party monopoly and persecution of opposition) as well as (Dickens) capitalism (exploitation of workers).

Trump considering cancelling US Chinese shares registration
US President Donald Trump's administration is considering revoking Chinese firms permits to trade on stock markets in the United States. An informed source told Reuters today. Such a move would be a radical escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Shares of concerned firms on the New York Stock Exchange immediately headed down after the report, dragging the entire market with them.
The stock withdrawal would be part of a broader effort to curb U.S. investment in China, the source added. He thus confirmed a Bloomberg agency report that sparked a shock in financial markets shortly before. Shares of Chinese firms Alibaba Group Holding, JD.com, Pinduoduo, Baidu, Vipshop Holdings, Baozun and IQIYI were losing from two to four percent.
According to government data from February, shares of 156 Chinese firms are trading on the Nasdaq and NYSE US exchanges. There are also at least 11 state-owned enterprises among them.
Bloomberg cautioned that an exact mechanism had not yet been worked out to ensure the withdrawal of Chinese firms' shares from US exchanges. The eventual plan would have to be approved by Trump, who but gave negotiations on the matter the green light.
China and the US have been waging a trade war for more than a year, imposing tariffs on each other. The two countries' dispute is having negative effects on the world economy and raising fears of a recession for the global economy. Washington, using customs fees, is trying to get Beijing to change trade practices and reduce China's surplus in trading with the US.
According to CNBC television server, US-China trade talks are expected to resume on October 10. His goal is to end the trade war.
Former French president Chiraco will bury on Monday; public pieta will be on Sunday
The funeral of former French President Jacques Chirac, who died on Thursday at 86, will take place Monday night at Paris's Montparnasse cemetery. French media outlets report on this, citing Chirac's family. The ceremony will be private.
The public will be able to say goodbye to the former head of state on Sunday afternoon at a piet in Paris's Invalides, where a coffin with Chirac's remains will be displayed, the Elysee Palace announced.
Crowds of people have been streaming into the presidential mansion since Thursday evening, according to AFP agency. That will be possible until Sunday. Then, for Monday, President Emmanuel Macron declared state mourning.
Meanwhile, from the world and France come further reactions to the deaths of the former mayor of Paris and president from 1995 to 2007, whom Prime Minister Édouard Philippe today described as “French in the right sense of the word”.
Chiraca was recalled by the Japanese, for example, as the politician was known for his love for their country and the sport of sumó. News of the former French president's death appeared on the front pages of all Japanese dailies, including sports ones, the French press noted.
The Tribal Art Museum at Paris' Quai Branly Avenue, which Chirac founded, will not collect admission fees for ten days in honor of the former head of state.
Temperature record fell on Arctic Spitsbergen, measured nearly 22 degrees there
“A 41-year-old record has fallen in Longyearbyen,” the Norwegian Meteorological Institute said on Twitter.
In the early evening, temperatures there soared to 21.7 degrees Celsius, breaking the 1979 record by 0.4 degrees, he added.
Roughly two-thousand-long Longyearbyen is the largest city in Spitsbergen, located about 1300 kilometers from the North Pole.
Svalbard heats up faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This fact highlights the dangers arising from warming other ends of the Arctic - from Alaska to Siberia, last year's report by the Norwegian Centre for Climate Study said.
The average temperature in Spitsbergen, he says, has risen by three to five degrees since the 1970s.
By 2100, it can rise even ten degrees unless the greenhouse gas discharge into the atmosphere is reduced.
Temperature rises may result in the melting of eternally frozen soil in Svalbard, which will threaten the stability of many buildings, roads or airports and may cause greater avalanches and landslides.
Climate warming also threatens Arctic fauna, such as polar bears or seals, which depend on the ocean's ice cover.
Failed qualification. Czech Athletes Fail Yet in Doha
The World Championships in Doha started for Czech athletics with qualifying setbacks. Diana Mezuliáníková dropped out in the run-up to the 800 metres and did not qualify for pole Romana Maláčová or hammer Kateřina Šafránková, defending eighth place, which she surprised last year in London.
The run-up on Friday will be completed by hurdler Vit Müller and Marcela Joglová will run the night marathon race.
Šafránková threw 65.46 metres in her third attempt and fell nearly six metres behind her maximum this year, which she would have to improve to advance. Maláčová jumped 435 cm, 450 cm was already above her strength. To participate in the final, the limit of 460 cm had to be lowdown.
Inter-Services, who only reached the championship at the last minute thanks to an invitation from the IAAF International Federation, finished fourth on the penultimate sixth straight with no time of 2:03 .48 minutes her to advance to the semifinals was not enough. She fell behind her highs this year by one and a half seconds. 'It was pretty quick on me, unfortunately I was fighting there in the turn with my opponent, which pretty much brushed me off my strength. I thought I still had the powers, but that's where it hampered me. I almost stopped and had to break again, so in this one it was a bit uncomfortable. I can't be completely satisfied,” the Czech representative said.
She was happy to overtake at least one female opponent in the finish straight. “She really wasn't well off, so every losing opponent was good. But I think it was for fifth place. Unfortunately,” she added. The fastest halfback in the run-ins was Winnie Nanyond of Uganda in 2:00 .36.
Missing in Doha is the best eight-woman woman of recent years, Caster Semenya of JAR, who has too high testosterone levels in her body, but like some other runners, she refuses the treatment she has this year mandates IAAF rules.
In the 100 metres runs, the number one favourite was confirmed by American Christian Coleman, who came under the ten-second mark with a time of 9.98 as the only one. His compatriot Justin Gatlin, who is aiming for his title defence at 37, also advanced to the semi-finals. The Nigerian Divine Oduduuru, who is deuce of this year's table with a performance of 9.86 and was expected to see his showdown with Coleman, who has a performance of 9.81 this season.
He showed great form already in the qualification of the long-distance Qualifying Cuban Juan Miguel Echevarría, who took the first jump to 840 cm. No athlete has jumped that far in MS qualifiers in the last 20 years. The 21-year-old Cuban leads this year's tables with a performance of 865cm.
Berlin is responding to public pressure and tackling the housing crisis. From private firm buys 6000 apartments
Berlin will buy back 6000 former social apartments the city sold 15 years ago from private Luxembourg firm ADO Properties SA for €920 million (£23.8 billion). It thus responds to pressure from the public rebelling against rocket-rising rent prices. According to Berlin Senator Katrin Lompscher for the Left Party (Die Linke), it is the largest ever such buyout in the history of the German capital. The opposition criticizes the move.
“The intention is to keep rents stable in Berlin and give tenants security,” Berlin Mayor Michael Müller (SPD) said in a statement. “At the same time, we will continue to build new apartments and legally treat the rent freeze,” he added. The municipal firm Gewobag will take over thousands of apartments located in the Spandau and Reinickendorf neighborhoods in the western part of the city this December.
According to Jefferies analyst Thomas Rothäusler, the city bought too dearly. He told Bloomberg agency Rothäusler that, by his estimate, housing units overpaid by about ten percent above their book value.
According to Germany's opposition party, the liberals (FDP) Berlin authorities are contributing to real estate speculation through their course of action. The FDP put it on Twitter on Friday. The move was branded a “waste of money” by the Alternative for Germany (AfD) protest party.
By mid-July, Gewobag had recovered 670 apartments in Berlin's Karl-Marx-Allee street, recalled the weekly Der Spiegel on its website. The award was not disclosed by the council at the time. Controversy over apartments on a former exhibition class from the days of the GDR accompanied protests and filled the front pages of the German press. He became a symbol of the plight of tenants in major German cities, the paper wrote.
Meanwhile, the German metropolis used to be renowned for low cost of living and low rents. In recent years, though, it has gained on attractiveness. Rent prices have doubled over the past ten years, according to AFP, with some residents finding it difficult to forge affordable housing.
Britons to return from Spain awaits mandatory two-week quarantine
Britain's cabinet also urged citizens to avoid all trips to mainland Spain that are not necessary because of the risk of spreading covid-19 disease.
Thus, the Canary and Balearic Islands are not mentioned, however, even after returning from them, people must enter isolation for two weeks.
The new rules come into effect at midnight.
“Protecting public health is our absolute priority.
We took this decision to prevent the potential spread of the virus in Britain,” British diplomacy said in a statement.
“We have always made it clear that in case there is a need, we will remove a particular country from the list of safe ones immediately,” she added.
As Britain's Metro newspaper noted, the latest announcement will hit the travel plans of thousands of Britons.
Spain is a very popular holiday destination.
Britons, among other things, have concerns about whether they will be paid sick leave in case they have to end up in isolation for 14 days after returning from holidays.
Neil Hunter from the town of Sittingbourne, for example, booked a ten-day holiday to Lanzarote, they were due to depart on Tuesday.
They have a tour ordered from Dec.
'We had the whole family going, my wife Amanda and daughter Bethany, but to be honest, after this announcement I don't know what's going to happen.
I work as a train driver and I don't think my employer will accede to being quarantined after returning from vacation for two weeks,” the Metro newspaper quoted Hunter as saying.
In the context of Spain, there are concerns that the country is at the beginning of a second wave of epidemic.
Over the last two days there have always been over 900 newly infected in 24 hours.
Authorities in some areas are already tightening coronavirus measures, such as Catalonia is trying to restrict all nightlife, preventing people from coming together in bulk.
The Czech Foreign Ministry has newly drawn attention to the increased risk of the disease in Catalonia, Aragon, the Basque Country and the Madrid region.
Czechs or children are forgotten. ČOI exposed discrimination in restaurants
These included, for example, misinforming of prices and non-compliance with the principles of honesty of sales.
In one case of discrimination, a restaurant in Prague refuses to let smaller children into the business. On his site, according to ČOI, he writes that the device is not suitable for children under the age of eight. “On the consumer's electronic question whether it is possible to order a table for four adults and one child of four years of age at the restaurant, the restaurant employee electronically replied that in the restaurant do not accept the presence of children under the age of eight,” added Fröhlich.
In the second case, another Prague company did not want to let Czech-speaking people on the table, while English-speakers allowed it. “Czech-speaking inspectors, in the position of a consumer, were not allowed to sit down at the table in the restaurant and make the order. English-speaking consumers were allowed to do this,” a spokesman for ČOI described the situation.
Both cases are now being dealt with in administrative proceedings. Because they are not yet conclusively terminated, the spokesman for the inspection could not disclose any closer information on the restaurants mentioned.
But discrimination only emerged at a very small proportion of restaurants inspected in the second quarter. In total, ČOI carried out 139 checks. In addition to the two discrimination cases mentioned, it revealed other misconduct in 64 cases. Mostly these were shortcomings in compliance with the principles of honesty sales and failure to inform the consumer about the prices of products and services in accordance with regulations.
Already on Wednesday, the inspection reported on cases of discrimination against foreigners at two restaurants in Prague, Clock Caffé and Café Restaurant. In both establishments, foreigners were charged sums higher than Czech-speaking clients. In these cases, final fines of 60,000 kronor have already fallen.
Model of electricity buyout from Dukovan to be discussed by the government
The government on Monday will discuss a model to buy out electricity from the planned new block of the Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant.
The bill reckons that if the feed-in price is higher than the price of power electricity on the market, the difference will be paid by all consumers through tariffs.
In the latter case, when the feed-in price will be below the market price, the impact on consumers will be the opposite.
Power electricity is the unregulated part of the final price of electricity for customers.
Vice Premier and Industry Minister Karel Havlicek (for ANO) and the energy company CEZ have previously said that the more likely option is that people will save for electricity by building.
Analysts, on the other hand, caution that the long-term outlook for electricity prices in the markets is always uncertain, something developments have shown several times in the past.
The intent has previously been criticised by environmental organisations.
“The feed-in price can be both below and above the market price of power electricity.
Thus, the final impact at the time of applicability of the rule can be both negative and positive.
The impact will be spread among customers according to the size of the circuit breaker - at lower consumption or by electricity consumption - at higher electricity consumption,” the Ministry of Industry said in the material documents and trade (MPO).
Havlicek stated in May that he projected that the wholesale price of electricity would rise and people on the Dukovan construction would earn.
Otherwise, the impact will be in the tens of kronor per year per family, which he says is far less than people pay each year in electricity invoices to support so-called supported resources.
He has previously estimated that the feed-in price could be between 50 to 60 euro (about 1320 to 1600 CZK) per megawatt-hour (MWh).
The material presented does not contain any draft amount, it is to be contained only in the buyout agreement.
The price of electricity at the Prague Energy Exchange for 2021, for which traders now share the most, is currently around 45 euros (about 1190 CZK) per MWh.
“With a difference in the feed-in tariff and the market price of power electricity of ten euros, the balance of the average household with consumption of 3,3 MWh per year could be equivalent to a household of four, standard equipped with electrical appliances including electric hob and oven, which, however, does not use electricity for heating and hot water heating - less than 100 CZK/year,” wrote in the documents for the MPO government.
“We live in a hugely turbulent time.
The coronavirus pandemic has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term prediction of market prices to be a very speculative matter,” said ČTK previously managing director of the investment group Energy financial group Tomáš Voltr.
The proposed law reckons that the buyout would be carried out by the MPO, respectively, the state-owned legal entity, at a predetermined price.
A contract between the investor and the State guaranteeing the terms of the purchase of electricity would be concluded for a minimum of 30 years, with a possible extension of ten years, even repeated, but the longest until termination the operation of low-carbon production.
It defines a low-carbon generating design as a nuclear reactor power generating plant connected to an electrification system with an installed capacity of a minimum electrical output of 100 megawatts (MW ) after 2030.
Havlicek previously stated that the new Dukovan block should have a capacity of 1200 MW and produce nine terawatt-hours of electricity annually, equivalent to a tenth of the expected Czech consumption.
The block is expected to be commissioned in 2036.
The funding model for the new Dukovan bloc was approved by the government on Monday.
The facility should be financed by the state during construction at no rate, with 2 percent interest in operation.
The opposition does not agree with the financing model, it also bothers the possibility of Russian or Chinese firms building Dukovans.
The state should participate in the construction 70 percent.
The rest should be paid by CEZ, which will also cover all possible additional costs.
CEZ CEO Daniel Beneš told ČTK in May that the expected sum for building the block at current prices was roughly six billion euros (approximately 162 billion kronor).
Contracts between the state and CEZ on the construction of the new Dukovan block will be signed on Tuesday.
In the underground of the CSA mine in Karviná was burning, no one was injured
The CSA Mine in Karviná was burning this morning. The cause of the fire is not yet known. However, no one was injured, Ivo Čelechovský, a spokesman for the mining company, said for ČTK.
The fire broke out at 04:25 in a fault at a depth of about 1200 metres. “Nothing happened to any of the staff, no one was hurt. Banese rescuers immediately intervened on the scene, who destroyed the fire with direct action and conducted a field search. The workplace was immediately closed and made inaccessible,” the spokesman said. The exact cause of the fire will now be established by a special commission.
In the former Ostrava-Karvinsky rev, coal is already mined only in the Karvinian part, namely in the CSA, Lazy, Darkov, ČSM-North and ČSM-South mines. At Dole Lazy, mining should end this year, and the gradual downturn awaits other mines. The mining company OKD is the only producer of black coal in the Czech Republic, its last year production was 4.62 million tonnes. There are 9000 people working in the mines.
Brno Grand Prix? Threatening tickets
The most expensive item is the award fee before the Grand Prize every year. This year was about one hundred and fifteen million crowns. “The mass of people who come to Brno during the Grand Prix will spend money there on accommodation, food or entertainment, which should more or less balance the costs associated with organizing the event, including the award fee, evaluated by economist Petr Pelc.
According to him, the importance of the race is also in attracting tourists to the city. “Brno doesn't have so many world tourist attractions. The grand prize there attracts visitors from abroad as well. It is important for Brno as well as, for example, the Tuřany Airport or the Exhibition Centre. And these are projects that get supported from public money,” the economist added.
Brno Grand Prix
- cost over the past five years: 686 million kroner
- profits from the past five years: 682 million kroner
- problem: lack of money for organizing, increasing fee for promoter company Dorna
- possible solution: more money from the state, use of the advertising area, increase the price of tickets
- current status: negotiations on a new contract to organize races for another five years
According to the director of the Institute of Public Administration, Filip Hrůza, organizers now have to evaluate whether the plant is advantageous for Brno. “The Grand Prix sucks money from public budgets for other matters. To some extent, though, it's a political and not an economic issue,” he thinks.
In the future, the cost of a motorsport event may be even higher. In fact, there is a variant of increasing the rate fee to almost double.
“The situation is not closed, we must try to negotiate the best possible terms with Dorna. It also depends on the extent to which the state is prepared to contribute to hosting the race. If the worst-case scenarios were to be fulfilled, I am afraid that it is not real for the city and the region to pay the amount,” conceded the mayor of Brno, Markéta Vaňková, the mayor of Brno.
As Diary Equality has already reported, representatives of the South Moravian Region and Brno, due to difficulties raising money for the Grand Prize, are also discussing the possibility of using advertising. “Dorna's condition is that advertising must be placed in places that do not occupy cameras. Also limited is the choice of companies, because if Dorna has a general sponsor, then a company from the same area cannot be the second sponsor,” Vaňková explained.
Promoters can also get more money from tickets in the next years. “We have to sit down and say what the cost is actually going to be. And we must adapt to the revaluation of tickets,” said Brno's opposition representative for the ANO movement and former mayor Petr Vokřál.
Department for Regional Development has withdrawn material on promoting tourism in media for two billion
Material according to which the Ministry for Regional Development (MMR) planned to spend two billion kroner in media, internet and billboards on holiday advertising in the Czech Republic, the office from a reminder proceedings withdrew.
Minister Klara Dostálová (for YES) told the server that the material was still being worked on.
The document in EKLEP (electronic library of legislative process) was brought to the attention of the document in Epravy.cz on Friday.
The Ministry justified the plan with a slump in tourism due to the coronavirus.
During the coronavirus crisis, both revenue and the media experienced a slump.
The proposal drew criticism from both the opposition and tourism representatives.
According to the proposal, which is now available on hlidacstatu.cz, MMR planned to give money through the state tourism promotion agency CzechTourism for advertising on televisions, radio, print, internet, billboards or surfaces at train stations.
The biggest part of the money, and that of 700 million kronor, would receive televisions.
Most would be acquired by private Nova and Prima televisions.
Printed diaries and weeklies would get 400 million, and the same volume would give MMR for PR articles, advertising banners and videos on the website.
Radio stations would receive 350 million for the media campaign, most of it again private stations.
The other 150 million would be used for outdoor advertising on billboards, LED screens and surfaces at train stations or subways.
The campaign to promote tourism in the Czech Republic was scheduled to start in mid-August and last for a year.
“The material is still being worked on, it is certainly not yet in the form that should be presented,” Dostálová said without further details of the ListNews server.
The material was criticised by the opposition, according to TOP 09 chief Marketa Pekarova Adamova, media from Prime Minister Andrei Babiš's trust funds (YES) would profit from advertising.
“I firmly believe that this flamboyant contempt will get a blow between the eyes at the election this fall,” she wrote on Twitter.
Dostal retorts that it is, in fact, about helping crisis-hit media.
'It can also be a coincidence, I don't know anything about media support, 'she told Diary N on Friday.
According to her, the budget of two billion is indicative.
“Of course, we still count it, it may be less and more.
It's working material,” she added.
The Save Tourism initiative makes no sense for a media campaign to promote domestic tourism.
“We want two billion for companies in tourism, not an unnecessary advertising campaign,” Tomáš Barčík, the initiative's chairman, said on Sunday.
If there are two billion crowns in the state budget, they should go to firms, not to the media, the initiative says in an open letter to the government.
The end of political trafics? The new law doesn't help anyway, according to critics!
But according to some opposition MPs, the law is more likely to record ministers getting rid of responsibility for choice while still selecting their candidates.
Greater transparency in tenders for posts at state-owned firms - that's one of the goals of the nomination bill. 119 MPs have spoken out in favour. The law passed, for example, thanks to the votes of YES, the Communist Party, the Social Democrats and even the Pirates.
Candidates for state-owned firms will have to go through a selection process before a government committee. For example, it was the Pirates that sought to make the recommendation to the minister binding. That didn't happen after all.
Citizen Democrats and the SPD movement fear the nomination bill will be taped to ministers. “The minister will be able to hide behind some decision by the commission and will not have clear transparent accountability,” thinks SPD President Tomio Okamura. The vice-president of ODS Martin Kupka speaks similarly.
A government committee should completely reject candidates who will not meet the conditions. These will include criminal integrity, indebtability, a minimum age of 25, and expertise should also be the main criterion of selection.
The bill will still have to pass the Senate, and after that the president will get it for signature.
Automaid brought the voice of the digital soul
Everything you know about obesity is wrong, proclaims the headline of a long text written for the Huffington Post server by Michael Hobbes and photographed by Finlay Mackay. In a provocative retrolight, it then says that the medical community ignored the facts about obesity for decades and waged a fierce (and also unnecessary) war against overweight people that not only noted public opinion, but also ruined a lot of lives. Now, however, is the time for a new paradigm.
What Hobbes puts right to the beginning is the fact that from knowing and knowing facts to putting it into practice often goes a very long and tiring road. He mentions a case of scurvy, when some captains had already given out lemons, limes and oranges to their crew in the seventeenth century, believing that they would prevent disease. However, the British War Navy withdrew from this practice due to fears of increased costs. The clear influence of fruit in the prevention and treatment of the disease was then demonstrated in the middle of the 18th century, but it took another fifty years for the Navy to take this into view. I seatbelts existed long before the invention of the car, but mandatory only began to be in the 1960s, likewise the first confirmed asbestos-related fatality dates from 1906, yet its the first ban came in 1973.
'Every public health discovery - and it doesn't matter how significant it was - has always had to compete with traditions, prejudice and financial stimulus within the society into which it was to be implemented ,” Hobbes writes. In American society, nearly 80 percent of the adult population and around one-third of children now meet the definition of being overweight or obesity. More Americans now live with obesity than with breast cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and HIV combined.
Meanwhile, obesity is viewed as an eminently personal failure of an individual who is claimed to be burdening health care and reducing GDP. The fear of thickness is so great in the population that Americans now spend more money on diets than they put out on computer games and movies. But the truth is that diets don't work. As early as 1959, research showed that 95 to 98% of attempts to lose weight end in failure, and two-thirds of people on diets subsequently gain more than they lost.
Armed with statistics, Hobbes further describes the lifestyles and traumas of overweight people. Personal is here with systemic, where, for example, in the faculties of teaching future doctors, the issue of nutrition is only 19 hours from the entire study. Which at a time when the 60 process of calories Americans accept comes from ultra-processed food - that is, overly processed food.
How obesity is stigmatised is, in turn, illustrated by reports from offices where overweight people typically experience shorter checkups, doctors approach them with less empathy and view them as more problematic patients.
But being overweight is far from just an American problem, as Hobbes writes, Since 1980, the proportion of obesity in 73 countries worldwide has doubled, rising in 113. And in that time, no country has managed to shrink and stop the increase. Totally none.
Simona Krain: Fuck the Age! Then she kissed Lucia White!
The day before the christening of the Fuck The Age calendar (in translation M*dat age) Simona Krain posted her last photos of her being completely nude! “I was a little worried about people denouncing me, taking pictures of myself naked at my age. I'm a pretty shy person. But so far I have only positive reactions. I wanted to show women that when she wants to, it goes even at 46 to have a solid figure. Of course there is a slog and renunciation behind it, but it can't be done otherwise.”
“Lukas Dvorak and I took about three thousand photos, picked about a hundred and there are twelve in the calendar, so the rest are still waiting for their moment. It's definitely not the last time I'm naked,” the model confided in Lightning, who even at her christening came very exposed.
She was wearing an elongated Bernhardt blazer and shorts underneath that could not be seen, so it looked like she had forgotten the bottom. Daily jogging has hardened her legs and so she can afford similar models.
Simona took such joy in success that she kissed at the baptism of everyone she met. Husband, friends, even Slavica Lucie Bílá.
Broth of life, cock beers and death like a blade of grass
Posthumous is also the third album titled A Death is a blade of grass by Brno poet, tireless organizer of cultural activities and publisher Jaroslav Erik Frič, who also left a year ago, 24. May.
In Friča's discography it is the fifth item and, like the previous titles, the main emphasis is on Friča's poetry, which he is himself an excellent artist.
Frič, 1949, was understandably influenced by the American beat generation, but he also inspired this inspiration through his own, distinctively served experiences and also very intrinsic expressions of faith.
However, he was left with some agitation on the hunt, if he spoke or wrote about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, non-aggressive, completely tolerant.
I can think of Bohuslav Reynek in this context (in contrast to Jan Zahradníček), the masters are forgiven.
Friča's album offers records of the author's reading from 2006, as well as performances with musicians who have always accompanied it very sensitively, whether it was celist Josef Kelek or Honza Bartoň and Vizzslav Holata.
I will help - like - in the words of Ostrava poet Petr Hruška about Friča's long poetry compositions.
“There was a proud and never-ending bitterness of them,” Pear writes, “over the state of our world threatened with extinction.
A world increasingly sinking into numbing consumerist vanity and raking, it is increasingly moving away from what its soul was made of - from the mysteries of faith, humility and human closeness.
There was a statement of one who knows that the values for which he was created are of little interest, but who also knows that only because of general disinterest, they cannot be renounced.
Those poems were a reminder that one might have to lose everything dear, but it is not immaterial in which way it will lose.
If he sells out to general decline, he skeptically resigns, falls silent, or stays quiet until the last moment in a calm and proud insistence on what he believes and what he loves.”

Paroubek is not my adviser, Hamáček said
Former prime minister and chairman of the Czech Republic Jiri Paroubek is not a paid social democracy adviser.
Party Chairman and Interior Minister Jan Hamáček only communicates with him and reads his views and articles.
Hamáček said it on the Prima Partie TV show today.
Paroubek should be Hamáčka's advisor reported on Friday the server Seizprvy.cz.
“We write an essay from time to time, he sends me some material occasionally and I read it,” Hamacek said today.
He added that it was nonetheless not an official and paid collaboration.
The SSD doesn't have the resources to waste them on similar purposes, according to him.
“That I occasionally read his opinion, so people like that are a lot,” he said.
In a follow-up discussion with ODS MP Jana Černochová, the minister said that many ODS members still “uncovered listen to the views of Václav Klaus”.
It's fine, according to him, because this is an experienced politician and a former chairman of the party, which is also the case for Paroubko.
The fact that the media is making an affair out of it marked this year's cucumber season mark.
The server Dizprvy.cz wrote on Friday that Paroubek fulfils the role of Hamáček's unofficial consultant.
He also wrote that former chairman of the cell Petr Benda, who is affiliated with Paroubek and served as deputy chairman of his LEV 21 party, was heading to the fourth position of the party's candidate in the Ústí region.
Hamáček said today that the composition of the female candidate would not comment until she was done and approved.

Duplantis has a mile lead, he's a kick in the ass, whitewash Swede's challenger
It is the 22-year-old American pole player who has the ambition and potential to be among the most serious competitors of the new ruler.
He already knows what it's like to beat the two years younger Duplantis, overpowered him to an NCAA university association meet last year.
'We had a battle the year before, that's when he won and I was second, then we threw it through.
In both cases, it was a very good duel,” describes Nilsen, who secured the victory with a performance of 5.95 metres.
But Duplantis has since shot steeply upwards and is currently found alone in the highest pole spheres.
In just 20, he became a world recordman, breaking the bar of 6.17 metres this year in Toruń on 8 February, an inch added still in Glasgow a week later.
“He was jumping six metres already at 18 when he finished high school,” recalls his peer Nilsen for the World Athletics website.
“It was clear that once he matured from boy into man, he would make all his potential and talent tenfold.
Twenty years is a pretty good age to jump a world record,” he believes.
As much as Nilsen's account of achievements is thinner about knowledge than the one Duplantis prides himself on, the American sets similar goals.
He has hinted at his options so far at the NCAA races he has won regularly, this February he improved his indoor personal record to 5.93 m. Last August, he won a gold medal at one of them Pan American Games in Lima, already in 2017 he fought his way to the American quest to the World Championship, where he finished 13th.
The closest milestone then for him is to taste the Diamond League for the first time.
“It's definitely my priority to get on the professional circuit and race as much as possible in the Diamond League because that's where you can make a name for yourself,” he realises.
“When you can succeed at this level, you can undoubtedly do the same at events such as the Olympics, the World Championships or the Pan American Games.”
Because of the pandemic, though, these peak holidays are being postponed, giving Nilsen and the other bars time to improve.
But will that be enough to catch up with Duplantis, who lightly can turn the under-five circle race into a mere duel for silver?
“Everyone is trying to catch up to him, but I don't think it will be possible any time soon,” Nilsen ponders.
“That kid has been jumping for 16 years and he's got a mile edge over everyone else in training.”
And before Tokyo 2021 starts, he'll want to increase it.
Scientists are looking into their study for toddlers with a birth defect, so-called valgosity of the ankles
Valgosity (drain) of the ankles is a birth defect that affects five to ten percent of children. By default, it is treated with intensive exercise. Scientists are trying to help these children even more, so they have developed special shoes that should significantly accelerate the treatment.
'We have two prototypes of shoes that will be worn by both healthy children and children diagnosed to map the effect in both groups. Participation in research will have no risks for children and measurements will be completely painless,” explains Marta Gimun, head of research from MU's Faculty of Sports Studies.
Parents of both groups of children can report to the study via the web, where the registration form and all the information is available.
Scientists are looking for fifty children diagnosed and fifty children healthy. Of each group, half will always wear health shoes and half will not.
“The moment when parents should sign up for their child is when they embark on the first separate steps, typically letting go of, for example, furniture that they hold on to when trying to walk. Participation in the research includes three measurements within seven months of the child's first steps, each lasting about 20 minutes, half of the participants also includes wearing tested shoes,” points out Gimun.
Opening of Pumpkin World delayed pumpkin ripening
Nová Ves u Leština (Havlíčkobrodsko) - The farmhouse in Nová Vsi near Leština in Havlíčkobrodsk opened today for more than a month. Decorations made up of thousands of freshly harvested pumpkins are ducked in the garden by a massive orange pyramid. The autumn event, which is becoming a tradition, starts a week later this year as pumpkins on the surrounding seven hectares of Pipkova family fields have matured longer. There are still a lot of them in the field, Jaroslava Pipková told ČTK today.
The Pipks grow many types of pumpkins, but the last two years have not wanted the weather. This year's harvest has been delayed and some species have not worked out. “As usual, we have plenty of orange pumpkins for Halloween, but some species have not been done for fairies,” Pipková said. Even so, several species can be chosen on the farmhouse, from the already mentioned large pumpkins suitable for carving and eating decorations through hokaido cooking pumpkins or elongated “spaghetti” to ornamental gourds of different colors and shapes.
Cultivation of pumpkins is laborious. Farmers hand dig plants and harvest their fruits, snipping away from the stem of the pumpkin with scissors. Pumpkin World have been opening regularly since 2010, past vintages have attracted thousands of people. Decoration made of pumpkins is complemented by attractions made of straw or maze made of logs. Visitors will also see animals kept on the farmhouse. It will be open daily until 3 November.
Details for the event are on the farm's Web site, where growers also offer some recipes for pumpkin dishes, like pumpkin muffins or juice. About other options for finishing pumpkin in the kitchen are told by visitors themselves. “A lot of cookbooks have tried their recipes, too, we will be inspired,” Pipková said. She noted that some housekeepers pumpkin also load on acid like cucumbers.

Strawberry, plum and invisible. Choose the right shade of lipstick: There's not just one red
Choosing red lipstick, you should first determine whether you are warm or cold type. Try a simple test - look at the veins on your wrist. If they are blue, you are cold type, if green, then you are among the types of warm. Choosing a new red lipstick, in the first place, put just on the layout based on the undertone. In the next one, take a look at the texture.
If you fit women with a cold undertone, then lipsticks in purple, plum, cherry or mauve colors are suitable for you.
If you fall into the category of warm skin undertone, choose such and lipstick. You'll recognize them by gravitating toward orange, coral, gold or brown reflection.
It may happen to you that some veins look green, and others blue. In this case, congratulations - you do not need to look at the undertone, and you can only focus on your color preferences.

Uncombed wants state of 45 million
The Ministry of Justice has received six requests so far in this context, according to Vladimir Řečpka, a spokesman for the office, and is now analyzing them. The young man had been in prison for two years for assaulting a woman, but the justice finally exonerated him.
The invocation in the caucuses was not filed by both the top prosecutor Pavel Zeman and the Minister of Justice Marie Benešová.
The attempted murder of a hairdresser in Hořice happened in February 2013. Hradec's public prosecutor's office indicted him from the then 20-year-old student of Necombed gymnasium. The prosecution alleged that he hit the woman several times in the head with a log and took over ten thousand kroner from her. A seriously injured woman was found by her son, and her life was saved by doctors of Hradec Hospital.
Uncombed from the outset, he dismissed any guilt. “I'm innocent, and I swear by that. I am sincerely sorry for what happened damaged, but I am not that perpetrator,” the youngster said earlier in court, who did not deny that the fateful day was at the hairdresser. He said he wanted to get a haircut. But he left after his wife told him he was already closing. He then turned himself in to police as a witness.
The hairdresser did not recognize him at first as the aggressor during interrogation, but later called Uncombed an attacker. According to court experts, she suffered from memory lapses after the attack.
The Hradec Regional Court successively delivered five verdicts in the case. At first, he pleaded Uncombed guilty twice and imposed him 16 years in prison, the High Court of Appeal reduced his sentence to 13 years. Uncombed, he gradually headed behind bars twice, but each time he went free after the intervention of the Supreme Court. Repeatedly acquittals finally fell after the ordered exchange of the Judicial Chamber, with the last one upheld this March by the High Court.
However, the President of the Board of Appeal, Jiří Lněnička, at the same time, stated that the decision was wrong, but given the procedural situation, he said he had no better option. He said he dismissed the prosecutor's appeal against the acquitting verdict, even though her appeal objections were justified.
'The problem with this thing is not that there is a lack of evidence, but an assessment of them. We consider that a sufficient amount of evidence has been collected in the preparatory proceedings that would be richly sufficient in another criminal case for the recognition of guilt,” Lněnička said.
But the Hradec but also the Supreme Court looked at the caucuses differently, and their opinion would probably not have changed the further annulment of the exempting judgment.

A woman has spent hundreds of thousands on an infirm son's disability pension.
She is awaiting trial
The money the 33 year-old receives from the state as a disability pension is mainly intended to improve his quality of life.
For embezzlement, a woman threatens up to eight years in prison.
Due to poor health, the court deprived the sick man of arbitrary and appointed his mother as a guardian to manage, among other things, his son's money.
“A woman from mid-November 2013 to this January used part of the funds from the son's disability pension for her need and thus deprived him of 440 thousand crowns,” it said Police spokeswoman Dana Ladman, stating that it aggravated the accused woman, that as a guardian she had a separately imposed duty to defend the interests of the aggrieved.
The woman, as instructed by the court, had set up an account for her son, but she had his pension sent to her account.
“After paying the costs associated with the son's stay in a medical facility and reimbursement of necessary medicines, she used the remaining funds for the purchase of the vehicle, electrical appliances and the operation of the household,” stands in the indictment.
That she can't use her son's money for her need, the woman admitted.
But she defended herself by helping with them in paying family expenses.
“We had problems from our income to tighten the running of the household.
We never bought anything above standard.
It was always down to things the purchase of which the son would approve.
I thought of it as family money.
I had no idea I was committing an offence by doing so,” the woman explained to police officers.
She promised to return the money to her son.
North America has been populated for 30,000 years, scientists claim after tool find
Finds from Chiquihuite Cave in the Mexican state of Zacatecas include 1930 tools made of limestone, among which are a fine blade that may have been used to slice meat, and pointed objects that could serve as spikes of spears or spears.
Scientists found that the oldest of the instruments date from 33,000 to 31,000 years ago.
“There are only a few products of this age.
But there they are,” said archaeologist Ciprian Ardelean of the university in the state of Zacatecas and lead author of one of two studies published on the subject in the journal Nature.
The youngest instruments reach the age of 12,500.
According to experts, humans thus inhabited the Chiquihuite Cave, located at a great altitude, for a long 20,000 years.
So far, a widely accepted theory has spoken of the first representatives of the Homo sapiens species crossing over the mainland bridge from an area of present-day Russia to Alaska some 13,500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including unique spear spikes used to kill mammoths and other prehistoric animals, showed that this clovian culture subsequently spread across much of the North America.
But this model has received a crack in recent decades when several ancient settlements that were two to three thousand years older were discovered.
In a second study published in the journal Nature, it says of 42 different sites across North America proving human presence on the continent as early as 26,000 to 19,000 years ago.
Scientists believe a small number of people may have come to the North American mainland earlier than predicted until now.
Some could reach America by boat.
“Clearly, people were in America long before the development of the so-called Clovian culture,” anthropologist Ruth Gruhn of the University of Canada's Alberta province said on the new findings.
Interest in airfare so far fulfills an upbeat scenario, dealers say.
Gradually, even prices are reduced
Ticket sales in the Czech Republic grow every week.
While interest is still roughly half that compared to last summer, demand is growing by as much as 20 per cent each week.
Thus, post-crisis development fulfills the most optimistic scenarios, according to vendors.
Ticket prices are also gradually decreasing.
Among the most sought-after destinations are particularly southern European states, according to retailers.
Spain, Italy and Greece lead, according to Kiwi.com data.
At the portal Letuška.cz, the most sold flights to Split, Croatia.
Of other countries, the most sought-after is the UK, which has always been one of the most bustling destinations.
The average ticket price is also decreasing.
At the portal Letuška.cz was around 6250 crore in the middle of the month, 3000 crore.
This is mainly due to an increase in demand for European destinations, which now account for about 85 per cent of sales.
However, prices themselves are falling to some European places, such as Spain or Italy have fallen by about a fifth in the past weeks.
The crisis has also affected the behaviour of customers who are now buying tickets far less in advance than before, fearing further developments in the coronavirus situation.
According to earlier Kiwi.com information, the pre-departure ticket purchase period decreased by roughly ten days year-on-year.
“It confirms to us a future trend where people will order tickets with much less advance, they will require more flexibility, less risk,” Kiwi.com's vice president of products said Michal Shingle.
Currently, the average booking time before departure is 21 days.
Along with the growth in sales, the number of renewed airline routes from the Czech Republic is rising.
Regular services to more than 60 destinations are currently operating at Prague Airport.
Against last summer's season, it goes about half the destinations.
The hunger was injured in the fall from the seated, they carried him to the ambulance for three hours
An unfortunate accident occurred at the top lots at the Čertova Mill before half eight in the evening.
“It was very complex and inaccessible terrain, so we approached the injured man five of our rescuers with proper technique. At the same time, we asked for cooperation the Medical Rescue Service of the Moravian-Silesian Region. Medics then dispatched an ambulance car to the accident,” Libor Kluz, a dispatcher for the Mountain Service of Beskida, described the circumstances of the intervention.
Rescuers found the thinkers in a tipped location with multiple injuries. They treated it immediately and then sparingly, but transported with difficulty on the so-called Austrian cart over unwalkable terrain.
“Transport in the route of about one and a half kilometres was slow and difficult. The injured nimrod was therefore surrendered to the crew of the ambulance car after approximately three hours,” added Libor Kluz.
According to Radan Yashkovsky, the commissioned chief of the Mountain Service of Beskida and at the same time an encroaching rescuer, a fellow minder was luckily able to detail the whereabouts of the wounded.
“We therefore found it relatively quickly. However, if he had an app on his phone, our paramedics would have been with him sooner and at the same time he would have known immediately dispatch line 155 about the accident and his situation,” Radan Yashkovsky noted.
He added that a loaded mobile phone with the Ambulance app activated should be commonplace in the mountains today.
Grand final already tonight!
Watch the dart battle live on Nova Sport
The second most prestigious tournament within the PDC organization went to the grand final.
It will feature experienced nine-year-old Scottish darter Gary Anderson and the surprise of the tournament, 26-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh.
Gary Anderson knocked out Justin Pip in the first round, then ran into his neighbor in the scoreboard.
Even with James Wade, however, he copped himself and in the quarter-finals he prowled profusely with Simon Whitlock, who had previously sent home the world number one.
The “Flying Scotsman” had a lame finish in the semi-final when he faced Michale Smith.
But he escaped the gravedigger from the shovel at the last minute, dominating in extra time and after a result of 18:16 he claimed a place in the final of the tournament he had already dominated in 2018 when he defeated in an amazing battle Mensur Suljovich 9:19 p.m.
World Matchplay's biggest surprise is Dimitri van den Bergh.
The Belgian talent is enjoying the tournament and just perhaps the knowledge that he has nothing to lose has helped him to play on an absolutely fantastic wave.
The 26-year-old dart first surprisingly knocked out Nathan Aspinall's world six, pressurised even Joe Cullen in a dramatic battle, and battered Adrian Lewis in the quarter-finals after a sharp onset.
The big clearance was the semi-final.
Glen Durrant showed his strength right on the opening, but in the calm playing Belgian then regained a lead with an excellent series, which he then more or less kept unchallenged until the end.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in the high scoring through which he ran occasional uncertainty on the doublets.

This applies, for example, to Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium or Israel.
The disease has already occurred in almost all countries of the world, the first case has been officially announced today by the DPRK.

Air in homes is up to five times worse than outdoor ones.
Health harms air fresheners as well as deodorants
Health threatens not only poor air quality in outdoor areas, but also at home.
This was brought to attention by Israeli human health expert Carol Abraham, already quoted by The Jerusalem Post newspaper.
According to Abraham, who was deserving of the creation of Israel's Ministry of Environmental Protection, it is necessary to focus on household harms right now, when many people spend more time working from home.
Abraham referred to research by the US Environment Agency (EPA), which said the quality of domestic air is up to five times worse than outdoor.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) judges that 3.8 million people die prematurely annually due to poor air quality in their homes.
'Because of the coronavirus epidemic, which has forced many and is still forcing them to work from home, people have to spend more hours in homes than before, so it's time to focus on home air quality, ' said Abraham.
In Israel, according to her, almost no one deals with the quality of “domestic air”.
Dangerous can be things that a person normally comes into contact with - coatings, air fresheners, disinfectants, deodorants or pesticides.
“Poison gas is also given off by garments that we regularly wear to the dry cleaners,” Abraham said.
The most at risk, she says, are children, old members of the household and people with respiratory problems.
Even otherwise healthy individuals may begin to suffer problems such as headache, fainting, nasal irritation, nosebleeds, vomiting or skin allergies.
With prolonged exposure to unhealthy substances, internal organs and central nervous system can be damaged.
But not all harmful substances come from objects inside households, the source can also be the material from which the houses are built.
Tough competition for Skoda Kamiq. Kia XCeed is betting on lavish gear, at what price?
The Kia XCeed is a relatively difficult-to-rank model. It falls clearly between compact SUVs, but does not offer all-wheel drive. It leaves that item to Sportage's larger sibling, which is such a direct answer to cars like the Skoda Karoq, the Opel Grandland X or the Volkswagen Tiguan. Compared to them, XCeed is betting on more dynamic body shapes, which by sloping the rear can remotely remind the world of Suv-coupe, popular in this part of the market mainly among premium by brands Audi, BMW or Mercedes-Benz.
On the other hand, XCeed cannot be included on the side of plastered versions of classic compacts, including Ford Focus Active. In contrast to him, Koreans made a much larger number of changes to the body, so whoever does not want to see Ceed in the shapes of the novelties perhaps not even need to see.
Unlike the compact hatchback or Ceed station wagon, the XCeed also offers itself exclusively with turbocharged engines, so do not expect a basic atmospheric fourteen-hundred. XCeed launches with a turbocharged litre and offers a turbocharged 16 hundred with 150 kW, reserved for the GT sibling. Here sports grade don't wait. Turbodiesely 1.6 CRDi is only offered in mild-hybrid design, that is, the internal combustion engine is assisted by an electric system that helps with reducing consumption and emissions. From 100 kW it is also possible to pay extra for a seven-speed dual-clutch slot machine next to the manual.
Soon the supply will grow to include a plug-in hybrid, a variant that will travel roughly six dozen kilometers on electricity alone. The battery can then be charged even from a normal outlet.
Quiz on Václav Havel: How long he spent in prison and what made him write up Charter 77
Fuenlabrada lost the chance of advancing to Spain's top football league due to coronavirus disease in the team.
The competition management cancelled the originally postponed duel of the last round of League Two, in which the team could secure participation in the play off.
Fuenlabrada reported 12 more people infected on Saturday, bringing the total number of positive tests for covid-19 at the club to already 28.
Due to contagion in the team, Monday's duel against La Coruni was postponed, in which a point was enough for Fuenlabrada to get into the play off.
The competition's management said today that it had definitively called off the duel against La Coruni in view of force majeure due to the fact that it was no longer played.
Fuenlabrada accepted the decision.
Against the failure to play a match, La Coruña, on the contrary.
In the end, given the results of their rivals, a victory over Fuenlabrada would not be enough to save, but he considers it unfair that the last round was not played according to customs complete in single term.
The management of the erstwhile elite Spanish club is threatening to fall into the third league with a trial.
The first two teams of the table of Huesca and Cadiz have the certainty of progress among the elite.
For the remaining third advancing spot, Zaragoza, Almería, Girona and Elche clash in the play off.
Karel Gott didn't like Vaclav Havel?
Daughter Dominica revealed it
'Dad didn't have to have him for many years, 'she revealed for Aha! Gotta Dominic's eldest daughter, saying that the Master couldn't figure out Havel's name, and whenever a speech came to him, Karla was always angry.
It's hard to say what they did to themselves, but according to Dominica, the feud began sometime in the mid-1990s
“My dad made the point in some article after the revolution that he had it easier than he did.
That Havel could write in his drawer in the Dark Ages, but if he defied himself, then he had an end to his career,” Gott argues.
But he then adds that eventually the Czech greats found a way to each other.
“I know that the word Havel could not have heard by his sixties at all.
But then the president congratulated him with a birthday letter, and suddenly Dad's relationship to him started to change,” Dominika recalls.
After all, ten years later, Gott even invited the former president to celebrate his 70s at the Ambassador Hotel in Wenceslas Square.
'And that's where a new era in their relationship started, because Dad then regularly invited Mr Havel home to back on Bertramk, 'added the blonde, whose father died last October.
Nightingale is said to have also been sorry that he never received state honours from Václav Havel.
But he was still in 2009, even though it was already out of the hands of his successor as Václav Klaus (79).
More honours will be received in memoriam, the current President Miloš Zeman (75) is to award him the Order of the White Lion to honor his memory.
Heat threatens in Czech Republic since Tuesday, meteorologists warn of wildfires
Meteorologists' warning of high temperatures is valid for Tuesday afternoon for the whole of Bohemia except for the Karlovy Vary Region and also for southern and central Moravia.
“Exceptionally, temperatures may also exceed 34 degrees Celsius, especially in central Bohemia,” they state.
People advise to adhere to a drinking regime in the heat and limit the body load in the midday and afternoon.
Due to warm weather with a minimum of rainfall, there will be a danger of starting fires from Tuesday morning.
Windy weather could contribute to their rapid spread.
Meteorologists' warning of the risk of fires refers to central Bohemia, including Prague, Liberec, Ústí, Karlovy Vary and Pilsen regions.
A warning of fires will be in effect until further notice.
“We do not expect more significant rainfall to alleviate the danger in the north-west and west of Bohemia until at least the end of the week,” the CHMI reports.
The Prague Magistrate responded to the weather warning by a ban on making fires at risk sites, which is due to apply from Tuesday.
People in the capital will not be allowed to set open fires, for example, in parks, gardens or forests, up to 50 metres from the edge of the forest cover.
Smoking and the use of pyrotechnics are also forbidden in these places.
The measure will apply until further notice, Vít Hofman, the Prague Magistrate's spokesman, informed.
A French chef is in court with Michelin over the star's removal. I suffer from depression, he claims
Renowned French chef Marc Veyrat lost his third Michelin star this January, a year after he acquired it. He intends to judge with the publisher of the red guide to receive the exact reasons for degradation. Veyrat also doubts the competence of Michelin inspectors, who he believes mistook saffron for cheddar. The first court trial is scheduled to take place in November.
The chef of the famous La Maison de Bois restaurant in the alpine region of Upper Savoy lost one of three Michelin stars in January this year. The publisher of the prestigious Le Guide Michelin will be judged because the commissioners' conclusion, according to him, was not properly justified. In addition, the removal of the asterisk according to him occurred without any notice. “I've been suffering from depression for six months. How dare you mess with the health of the cooks?” sent Veyrat to the commissioners.
Michelin is said to have provided the chef with only vague reasons, such as that the chef put cheddar in souffle, which did not like the inspection. “I put saffron in it and those gentlemen thought it was cheddar because it was yellow. From the beginning, I love working with Savoy ingredients,” he corralled against the Veyrat decision. The latter is convinced of the strong incompetence of the Michelin Commissioners: “You are crooks who only stir up controversy for commercial reasons.” An indignant Veyrat does not understand “how they could afford to say we put in our souffle cheddar.” “They insulted our region as well, my employees were crazy about it. We have eggs from our hens, milk from our own cows, gardeners collect fresh herbs every morning,” he exasperated.
The distinctive chef, always with a black hat on his head and dark glasses, is an opponent of a new generation of Michelin commissioners and is therefore requesting the removal of his restaurant from the red guide. However, the publisher rejects this. “If the business remains open and our inspectors re-select it, we will continue to recommend it,” argues Gwendal Poullennec, Michelin's international director.
According to Michelin, the chef's lawsuit testifies that he has no meaningful charges yet and the lawyer will only help him formulate it. “We regret that Mr. Veyrat communicates with us rudely. But we will examine his comments carefully,” he opined.
In addition to La Maison de Bois, Marc Veyart owns two other three-star restaurants.
