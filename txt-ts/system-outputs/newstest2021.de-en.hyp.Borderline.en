p. 381 Jan Christopher Horak wrote: "The film is a remarkable achievement of the director.
We shall not know.
You could have known.
Please all be aware of a very simple fact for a moment: pretty much everything we know about the universe we know through light.
We can stand on Earth and look into the night sky and look at stars with our bare eyes.
The sun burns our peripheral vision.
We see light reflected from the moon.
and in the time that has passed since Galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope at the celestial bodies, the universe known to us has traveled to us as visible light, traversing immeasurable ages of cosmic history.
With the help of all our modern telescopes, we have been able to study it all: this impressive silent film of the universe, this series of snapshots dating back to the Big Bang.
But the universe is not a silent movie, because the universe is not silent.
I would like to convince you that the universe has a soundtrack and that this soundtrack is played in space itself: Because space can vibrate like a drum.
It can sound a kind of sound recording that can be heard throughout the universe; of some of the most dramatic events when they occurred.
Now we would like to add a sonic component to the wonderful visual arrangement we have from the universe.
And even if we've never heard the sounds of the universe before, we should slowly turn up the volume control for what's happening out there over the next few years.
Out of this ambition to capture songs of the universe, we focus our interest on black holes and their inherent promise. Black holes hammer against space-time like wooden mallets on a drum. They have a very characteristic sound that I would like to play to you; or our idea of how this song will sound.
One day we may see a shadow cast by a black hole against a bright background, but so far we haven't succeeded.
And yet you can hear black holes, even if they are invisible, because they play on space-time like a drum.
We owe the idea that the universe sounds like a drum to Albert Einstein, to whom we owe so much.
Einstein realized that if space were empty, if the universe were empty, it would have to look like this picture, just without this helpful grid.
But if we moved through space in free fall, even without this helpful grid, then maybe we could paint it ourselves, because we would realize that we are moving along straight lines, along undistorted, straight paths through the universe.
Einstein also recognized (and that's what it's all about) that when you bring energy or mass into the universe, it bends the universe. If a free-falling body, say, passed the Sun, it would be distorted along the natural lines of curvature in space.
This is Einstein's great General Theory of Relativity.
Even light is bent along these paths.
And a body can be bent so strongly that it gets into an orbit around the sun, like the earth, or like the moon in the earth's orbit.
These are natural curvatures in space.
What Einstein did not know was this: If you took the sun and pressed it into a ball of six kilometers in diameter, if you took something with a million times the mass of the earth and pressed it together to six kilometers, you would create a black hole; a body of such density that light that passed too close to it could never escape. It would be a black shadow in front of the universe.
But Einstein considered black holes a mathematical curiosity all his life.
He didn't believe they really existed.
He was convinced that nature would protect us from its formation.
It would take decades for the term "black hole" to be coined and people to understand that black holes are astrophysical bodies. In fact, they are the lifeless state of extremely dense stars that collapse in a horrific catastrophe at the end of their lives.
Our Sun, however, will not end as a black hole.
It's simply not big enough for that.
But we did a little thought experiment, just as Einstein liked to do. Let's imagine that we squeeze the sun to six kilometers in diameter and bring a tiny earth into its orbit, say, 30 kilometers away from this black sun.
This earth would shine by itself, (because since the sun would then have disappeared, there would be no other light source) so we let our little earth shine by itself.
We could put the Earth into a carefree orbit about 30 km away from the crushed black hole.
This crushed black hole would be about the size of Manhattan.
It would pour a little more into the Hudson before it destroyed the Earth.
But we're talking about that.
We're talking about something you can squeeze until it's half the size of Manhattan.
Now we bring the Earth very close, up to about 30 km, and see how it moves in a completely flawless orbit around the black hole.
There's a kind of myth that black holes devour everything in the universe, but in fact you have to get very close to them to fall in.
But what is particularly impressive from our point of view is the fact that we can always see the Earth.
She can't hide behind the black hole.
The light that comes from the earth, some of it falls in, but some is scattered and returns to us.
So you can't hide anything behind a black hole.
If this is the Battlestar Galactica and you're fighting the Cylons, don't hide behind the Black Hole.
They can see them.
So our Sun will not collapse into a black hole, its mass is not enough, but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
If one of them wiped out the Milky Way, it would look like that.
We would see a shadow of the black hole against the backdrop of billions of stars in the Milky Way galaxy and their glowing dust tracks.
Should we fall toward this black hole, we would see all the light bent around it, and we could even enter the shadow without noticing anything unusual happening.
It would be bad if we tried to ignite our engines and escape, because we couldn't, just as the light can't escape.
But even if the black hole is dark from the outside, it is not dark inside, because all the light of the galaxy could fall behind us.
And although due to a phenomenon of the theory of relativity (the so-called time dilation), our clocks seemed to go slower in relation to galactic time, it would look as if the development of the galaxy had accelerated and shot at us just before we were crushed to death by the black hole.
It would be like a near-death experience to see the light at the end of the tunnel, but it would be a comprehensive death experience.
(Laughter) And you couldn't tell anyone about the light at the end of the tunnel.
Now we have never seen such a shadow of a black hole, but black holes can be heard, even if they are invisible.
Please imagine an astrophysically realistic situation. Imagine two black holes that have spent a long life together.
Perhaps it was once stars that collapsed into two black holes, each with a mass ten times that of the Sun.
We are now squeezing them together to a diameter of 60 km.
They can spin several hundred times per second.
At the end of their lives, they circle each other almost at the speed of light.
They can travel thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second. And while they do, they not only bend space, but they leave in their wake a sound of space, a real wave of space-time.
Space contracts and expands as it flows out of these black holes and hammers into the universe.
And they travel out into the cosmos at the speed of light.
We owe this computer simulation to a relativity working group at NASA Goddard.
It took almost 30 years for someone to solve this problem.
This was one of those groups.
Here we see two black holes circling each other, again with the helpful, painted lines.
Maybe you can see - it's a bit indistinct - but when you see the red waves coming out, these are gravitational waves.
They actually represent the sound of sounding space and will emerge from these black holes at the speed of light as they become quieter and quieter and eventually merge into a spinning, silent black hole.
If you were close enough, the sound of contracting and expanding space would roar in your ears.
You would be able to hear the sound literally.
Of course, your head would also be pressed and stretched, which would be quite unpleasant, which is why you would also have trouble understanding what is happening.
But I would like to show you what sounds we would predict here.
This is from my working group - a slightly less glamorous computer model.
Imagine a lighter black hole falling into a very heavy black hole.
What you hear is the sound with which the light black hole hammers into space, every time it comes close to it.
When it moves away again, it's a little too quiet.
But it hits like a mallet and literally shatters the universe, making it vibrate like a drum.
We can predict what that will sound like.
We know that when it falls in, it gets faster and louder.
And finally, we hear the little guy fall into the big guy.
I've never heard this so loud - it's really much more dramatic.
At home it sounds rather disappointing.
More like ding, ding, ding.
This is another sound from my group.
No, I don't show you any pictures, because black holes don't leave any helpful ink marks. Space has no colorful, painted lines.
But if you were floating around in space during a space vacation and you would hear this here, then you should make sure you get away.
(Laughter) You should really get away from that noise.
Both black holes are moving.
Both black holes are getting closer.
In this case, they vibrate very strongly at first.
And then they merge.
This chirping is typical for the merging of two black holes, so that it chirps at the end.
This is our conception of what we would see.
Luckily, we're at a safe distance here in Long Beach, California.
But it is highly likely that two black holes have just merged somewhere in the universe.
And it is just as certain that space vibrates around us after it has probably taken millions of light years, or a million years to travel to us at the speed of light.
But the sound is much too quiet than we could ever hear.
Experiments are being carried out on Earth with great zeal, one of which is called LIGO - to detect deviations in the way space contracts and expands again, deviations in the order of magnitude smaller than an atomic nucleus over a distance of four kilometres.
It is an incredibly ambitious project and its sensitivity will be further developed in the coming years - in order to be able to perceive this here.
There should also be a mission for outer space, which will hopefully start within the next ten years. It is called LISA.
LISA will be able to see huge black holes, black holes with millions or billions of times the density of the Sun.
In this image from the Hubble telescope, we see two galaxies.
They look like they're frozen in an embrace.
Each probably contains a huge black hole inside.
But they are not frozen. They merge with each other.
These two black holes collide and become one over the course of billions of years.
Our human capacity for perception is unable to grasp a song of such duration.
But LISA could see the final stage of two giant black holes, at an earlier stage in the history of the universe, the last 15 minutes before they merge.
And it's not just about black holes, but also about all the big disturbances in the universe - and the biggest of all is the Big Bang.
When the term was coined, it was meant contemptuously - "Who believes in a big bang, a big bang?"
This animation from friends of mine at Proton Studios shows an exterior view of the Big Bang.
We never really want to try; we never want to be inside the universe because you can never be outside the universe.
So imagine you're in the Big Bang.
It's everywhere, all around you, and space is swirling and swinging totally uncontrollably.
14 billion years pass, but this song still rings out around us.
Galaxies form and generations of stars are born in these galaxies, and a habitable planet orbits one of these stars, at least one.
And here we sit and work like crazy on these experiments, do calculations and write computer code.
Imagine that two black holes collided a billion years ago.
Their song has been sounding through space ever since, all the time.
We didn't even exist back then.
It's getting closer and closer - 40,000 years ago we still painted cave paintings.
Should it be the Big Bang we're recording, it would sound like that.
It's literally the epitome of noise.
It's white noise, it's such a chaotic noise.
But it's all around us, probably at least if it hasn't been wiped out by another process in the universe.
When we record it, it will sound like music to our ears because it will be a quiet echo, an echo of the moment of our creation, our visible universe.
So within the next two years we will be able to make the soundtrack a little louder and output the universe as a sound image.
But if we can grasp those very earliest moments, it will bring us much closer to an understanding of the Big Bang, which in turn brings us closer to some of the most complex, elusive questions.
If we played a film of the universe backwards, we would know that there was a big bang in the past and we could even perceive the cacophony of its sound. But was our big bang the only big bang?
I think we have to ask the question: Has something like this ever happened?
Will it repeat itself?
I think, in the spirit of the challenge posed by TED - to rekindle amazement - we can ask questions, at least at this last minute, that might otherwise elude us forever.
But we have to ask ourselves: Is it possible that our universe is just an offshoot of a bigger story?
Or is it possible that we are just an offshoot of a multiverse - each offshoot with its own Big Bang in its past - maybe some of them have drum-playing black holes, others maybe not - in some there may be intelligent life, in others not - not in our past, not in our future, but in some way fundamentally connected to us?
So we have to ask ourselves: If there is a multiverse, do living beings exist in another fragment of this multiverse?
These are my creatures of the Multiverse.
Are there other beings in this multiverse who are concerned about us and their own origins?
And if they exist, I can imagine that they are like us, that they calculate and write computer codes, build instruments, try to make out the farthest sound of their origin and wonder who is still out there.
Thank you. Thank you.

Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvest workers infected
After a corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in Mamming in Lower Bavaria, almost 500 people are under quarantine and are no longer allowed to leave the farm.
A security service monitors the ban on going out.
A total of 174 harvest workers were tested positive for the corona pathogen Sars-CoV-2 during the screening, as the district office of Dingolfing-Landau announced on Saturday evening.
"In order to avoid further expansion, we unfortunately have to take this step to protect the population," explained District Administrator Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees had already been infected in the company - this was the reason for the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm that grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and beetroot - but the cucumbers are only for jars.
Mamming is a rural community with a good 3300 inhabitants not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to keep calm: "According to our information, it is a closed group of people."
On the farm, infected employees were separated from non-infected employees, the site is now surrounded by a fence.

The SPD takes a similar view: "After the corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof slaughterhouse in mid-May, we have already called for a special control programme for farms with harvest workers," said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.

Many people believe that driving is an activity reserved only for people who can see.
A blind person driving a car safely and independently has so far been considered an impossible task.
Hello, my name is Dennis Hong, and we want to give blind people freedom and independence by building a vehicle for the blind.
So, before I talk about this car for the blind, let me talk briefly about another project I've been working on and called the DARBA Urban Challenge.
This was about building a robotized car that can drive itself.
You press Start, no one touches anything, and it can reach its destination completely automatically.
Thus, in 2007, our team won half a million dollars by becoming third in the competition.
Around this time, the National Association of the Blind, or NFB, challenged the Investigation Committee to create a car that can be safely and independently driven by a blind person.
We decided to give it a try because we thought, hey, how difficult that can be.
We already have an automatic vehicle.
We put a blind person in and it's finished, isn't it?
(Laughter) We couldn't have been wrong.
What the National Association for the Blind (NFB) wanted was not a vehicle that drives blind people around, but a vehicle where a blind person can make active decisions and drive.
Therefore, we had to throw everything away and start again.
Therefore, to test this crazy idea, we developed a small buggy prototype vehicle to test its feasibility.
And in the summer of 2009, we invited dozens of young blind people from all over the country and gave them the opportunity to take a spin.
It was an absolutely amazing experience.
But the problem with this car was that it was designed so that it could only be driven in a controlled environment, a level, traffic-free parking lot, and that even the lanes were highlighted with red cones.
Therefore, with this success, we decided to take the next big step, to develop a true car that can be driven in the right roads.
So how does it work?
Well, it's a pretty complicated system, but let me try to explain it, and maybe I can simplify it.
Well, we have three steps.
We have perception, computation and non-visual interfaces.
Well, it is clear that the driver cannot see, so the system must be able to perceive the environment and collect information for the driver.
For this, we use an initial measurement unit.
It measures the acceleration, the angular acceleration, like a human ear, an inner ear.
We merge the information with a GPS unit to get approximately the position of the car.
We also use two cameras to detect the lanes of the road.
And we also use three laser distance measurements.
The lasers scan the environment to detect obstacles, a car approaching us from the front or from behind, and also any obstacles entering the road, any obstacles around the vehicle.
After that, all this enormous amount of information is passed into the computer, and the computer can do two things.
First, first of all, process the information to understand what the environment is like; these are lanes on the road, the obstacles, and convey this information to the driver.
The system is also smart enough to calculate the safest way to operate the car.
We can also generate instructions on how to operate the control of the vehicle.
But, the problem is this: How can we convey this information and these instructions to a person who can't see quickly enough and fairly accurately so that they can drive?
For this, we have developed different types of non-visual user interface technology.
We started with a three-dimensional ping sound system, a vibration vest, a click wheel with voice commands, a foot strip, and even a shoe that puts pressure on the leg.
But today, we're going to talk about three of these non-visual user interface technologies.
Well, the first interface technology is called DriveGrip.
This is a pair of gloves, and it has its vibrating elements on the ankle side, so they can give instructions on how to control, direction, and intensity.
Another device is called SpeedStrip.
These are a chair, strictly speaking, it is a massage chair.
We hollow it out, and we reorganize the vibrating elements into different patterns, and we use them to convey information about the speed, and also to convey instructions on how to use the accelerator and brake pedal.
Therefore, here they can see how the computer sees the environment, and since they can't see the vibration, we even equip the driver with red LEDs so he can really see what's going on.
These are the sensory data, and this data is forwarded to the devices via computers.
Therefore, these two devices, DriveGrip and SpeedGrip, are very effective.
But the problem is that they are stitch instructions devices.
Therefore, this is not a real freedom, is it?
The computer tells you how to drive, turn left, turn right, accelerate, stop.
We call it back seat driver problem.
Therefore, let's move away from the stitch instruction devices, and now focus more on the information devices.
A good example of this non-visual information interface technology is AirPix.
Consider it a monitor for the blind.
Well, it's a small tray, it has lots of holes and it releases compressed air, so it can even draw pictures.
Therefore, even if they are blind, they can put their hand on it, see the lanes and the obstacles on the road.
In fact, they can also change the air frequency that escapes, and possibly the temperature.
Therefore, it is in fact a multidimensional user interface.
Well, here you can look at the left camera, the right camera seen from the vehicle, and see how the computer interprets this and sends the information to the AirPix.
For this, we show a simulator, a blind person driving and using the AirPix.
This simulator was also very useful to train the blind riders and also fast in testing different varieties of ideas for different types of non-visual user interfaces.
Therefore, that's how it mainly works.
But this vehicle is a prototype, and it will not enter the road until it is proven to be safe, or safer than today's vehicles.
And I really believe this can happen.
But still, will society, would they accept such a radical idea?
How will we regulate insurance?
How will we issue driving licenses?
Aside from the technological challenges, there are many types of hurdles we need to overcome before it becomes a reality.
Of course, the main objective of this project is to produce a car for a blind person.
But potentially more important than this is the tremendous benefit of spin-off technology that can be drawn from this project.
The sensors that are needed can see in the dark in fog and rain.
And along with these new types of interfaces, we can use this technology and apply it in safer cars for normal-seeing people.
Or for blind people, in everyday devices in the household, in training and in the office.
Imagine a teacher writing on the blackboard in a classroom, and a blind student can see and read what he has written using these non-visual interface technologies.
This is priceless.
So, the things I've shown you today are just the beginning.
Thank you very much.

Discuss Abolition of the 50 + 1 Rule
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended thinking about abolishing the 50 + 1 rule.
"German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates fait accompli," Grindel told "Bild am Sonntag".
He stressed: "For the clubs that are most likely to be dangerous to Bayern and Dortmund, the 50 + 1 rules do not work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, one cannot avoid the debate as to whether it is not appropriate to facilitate the inclusion of investors for clubs that want to break into this phalanx".
However, he has doubts whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority participation, which is prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50 + 1 rule.
"It remains a legal risk to draw investment fences around the Bundesliga as a business location in a European internal market," said Grindel.
The former DFB boss sees the danger that "the attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will ultimately only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs on a European level, but will not lead to more tension in the championship".

He had received the gift, worth around 11,000 euros, from a Ukrainian official.
"I committed a compliance violation, and it was right to draw the consequences from it," said Grindel.
"I dealt with the ominous watch gift in a completely transparent and unsuspecting way.
Many in the DFB knew about it".
He had never "made a secret of the gift," the 58-year-old assured.
"This may be called naive, but at any rate this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption".

Argentina rejects creditors' counter offer
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economy in Buenos Aires announced on Saturday.

"While 50 percent of children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors."
The debt of the second-largest economy in South America is no longer sustainable under current conditions.

Professionally arrived - privately not yet
"It's going super well" - this is the conclusion drawn by Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first days in the notary's office in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very quickly: In mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will succeed Lutz Feller in the notarial office in Eggenfelden.
Already six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the doctor of law took up the work, the normal day-to-day business has long been running at full speed.
"Privately, however, I still have to arrive," she explains in an interview with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
The short lead time was of course not enough to completely relocate the centre of life from Regensburg to Eggenfelden, reports the native Dingolfinger.
She and her husband, who works as a judge at the regional court in Regensburg, are currently looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city.
At least her husband was still able to apply for parental leave at short notice in order to be able to guarantee the care of the two daughters (3 ½ and 1 ½ years old).
In order not to have to commute every day from Regensburg, she also has overnight accommodation with her parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-old.
Raised in the neighbouring district, the city of Eggenfelden has of course long been known to her.
During visits on site with her family in recent months, she found out again: "Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town".
She was all the more pleased that she had won the race in the selection process for the vacant position.
Her native Lower Bavaria also plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career: After studying law in Passau, she completed her legal traineeship and the 2nd state examination in Regensburg.
After several positions as a notary assessor, including in Rehau and Hof in Upper Franconia, Babenhausen in Unterallgäu and Regensburg - during this time she also "incidentally" shouldered her doctorate in employment law - she took up her first position as a notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016, she took parental leave, which was finally followed by the move to Regensburg.
Since then she has taken over representation services in various notarial offices.
When the position in Eggenfelden was advertised because of the approaching retirement of Lutz Feller, she saw the right time for full professional re-entry, explains the 39-year-old.
The team of her predecessor, who will take over the holiday replacement in the notarial office in the future, has completely taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer - and immediately has a praise for the team of the law firm ready: "It's going super well!"
The fact that she can rely on well-rehearsed processes here makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of her private centre of life.
In terms of kindergarten and nursery places, she has already made contact with a local institution.
And everything works out as desired, she hopes to be able to pursue her hobby here soon - and get to know the most beautiful jogging routes in the Rottal.

BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be filled to 20 percent at the start of the season in the event of a fan return.
"Due to the distance regulation, which is mandatory to comply with, we are currently planning with 12,000 to 15,000 spectators," said Borussia Dortmund's managing director Carsten Cramer to the "Tagesspiegel".
Normally, the arena in the Revierstadt holds slightly more than 81,000 spectators at Bundesliga matches.
In the ghost games of last season caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BVB had lost around four million euros per game.
Cramer, who is responsible for marketing, digitalization and internationalization at BVB, hopes that in addition to the normal spectator seats, some of the approximately 4000 seats in the hospitality area can also be opened again: "It is of course a blow to the office if these revenues completely break away."
In view of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, everyone is currently "well advised to take a stable page length for the time being."
"If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people in Germany alone are on short-time work, then the need for entertainment is limited," explained Cramer.
The Dortmund marketing boss praised the BVB pros for their partial salary waiver, which is intended to help overcome the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their salary waiver has a different effect than if we put 100 people who work in merchandising on short-time work."

Kalbitz expulsion from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "Feigenblatt"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is from the point of view of the FDP only a "fig leaf" and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the extreme right in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of radicals in the AfD, "FDP politician Benjamin Strasser told the dpa news agency in Berlin.
The Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD had confirmed on Saturday in Stuttgart, after several hours of hearings, the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Executive Board had decided by a majority in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD parliamentary group in the Brandenburg state parliament.
"If the AfD really wanted to consistently remove right-wing extremists from its party, functionaries like Björn Höcke and his supporters would have been excluded long ago," said Strasser.
"However, there is no political will for this in the AfD, because right-wing extremism is now part of the party."
CSU General Secretary Markus Blume expressed a similar view: "The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded says nothing and does not change anything," he told "Welt am Sonntag."
"Rather, it speaks volumes how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist in the middle of the AfD still has."
Blume assumes that the AfD will again land below five percent in elections in the future.
"The days of the AfD in parliaments are numbered."
Kalbitz was one of the spokesmen of the now officially dissolved "wing" around the Thuringian AfD state and parliamentary party chairman Björn Höcke; the Office for the Protection of the Constitution classifies the extension as a "secured right-wing extremist endeavor."
In May, the AfD federal executive threw Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason, he stated that when he joined the party, Kalbitz had not stated an earlier membership in the now banned right-wing extremist "Heimattreue Deutsche Jugend" (HDJ) and among the Republicans.
Kalbitz denies membership in the HDJ.
The chairman of the left-wing fraction in the Brandenburg state parliament, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court did not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf has only eaten chalk.
The AfD remains a far-right party, whether with or without Kalbitz. "
This decision would neither weaken the federal party nor the right wing.
"The manoeuvre of the Meuthen troops is transparent.
They want to avoid further observation by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution and are trying to get through under the radar, "said Walter.
"The AfD won't get rid of the ghosts it called.
An expulsion does not change anything, "commented the Brandenburg SPD General Secretary Erik Stohn on the decision in the Kalbitz case.
"Here, the AfD regional association and the parliamentary group have remained their right-wing leader to this day."
The legal dispute over Kalbitz's membership in the AfD will continue.
The latter announced on Saturday that he would now take civil action against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court.

North Sea wind farms deliver a good 21 percent more electricity
The wind power plants on the German North Sea fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid in the first six months of the year.
That is a good 21 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, announced the network operator Tennet in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea electricity to the mainland and the transmission through the German electricity grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of Tennet's grid area, have fed in a further 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, wind power from the North and Baltic Seas thus comes to 13.73 TWh, compared to a good 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of total wind power in Germany; that is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms ensure higher generation capacities
In addition to the wind conditions, the increased contribution of offshore wind energy results from higher generation capacities because new wind farms have been connected to the grid in the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea were all running at full power at the same time, they could mathematically generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatts.
It is expected to rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea by 2030.
"By then, we will be investing 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore grid connections in Germany and the Netherlands," said Tennet Managing Director Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind farms cannot make full use of their capacity even at sea, but reach around 40 percent.
The previous record day this year is January 2, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could supply almost seven million households with electricity.

Freital: Windbergfest cancelled due to corona
The Windbergfest will not take place this year.
The city of Freital has cancelled the three-day festival planned for September.
In other years, over 30,000 people had attended this city festival.
"We really did not make this decision easy for ourselves and - aware of how difficult it is economically for those involved - hoped until the last minute," explained Lord Mayor Uwe Rumberg (non-partisan).
"But ultimately, as organizers, we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people."
Because if tens of thousands had flocked to the festival grounds and the marquee, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact tracking in accordance with the current corona protection regulation could not have been complied with.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that not much would have remained of a folk festival.
In addition, the organizational and monitoring effort would increase disproportionately many times over.
Rumberg put off on next year.
Then the city of Freital will celebrate its 100th anniversary, including the Winterbergfest from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the Day of the Saxons from 10 to 12 September 2021.

More air traffic controllers in Worms in the future
The University of Applied Sciences in Worms continues to take to the skies: "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" endows a professorship for "Air Traffic Management."
A corresponding contract between the university and DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and will start in 2021.
With the professorship, it is possible to start studies not only in the summer, but also in the winter semester.
This means that twice as many students can be trained as before.
At the same time, capacities at both the university and the DFS Academy of Air Navigation Services will be equally utilized.
DFS will advise the university on the establishment and appointment of the professorship.
Represented at the university since 2019
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students have been in the Air Traffic Management degree programme as part of their training as air traffic controllers at Worms University of Applied Sciences.
Nine students have already started this year.
So far, the experiences of DFS have been very positive, and the performance of the students has been outstanding.
The combination of studies and pilot training contributes significantly to further increasing the attractiveness of the pilot profession.
"In these times, funding is not easy for us economically.
However, we firmly expect air traffic to recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to be able to fulfil our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel, "says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman and CEO of DFS, at the signing of the contract.
"For DFS, the endowed professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, interdisciplinary knowledge base in the long term.
We are therefore continuing the good cooperation with the university and at the same time underpinning our attractiveness as an employer. "
This is also underlined by Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of Worms University of Applied Sciences: "The endowed professorship forms an important bridge between science and industry.
With it, we would like to build on the existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual bachelor's degree programme in Air Traffic Management. "
The trust of Deutsche Flugsicherung is both a motivation and an obligation for Worms University of Applied Sciences to further expand its teaching and research expertise in the future-oriented fields of aviation.
Working for the air traffic controllers of tomorrow, the university can set very special highlights and innovative priorities for its students with the first endowed professorship for a dual course of study.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary in the Ministry of Science, Continuing Education and Culture, emphasises: "With its focus on air transport, Worms University of Applied Sciences has a unique selling point in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the university's profile. "

Heil wants to examine other industries after meat industry
The COVID-19 crisis brought conditions in parts of the meat industry back to light.
Law tightening is imminent.
But are they right - and will they stay that way?
Federal Minister of Labour Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to examine other sectors after the now planned strict regulations against grievances in the meat industry.
"We will look at industry by industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary," said Heil to the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employers are already warning against restricting contracts for work and services in general.
After the massive corona outbreak at the meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet wants to pass a law of salvation this Wednesday.
Large-scale slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to employ external personnel for slaughter, cutting and meat processing.
For this purpose, the use of contract and temporary workers is to be prohibited there.
Employer president Ingo Kramer told dpa: "Stay away from a general restriction on work contracts and temporary employment if you don't want to completely strangle the economy."
Contracts for work and services are, for example, for wide areas of trade, the construction industry and plant engineering necessarily the basis for their added value for the customer.
"The failings of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument."
Heil assured: "My goal is not to ban contracts for work and services everywhere in the German economy."
Work contracts make sense.
"If an industrial company commissions a craftsman to install a security system, this is a completely normal work contract."
The German meat industry considers a ban on contracts for work and temporary work to be unconstitutional in its sector alone.

Often they had no rest.
Wage was withheld for protective equipment or rent.
It was also noted that the situation regarding the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively harsh law had already entered into force for the meat industry in 2017.
However, these were circumvented by "tricky constructions."
"Now we have to clean up fundamentally."
The politician announced: "The Occupational Safety and Health Act, which we want to adopt in the cabinet at the end of July, also includes measures that not only affect the meat industry - for example, higher testing rates for occupational health and safety or clear criteria for communal accommodation."
The draft submitted to dpa includes amendments to the Act on the Protection of Workers' Rights in the Meat Industry and the Occupational Health and Safety Act.
Brandenburg's consumer protection minister Ursula Nonnemacher (Green Party) considers more intensive controls necessary.

Car rolls over: Young woman seriously injured in accident on federal highway 83 near Hofgeismar
A 21-year-old suffered serious injuries in an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme on Sunday at around 1: 25 p.m.
She was taken to the Kassel Hospital.
The fire department used thermal imaging cameras to look for potential passengers.
According to the police, the woman was on the road on federal highway 83 in the direction of her place of residence, Hümme, when her car drifted off the road for unknown reasons and rolled over several times.

Since it was unclear whether someone was still in the vehicle, the adjacent corn field was searched from the turntable ladder with a thermal imaging camera.
The drone squadron from Warburg, which also works with thermal imaging cameras, had also been ordered for the search for persons.
However, the volunteers did not find anyone between the tall maize plants.
The seriously injured woman was taken by ambulance to the hospital in Kassel for further care.
Almost 50 firefighters from the Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg fire brigades were on site.

Juventus Turin champions in Italy
Turin - After a redeeming goal from Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in a row.
The team around the five-time world footballer made the total of 36th Scudetto of the club's history perfect with a 2: 0 (1: 0) on Sunday evening in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo scored 1:0 before half-time.
With 83 points, Turin, which competed without the last long-injured ex-national player Sami Khedira, can no longer be displaced from first place two matchdays before the end of the Serie A season.
The runner-up Inter Milan is seven points behind.
Juventus was harmless despite optical superiority in the first half, then Ronaldo scored after a free kick variant with the last action.
The 35-year-old scored a pass from Miralem Pjanic directly from the penalty area border with a flat shot (45th + 7).
Against the now more offensive guests Ronaldo was also involved in the 2: 0, after his shot Federico Bernardeschi (67th) dusted off.
This secured the lackluster but decisive success.

Because of the defeat, the people of Turin had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
The reassuring lead in the championship lead at the end was mainly due to the weakness of the competitors.
Because in the eleven games before the game on Sunday, the Sarri team had only managed five victories.
Whether Ronaldo will also be the top scorer is questionable.
Because while the Portuguese superstar has scored 31 goals so far, the former Dortmund Ciro Immobile has already scored 34 goals on his account after his pack of three in the 5: 1 (1: 1) of fourth-placed Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to FC Bayern's title win.

Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - Despite all threatened penalties and court rulings, motorists continue to step on the gas in countless illegal races on the roads of Baden-Württemberg: In the past year and the first four months of this year, the police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
There are no comparable values for the years before, but the speeders are increasingly making work for the judicial authorities: At the public prosecutor's offices between Konstanz and Mannheim, a total of 155 investigations for illegal races were conducted in 2018, a year later there were already 252 and in the current year by the beginning of June already 151.
The races were less about organized events, as can be seen from the response of the Ministry of the Interior to an inquiry by the Landtag-SPD.
In most cases, the drivers competed against each other spontaneously or they fled from the police - this is also reported as an illegal race.
The drivers were mainly German men between the ages of 18 and 60.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases are the speeders caught and also asked to pay: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines have been imposed and 15 prison sentences pronounced since 2018.
However, there are no indications that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
Rather, because of the numerous tragic accidents and trials of past years, other drivers reacted more sensitively than before and reported more frequently, said a ministry spokesman.
Autobahn 8 is particularly popular with racers. Again and again, drivers brake the traffic there to make room for themselves and use the free track for a race.

A81 is the most popular "racetrack"
On the A81, the police even registered more races than on any other federal highway.
With a speed limit there is an attempt to slow down the speeders on the particularly affected section between Engen and Geisingen.
The mostly high-priced and pimped-up sports and luxury cars often have Swiss license plates, because the drivers move to the lawn in Germany because of the high penalties for driving too fast and car racing in the neighboring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit must not be reduced to a few distances: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometers per hour, we would get rid of this problem on motorways," says Martin Rivoir, the traffic expert of the SPD parliamentary group.
"The inhibition threshold for speeders would be significantly higher if one were not allowed to travel legally here and there at 200 kilometers per hour and more."
Rivoir thinks less of education or image campaigns: "Anyone who ignores all rules in such a way and puts not only their own lives, but also the lives of other road users at risk, can hardly be reached with reason."
ADAC demands stronger crackdown by the police
For the ADAC, however, this is not enough: "We assume that racers will not be deterred by the speed limits," says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and Environment at ADAC Württemberg.
He calls for additional and also tougher controls on the affected routes.
Not infrequently, the high-speed trial of strength turns into painful and momentous seriousness: Since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people across the country have died in the races, two of them uninvolved in a nightly crash in Stuttgart's city centre and one in Gerlingen.
Two young men are said to have delivered a car race there in November.
One of the vehicles came off the road, crashed into a garden wall and remained lying on the side, the 18-year-old co-driver died.
21 other people were injured in the races of the past two years.
However, in the opinion of Minister of the Interior Thomas Strobl, stricter penalties are not necessary: "Legislative action to sanction illegal motor vehicle races more severely is not seen," says the paper of the Ministry of the Interior.

The first time I was almost 10 years ago in Antarctica, where I saw my first icebergs.
I was seized with awe.
My heart was racing, dizzy as I tried to grasp what was before me.
The icebergs around me protruded almost 60 meters out of the water, and I could only be amazed that this was a snowflake on another snowflake, year after year.
Icebergs are born as the calf of a glacier or by breaking out of ice floes.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They interact in a clear way with their environment and their experiences.
Some refuse to give up and cling to the bitter end, while others can no longer stand it and collapse in a fit of dramatic passion.
When you look at an iceberg, it's easy to think that they are isolated, separate and alone, just as we humans often see ourselves.
But the truth is far from that.
As an iceberg melts, I inhale its prehistoric atmosphere.
As the iceberg melts, it releases mineral-rich drinking water that feeds many life forms.
In my photographs of these icebergs, I proceed as if I were making portraits of my ancestors, aware that they exist in this way in these individual moments, and will never exist like that again.
It is not death when they melt; it is not an end, but a continuation of their path along the life cycle.
Part of the ice in the icebergs I photograph is very young - a few thousand years old.
And part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old.
The last pictures I would like to show you show an iceberg that I photographed in Kekertsuatsiak in Greenland.

This is the average size of a Greenland iceberg.
It protrudes about 120 feet from the water, or 40 meters.
And this video is in real-time.

Thank you.

Nuremberg: Unauthorized tuning meeting - Police intervene, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and at times over 1000 people participated Saturday night in a "tuning meeting" in the parking lot of a furniture store.
The police implemented their announcement to increase their control of such events.
A big tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (25 July 2020) in the southern part of Nuremberg.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the police of Middle Franconia, around 10: 30 p.m., the Nuremberg traffic police found an increased number of vehicles in the area of a large parking lot in Ingolstädter Straße.
As a result, the police carried out a large number of vehicle inspections there.
Only recently, the police had announced that they wanted to take stronger action against so-called autoposers.
Illegal tuning meeting in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the "scene"
The officials counted at the top a good 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, reports the police.
Of this, however, only a small part of those present can be assigned to the "autoposer" and tuning scene.
Apparently, most of the relevant scene complied with the appeal of the police.
On the basis of the vehicles and persons located on site, it can be assumed that these were predominantly onlookers.
In addition, the vast majority of those present adhered to the applicable infection protection regulations, in particular compliance with the minimum distance and wearing a mouth-nose protection.
The control measures carried out on site were completed around 1: 00 am.
In total, the officials found such structural changes in 10 vehicles that the operating permit had expired.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No car races
There were no illegal car races.

Figures from the employment agency: 900 suspected cases of abuse in short-time work
Berlin - According to its own statement, the Federal Employment Agency (BA) is investigating around 900 suspected cases of abuse of short-time work allowances.
"This is extremely little for more than 880,000 companies that have reported short-time work," said Daniel Terzenbach, the executive board member responsible for operations, to the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung."

Indications of abuse often come from the affected employees or trade unions.
In addition, the BA uses analysis software to detect abuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible wave of insolvency in the autumn.
"Will there be significantly more insolvencies than in the previous year?
The assessments differ, but we are preparing ourselves for the event of the case and are already training our employees in the employment agencies for processing applications for insolvency money. "
The figures are still inconspicuous, said Terzenbach.

The number of confirmed cases rose to 48, according to the state authorities in Linz.
More than 100 results were still outstanding in the evening.
Accordingly, many of the infected are young interns in tourism businesses, but at least one holiday guest was tested positive.
Residents, guests and tourism staff were asked to stay in their accommodations on Saturday night.
The curfew was set at 23 o'clock.
"There are cancellations and cancellations there and there" of bookings, said the head of the Wolfgangsee Tourism Association, Hans Wieser, to the dpa.
Sporadic guests also left early.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist resort in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, around one third of the guests are Germans.
On Friday, the first infections became public knowledge.
The head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended on Saturday the behavior of the interns, who had celebrated in several restaurants and could have been infected there.
"We all enjoyed doing this in our youth," he told the radio station Ö1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The tourism association launched an information campaign to raise awareness among young employees of the dangers of COVID-19.
Starting on Saturday, hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from 15 July were contacted.
The outbreak evokes memories of the Austrian ski and party resort of Ischgl in Tyrol, which was a center of the spread of COVID-19 throughout Europe in the early stages of the pandemic.
In total, more than 1500 people in Austria are currently infected with the virus.
The focus of new infections is on Vienna and Upper Austria.

They all know that what I'm about to say is true.
The intuition that inequality weakens social cohesion existed even before the French Revolution.
What's new is that we now have evidence. We can compare societies, more equal and more unequal, and see what inequality does.
I would like to show you statistics and explain why there are connections between them.
Look, what a poor bunch we are.
(Laughter) I want to start with a paradox.
This shows life expectancy and gross national income - on average in rich countries.
You see that the countries on the right, Norway and the USA, for example, are twice as rich as Israel, Greece, Portugal on the left.
And that doesn't change their life expectancy at all.
Nothing speaks for a connection.
But within societies there are enormous social disparities in health across society.
Here, once again, life expectancy.
Here are small areas in England and Wales - the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.
A big difference between the poor and the rest of us.
Even the people just below the top are in worse health than those at the very top.
So income is very important within individual societies, and none at all between them.
The explanation for this paradox is that within societies we are dealing with a relative income, the social position, the status - where we stand in relation to each other, and how large the distances between us are.
And when you understand this, you immediately ask yourself: What happens when the differences get bigger, or smaller, when income disparities rise or fall?
And that's what I'm showing you now.
Not with hypothetical data.
Using data from the UN - the same that the World Bank uses - on the extent of income disparities in rich developed market democracies.
The measure we use, because it's easy to understand and available for download, is how much richer the top 20 percent are than the bottom 20 percent of each country.
You see that in the same countries on the left - Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden - the top 20 percent are around 3 ½, 4 times as rich as the bottom 20 percent.
But on the other hand - Britain, Portugal, the US, Singapore - the differences are twice as large.
On this scale, we are twice as unequal as some of the other successful market democracies.
Now I'll show you what that does to our societies.
We have collected data on problems with social gradients, the problems that are more common at the bottom of the social ladder.
Internationally comparable data on life expectancy, children's mathematics, reading and writing skills, infant mortality and murder rates, what proportion of the population is imprisoned, teenage pregnancies, trust, obesity, mental illnesses - which include drug and alcohol addiction in standard diagnostics - and social mobility.
We have summarized them in an index.
All with the same weight.
For each country there is a kind of average of these factors.
And here you see it in relation to the degree of inequality that I have shown you, to which I will return again and again.
The more unequal countries perform worse on all these social problems.
This is an unusually high correlation.
But if you put the same index of health and social problems in relation to GNI per capita, to gross national income, there is nothing left, no correlation.
We have worried that people think we have only chosen the problems that support our reasoning and constructed this evidence, so we have also published an article in the British Medical Journal on the UNICEF Index of Child Welfare.
In it, 40 different components were put together by other people.
The index contains whether children can talk to their parents, whether they have books at home, their immunization rates, whether there is bullying at school.
Everything flows in.
Here is the index relative to our inequality values.
Children perform worse in unequal societies.
A highly significant ratio.
And again, when comparing the child's welfare index to national per capita income, there is no correlation, not even a hint.
All the data I've shown you so far say the same thing.
The average well-being of our societies no longer depends on national income and economic growth.
These are crucial in poorer countries, but not in the rich developed world.
But the differences between us, where we stand in comparison to each other has become very important.
I will now show you individual parts of our index.
Here, for example, is trust.
Simply the proportion of the population that believes that most people can be trusted.
The data comes from the World Values Survey.
On the more unequal side, about 15 percent of the population believe that others can be trusted.
But in the same societies, the figure is as high as 60 or 65 percent.
And for the degree of integration into communal life or social capital, there are similarly close references to inequality.
We've done all this work twice.
First with the rich, developed countries, and then in a second test field again with the 50 American states - with the same question: do the more unequal states perform worse on all these scales?
Here, according to a data collection by the US government, trust is related to inequality.
A very similar distribution over a similar range of degrees of trust.
The same thing is happening here.
Our fundamental result is that almost all factors that are internationally associated with trust do the same in the 50 US states, in a separate test environment.
And that's not just a happy coincidence.
Here are mental illnesses.
WHO compiled these figures by conducting the same diagnostic interviews with randomly selected test subjects in order to compare the rates of mental illness in societies.
This is the percentage of the population who were mentally ill last year.
It ranges from 8 percent to three times that - entire societies that have three times as high rates of mental illness as others.
And again, a high correlation to inequality.
And here violence.
These red dots are American states, the blue triangles are Canadian provinces.
Note the scale of differences.
It ranges from 15 murders per million to 150.
This is the proportion of the population that is in prison.
Here there is about a tenfold difference on the lateral log scale.
It ranges from about 40 to 400 detained people.
This ratio is not primarily caused by higher crime rates.
In some places, this is a sub-factor.
But the main reason is tougher court rulings.
And more unequal societies are also more likely to adhere to the death penalty.
Here are children dropping out of school.
Again pretty big differences.
With devastating effects on the use of talents of the population.
Here is social mobility.
Actually a measurement of mobility based on income.
The question is: Do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons, or is there no connection between them?
On the more unequal side, fathers' income is much more important -- in the UK, in the US.
And in the Scandinavian countries, fathers' income is much less crucial.
There is more social mobility.
We like to say - and I know that many Americans are here in the audience - if Americans want to live the American Dream, they should go to Denmark.
(Laughter) (Applause) I've just introduced you to a few things.
I could have shown you a lot of other problems.
All of these problems are more common at the lower end of the social gradient.
But there are countless problems with social gradients that are worse in more unequal countries - not just a bit, but somewhere between 2 times and 10 times as common.
Imagine these costs, the human costs.
But I would like to come back to the graph again, in which we have summarized everything to show two things.
On the one hand, graph by graph shows that the countries that do poorly, regardless of the outcome, are apparently the more unequal, and those that do better seem to be the Nordic countries and Japan.
So what we see is a general social dysfunction that goes hand in hand with inequality.
This applies not only to one or two things, but to most.
The other very important aspect of this graph can be seen here below, Sweden and Japan - in many ways very different countries.
The position of women, how much they cling to the nuclear family, here they lie at opposite poles of the rich, developed world.
Another very important difference is how they achieve their greater equality.
In Sweden there are huge differences in earnings offset by taxation, the general welfare state, generous social benefits, etc.
It's completely different in Japan.
There are already smaller differences in earnings before the tax.
There are lower taxes.
A smaller welfare state.
And in our analysis of the American states we find the same contrast.
Some states are successful through redistribution, others are doing well because they have small income differences before the tax.
Our conclusion is that it doesn't matter so much how you get to greater equality as long as you somehow achieve it.
I don't mean perfect equality, I'm talking about something that already exists in rich market democracies.
Another surprising part of the picture is that it is not only the poor who are affected by inequality.
Apparently there is some truth in John Donne's "No one is an island."
In several studies, one can compare how people in more or less the same countries perform at every level of the social hierarchy.
This is just one example.
Infant mortality.
Some Swedes have kindly classified much of their infant deaths according to the British Register of Socio-Economic Classification.
This is an anachronistic classification according to the professions of the fathers, so single parents are led separately.
But where "low social class" is noted, this means unskilled handicraft activities.
Then there are the learned craft professions in the middle, then the subordinate non-craft, up to the higher-located professions - doctors, lawyers, executives of larger companies.
You can see that Sweden is better than Britain, across the entire social hierarchy.
The biggest differences are down in society.
But even at the top, living in a more equal society seems to bring a small advantage.
We show this in five different data sets that deal with educational success and health in the USA and internationally.
That seems to be the case in general - greater equality matters the most at the bottom, but has some advantages even at the top.
But I should say something about what is happening.
I am interested in the psychosocial effects of inequality.
This has to do with feelings of superiority and inferiority, the feeling of being valued or devalued, respected or despised.
And, of course, the feeling of status competition that results from it drives consumerism in our society.
It also leads to status uncertainty.
We are more concerned about how we are judged by others, whether we are seen as attractive, smart, etc.
The socially assessing judgments are increasing, and the fear of these judgments.
Interestingly, there is similar research in social psychology: some people have evaluated 208 different studies in which volunteers were invited to psychological labs to measure their stress hormones and their response to stressful tasks.
What interested them in the evaluation was which types of stress most reliably raised the cortisol level, that of the central stress hormone.
And the result was: Tasks that posed a threat to social assessment - threats to self-confidence or social status in which others can judge their own performance negatively.
These types of stress have a very specific effect on the physiology of stress.
We have been criticized.
Of course, there are people who don't get this done and people who find it very amazing.
I should tell you, however, if we are criticized for a targeted selection of our data, we never select specifically for our purposes.
Our absolute principle is: if our data source has data for one of the countries we are looking at, it will be included in the analysis.
Our data source determines whether it is reliable data, not us.
Anything else would be bias.
What about other countries?
There are 200 studies on health relative to income and equality in academic peer-reviewed journals.
This is not limited to these countries, this is a very simple demonstration.
The same countries, the same inequality scale, one problem after another.
Why don't we check other factors?
We have shown that per capita income makes no difference.
And, of course, others with more sophisticated methods have also reviewed poverty and education, and more.
What about causality?
A correlation does not yet prove causality.
We've spent a lot of time with that.
In fact, people know the causal relationships very well in some of these results.
The big news in our understanding of the drivers of long-term health in the rich developed world is how much chronic social stress strains the immune system, the cardiovascular system.
Or, for example, the reason why violence is more prevalent in more unequal societies is because people are sensitive to being despised.
To cope with this, we need to clarify what happens after the tax and what happens before the tax.
We have to limit the income, the bonus culture income at the top.
We must hold our bosses accountable to employees as best we can.
But the message to take away is that we can improve the actual quality of human life if we address the income disparities between us.
Suddenly there is a lever for the psychosocial well-being of entire societies, and that is very exciting.
Thank you.

Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualified for Champions League
London (dpa) - The English football record champions Manchester United are returning to the Champions League after a year of absence.
The Red Devils secured third place in the league on the last day of the Premier League by a 2: 0 (0: 0) success against their direct competitor Leicester City.
The Foxes now have to be content with the Europa League, because FC Chelsea still passed by and also qualified for the premier class in fourth place.
In the fight against the descent, Aston Villa was allowed to cheer.
Manchester United took the lead with a penalty kick from Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in injury time, Jesse Lingard (90 + 8) scored to the final score.
Chelsea, in the Champions League round of 16 opponent of FC Bayern, won thanks to Mason Mount (45th + 1) and Olivier Giroud (45th + 4) in parallel with 2: 0 (2: 0) against the Wolverhampton Wanderers.
"That means a lot to me," said coach Frank Lampard, who in his first season as Chelsea coach is also in the FA Cup final against Arsenal.
Chelsea's victory against Wolverhampton also benefited Tottenham Hotspur, who passed the Wolves with a meagre 1: 1 (1: 0) at Crystal Palace and started sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa decided the long-distance duel with FC Watford and AFC Bournemouth for itself, but had to tremble for a long time for the league at West Ham United.
The late lead of Jack Grealish (84th) was immediately compensated by Andrej Yarmolenko (85th).
The 1: 1 (0: 0) was enough, however, because Watford lost 2: 3 (1: 3) to Arsenal.
The club, which lost three coaches in the season, is relegated after five first-league years.
Just like Bournemouth, which could no longer save itself by a 3: 1 (2: 1) at Everton FC.
In the end, one point was missing.
Liverpool FC, which has been the English champion since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3: 1 (1: 1) victory at Newcastle United.
99 points are the highest score the Reds have ever scored in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team narrowly missed the points record in English football.
Manchester City holds the record with 100 points in the 2017 / 18 season.
After the Newcastle lead in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) turned Sunday's game for Liverpool.
"It was an extraordinary season for this wonderful club," said goalscorer van Dijk after the game, "that should spur us on to defend the title.
It will be difficult. "
The Premier League bosses should also be satisfied in the end.
Due to the coronavirus crisis, football operations in England were interrupted from 13 March to 17 June.
In the meantime, it was even discussed about a premature termination or a holding of the remaining games on neutral ground.
Finally, however, the season could be played to the end without special incidents - but as in Germany without spectators in the stadiums.

I would like to show you today how we will manufacture things in the future.
I believe that our buildings and machines will soon assemble, duplicate and repair themselves.
I will show you what I consider to be today's production methods, and then compare them with some natural systems.
In the current manufacturing industry, we have skyscrapers - two and a half years [construction period], half to a million parts, quite complex, new and exciting technologies of steel, concrete, glass.
We have exciting machines that take us into space - five years [construction time], two and a half million parts.
On the other hand, if you look at natural systems, you'll find proteins that have two million types and can fold in ten microseconds, or DNA with three billion base pairs that can be copied in about an hour.
So there's all this complexity in our natural systems, but they're extremely efficient, much more efficient than anything we can make, far more complex than anything we can build.
They are much more energy efficient.
They almost never make mistakes.
And they are durable because they can repair themselves.
So there are a lot of interesting things to discover in natural systems.
And if we manage to let that flow into our built environment, then we have an exciting potential for new construction methods.
And I believe that the key is self-assembly.
If we want to use self-assembly in our physical environment, I think there are four key factors.
The first is that we need to decipher all the complexity of the things we want to build - our buildings and machines.
And we have to translate that into simple sequences - the DNA of how our buildings work, so to speak.
Then we need programmable parts that can use this sequence and use it to fold or reconfigure.
We need activation energy so that our parts from the program can fold up.
And we need a kind of redundancy for error correction to really create what we want to build.
I'll show you some projects that my colleagues and I are working on at MIT so that self-assembly can be realized in the future.
The first two are MacroBot and DeciBot.
These projects are large-scale, reconfigurable robots - two and a half to four meter long proteins.
They are equipped with electromechanical devices, sensors.
You decode what you want to fold into a sequence of angles - minus 120, minus 120, 0, 0, 120, minus 120 - something like that; a sequence of angles, or rotations, and you send that sequence through the chain.
Each unit picks up its message - that is, minus 120 - it rotates accordingly, checks whether it has arrived, and forwards it to the neighboring unit.
These are the brilliant scientists, engineers and designers who worked on this project.
And I think it makes one thing really clear: Is this really scalable?
I mean, thousands of dollars, many hours of work to create this two and a half meter high robot.
Can we really scale that up? Can we really embed robotics in every part?
The next project questions this and looks at the passive nature or the passive attempt to make reconfiguration programmable.
But it goes one step further and tries to make actual calculations possible.
It basically integrates the most fundamental component of EDP, the digital logic gate, directly into the parts.
This is a NAND gate.
You have a tetrahedron, which is the gate that will do the calculations, and you have two input tetrahedrons.
One represents the input of the user while making the blocks.
The other comes from the previous component that was arranged.
And then it delivers an output in three-dimensional space.
This means that the user can enter what the components should do.
It performs calculations based on what it has done before and what the user requires of it.
And now it begins to move in three-dimensional space - up and down.
On the left side, the input [1,1] corresponds to the output 0 going down.
On the right side, the input [0,0] corresponds to the output 1 that goes up.
What that really means is that our structures now contain the plans of what we want to build.
So you have all the information about what has been built.
This means we can achieve some form of self-replication.
In this case, I call it self-directed replication because the structure contains the exact blueprints.
If errors occur, a part can be replaced.
All the local information is integrated to show how to fix it.
So you could have something that climbs and reads along and delivers an output of one to one.
It is directly integrated; there are no outside instructions.
The last project I'm going to show is called Biased Chains, and it's arguably the most exciting example of self-mounting systems we have at the moment.
It takes up the ability for reconfiguration and programming and creates a completely passive system.
Basically, you have a chain of elements.
Each element is completely identical and they are polarized.
Every chain, or element, wants to turn to the right or to the left.
So while you're putting the chain together, you're basically programming it.
Each unit is told whether it should turn to the right or to the left.
When you shake the chain, it folds together into a configuration that you have programmed in - in this case a spiral or, in this case, two adjacent cubes.
So you can basically program every possible three-dimensional form - or one-dimensional, two-dimensional - completely passively into this chain.
What does that tell us about the future?
I think it tells us that there are ways of self-assembly, replication, and repair in our physical structures, buildings, and machines.
There are new ways of programming in these parts.
And this creates new possibilities for IT.
We will have spatial programming.
Imagine our buildings, bridges, machines, all our components could do calculations.
That would mean parallel and distributed computing power, new design possibilities.
So there is an exciting potential for that.
I think these projects I've shown here are just a tiny step toward this future as we implement these new technologies for a new, self-creating world.
Thank you.

Arrests and violence at demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against Prime Minister Netanyahu are becoming increasingly fierce.
During the night there were violent clashes.
The Israeli police took violent action on Sunday night in Jerusalem against participants in a demonstration against the right-wing conservative Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu.
Twelve people have been arrested for participating in riots, said police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld.
Among other things, the police used water cannons to disperse the rally.
According to media reports, a total of around 6,000 people gathered near Netanyahu's official residence on Saturday evening.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu's handling of the COVID-19 crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew horns, and called on Netanyahu to resign.
Participants in a counter-demonstration who supported Netanyahu have also been arrested, reported the news website "ynet."
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the head of government's private villa in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
According to the police, a man was arrested near Tel Aviv because he is suspected of having sprayed pepper spray from a moving car onto demonstrators on the roadside.
Another man was arrested after a stabbing attack on a demonstrator in the south of the country.
The demonstrator was slightly injured in the neck.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv there have recently been several demonstrations against Netanyahu.
The rallies accompany the corruption trial against the head of government.
Recently, Netanyahu has also been criticized for his handling of the COVID-19 crisis.

North Korea seals off border town after suspected corona case
So far, North Korea has seen its own measures to ward off the coronavirus as a "shining success."
The country is now reporting a suspected case for the first time.
Because of a first official suspected corona case in the country, North Korea has completely sealed off a major city for fear of a catastrophe.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defenses in the past six months, "the malignant virus may have been introduced into the country," the state media reported.
A state of emergency has been declared for the region around the border town of Kaesong.
The Communist leadership declared the highest level of alarm.
Should the suspected case be confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the isolated country.
According to its own statements, North Korea has not yet registered a single infection and described its defensive measures as a "shining success."
The information was doubted abroad.
The disease symptoms were reportedly found in an "outlier" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
The person fled to South Korea three years ago and has now returned across the border.
There was initially no confirmation from South Korea for crossing the border within the four-kilometre-wide and for the most part still mined military buffer zone.
However, according to reports by the national news agency Yonhap, South Korea's military acknowledged the possibility of an illegal border crossing to North Korea as high.

Tension ahead of Council meeting: City East and noise protection are still under discussion before a big summer break
"In addition to environmental topics, the committee members will also vote on the development plan for the large-scale project Innenstadtentwicklung-Ost," it says rather casually in the middle section of the city's press release on the next city council meeting on Tuesday, July 28, at 4.30 pm in the Great Hall of the CongressCentrum Pforzheim.
Above all, the upgrading of the eastern city is controversially discussed until the end.
The majorities for this are scarce, most recently even negative in individual committees depending on attendance.
An appeal from business (construction, real estate, trade and IT) not to let the project developed by the citizens and then by the administration and the municipal council fail after almost ten years of preparation, criticized project opponent Reinhard Klein as an "extra-parliamentary opposition," "clueless," "speculation," "defamation" and "deliberate false statements."
"Everyone thinks they know better," says Klein, who has been a member of the municipal council for a year as the only representative of the citizens' list of Pforzheim.
In fact, after reading the contracts, he was in this position: "I know what I'm talking about."
The exit comes the city cheaper, the Technical Town Hall is contrary to statements of the city administration after subsidies, of whose existence Klein is convinced to renovate for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop quite differently than one predicts in the town hall and on the part of the supporters from the economy.
Shaping the city by its own power and not an investor: That is his plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP / FW / UB / LED parliamentary group, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
Essentially, it also envisages the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, keeping the Schloßberg open, renting the Ex-Thales for administrative areas and a smaller-scale inner-city redesign, ideally with local sponsors.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues in particular will play a central role.
Among other things, the local council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the population of Pforzheim from health noise pollution caused by road traffic, many of which include speed reductions.
In a press release, the local Verkehrsclub Deutschland welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of the fact that this must come so, because they have only contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus noise through neglect of the regular bus service with thinned-out cycles and through little commitment to cycling, according to the VCD.
The municipal council also votes on the participation of the city of the Energy and Climate Protection Agency Pforzheim / Enzkreis.
The agenda also includes accession to the Climate Protection Pact of the state of Baden-Württemberg, the resetting of parental contributions in municipal day-care centres and the application for inclusion in the federal government's smart city funding.

Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with a lot of delay
With a delay of almost half a year, Tim Zimmermann will start his debut season in the ADAC GT Masters on 31 July.
Before the league of super sports cars can start regular operation, the first test drives were due.
For Zimmermann, it was all about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 better.
The corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from tackling his first business trip in the new Lamborghini Huracan from Grasser Racing.
This was now possible under special hygiene conditions.
The 23-year-old from Langenargen completed his first laps at the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his debut in the GT3 car.
"There are already a few things that are different from the Porsche from the previous season," says Zimmermann.
"With the ABS, for example, you have to go into corners differently.
But it was really a lot of fun. "
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite being only 25 years old, the Dutchman is already experienced in GT racing and was able to help his new team-mate in many ways.
"I'm not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series also brings new challenges," says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I understand each other brilliantly and we have also made enormous progress from session to session at the Lausitzring."
Exactly there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also host its first race.
From 31 July, the 33 super sports cars will race through Lusatia.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 serial newcomers, knows the track though.
In 2015 he was most recently a guest at the Motodrom.
"It worked quickly and I didn't have much to get used to the track," says Zimmermann, who is starting for the Graf Zeppelin racing community in Friedrichshafen.
"The Lausitzring has many fast passages that you have to hit optimally to be fast."
How fast Zimmermann really is will be revealed in two weeks.
"Of course, the teams play poker a little during the tests," he says.
"In the end, however, we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring."
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a tightly packed calendar.
Seven races are scheduled until the beginning of November.
The current status is that no spectators will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.

British transport minister caught cold by quarantine decision
The British government's decision to put holidaymakers in Spain under quarantine for two weeks after their return has, according to press reports, caught the country's transport minister off guard.
Accordingly, Grant Shapps is currently on holiday in Spain, of all places, while his colleagues at home decided on the measure on Saturday.
Because of the rising corona numbers in Spain, the cabinet in London removed the country from the list of countries from which entry is possible without quarantine requirements.
The new regulation applies from today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to be quarantined after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But the regulation applies to those who are just on holiday on the cut-off date, only from Saturday, August 1, and was not introduced overnight.
Incidentally, Spain is still regarded in Austria as one of the "safe countries" for which no quarantine in Austria is required.
"Many ministers may have known in advance that there is a possibility that a quarantine will be imposed on vacationers in Spain," commented Labour MP Diane Abbot.
"But apparently no one bothered to tell Grant Shapps."

Do you know how many species of flowering plants there are?
A quarter of a million - that is the number of known species - a quarter of a million species of flowering plants.
And flowers are real devil studs.
Plants have great difficulty producing them.
They require an enormous amount of energy and raw materials.
Why are they making this effort?
The answer is, of course, like so much in the world: sex.
I know what you're thinking of when you look at these pictures.
And the answer to why sexual reproduction is so important -- there are many other ways for plants to reproduce.
Let's take offshoots; they can have sex with themselves, so to speak; they can pollinate themselves.
But they actually have to spread their genes to mix them with other genes so that they can occupy ecological niches.
This is how evolution works.
Plants pass on this information about pollen.
Some of you may have seen some of these pictures before.
As I always say, everyone would have to have a scanning electron microscope at home to see them.
There are as many different types of pollen as there are flowering plants.
And that's very useful for forensics and so on.
Most of the pollen that triggers hay fever in us comes from plants that use the wind to spread their pollen. This is a very inefficient process, which is why so much of it ends up in our noses.
Because the plants hurl out very large quantities, in the hope that the male sex cells that are in the pollen will only hit another flower by chance.
All grasses, i.e. all cereal plants and most trees, transport pollen through the wind.
But most species use insects for their own purposes. And that's the smarter way, as less pollen is needed.
The insects and other species can bring the pollen directly to its destination.
We are, of course, aware of the relationship between insects and plants.
Whether flies, birds or bees, they also benefit from it, usually through the nectar.
This symbiosis has led to some wonderful adjustments - the hummingbird hawkmoth is a beautiful adaptation.
The plant benefits from the fact that the hummingbird spreads the pollen further.
Plants have developed small runways for bees that would otherwise not find their way.
On many plants are markings that resemble other insects.
These are the dust bags of a lily, a very clever construction. When an unsuspecting insect lands on it, the bags fold up and hit the insect on the back, where the pollen gets stuck and taken to other plants.
This is an orchid that looks like it has a mouth. The insects are forced to crawl out and are covered with pollen.
There are at least 20,000 orchid species - an impressive variety.
And they have all sorts of tricks up their sleeve.
They must attract pollinators to help them.
This orchid, known from the investigations of Charles Darwin, who put forward a great thesis at its sight. You see a very long nectar tube going down from the orchid.
And what insects have to do there in the middle of the flower - they have to put their little proboscis in there and put the whole nectar tube down to get to the nectar.
And when Darwin saw this flower he said, "Something must have developed in parallel."
And indeed, here is this insect.
Usually it rolls up the trunk, but in its stretched shape it looks like this.
You can imagine that if nectar is so valuable and costly for the plant to produce and attracts many pollinators, then it's like human sex, people start deceiving.
They say, "I have nectar, will you come and get it for yourself?"
This is a plant.
This is a plant that insects in South Africa simply love, and they have developed a long proboscis to get the nectar.
And this is an imitator,
a plant that copies the original.
And here is the fly with a long trunk that has not received nectar from the imitator. Because the imitator, unlike the fly expected, has no nectar at all.
But the fly has not only received no nectar, it also has - if you look very closely, at the head end of the trunk you can see pollen that it would have transferred to other plants if only a botanist had not come by and glued it to blue paper.
(Laughter) Deception runs through the whole plant kingdom.
These black dots on the flower, they look like black dots to us, but for male insects of certain species they look like two females that are very hot.
(Laughter) And when the insect lands there, it picks up pollen that takes it to more plants. If you look at the "everyone-household-should-have-one" electron microscope image, you'll see that there are certain three-dimensional patterns.
It probably not only looks good for the insect, but also feels good.
And these electron microscope images - here one of an orchid imitating an insect - show that different parts of the shape have different colors and seemingly different surfaces, and for the perception of an insect, the textures are very, very different.
This plant has developed the imitation of a shiny metallic surface, as seen on some beetles.
And under the electron microscope, you can see that this surface is very different from the one we have looked at so far.
Sometimes the whole plant imitates an insect, even in our perception.
I think that looks like a flying animal.
It's a wonderful thing.
This one is clever. It's called Obsidium.
I sometimes regard them as malice.
For certain bees, it looks like another, particularly aggressive bee, so it flies there and hits it several times on the head to drive it away and naturally absorbs a lot of pollen.
At the same time, this plant imitates another orchid that provides a rich food supply for insects.
But this one has nothing for her.
So she cheats on two levels - fabulous.
(Laughter) Here we see the Cananga tree, an ingredient of many perfumes.
I smelled one of someone earlier.
The flowers should actually not be so colorful.
They send a fantastic spectrum of scents to all insects.
This one doesn't smell so good.
This is a flower that really smells very hideous and that has evolved to imitate carrion.
Therefore, flies love them.
They fly in and pollinate them.
This is a Helicodiceros, also known as "dead horse."
I don't know what a dead horse smells like, but the plant probably hits it quite well.
It's really terrible.
And blowflies cannot hold back.
They fly straight to the back
and lay their eggs there, they think it's carrion, without realizing that there is no food for the eggs that die because of it, but the plant benefits from it as the fly full of pollen flies on again and pollinates the next flower - fantastic.
This is Arum maculatum, the spotted Aronstab.
I photographed him last week in Dorset.
It heats up to about 15 ° above ambient temperature - fascinating.
And when you look inside the plant, there is a kind of barrier behind the inflorescences. Flies are attracted by the heat that creates volatile chemicals, and are then trapped at the bottom of the container.
They drink the wonderful nectar and are sticky afterwards.
At night they get a pollen shower and then the bristles we saw above slacken, giving way to the mosquitoes that are full of pollen - great thing.
If you think that's great, now comes one of my favorites.
This is the Philodendron Selloum.
If someone from Brazil is here, you will know the plant.
It is really fascinating.
This species Phallus there is about 30cm long.
And it does something that no other plant I know does, when it blooms. There in the middle are the inflorescences - for about 2 days it has a metabolism that is very similar to that of mammals.
Instead of feeding on starch, which is the food of plants, it takes something similar to brown adipose tissue and burns it so quickly that the fat burning rate, the metabolism, corresponds to that of a small cat.
This is twice the energy production of a hummingbird, in relation to weight - insanely impressive.
But he still does something that is unusual.
It not only heats up to 43 to 44 ° C for approximately 2 days, but also maintains a constant temperature.
It can regulate its temperature and thus keep it constant.
They ask themselves, "Why is he doing this?"
As you can imagine, there are some bugs that love to mate at this temperature.
And they fly in and start.
(Laughter) And the plant showers them with pollen, and they fly on and pollinate.
What a wonderful thing.
The typical pollinator for us is an insect. But in the tropics, many birds and butterflies also pollinate.
And many tropical flowers are red and we believe this is because birds and butterflies look similar to us and therefore can see the color red very well.
If you look at the spectrum of birds and people, we see red, green and blue so this spectrum here.
Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet and different levels of ultraviolet.
So something that goes beyond our spectrum.
And I hear you asking, "Wouldn't it be great if we could see that too?"
Of course, we can.
So what does an insect see?
Last week I photographed this sunflower in Dorset.
As you can see, these are small yellow flowers, small yellow flowers everywhere.
And that's what they look like in visible light.
That's what it looks like when you remove the red.
Most bees don't see red.
And then I photographed with ultraviolet filters and exposed the special ultraviolet frequencies for a very, very long time and that came out.
And that's a fantastic target.
We don't know exactly what bees see, just like you don't know what I see when I say "That's red."
We cannot look into the thoughts of insects or other people.
But the contrast will be something like that. It stands out against the background.
Here is another small flower - different bandwidth of ultraviolet frequencies, other filters similar to pollinators.
And that's what they would see.
If you now think all yellow flowers have this property - no flower was harmed for this picture; it was only attached to the tripod, not killed - but under ultraviolet light it looks like this.
And that could serve as the basis of a sunscreen, because sunscreens absorb UV light.
The substances in the plant could be helpful.
Finally, we have an evening primrose that Bjorn Rorslett sent me from Norway - fantastic hidden patterns.
I love the idea of hidden things.
I think there is something poetic about it, namely that these images were taken with UV filters, filters that are mainly used by astronomers to photograph Venus - more precisely, its nebulae.
That is the main purpose of these filters.
Venus is the goddess of love and fertility, and that, in turn, is the story of flowers.
And flowers not only show great efforts to attract pollinators, they also manage that we plant large fields full of them and give them to each other at births and deaths, and especially at weddings, which, when you think about it, are the moment when the exchange of genetic material from one organism to another is determined.
Thank you very much.

FC Bayern München: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start into the hot preparation phase for the Champions League began for double winner FC Bayern with a setback.
Hansi Flick, who recovered "reasonably well" after a short vacation and a few days of training, already has to consider after the first team training how he can rebuild his successful defense after the injury of world champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who has the third most minutes of action behind captain Manuel Neuer and midfield boss Joshua Kimmich, suffered a band injury at the left foot root and threatens to be missing in decisive king-class duels.
In the Munich dirty weather, the right-wing defender broke off a training game and was driven off the field with a golf kart.
How long the unrestricted regular player has to pause in the fight for the title is an open question.
An appearance in the second leg of the round of 16 against FC Chelsea on 8 August should hardly be possible, the 24-year-old can hope for the final tournament starting in Lisbon on 12 August.
Bayern, however, do not want to be stopped by the mishap from training on Sunday.
In his personal triple formula, Flick named the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on their way to Portugal's capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration are to show his victory-hungry title collectors in the ideally following 28 days until the king-class final on August 23.
"We have mastered the mandatory tasks with championship and cup simply excellently.
Now it's time to create something special, "said Flick.
Until the Munich team can concretely deal with the final tournament and previously a training camp in the Algarve, however, the round of 16 obligation against FC Chelsea is due for the first time.
After the 3: 0 in the first leg before the corona break, the Londoners should not become a Bayern nightmare again in their home arena as in the lost "Finale dahoam" 2012.
"We have to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and gain confidence with a good game, "demanded Flick.
A test to get in the mood is scheduled for Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn his stars, who had 13 days of vacation after the double, to a unique August.
He welcomed 31 players to Säbener Straße, including the new players around Edel-Einkauf Leroy Sané, who met all new colleagues on the pitch for the first time after his move from Manchester City.
"Like all newcomers, Leroy has fitted in well," reported Flick.
But instead of talking about the new season, when Sané & amp; Co. are no longer only allowed to train, Flick preferred to talk about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of individual and small-group training, it is now being trained in team strength for the Londoners, who, in contrast to the Flick ensemble, are in the rhythm of play.
After that, Munich could face a quarter-final against FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, in the semi-finals Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are possible opponents.
A path to the final in Lisbon "is not quite so easy," stressed the head coach, who can rely on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training from Tuesday onwards.
The World Cup record scorer Klose and Flick know of so many a joint tournament preparation, which is particularly important in the 0-on-100 attunement.
Working with his current team is "a pleasure," praised Flick.
The "focus on winning" is an impressive trait of his team.
The tournament with nine-man teams was also ambitious on Sunday.
All of the top performers were there, including Thiago, who is willing to emigrate, and defender David Alaba, whose whereabouts are not secured beyond the king-class season.
