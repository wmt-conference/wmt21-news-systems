P. 381 Jan Christopher Horak wrote: "The film is a remarkable achievement of the director.
We're not supposed to know.
You could have known.
Please all take a moment to consider a very simple fact: Pretty much everything we know about the universe we know through light.
We can stand on the earth and look into the night sky and look at stars with our naked eyes.
The sun burns our peripheral vision.
We see light reflected from the moon.
and in the time that has elapsed since Galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope at the heavenly bodies, the known universe has traveled to us as visible light, traversing immeasurable ages of cosmic history.
With the help of all our modern telescopes, we have been able to study all this: this impressive silent movie of the universe, this series of snapshots that go back to the Big Bang.
But the universe is not a silent film, because the universe is not silent.
I want to convince you that the universe has a soundtrack and that this soundtrack is played in space itself: because space can vibrate like a drum.
It can sound a kind of recording that can be heard throughout the universe; of some of the most dramatic events as they occurred.
Now we would like to add a sonic component to the wonderful visual arrangement we have of the universe.
And even if we've never heard the sounds of the universe before, over the next few years we should slowly turn up the volume on what's happening out there.
Out of this ambition to capture songs of the universe, we turn our attention to black holes and their inherent promise. Black holes hammer against space-time like mallets on a drum. They have a very characteristic sound that I would like to play to you; or our idea of how this song will sound.
One day we might see a shadow cast by a black hole against a bright background, but so far we haven't.
And yet you can hear black holes, even if they are invisible. The reason for this is that they play on space-time like a drum.
We owe the idea that the universe sounds like a drum to Albert Einstein, to whom we owe so much.
Einstein realized that if space were empty, if the universe were empty, it would have to look like this picture, only without this helpful grid.
But if we were moving through space in free fall, even without this helpful grid, then maybe we could paint it ourselves. Because we would realize that we are moving along straight lines, along undistorted, straight paths through the universe.
Einstein also realized (and this is the point) that when you put energy or mass into the universe, it warps the universe. If a body in free fall passed, say, the sun, it would be distorted, along the natural curvature lines in space.
This is Einstein's great general theory of relativity.
Even light is bent along these paths.
And a body can be bent so much that it enters an orbit around the sun, like the earth, or like the moon in the earth's orbit.
These are natural curvatures in space.
What Einstein did not know was this: if you took the sun and squeezed it into a ball six kilometers in diameter, if you took something with a million times the mass of the Earth and squeezed it into six kilometers, you would create a black hole; a body of such density that light passing too close to it could never escape. It would be a black shadow in front of the universe.
But throughout his life, Einstein considered black holes to be a mathematical curiosity.
He didn't believe they really existed.
He was convinced that nature would protect us from their emergence.
It would be decades before the term "black hole" was coined and people understood that black holes are astrophysical bodies. In fact, they are the lifeless state form of extremely dense stars that collapse in a horrific catastrophe at the end of their lives.
Our sun, however, will not end up as a black hole.
It's just not big enough for that.
But we did a little thought experiment, just like Einstein liked to do. Let's imagine that we squeeze the sun to six kilometers in diameter and put a tiny earth in its orbit, say 30 km away from this black sun.
This earth would shine by itself (since the sun would have disappeared, there would be no other source of light) so we let our little earth shine by itself.
We could put the Earth into a carefree orbit about 30 km away from the crushed black hole.
This crushed black hole would be about the size of Manhattan.
It would pour a little more into the Hudson before it destroyed the earth.
But that's roughly what we're talking about.
We're talking about something you can squeeze until it's half the size of Manhattan.
Now we bring the Earth very close, down to about 30 km, and see how it moves in a completely perfect orbit around the black hole.
There is a kind of myth that black holes devour everything in the universe, but in fact you have to get very close to them to fall in.
But what is particularly impressive from our point of view is the fact that we can always see the Earth.
It cannot hide behind the black hole.
The light that comes from the earth, some of it falls in, but some is scattered and returns to us.
So you can't hide anything behind a black hole.
If this is Battlestar Galactica and you're fighting the Cylons, you better not hide behind the black hole.
They can see them.
So our sun will not collapse into a black hole, its mass is not sufficient for this. But there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
If one of them wiped out the Milky Way, this is what it would look like.
We would see a shadow of the black hole, against the backdrop of billions of stars of the Milky Way galaxy and their glowing dust lanes.
If we were to fall into this black hole, we would see all the light that would be bent around it, and we could even enter the shadow without noticing that something unusual is happening.
It would be bad if we tried to ignite our engines and escape, because we couldn't, any more than light can escape.
But even if the black hole is dark from the outside, it is not dark inside, because all the light of the galaxy could fall in behind us.
And although, due to a phenomenon of the theory of relativity (the so-called time dilation), our clocks seemed to go slower in relation to galactic time, it would look as if the evolution of the galaxy had accelerated and was shooting towards us, just before we were crushed to death by the black hole.
It would be like a near-death experience when you see the light at the end of the tunnel. However, it would be a comprehensive death experience.
(Laughter) And you couldn't tell anybody about the light at the end of the tunnel.
Now, we have never seen such a shadow of a black hole, but black holes can be heard, even if they are invisible.
Please imagine an astrophysically realistic situation. Imagine two black holes that have spent a long life together.
Perhaps they were once stars that collapsed into two black holes, each with a mass ten times that of the sun.
We are now squeezing them into a diameter of 60 km.
They can rotate several hundred times per second.
At the end of their lives, they orbit each other at nearly the speed of light.
They can travel thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second. And as they do so, they not only bend space, but they leave in their wake a sounding of space, a veritable wave of space-time.
Space is contracting and expanding as it pours out of these black holes and pounds the universe.
And they travel out into the cosmos at the speed of light.
We owe this computer simulation to a relativity working group at NASA Goddard.
It took almost 30 years for someone to solve this problem.
This was one of those groups.
Here we see two black holes orbiting each other, again with the helpful painted lines.
Maybe you can see - it's a little fuzzy - but if you see the red waves coming out, that's gravitational waves.
They actually represent the sound of space ringing and will exit these black holes at the speed of light as they become quieter and quieter, eventually merging into a spinning, silent black hole.
If you were close enough, the sound of space contracting and expanding would be booming in your ears.
You would literally be able to hear the sound.
Of course, your head would also be squeezed and stretched, which would be quite uncomfortable, which is why you would also have trouble understanding what is happening.
But I would like to play you what sounds we would predict here.
This is from my work group - a slightly less glamorous computer model.
Imagine that a lighter black hole falls into a very heavy black hole.
What you hear is the sound of the light black hole pounding the universe every time it passes close to it.
When it moves away again, it is a bit too quiet.
But it hits like a mallet and literally shatters the universe, making it vibrate like a drum.
We can predict how that will sound.
We know that when it falls in, it gets faster and louder.
And finally, we hear the little guy falling into the big guy.
I've never heard it so loud - it's really much more dramatic.
At home, it sounds rather disappointing.
More like ding, ding, ding.
This is another sound from my group.
No, I'm not going to show you any pictures, because black holes don't leave helpful ink trails. Space does not have colorful, painted lines.
But if you were floating around in space on a space holiday and you heard this, you'd want to get away.
(Laughter) You really should get away from that noise.
Both black holes are moving.
Both black holes are getting closer to each other.
In this case, they vibrate very strongly at first.
And then they merge.
This chirping is typical of the merging of two black holes, that it ends up chirping like this.
This is our idea of what we would see.
Fortunately, we are at a safe distance here in Long Beach, California.
But it is very likely that two black holes have just merged somewhere in the universe.
And it is just as certain that space is vibrating around us, having presumably taken millions of light years, or a million years to travel to us at the speed of light.
But the sound is far too quiet for us to ever hear it.
On Earth, experiments are being carried out with great zeal, one of which is called LIGO - to detect deviations in the way space contracts and expands again, deviations in the order of magnitude smaller than an atomic nucleus over a distance of four kilometers.
It is an incredibly ambitious project and its sensitivity will be further developed in the next few years - to be able to perceive this here.
There will also be a mission for space, which will hopefully be launched within the next ten years. Her name is LISA.
LISA will be able to see huge black holes, black holes with millions or billions of times the density of the sun.
In this image from the Hubble telescope, we see two galaxies.
They look as if they are frozen in an embrace.
Each probably harbors a huge black hole in its interior.
But they are not frozen. They merge with each other.
These two black holes collide and become one over the course of billions of years.
Our human perception is not capable of grasping a song of such duration.
But LISA could see the final stages of two giant black holes, earlier in the history of the universe, the last 15 minutes before they merge.
And it's not just about black holes, but also about all the big disturbances in the universe - and the biggest of all is the Big Bang.
When the term was coined, it was meant contemptuously - "Who believes in a big bang, a big bang?"
This animation by friends of mine at Proton Studios shows an exterior view of the Big Bang.
We never really want to try; we never want to be inside the universe, because you can never be outside the universe.
So imagine that you are in the Big Bang.
It is everywhere, all around you, and space is wafting and vibrating completely uncontrollably.
14 billion years go by, but this song still rings around us.
Galaxies form and generations of stars are born in these galaxies. And around one of these stars, at least a single one, orbits a habitable planet.
And here we sit, working like crazy on these experiments, doing calculations and writing computer code.
Imagine that a billion years ago, two black holes collided.
Her song has been ringing through space ever since, all the time.
We didn't even exist then.
It's getting closer and closer - 40,000 years ago we were still painting cave paintings.
If it was the Big Bang we were recording, that's what it would sound like.
It is literally the epitome of noise.
It's white noise, it's such a chaotic sound.
But it is all around us, probably anyway, if it hasn't been wiped out by some other process in the universe.
When we record it, it will sound like music to our ears, because it will be a soft echo, a reverberation of the moment of our creation, of our visible universe.
So within the next two years, we'll be able to turn up the soundtrack a little bit and have the universe as a soundscape.
But if we can capture those very earliest moments, it will bring us much closer to an understanding of the Big Bang, which in turn will bring us closer to some of the most complex, most elusive questions.
If we played a movie of the universe backwards, we would know that there was a Big Bang in the past and we could even perceive the cacophony of its sound. But was our Big Bang the only Big Bang?
I think we have to ask the question: has this ever happened before?
Will it happen again?
I think, in the spirit of the challenge that TED represents - to rekindle wonder - we can ask questions, at least in this last minute, that might otherwise elude us forever.
But we have to ask ourselves: Is it possible that our universe is just an offshoot of a larger story?
Or is it possible that we are just an offshoot of a multiverse - each offshoot with its own Big Bang in its past - perhaps some of them have drumming black holes, others may not - in some there may be intelligent life, in others not - not in our past, not in our future, but yet in some way fundamentally connected to us?
So we have to ask ourselves: if there is a multiverse, do living beings exist in another fragment of this multiverse?
These are my creatures of the multiverse.
Are there other beings in this multiverse who wonder about us and about their own origins?
And if they exist, I can imagine that they are like us, that they calculate and write computer codes, build instruments, try to make out the most distant sound of their origin and wonder who else is out there.
Thank you. Thank you.

Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvest workers infected
After a corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in Mamming, Lower Bavaria, almost 500 people are under quarantine and are no longer allowed to leave the farm.
A security service monitors the curfew.
A total of 174 harvest workers tested positive for the corona pathogen Sars-CoV-2 during the serial examination, as announced by the Dingolfing-Landau district office on Saturday evening.
"In order to avoid further spread, we unfortunately have to take this step to protect the population," explained district administrator Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees had already been infected in the company - this was the reason for the series of tests.
The farm is a large vegetable farm that grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and beetroot - but the cucumbers are only for pickling jars.
Mamming is a rural community with just over 3,300 inhabitants not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.

On the farm, infected and non-infected employees were separated, and the area is now surrounded by a barrier fence.

Many people believe that driving is an activity reserved only for people who can see.
A blind person driving a car safely and independently has until now been considered an impossible task.
Hello, my name is Dennis Hong, and we want to give blind people freedom and independence by building a vehicle for the blind.
So before I talk about this car for the blind, let me talk briefly about another project I've been working on called the DARBA Urban Challenge.
This one was about building a robotized car that can drive itself.
You press start, nobody touches anything, and it can reach its destination completely automatically.
So in 2007 our team won half a million dollars by coming third in the competition.
Around this time, the National Federation of the Blind, or NFB, challenged the Investigative Committee to produce a car that could be driven safely and independently by a blind person.
We decided to try it because we thought, hey, how hard can it be?
We already have an automatic vehicle.
We put a blind person in and it's done, right?
(Laughter) We couldn't have been more wrong.
What the National Federation of the Blind (NFB) wanted was not a vehicle that drives blind people around, but a vehicle where a blind person can make active decisions and drive.
So we had to throw everything away and start again.
Therefore, to test this crazy idea, we developed a small buggy prototype vehicle to test its feasibility.
And in the summer of 2009, we invited dozens of young blind people from all over the country and gave them the opportunity to go for a spin.
It was an absolutely amazing experience.
But the problem with this car was that it was designed so that it could only be driven in a controlled environment, a flat, traffic-free parking lot, and that even the lanes were highlighted with red traffic cones.
Therefore, with this success, we decided to take the next big step, to develop a real car that can be driven on real roads.
So how does it work?
Well, it's a pretty complicated system, but let me try to explain it, and maybe I can simplify it.
Well, we have three steps.
We have perception, computation and non-visual interfaces.
Well, it is clear that the driver cannot see, so the system must be able to perceive the environment and gather information for the driver.
For this, we use an initial unit of measurement.
It measures the acceleration, the angular acceleration, like a human ear, an inner ear.
We merge the information with a GPS unit to get the approximate position of the car.
We also use two cameras to see the lanes of the road.
And we also use three laser distance measurements.
The lasers scan the environment to detect obstacles, a car coming towards us from the front or from behind, and also any obstacles entering the road, any obstacles around the vehicle.
Then all this enormous amount of information is fed into the computer, and the computer can do two things.
First, first of all, processing the information to understand what the environment is, which is the lanes on the road, the obstacles, and communicating that information to the driver.
The system is also smart enough to calculate the safest way to operate the car.
We can also generate instructions on how to operate the controls of the vehicle.
But, the problem is this: How can we convey this information and these instructions to a person who cannot see, fast enough and fairly accurately so that he can drive?
For this, we have developed different types of non-visual user interface technology.
We started with a three-dimensional ping sound system, a vibrating vest, a click wheel with voice commands, a foot strip, and even a shoe that puts pressure on the leg.
But today, we're going to talk about three of these non-visual user interface technologies.
Well, the first interface technology is called DriveGrip.
This one is a pair of gloves, and it has its vibrating elements on the ankle side, so they can convey instructions on how to steer, the direction and the intensity.
Another device is called SpeedStrip.
This is a chair, actually, it's a massage chair.
We hollow it out, and we reorganize the vibrating elements into different patterns. And we operate them to convey information about the speed, and also to convey instructions about how to use the accelerator and brake pedals.
So, you can see here how the computer sees the environment. And since they can't see the vibration, we even equip the driver with red LEDs so he can really see what's going on.
This is the sensory data, and this data is relayed to the devices via computer.
Therefore, these two devices, DriveGrip and SpeedGrip, are very effective.
But the problem is that they are stabbing instructions devices.
Therefore, this is not a real freedom, is it?
The computer tells you how to drive, turn left, turn right, accelerate, stop.
We call it the backseat driver problem.
Therefore, let's move away from the cue devices, and focus more on the information devices.
A good example of this non-visual information interface technology is AirPix.
Think of it as a monitor for the blind.
Well, it's a small tray, it has a lot of holes and it releases compressed air, so it can even draw pictures.
Therefore, even if they are blind, they can put their hand on it, see the lanes and the obstacles on the road.
In fact, they can also change the frequency of air that escapes, and possibly the temperature.
Therefore, it is in fact a multidimensional user interface.
Well, here you can look at the left camera, the right camera as seen from the vehicle, and see how the computer interprets this and sends the information to the AirPix.
For this, we show a simulator, a blind person driving and using the AirPix.
This simulator was also very useful to train the blind drivers and also quick in testing different kinds of ideas for different types of non-visual user interfaces.
So, that's basically how it works.
But this vehicle is a prototype, and it won't hit the road until it's proven to be safe, or safer than today's vehicles.
And I really believe that this can happen.
But still, will society, would they accept such a radical idea?
How will we regulate insurance?
How will we issue driving licences?
Apart from the technological challenges, there are many kinds of hurdles that we have to overcome before it becomes a reality.
Of course, the main goal of this project is to make a car for a blind person.
But potentially more important than this is the huge spin-off technology benefit that can be gained from these projects.
The sensors that are needed can see in the dark in fog and rain.
And together with these new types of interfaces, we can use this technology and apply it in safer cars for normal-sighted people.
Or for blind people, in everyday devices in the home, in education and in the office.
Imagine a teacher writing on the blackboard in a classroom, and a blind student can see and read what he has written using these non-visual interface technologies.
That is priceless.
So, the things I've shown you today are just the beginning.
Thank you very much.

Discuss the abolition of the 50+1 rule
Former DFB president Reinhard Grindel has recommended that consideration be given to abolishing the 50+1 rule.
"German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates a fait accompli," Grindel told Bild am Sonntag.
He stressed: "For the clubs that are most likely to be dangerous to Bayern and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules do not work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, one cannot avoid the debate about whether it is not necessary to make it easier for clubs that want to break into this phalanx to involve investors."
However, he has doubts as to whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority shareholdings, which are prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50+1 rule.
"It remains a legal risk to draw investment fences around the Bundesliga as a business location in a European single market," said Grindel.
The former DFB boss sees the danger that "the attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will ultimately only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but will not lead to more tension in the championship."

Looking at the past, Grindel feels betrayed.

"Personally, this has kept me very busy."
He had received the gift worth around 11,000 euros from a Ukrainian official.
"I committed a compliance violation, and it was right to draw the consequences," Grindel said.
"I handled the ominous watch gift in a completely transparent and guileless manner.
Many in the DFB knew about it."
He never "made a secret of the gift," the 58-year-old assured.
"One might call that naive, but in any case this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."

Argentina rejects creditors' counter-offer

Arrived professionally - not yet in private life
"It's going super well" - this is the conclusion drawn by Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first days at the notary's office in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything happened very quickly: in mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she would succeed Lutz Feller in the Eggenfelden notary's office.
Just six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the doctor of law started work, the normal day-to-day business has long been running at full speed.
"Privately, however, I have yet to arrive," she explains in an interview with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
Of course, the short lead time was not enough to completely relocate the center of life from Regensburg to Eggenfelden, reports the native of Dingolfing.
She and her husband, who is a judge at the regional court in Regensburg, are currently looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city.
At least her husband was able to apply for short-term parental leave in order to ensure the care of their two daughters (31⁄2 and 11⁄2 years old).
In order not to have to commute from Regensburg every day, she has a place to stay with her parents in Dingolfing for the time being, explains the 39-year-old.
Having grown up in the neighbouring district, the city of Eggenfelden has of course been familiar to her for a long time.
During visits to the area with her family in recent months, she has once again noted: "Eggenfelden is a really nice small town."
She was all the more pleased that she had made the running in the selection process for the vacancy.
Her native Lower Bavaria also plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career: After studying law in Passau, she completed her legal clerkship and the second state examination in Regensburg.
After several positions as a notary assessor, including in Rehau and Hof in Upper Franconia, Babenhausen in Unterallgäu and Regensburg - during this time she also "incidentally" completed her doctorate in labour law - she took up her first position as a notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016, she went on parental leave, which was followed by a move to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken on representation services in various notary offices.
When the position in Eggenfelden was advertised due to the approaching retirement of Lutz Feller, she saw the right time for a full professional re-entry, explains the 39-year-old.
Dr. Stefanie Kramer has completely taken over the team of her predecessor, who will take over the holiday representation in the notary's office in the future - and immediately has praise for the team of the law firm: "It's going super well!"
The fact that she can rely on well-established processes here makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of the private center of life.
In terms of kindergarten or crèche places, she has already made contact with a local institution.
And if everything works out as desired, she hopes to be able to pursue her hobby here soon - and to get to know the most beautiful jogging trails of the Rottal.

BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not be even 20 percent full at the start of the season if fans return.
"Due to the distance regulation, which must be adhered to, we are currently planning for 12,000 to 15,000 spectators," Borussia Dortmund's managing director Carsten Cramer told the "Tagesspiegel."
Normally, the arena in the district town holds just over 81,000 spectators for Bundesliga games.
In the ghost games of last season caused by the corona pandemic, BVB lost around four million euros per game.
Cramer, who is responsible for marketing, digitization and internationalization at BVB, hopes that in addition to the normal spectator seats, some of the approximately 4000 seats in the hospitality area can be opened again: "It is of course a blow to the office if these revenues completely disappear."
In view of the ongoing corona crisis, everyone is currently "well advised to take a stable page length for the time being."
"If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people in Germany alone are in short-time work, then the need for entertainment is limited," Cramer explained.
The Dortmund marketing boss praised the BVB professionals for their partial salary waiver, which is intended to help overcome the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their salary waiver has a different effect than if we put 100 people who work in merchandising on short-time work."

Kalbitz expulsion from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "fig leaf"
From the point of view of the FDP, the exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is only a "fig leaf" and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the far right in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of radicals in the AfD," FDP politician Benjamin Strasser told the dpa news agency in Berlin.
On Saturday in Stuttgart, after several hours of negotiations, the Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Executive Board had decided by a majority in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD group in the Brandenburg state parliament.
"If the AfD really wanted to consistently remove right-wing extremists from their party, officials like Björn Höcke and his supporters would have been expelled long ago," said Strasser.
"However, there is no political will to do so in the AfD, because right-wing extremism is now part of the party."
CSU General Secretary Markus Blume expressed a similar view: "The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded says nothing and changes nothing," he told the "Welt am Sonntag."
"Rather, it speaks volumes how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist in the middle of the AfD still has."
Blume assumes that the AfD will again fall below five percent in elections in the future.
"The AfD's days in parliament are numbered."
Kalbitz was one of the spokesmen of the now officially disbanded "wing" around the Thuringian AfD state and parliamentary group chairman Björn Höcke; the Office for the Protection of the Constitution classifies the Strönung as a "secured right-wing extremist endeavor."
In May, the AfD's national executive board kicked Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason, he stated that Kalbitz had not indicated a previous membership in the now banned right-wing extremist "Heimattreue Deutsche Jugend" (HDJ) and the Republicans when he joined the party.
Kalbitz denies membership in the HDJ.
The chairman of the left-wing faction in the Brandenburg state parliament, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court does not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf has only eaten chalk.
The AfD remains a right-wing extremist party, with or without Kalbitz."
Neither the federal party nor the right wing will be weakened by this decision.
"The manoeuvre of the Meuthen force is transparent.
They want to avoid further observation by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution and are trying to slip under the radar," Walter said.
"The AfD can't get rid of the ghosts it summoned.
An expulsion does not change anything," commented the Brandenburg SPD General Secretary Erik Stohn on the decision in the Kalbitz case.
"This is where the AfD regional association and the parliamentary group have stood by their right-wing leader to this day."
The legal dispute over Kalbitz's membership in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he would now take civil action against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court.

North Sea wind farms deliver a good 21 percent more electricity
The wind power plants on the German North Sea have fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid in the first six months of the year.
This is a good 21 percent more than in the same period last year, announced the network operator Tennet in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of North Sea electricity to the mainland and its routing through the German power grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of Tennet's grid area, have fed in a further 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
This brings the total wind power from the North and Baltic Seas to 13.73 TWh, compared to just over 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind power in Germany; this is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms ensure higher generation capacities
In addition to the wind conditions, the increased contribution of offshore wind energy results from higher generation capacities, because new wind farms have been connected to the grid in the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea were all running at full power at the same time, they could generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatts.
By 2030, it is expected to rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore grid connections by then," said Tennet Managing Director Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind farms can not exhaust their capacity even at sea, but reach about 40 percent.
The record day so far this year is 2 January, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, which is equivalent to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could supply almost seven million households with electricity.

Freital: Windbergfest cancelled due to corona
The Windberg Festival will not take place this year.
The city of Freital has cancelled the three-day festival planned for September.
In other years, more than 30,000 people had attended this city festival.
"We really did not take this decision lightly and - aware of how difficult it is economically for those involved - hoped until the last minute," explained Lord Mayor Uwe Rumberg (non-partisan).
"But ultimately, as organisers, we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people."
Because if tens of thousands had streamed onto the festival grounds and into the marquee, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact tracing in accordance with the current coronavirus protection regulation could not have been adhered to.
Or the restrictions would have been so severe that there would not have been much left of a folk festival.
In addition, the organizational and monitoring effort would increase disproportionately many times over.
Rumberg consoled for next year.
Then the city of Freital will celebrate its 100th anniversary with the Winterberg Festival from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the Day of the Saxons from 10 to 12 September 2021.

More air traffic controllers in Worms in the future
The University of Worms continues to take to the skies: The "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" endows a professorship for "Air Traffic Management."
A corresponding contract between the university and DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and will start in 2021.
With the professorship, it is possible to start studies not only in the summer, but also in the winter semester.
This means that twice as many students can be trained as before.
At the same time, the capacities of both the university and the air traffic control academy of DFS are evenly utilized.
DFS will advise the university on the establishment and appointment of the professorship.
Represented at the university since 2019
Since the summer semester of 2019, the first students have been in the Air Traffic Management course as part of their training as air traffic controllers at the University of Applied Sciences in Worms.
This year, nine students have already started.
So far, the experience of the DFS has been very positive, the performance of the students is excellent.
The combination of studies and pilot training contributes significantly to further increasing the attractiveness of the pilot profession.
"In these times, funding is not easy for us economically.
However, we firmly expect air traffic to recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to be able to fulfill our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel," says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman and CEO of DFS at the signing of the contract.
"For DFS, the endowed professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, interdisciplinary knowledge base in the long term.
We are therefore continuing our good cooperation with the university and at the same time reinforcing our attractiveness as an employer."
This is also underlined by Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of the University of Applied Sciences Worms: "The endowed professorship forms an important bridge between science and business.
With her, we would like to build on the already existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practice partner for the dual bachelor's degree program in Air Traffic Management."
The trust of Deutsche Flugsicherung is both a motivation and an obligation for the Worms University of Applied Sciences to further expand its teaching and research expertise in the future fields of air transport.
In its commitment to the air traffic controllers of tomorrow, the university can set very special highlights and innovative focal points for its students with the first endowed professorship for a dual course of study.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary at the Ministry of Science, Further Education and Culture, emphasizes: "With its focus on air transport, the University of Worms has a unique selling point in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university."

Heil wants to examine other sectors after the meat industry
The corona crisis once again brought to light the conditions in parts of the meat industry.
Tightening of the law is imminent.
But are they right - and will it stay that way?
Federal Labour Minister Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to review other sectors in accordance with the now planned strict regulations against abuses in the meat industry.
"We will look at industry by industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary," Heil told the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employers are already warning against restricting work contracts in general.
After the massive corona outbreak at the meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the federal cabinet wants to pass a law of salvation this Wednesday.
Large slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to use third-party personnel for slaughtering, cutting and meat processing.
To this end, the use of contract and temporary workers is to be prohibited there.
Employers' association president Ingo Kramer told dpa: "Stay away from a general restriction of work contracts and temporary employment if you don't want to completely strangle the economy."
For example, for a wide range of trades, the construction industry and plant engineering, work contracts are necessarily the basis for their value creation for the customer.
"The misdeeds of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument."
Heil assured: "My goal is not to ban work contracts everywhere in the German economy."
Contracts for work and services make sense.

Wages were withheld for protective equipment or rent.
It was also noted that the situation regarding the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively strict law had already come into force for the meat industry in 2017.
However, these were circumvented by "tricky constructions."
"Now it has to be fundamentally cleaned up."
The politician announced: "The Occupational Health and Safety Act, which we want to pass in the cabinet at the end of July, also includes measures that do not only affect the meat industry - for example, higher inspection rates for occupational health and safety or clear criteria for shared accommodation."
The draft presented to the dpa includes amendments to the Act on the Protection of Workers' Rights in the Meat Industry and the Occupational Safety and Health Act.

Car overturns: Young woman seriously injured in accident on Bundesstraße 83 near Hofgeismar
A 21-year-old woman suffered serious injuries in an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme at around 1.25pm on Sunday.
She was taken to the Klinikum Kassel.
The fire brigade used thermal imaging cameras to search for possible passengers.
According to the police, the woman was driving on Bundesstraße 83 in the direction of her home town of Hümme when her car left the road for reasons that have not yet been clarified and overturned several times.
In order to save the victim, the fire brigade had to cut the roof of the car free.
Since it was unclear whether anyone else was in the vehicle, the adjacent cornfield was searched from the turntable ladder with a thermal imaging camera.
The drone squadron from Warburg, which also works with thermal imaging cameras, had also been ordered to search for people.
However, the emergency services did not find anyone among the tall corn plants.
The seriously injured woman was taken by ambulance to the hospital in Kassel for further care.
Nearly 50 firefighters from the Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg fire departments were on the scene.
The highway was closed for two hours due to the accident.

Juventus Turin champions in Italy
Turin - After a redemptive goal by Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in a row.
The team around the five-time world footballer completed the 36th Scudetto in the club's history with a 2-0 (1-0) win at home against Sampdoria Genoa on Sunday evening.
Ronaldo scored to make it 1-0 before half-time.
With 83 points, Turin, which competed without the recently long-injured ex-national player Sami Khedira, can no longer be ousted from first place two days before the end of the Serie A season.
Second-placed Inter Milan are seven points behind.
Juventus was harmless despite visual superiority in the first half, then Ronaldo scored after a free-kick variation with the last action.
The 35-year-old converted a pass from Miralem Pjanic from the edge of the penalty area with a low shot (45+7).
Against the now more offensive guests, Ronaldo was also involved in the 2-0, after his shot, Federico Bernardeschi (67th) dusted off.
This ensured the lackluster but decisive success.
The foul penalty that hit the crossbar in the 89th minute should only have annoyed Ronaldo himself with a view to the scorer's standings.
"It's complicated to stay mentally and physically on the ball for 90 minutes.
The games are strange, and the momentum changes very easily," explained coach Maurizio Sarri after the 1:2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Above all, the mental exhaustion of his players is great, said the Juve coach.
Because of the defeat, the Turin team had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
In the end, Juve's reassuring lead at the top of the table was mainly due to the weakness of their rivals.
Because in the eleven games before the match on Sunday, the Sarri team had only managed five victories.
Whether Ronaldo will also be the top scorer is questionable.
Because while the Portuguese superstar has scored 31 goals so far, the former Dortmund player Ciro Immobile has already scored 34 goals after his three-pack at 5:1 (1:1) of the fourth-placed Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to FC Bayern's title win.

Baden-Württemberg: More than 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - Despite all the threatened penalties and court rulings, motorists continue to accelerate in countless illegal races on the roads of Baden-Württemberg: Last year and the first four months of this year, the police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
There are no comparable figures for previous years, but the speeders are increasingly making work for the judicial authorities: In 2018, a total of 155 investigations into illegal races were conducted at the public prosecutor's offices between Konstanz and Mannheim, a year later there were already 252 and in the current year up to the beginning of June already 151.
The races were less about organized events, as can be seen from the response of the Ministry of the Interior to a request from the state parliament SPD.
In most cases, the drivers spontaneously competed against each other or they fled from the police - this is also reported as an illegal race.
The drivers were mainly German men between the ages of 18 and 60.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases are the speeders caught and also asked to pay: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines and 15 prison sentences have been imposed since 2018.
However, there is no evidence that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
Rather, other drivers reacted more sensitively than before because of the numerous tragic accidents and trials of past years and indicated more frequently, said a ministry spokesman.
The Autobahn 8 is particularly popular with speeders. Again and again, motorists slow down the traffic there in order to gain space and use the free track for a race.
Last August, a dozen drivers were caught near Kirchheim unter Teck, three months earlier there were even 18 drivers on the A8 near Merklingen.
A81 is most popular "race track"
The police even register more races on the A81 than on any other federal motorway.
With a speed limit there is an attempt to slow down the speeders on the particularly affected section between Engen and Geisingen.
The mostly high-priced and souped-up sports and luxury cars often have Swiss license plates, because the drivers avoid Germany because of the high penalties for speeding and car races in the neighboring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit must not be reduced to a few routes: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometres per hour, we would get rid of this problem on motorways," says Martin Rivoir, the traffic expert of the SPD parliamentary group.
"The threshold for speeders would be significantly higher if you weren't still legally allowed to drive at 200 kilometers per hour and more here and there."
Rivoir thinks less of education or image campaigns: "Anyone who flouts all the rules in such a way and risks not only their own life, but also the lives of other road users, is hardly reachable with reason."
ADAC calls for stronger police action
However, this is not enough for the ADAC: "We assume that speeders will not be deterred by the speed limits," says Holger Bach, Head of Traffic and Environment at the ADAC Württemberg.
He calls for additional and also tougher controls on the affected routes.
Not infrequently, the high-speed test of strength turns into painful and momentous seriousness: Since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people have died nationwide in the races, two of them bystanders in a nighttime crash in Stuttgart's city center and one in Gerlingen.
Two young men are said to have been involved in a car race there in November.
One of the vehicles came off the road, crashed into a garden wall and lay on its side, the 18-year-old passenger died.
21 other people were injured in the races of the past two years.
However, according to Interior Minister Thomas Strobl, harsher penalties are not necessary: "There is no need for legislative action to sanction illegal motor vehicle races more severely," according to the paper of the Ministry of the Interior.

The first time I was in Antarctica was almost 10 years ago, where I saw my first icebergs.
I was awestruck.
My heart raced, I felt dizzy as I tried to grasp what was in front of me.
The icebergs around me rose almost 60 metres out of the water. And I could only marvel that this was one snowflake on top of another snowflake, year after year.
Icebergs are born as a calf of a glacier or by breaking out of ice floes.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They interact with their environment and their experiences in a unique way.
Some refuse to give up and cling on until the bitter end, while others can't take it anymore and collapse in a fit of dramatic passion.
Looking at an iceberg, it is easy to think that they are isolated, separate and alone, just as we humans often see ourselves.
But the truth is far from that.
As an iceberg melts, I breathe in its ancient atmosphere.
As the iceberg melts, it releases mineral-rich drinking water that nourishes many forms of life.
I approach my photographs of these icebergs as if I were taking portraits of my ancestors, aware that they exist this way in these individual moments, and will never exist this way again.
It is not death when they melt; it is not an end, but a continuation of their path along the life cycle.
Some of the ice in the icebergs I photograph is very young - a few thousand years old.
And some of the ice is more than 100,000 years old.

Nuremberg: Unauthorised tuning meeting - police intervene, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and at times more than 1,000 people took part in a "tuning meeting" in the parking lot of a furniture store on Saturday night.
The police followed through on their announcement to step up control of such events.
A large tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (25 July 2020) in Nuremberg's Südstadt.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the Mittelfranken police, the Nuremberg traffic police detected an increased number of vehicles in the area of a large parking lot on Ingolstädter Straße at around 10:30 p.m.
The police then carried out a large number of vehicle checks there.
Only recently, the police had announced that they wanted to take more action against so-called autoposers.
Illegal tuning meeting in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the "scene"
The officers counted a good 700 vehicles and about 1100 people at the peak, according to the police.
Of these, however, only a small proportion of those present can be attributed to the "car poser" and tuning scene.
Apparently, the majority of the relevant scene complied with the police appeal.
Based on the vehicles and people on site, it can be assumed that these were mostly onlookers.
In addition, the vast majority of those present adhered to the applicable infection protection regulations, in particular the observance of the minimum distance and the wearing of a mouth and nose protection.
The control measures carried out on site were completed around 1:00 a.m.
In total, the officials found such structural changes in 10 vehicles that the operating permit had expired.
Four of these vehicles had to be seized.

Figures from the employment agency: 900 suspected cases of abuse in short-time work
Berlin - According to its own statement, the Federal Employment Agency (BA) is investigating around 900 suspected cases of abuse of the short-time work allowance.
"With more than 880,000 companies that have reported short-time working, this is extremely low," Daniel Terzenbach, the board member responsible for operations, told the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung."
When a large number of companies suddenly applied for short-time work at the beginning of the corona crisis, the BA had to react quickly.
Normally, the examination takes up to three weeks.
"We didn't have that much time in this hot phase.
We will therefore take a closer look at the final accounts.
There will certainly be more to come.
We are not naïve and we have a lot of stamina."
Indications of abuse often come from the affected employees or trade unions.
In addition, the BA uses analysis software to detect patterns of abuse.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible wave of insolvencies in the autumn.
"Will there be significantly more insolvencies than in the previous year?
Estimates vary, but we are preparing for the eventuality and are already training our employees in the employment agencies to process applications for insolvency benefits."
The figures are still unremarkable, said Terzenbach.

Austria: Mass testing after corona outbreak in tourist resort
Authorities have responded to a corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist resort of St. Wolfgang with hundreds of tests.
The number of confirmed cases rose to 48, according to the state authorities in Linz.
More than 100 results were still pending in the evening.
According to this, many of the infected are young interns in tourism companies, but at least one holiday guest has also tested positive.
Residents, guests and tourism workers were asked to stay in their accommodation on Saturday night.
The curfew was set at 11 p.m.
"There are cancellations and cancellations" of bookings here and there, the head of the Wolfgangsee tourism association, Hans Wieser, told dpa.
A few guests also left early.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist resort in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, around a third of the guests are German.
The first infections were publicly announced on Friday.
The head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended on Saturday the behavior of the interns, who had partied in several restaurants and could have been infected there.
"We all liked to do that in our youth," he told the Ö1 radio station.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The tourist board launched an information campaign to make young employees aware of the dangers of Covid-19.
From Saturday, hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from July 15 were contacted.
The outbreak brings back memories of the Austrian ski and party resort of Ischgl in Tyrol, which was a centre for the spread of corona throughout Europe in the initial phase of the pandemic.
In total, more than 1500 people are currently infected with the virus in Austria.
The focus of the new infections is Vienna and Upper Austria.

You all know that what I am about to say is true.
The intuition that inequality weakens social cohesion existed even before the French Revolution.
What is new is that we now have evidence. We can compare societies, more equal and more unequal, and see what inequality does.
I want to show you statistics and explain why there are correlations between them.
Look at what a pathetic bunch we are.
(Laughter) Let me start with a paradox.
This shows life expectancy and gross national income - in rich countries on average.
You see that the countries on the right, Norway and the USA for example, are twice as rich as Israel, Greece, Portugal on the left.
And that doesn't change their life expectancy at all.
There is nothing to suggest a connection.
But within societies, there are huge social disparities in health across society.
Here, once again, the life expectancy.
Here are small areas of England and Wales - the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.
A big difference between the poor and the rest of us.
Even the people just below the top are in worse health than those at the top.
So income matters very much within individual societies, and not at all between them.
The explanation for this paradox is that within societies we are dealing with relative income, social position, status - where we stand in relation to each other, and how big the gaps are between us.
And when you understand that, you immediately ask yourself: What happens if the differences get bigger, or smaller, if income differences increase or decrease?
And I'm going to show you that now.
Not with hypothetical data.
Using UN data - the same that the World Bank uses - on the extent of income inequality in rich developed market democracies.
The measure we use, because it is easy to understand and available for download, is how much richer the top 20 percent are than the bottom 20 percent of each country.
You see that in the more equal countries on the left - Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden - the top 20 percent are about 31⁄2, 4 times as rich as the bottom 20 percent.
But on the other side - the UK, Portugal, the US, Singapore - the differences are twice as great.
On this scale, we are twice as unequal as some of the other successful market democracies.
Now I'll show you what that does to our societies.
We collected data on problems of social disparity, the problems that are more prevalent at the bottom of the social ladder.
Internationally comparable data on life expectancy, children's math, reading and writing skills, infant mortality and homicide rates, what proportion of the population is incarcerated, teenage pregnancy, confidence, obesity, mental illness - which includes drug and alcohol addiction in standard diagnostics - and social mobility.
We have compiled them in an index.
All with equal weight.
For each country there is a kind of average value of these factors.
And here you see it in relation to the degree of inequality that I have shown you, which I will come back to again and again.
The more unequal countries do worse in all these social problems.
This is an unusually high correlation.
But if you put the same index of health and social problems in relation to GNI per capita, to gross national income, there is nothing left, no correlation.
We were worried that people would think we had only selected the problems that supported our argument and constructed this evidence, so we also published an article in the British Medical Journal on the UNICEF Index of Child Wellbeing.
In it 40 different components were put together by other people.
The index includes whether children can talk to their parents, whether they have books at home, their immunization rates, whether there is bullying at school.
Everything flows into it.
Here is the index in relation to our inequality scores.
Children fare worse in unequal societies.
A highly significant ratio.
And again, if you compare the index of child well-being to the national per capita income, there is no correlation, not even a hint.
All the data I've shown you so far says the same thing.
The average well-being of our societies no longer depends on national income and economic growth.
These are crucial in poorer countries, but not in the rich developed world.
But the differences between us, where we stand in comparison to each other has become very important.
I will now show you individual parts of our index.
Here, for example, is trust.
Simply the proportion of the population who believe that most people can be trusted.
The data comes from the World Values Survey.
On the more unequal side, about 15 percent of the population believes that others can be trusted.
But in more equal societies, it's up to 60 or 65 percent.
And for the degree of involvement in community life or social capital, there are similarly close links to inequality.
We did all this work twice.
First with the rich, developed countries, and then in a second test field again with the 50 American states - with the same question: do the more unequal states perform worse on all these scales?
Here, according to a data collection by the US government, trust is correlated with inequality.
A very similar distribution over a similar range of confidence levels.
The same thing is happening here.
Our basic finding is that almost all factors that relate to trust internationally also do so in the 50 U.S. states, in the separate test environment.
And this is not just a happy coincidence.
Here are mental illnesses.
The WHO created these figures by conducting the same diagnostic interviews with randomly selected subjects in order to compare the rates of mental illness in societies.
This is the percentage of the population that had a mental illness in the previous year.
It goes from 8 percent to three times that - whole societies that have three times as high rates of mental illness as others.
And again, a high correlation to inequality.
And here, violence.
These red dots are American states, the blue triangles are Canadian provinces.
Note the scale of the differences.
It goes from 15 murders per million to 150.
That is the percentage of the population that is incarcerated.
Here there is about a tenfold difference on the lateral log scale.
It goes from about 40 to 400 imprisoned people.
This relationship is not primarily due to higher crime rates.
In some places, this is a partial factor.
But the main reason is harsher court sentences.
And more unequal societies are also more likely to retain the death penalty.
Here are children who drop out of school.
Again, pretty big differences.
With devastating effects in terms of the use of talents of the population.
Here is social mobility.
Actually, a measurement of mobility based on income.
The question is: Do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons, or is there no connection between the two?
On the more unequal side, fathers' income is much more important -- in the UK, in the US.
And in the Scandinavian countries, fathers' income is much less important.
There is more social mobility.
We like to say - and I know there are a lot of Americans here in the audience - if Americans want to live the American dream, they should go to Denmark.
(Laughter) (Applause) I've just introduced you to a few things.
I could have shown you a lot of other problems.
All of these problems are more prevalent at the lower end of the social gradient.
But there are countless problems with social disparity that are worse in more unequal countries - not just a little, but somewhere between 2 times and 10 times as prevalent.
Imagine that cost, the human cost.
But I want to go back to the graph where we summarized everything to show two things.
For one thing, graph after graph shows that the countries that do poorly, regardless of the outcome, seem to be the more unequal ones, and the ones that do better seem to be the Nordic countries and Japan.
So what we see is a general social dysfunction that goes hand in hand with inequality.
Not just one or two things, but most things.
The other very important aspect of this graph you see down here, Sweden and Japan - very different countries in many ways.
The position of women, how much they adhere to the nuclear family, here they are at opposite poles of the rich, developed world.
Another very important difference is how they achieve their greater equality.
In Sweden, there are enormous differences in earnings that are compensated by taxation, the general welfare state, generous social benefits, etc.
In Japan, it's completely different.
There, there are smaller differences in earnings even before tax.
There are lower taxes.
A smaller welfare state.
And in our analysis of the American states, we find the same contrast.
Some states are successful through redistribution, others are doing well because they have low pre-tax income differences.
Our conclusion is that it does not matter so much how you get to greater equality, as long as you get there somehow.
I don't mean perfect equality, I'm talking about something that already exists in rich market democracies.
Another surprising part of the picture is that it is not just the poor who are affected by inequality.
Apparently there is some truth in John Donne's "No man is an island."
In several studies it is possible to compare how people in more or less equal countries perform at each level of the social hierarchy.
This is just one example.
Infant mortality.
Some Swedes have kindly classified a large proportion of their child deaths according to the British register for socio-economic classification.
This is an anachronistic classification according to the professions of the fathers, so single parents are listed separately.
But where "low social class" is noted, it means unskilled manual jobs.
Then there are the skilled craft professions in the middle, then the subordinate non-craft professions, up to the higher-placed professions - doctors, lawyers, executives of larger companies.
You can see that Sweden is better than the UK, across the whole social hierarchy.
The biggest differences are at the bottom of society.
But even at the top, there seems to be a small benefit to living in a more equal society.
We show this in five different data sets that deal with parenting success and health in the US and internationally.
That seems to be generally the case - greater equality matters most at the bottom, but has some benefits even at the top.
But I should say something about what's going on.
I am concerned with the psychosocial effects of inequality.
This has to do with feelings of superiority and inferiority, the feeling of being valued or devalued, respected or despised.
And, of course, the sense of status competition that results from this drives consumerism in our society.
It also leads to status uncertainty.
We worry more about how we are judged by others, whether we are considered attractive, smart, etc.
The socially evaluative judgments are increasing, and the fear of these judgments.
Interestingly, there is similar research in social psychology: some people have evaluated 208 different studies in which volunteers were invited to psychological laboratories to measure their stress hormones and their response to stressful tasks.
What they were interested in evaluating was which types of stress most reliably raised levels of cortisol, the central stress hormone.
And the result was: tasks that meant a threat to social assessment - threats to self-confidence or social status, in which others can judge one's own performance negatively.
These types of stress have a very specific effect on the physiology of stress.
We have been criticised.
Of course, there are people who don't like it here and people who find it very surprising.
But I should tell you that when we are criticized for selecting our data selectively, we never select specifically for our purposes.
Our absolute principle is: if our data source has data for one of the countries we are looking at, it goes into the analysis.
Our data source determines whether it is reliable data, not us.
Anything else would be bias.
What about other countries?
There are 200 studies on health in relation to income and equality in academic peer-reviewed journals.
This is not limited to these countries, this is a very simple demonstration.
The same countries, the same scale of inequality, one problem after another.
Why don't we check other factors?
We have shown that per capita income makes no difference.
And, of course, others with more sophisticated methods have also examined poverty and education and more.
What about causality?
Correlation does not prove causation.
We spent a lot of time on that.
In fact, people know the causal relationships very well in some of these results.
The big news in our understanding of the drivers of long-term health in the rich developed world is how much chronic social stress stresses the immune system, the cardiovascular system.
Or, for example, the reason why violence is more prevalent in more unequal societies is because people are sensitive to being despised.
To cope with this, we need to clarify what happens after the tax and what happens before the tax.
We have to limit the income, the bonus culture income at the top.
We need to hold our bosses accountable to the employees as best we can.
But the take-home message is that we can improve the actual quality of human life if we fix the income gaps between us.
Suddenly there is a lever for the psychosocial well-being of entire societies, and that is very exciting.
Thank you.

Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualify for Champions League
London (dpa) - English football's record champions Manchester United are returning to the Champions League after a one-year absence.
The Red Devils secured third place in the table on the final day of the Premier League with a 2-0 (0-0) victory over direct rivals Leicester City.
The Foxes now have to be content with the Europa League, because Chelsea FC still passed and also qualified for the premier class in fourth place.
In the fight against relegation, Aston Villa could celebrate.
Manchester United took the lead through a penalty from Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in injury time, Jesse Lingard (90th+8) scored the final goal.
Chelsea, Bayern's opponents in the Champions League round of 16, won 2-0 (2-0) against Wolverhampton Wanderers thanks to Mason Mount (45th+1) and Olivier Giroud (45th+4).
"This means a lot to me," said coach Frank Lampard, who in his first season as Chelsea coach is also in the final of the FA Cup against Arsenal.
Tottenham Hotspur also benefited from Chelsea's victory against Wolverhampton, edging past Wolves with a meagre 1:1 (1:0) at Crystal Palace and starting in sixth place in the Europa League.
Aston Villa won the long-distance duel with FC Watford and AFC Bournemouth, but had to tremble at West Ham United for a long time.
The late lead of Jack Grealish (84th) was immediately offset by Andrei Yarmolenko (85th).
The 1:1 (0:0) was enough, however, because Watford lost 2:3 (1:3) at Arsenal.
The club, which fired three coaches during the season, is relegated after five years in the first division.
Just like Bournemouth, who couldn't save themselves from a 3-1 (2-1) defeat at Everton.
In the end, one point was missing.
Liverpool FC, who have been confirmed as English champions since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3-1 (1-1) victory at Newcastle United.
99 points is the most the Reds have ever scored in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team narrowly missed out on the points record in English football.
The record is held by Manchester City with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After Newcastle took the lead in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) turned the game around for Liverpool on Sunday.
"It has been an exceptional season for this wonderful club," said goalscorer van Dijk after the game, "which should spur us on to defend the title.
It will be difficult."
The Premier League bosses are also likely to be satisfied in the end.
Due to the coronavirus crisis, football in England was suspended from 13 March to 17 June.
In the meantime, there were even discussions about an early cancellation or a staging of the remaining games on neutral ground.
In the end, however, the season could be played to the end without any particular incidents - but, as in Germany, without spectators in the stadiums.

Today I want to show you how we will make things in the future.
I believe that our buildings and machines will soon assemble, reproduce and repair themselves.
I will show you what I consider to be today's production methods and then compare them with some natural systems.
In the current manufacturing industry, we have skyscrapers - two and a half years [construction time], half a million to a million parts, quite complex, new and exciting technologies of steel, concrete, glass.
We have exciting machines that take us into space - five years [to build], two and a half million parts.
On the other hand, if you look at natural systems, you find proteins that have two million types and can fold in ten microseconds, or DNA with three billion base pairs that can be copied in about an hour.
So there's all this complexity in our natural systems, but they're extremely efficient, much more efficient than anything we can make, far more complex than anything we can build.
They are much more energy efficient.
They almost never make mistakes.
And they are durable because they can repair themselves.
So there are a lot of interesting things to discover in natural systems.
And if we manage to incorporate this into our built environment, then we have an exciting potential for new construction methods.
And I believe that the key is self-assembly.
If we want to use self-assembly in our physical environment, I think there are four key factors.
The first is that we have to decipher all the complexity of the things we want to build - our buildings and machines.
And we have to translate that into simple sequences - sort of the DNA of how our buildings work.
Then we need programmable parts that can draw on this sequence and use it to fold or reconfigure.
We need activation energy so that our parts can fold up from the program.
And we need a kind of redundancy for error correction, so that what we want to build really comes into being.
I will show you some projects that my colleagues and I are working on at MIT, so that self-assembly can be realized in the future.
The first two are MacroBot and DeciBot.
These projects are large-scale, reconfigurable robots - two and a half to four meters long proteins.
They are equipped with electromechanical devices, sensors.
You decode what you want to fold into a sequence of angles - so minus 120, minus 120, 0, 0, 120, minus 120 - something like that; a sequence of angles, or rotations, and you send that sequence through the chain.
Each unit picks up its message - i.e. minus 120 - it rotates accordingly, checks whether it has arrived and forwards it to the neighbouring unit.
These are the brilliant scientists, engineers and designers who worked on this project.
And I think it makes one thing really clear: Is this really scalable?
I mean, thousands of dollars, many hours of work to create this two and a half meter high robot.
Can we really scale this up? Can we really embed robotics in every part?
The next project questions this and looks at the passive nature or the passive attempt to make reconfiguration programmable.
But it goes a step further and tries to make actual calculations possible.
It basically integrates the most fundamental component of EDP, the digital logic gate, directly into the parts.
This is a NAND gate.
You have a tetrahedron, which is the gate that will do the calculations, and you have two input tetrahedrons.
One represents the user's input while making the building blocks.
The other comes from the previous component that was arranged.
And then it delivers an output in three-dimensional space.
This means that the user can specify what the components should do.
It performs calculations based on what it has done before and what the user asks it to do.
And now it begins to move in three-dimensional space - up and down.
On the left side, the input [1,1] corresponds to the output 0, which goes down.
On the right side, the input [0,0] corresponds to the output 1, which goes up.
What this really means is that our structures now contain the blueprints of what we want to build.
So they have all the information about what has been built.
This means we can achieve a form of self-replication.
In this case, I call it self-guided replication because the structure contains the exact blueprints.
If errors occur, you can replace a part.
All the local information is integrated to show how to fix them.
So you could have something that climbs along and reads and delivers an output of one to one.
It is directly integrated; there are no instructions from outside.
The last project I'm going to show is called Biased Chains, and it represents probably the most exciting example of self-assembling systems that we have at the moment.
It takes the ability to reconfigure and program and creates a completely passive system.
Basically, you have a chain of elements.
Each element is completely identical and they are polarized.
Each chain, or element, wants to turn to the right or to the left.
So while you're putting the chain together, you're basically programming it.
Each unit is told whether to turn right or left.
When you shake the chain, it folds into a configuration that you have programmed - in this case a spiral, or in this case two cubes next to each other.
So you can basically program any possible three-dimensional shape - or one-dimensional, two-dimensional - completely passively into this chain.
What does this tell us about the future?
I think it tells us that there are possibilities of self-assembly, replication and repair in our physical structures, our buildings and machines.
There are new possibilities for programming in these parts.
And this creates new opportunities for EDP.
We're going to have spatial programming.
Imagine if our buildings, bridges, machines, all our components could perform calculations.
This would mean parallel and distributed computing power, new design possibilities.
So there's an exciting potential for that.
I think that these projects that I have shown here are just a tiny step towards this future, when we implement these new technologies for a new, self-creating world.
Thank you.

Arrests and violence at anti-Netanyahu demonstrations
The protests in Israel against Prime Minister Netanyahu are becoming increasingly violent.
There were violent clashes during the night.
Israeli police violently cracked down on participants in a demonstration against right-wing conservative Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Sunday night.
Twelve people were arrested for participating in riots, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said.
The police used, among other things, water cannons to break up the rally.
According to media reports, a total of around 6,000 people had gathered near Netanyahu's official residence on Saturday evening.
They were protesting against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu's handling of the corona crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew horns and called on Netanyahu to resign.
Participants in a counter-demonstration supporting Netanyahu were also arrested, the news site "ynet" reported.
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the prime minister's private villa in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man was arrested near Tel Aviv on suspicion of spraying pepper spray from a moving car at protesters on the side of the road, police said.
Another man was arrested after a knife attack on a protester in the south of the country.
The protester was slightly injured in the neck.
There have been several demonstrations against Netanyahu in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv recently.
The rallies accompany the corruption trial against the head of government.

North Korea seals off border town after suspected coronavirus case
North Korea has so far seen its own measures to ward off the coronavirus as a "shining success."
Now the country is reporting a suspected case for the first time.
Due to a first official suspected case of coronavirus in the country, North Korea has completely sealed off a major city for fear of a catastrophe.
Despite the strictest epidemiological countermeasures over the past six months, "the malignant virus could have been introduced into the country," state media reported.
A state of emergency has been declared for the region around the border city of Kaesong.
The communist leadership declared the highest level of alert.
If the suspected case is confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the isolated country.
North Korea had not registered a single infection so far, according to its own information, and described its defensive measures as a "shining success."
The information was doubted abroad.
The symptoms of the disease were reportedly detected in a "runaway" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
The person had defected to South Korea three years ago and had now returned across the border.
There was initially no confirmation from South Korea of the border crossing within the four-kilometre-wide and largely still mined military buffer zone.
South Korea's military, however, acknowledged the possibility of an illegal border crossing into North Korea as high, according to reports from the national news agency Yonhap.
There were investigations into a number of people.
According to North Korea, an emergency meeting of the Politburo of the Workers' Party, chaired by leader Kim Jong Un, was called on Saturday because of the suspected case.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive disaster."
As a preventive measure, Kim had already ordered on Friday to "completely block Kaesong and isolate each district and the region from others," it added.
The affected person, as well as all people in Kaesong who have had contact with her, have been quarantined.
The party's central military commission is to investigate the "outlier case" as well as the conduct of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose severe punishment.
It is estimated that about 300,000 people live in Kaesong.

Tension before council meeting: City East and noise protection are still up for discussion before the big summer break
"In addition to environmental issues, the committee members will also vote on the development plan for the large-scale project Innenstadtentwicklung-Ost," it says rather casually in the middle section of the municipal press release for the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, 28 July, at 4.30 pm in the Great Hall of the CongressCentrum Pforzheim.
The upgrading of the eastern part of the city in particular, however, will be the subject of controversy until the end.
The majorities in favour are narrow, most recently in some committees even negative, depending on the attendance.
An appeal from the economy (construction, real estate, trade and IT) not to let the project, which was developed out of the citizenry and then by the administration and the local council, fail after almost ten years of preparation, was criticized by project opponent Reinhard Klein as "extra-parliamentary opposition," "clueless," "speculation," "denigration" and "deliberate false statements."
"Everyone thinks they know better," said Klein, who has been a member of the municipal council for a year as the only representative of the Pforzheim citizens' list.
In fact, after reading the contracts, he is in this position: "I know what I am talking about."
The exit is cheaper for the city, the Technical Town Hall is, contrary to statements by the city administration, to be renovated for 8.5 million euros after subsidies, of whose existence Klein is convinced.
The city will develop quite differently from what is predicted in the town hall and by the proponents from the business community.
To shape the city through its own strength and not an investor: that is his plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP/FW/UB/LED group, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It essentially also provides for the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, the opening of the Schloßberg, the rental of the Ex-Thales for administrative areas and a smaller-scale inner-city transformation, ideally with local agencies.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues in particular will play a central role.
Among other things, the municipal council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the Pforzheim population from health-related noise pollution caused by road traffic, including speed reductions in many cases.
In a press release, the local Verkehrsclub Deutschland welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of the fact that this has to happen, because they have only contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus noise by neglecting regular bus traffic with thinned cycles and by little commitment to cycling, according to the VCD.
The municipal council also votes on the city's participation in the Energy and Climate Protection Agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
Also on the agenda is the accession to the climate protection pact of the state of Baden-Württemberg, the revision of the parental contributions in the municipal day-care facilities and the application for inclusion in the federal Smart City funding.

Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with a lot of delay
After a delay of almost half a year, Tim Zimmermann will start his debut season in the ADAC GT Masters on 31 July.
Before the league of super sports cars can start regular operations, the first test drives were now scheduled.
For Zimmermann, it was all about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 better.
For a long time, the Corona crisis prevented Tim Zimmermann from taking his first official drive in the new Lamborghini Huracan of Grasser Racing.
This was now possible under special hygienic conditions.
The 23-year-old from Langenargen did his first laps at the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his debut in a GT3 car.
"There are already a few things that are different from the Porsche from the previous season," says Zimmermann.
"With the ABS, for example, you have to go into the corners differently.
But it was really a lot of fun."
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite being only 25 years old, the Dutchman is already experienced in GT racing and was able to help his new team-mate in many ways.
"I'm not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series brings new challenges," says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I get on brilliantly and we have also made enormous progress from session to session at the Lausitzring."
It is exactly there - at the Lausitzring - that the GT Masters will also hold its first race.
From 31 July, the 33 supercars will race through Lusatia.
But Zimmermann, who is one of 15 newcomers to the series, knows the track.
He was last a guest at the Motodrom in 2015.
"It worked quickly and I didn't have to get used to the track very much," says Zimmermann, who competes for the Friedrichshafen racing association Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has many fast sections that you have to hit perfectly in order to be fast."
We'll find out in two weeks how fast Zimmermann really is.
"Of course, the teams play a bit of poker during the tests," he says.
"In the end, however, we are very satisfied and are looking forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring."

British transport minister caught cold by quarantine decision
The British government's decision to quarantine holidaymakers in Spain for two weeks after their return has caught the country's transport minister cold, according to press reports.
Accordingly, Grant Shapps is currently on holiday in Spain, of all places, while his colleagues at home decided on the measure on Saturday.
Due to the rising coronavirus numbers in Spain, the cabinet in London removed the country from the list of countries from which entry is possible without quarantine requirements.
The new rule applies from today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to quarantine on his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But the rule applies to those who are just on holiday on the deadline, only from Saturday, 1 August, and was not introduced overnight.
Incidentally, Spain is still considered one of the "safe countries" in Austria, for which no quarantine is required in Austria.
"Numerous ministers must have known in advance that there was a possibility of a quarantine being imposed on holidaymakers to Spain," commented Labour MP Diane Abbot.
"But apparently no one bothered to tell Grant Shapps."

Do you know how many species of flowering plants there are?
A quarter of a million - that's the number of known species - a quarter of a million species of flowering plants.
And blossoms are real devils.
Plants have great difficulty producing them.
They require an enormous amount of energy and raw materials.
Why do they bother?
The answer, of course, as with so much else in the world, is sex.
I know what you're thinking when you look at these pictures.
And the answer to why sexual reproduction is so important -- there are many other ways for plants to reproduce.
Take offshoots; they can have sex with themselves, so to speak; they can pollinate themselves.
But they actually have to spread their genes to mix them with other genes so that they can occupy ecological niches.
This is how evolution works.
Plants pass on this information via pollen.
Some of you may have seen some of these images before.
As I always say: everyone would have to have a scanning electron microscope at home to be able to see them.
There are as many different types of pollen as there are flowering plants.
And that's very useful for forensics and so on.
Most of the pollen that causes hay fever in us comes from plants that use the wind to spread their pollen. It's a very inefficient process, which is why so much of it ends up in our noses.
Because the plants throw out very large quantities, in the hope that the male sex cells that are in the pollen will only hit another flower by chance.
All grasses, i.e. all cereal plants and most trees transport pollen by the wind.
However, most species use insects for their purposes. And that's the smarter way, because it requires less pollen.
The insects and other species can carry the pollen directly to their destination.
We are, of course, aware of the relationship between insects and plants.
It's a symbiotic relationship. Whether flies, birds or bees, they also benefit from it, usually through the nectar.
This symbiosis has led to some wonderful adaptations - the hummingbird warbler is a beautiful adaptation.
The plant benefits from the fact that the hummingbird spreads the pollen.
Plants have developed small airstrips for bees that otherwise cannot find their way.
On many plants there are markings that resemble other insects.
These are the anthers of a lily, a very clever construction. When an unsuspecting insect lands on it, the bags flip up and hit the insect on the back, where the pollen gets stuck and is carried to other plants.
This is an orchid that looks like it has a mouth. The insects are forced to crawl out and are covered by pollen.
There are at least 20,000 species of orchids - an impressive variety.
And they have all sorts of tricks up their sleeves.
They need to attract pollinators to help them.
This orchid, known through the studies of Charles Darwin, who made a great thesis at the sight of it. You see a very long nectar tube coming down from the orchid.
And what insects have to do there in the middle of the flower - they have to stick their little proboscis in there and down the whole nectar tube to get to the nectar.
And when Darwin saw this flower, he said, "Something must have evolved in parallel with it."
And sure enough, here's this insect.
Normally it rolls up its trunk, but in its stretched form it looks like this.
You can imagine that if nectar is so valuable and costly for the plant to produce and attracts many pollinators, then it is like human sex, people begin to deceive.
They say things like, "I have nectar, do you want to come and get it?"
This is a plant.
This is a plant that insects in South Africa just love. And they've developed a long proboscis to get at the nectar.
And this is a copycat,
a plant that copies the original.
And here is the fly with a long proboscis that didn't get any nectar from the copycat. Because the imitator, contrary to what the fly expects, has no nectar at all.
But not only did the fly not get any nectar, it also - if you look very closely, at the head of the proboscis you can see pollen that it would have transferred to other plants, if only a botanist hadn't come along and stuck it on blue paper.
(Laughter) Deception runs throughout the plant kingdom.
These black dots on the flower, they look like black dots to us, but to male insects of certain species, they look like two females that are very hot.
(Laughter) And when the insect lands there, it picks up pollen, which it carries to other plants. If you look at the "every-household-should-have-one" electron microscope image, you can see that there are certain three-dimensional patterns.
It probably not only looks good for the insect, but also feels good.
And these electron microscope images - here one of an orchid imitating an insect - show that different parts of the shape have different colors and seemingly different surfaces, and to an insect's perception, the textures are very, very different.
This plant has developed the imitation of a shiny metallic surface, as seen on some beetles.
And under the electron microscope, you can see that this surface is quite different from the ones we've looked at so far.
Sometimes the whole plant imitates an insect, even in our perception.
I think it looks like a flying animal.
It's a wonderful thing.
This one is clever. It's called Obsidium.
I sometimes think of them as insidious.
To certain bees, it looks like another, particularly aggressive bee, so it flies over and bumps it on the head several times to drive it away, naturally picking up a lot of pollen.
At the same time, this plant imitates another orchid, which provides a rich food supply for insects.
But this one has nothing for them.
So she's cheating on two levels - fabulous.
(Laughter) Here we see the cananga tree, an ingredient in many perfumes.
I smelled one on someone earlier.
The flowers don't actually have to be that colourful.
They send a fantastic spectrum of scents to all insects.
This one doesn't smell so good.
This is a flower that smells really, really bad and that has evolved to mimic carrion.
That's why flies love them.
They fly in and pollinate them.
This is a Helicodiceros, also known as a "dead horse."
I don't know what a dead horse smells like, but it probably hits the plant pretty good.
It's really terrible.
And blowflies can't hold back.
They fly in all the way to the back
and lay their eggs where they think it is carrion, without realising that there is no food for the eggs, which therefore die, but the plant benefits from it, as the fly flies on again full of pollen and pollinates the next flower - fantastic.
This is Arum maculatum, the Spotted Arum.
I photographed him in Dorset last week.
It heats up to about 15° above ambient temperature - fascinating.
And if you look inside the plant, there is a kind of barrier behind the inflorescences. Flies are attracted to the heat, which creates volatile chemicals, and are then trapped at the bottom of the container.
They drink the wonderful nectar and are sticky afterwards.
At night they get a pollen shower and after that the bristles, which we saw above, slacken and thereby give way to the mosquitoes, which are full of pollen - a great thing.
If you think that's great, here's one of my favorites.
This is the Philodendron Selloum.
If anyone from Brazil is here, you will know the plant.
It's really fascinating.
This kind of phallus there is about 30cm long.
And it does something that no other plant I know does, and that's when it flowers. There in the middle are the inflorescences - for about 2 days it has a metabolism that is very similar to that of mammals.
Instead of feeding on starch, which is the food of plants, it takes something similar to brown adipose tissue and burns it so rapidly that the rate of fat burning, the metabolism, is equivalent to that of a small cat.
That's twice the energy production of a hummingbird, relative to weight - insanely impressive.
But he does something else that is unusual.
It not only heats up to 43 to 44 °C for about 2 days, but maintains a constant temperature.
It can regulate its temperature and thereby keep it constant.
They ask themselves, "Why is he doing this?"
As you can imagine, there are some beetles that love to mate at this temperature.
And they fly in and get going.
(Laughter) And the plant showers them with pollen, and they fly on and pollinate.
What a wonderful thing.
The typical pollinator for us is an insect. But in the tropics, many birds and butterflies also pollinate.
And many tropical flowers are red and we think this is because birds and butterflies look similar to us and can therefore see the colour red very well.
If you look at the spectrum of birds and humans, we see red, green and blue, so this spectrum here.
Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet and different levels of ultraviolet.
So something that goes beyond our spectrum.
And I hear you asking, "Wouldn't it be great if we could see that too?"
Of course we can.
So what does an insect see?
Last week I photographed this sunflower in Dorset.
As you can see, these are little yellow flowers, little yellow flowers everywhere.
And this is what they look like in visible light.
This is what it looks like when you take out the red.
Most bees do not see red.
And then I photographed with ultraviolet filters and exposed the special ultraviolet frequencies for a very, very long time and that's what came out.
And that's a fantastic target.
We don't know exactly what bees see, just like you don't know what I see when I say "That's red."
We cannot see into the minds of insects or other people.
But the contrast will be something like this. It stands out against the background.
Here's another little flower - different range of ultraviolet frequencies, different filters that are similar to pollinators.
And that's what they would see.
If you now think all yellow flowers have this property - no flower was harmed for this picture; it was only attached to the tripod, not killed - but under ultraviolet light it looks like this.
And that could serve as the basis of a sunscreen, because sunscreens absorb UV light.
The substances in the plant could be helpful.
Finally, we have an evening primrose that Bjorn Rorslett sent me from Norway - fantastic hidden patterns.
I love the idea of hidden things.
I think there is something poetic in that. Namely, that these images were taken with UV filters, filters that are mainly used by astronomers to photograph Venus - more precisely, its nebulae.
This is the main purpose of these filters.
Venus is the goddess of love and fertility, and that in turn is the story of flowers.
And flowers not only show great efforts to attract pollinators, they also manage to make us plant large fields full of them and give them to each other at births and deaths, and especially at weddings, which, if you think about it, is the moment when the exchange of genetic material from one organism to another is fixed.
Thank you very much.

Greta Thunberg: Evil eye against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest on Stephen Colbert's well-known late-night show via video link and revealed in the interview what she had in mind when she met Donald Trump.
Climate activist Greta Thunberg was a guest on a popular US late-night show via video link.
Among other things, she told of her struggle against the powerful of the world.
The teenager also spoke about her famous "evil eye" during her encounter with Donald Trump.
New York City - In the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has attracted attention with her tireless work for the "Fridays For Future" movement.
Now she spoke in a well-known latenight show about her plans in the future as well as her encounter with US President Donald Trump at the UN climate summit last year.
Late-night host Stephen Colbert welcomed the 17-year-old Thunberg to his show on Tuesday and conducted a lengthy interview with the Swede.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the powerful of the world.
"There are some things that surprised me," she said.
She was shocked by "how far people go to shift the focus away from the climate crisis."
She has experienced "everything from organized hate campaigns to threats just because a group of children takes to the streets."
She finds heads of state and leading politicians who mock her on social media or even try to silence her "funny" because they show her the reactions "because they have no other answer to it."
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was asked about a well-known scene in which she gave US President Trump a bitter look.
At the 2019 UN Climate Summit in New York, for which the activist sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive gaze was captured by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
The short clip was turned into a GIF, an animated image that eventually became one of the most frequently used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think of the US president at that moment?
To the relatively open question of Stephen Colbert, she answered only briefly and dryly: "To be honest, I don't think that needs any further explanation."
The experienced satirist Colbert had probably not expected the quick-witted answer and disappeared from the picture with a short laugh.
With her "How dare you?" speech about the principles of climate protection, she was remembered by many at the climate conference.

He later commented on life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that has happened to me in my life is the drugs - the best thing was to land a number 1 hit."
Towards the end of the decade, Green scored a surprise hit in 1979 with an album inspired by religious themes.
Meanwhile, Fleetwood Mac swam without him in a new formation on a wave of success.
