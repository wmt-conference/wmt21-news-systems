We shouldn't know.
You could have known.
Please make everyone aware of a very simple fact for a moment: we know pretty much everything we know about the universe through light.
We can stand on Earth and look into the night sky and look at stars with our bare eyes.
The sun burns our peripheral vision.
We see light reflected by the moon.
and in the time that has passed since Galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope at the celestial bodies, the universe known to us has travelled to us as visible light, crossing immeasurable ages of cosmic history.
With the help of all our modern telescopes, we have been able to study all this: this impressive silent film of the universe, this series of snapshots dating back to the Big Bang.
But the universe is not a silent movie, because the universe is not silent.
I would like to convince you that the universe has a soundtrack and that this soundtrack is played in outer space itself: because space can vibrate like a drum.
It can sound a kind of sound recording that can be heard throughout the universe; of some of the most dramatic events when they occurred.
Now we would like to add a tonal component to the wonderful visual arrangement we have from the universe.
And even if we've never heard the sounds of the universe before, we should slowly turn up the volume control for what's happening out there over the next few years.
Out of this ambition to capture songs from the universe, we focus our interest on black holes and the promise inherent in them. Black holes hammer against space-time like wooden mallets on a drum. They have a very characteristic sound that I would like to play to you; or our idea of how this song will sound.
One day we may see a shadow cast by a black hole against a bright background, but so far we have not succeeded.
And yet you can hear black holes, even if they are invisible, because they play like a drum in space-time.
We owe the idea that the universe sounds like a drum to Albert Einstein, to whom we owe so much.
Einstein realized that if outer space were empty, if the universe were empty, it would have to look like this picture, just without this helpful grid.
But if we moved through space in free fall, even without this helpful grid, then perhaps we could paint it ourselves, because we would recognize that we are moving along straight lines, along undistorted, straight paths through the universe.
Einstein also realized (and that's what it's all about) that when you bring energy or mass into the universe, it bends the universe.Â If a body in free fall, let's say, passed the Sun, it would be distorted along the natural curvature lines in space.
This is Einstein's magnificent General Theory of Relativity.
Even light is bent along these paths.
And a body can be bent so strongly that it gets into an orbit around the sun, like the earth, or like the moon in the earth's orbit.
These are natural curvatures in space.
What Einstein did not know was that if you took the sun and compressed it into a ball six kilometres in diameter, if you took something with millions of times the mass of the earth and compressed it to six kilometres, you would create a black hole, a body of such density that light that came too close to it would never be able to escape.
But Einstein considered black holes to be a mathematical curiosity throughout his life.
He did not believe that they really existed.
He was convinced that nature would protect us from its formation.
It would take decades for the term " black hole " to be coined and people to understand that black holes are astrophysical bodies; in fact, they are the lifeless state of extremely dense stars that collapse in a horrific catastrophe at the end of their lives.
Our sun, however, will not end up as a black hole.
It is simply not large enough.
But we carried out a small thought experiment, just as Einstein liked to do.Â Let's imagine that we are compressing the sun to a diameter of six kilometres and bringing a tiny earth into its orbit, let's say 30 km away from this black sun.
This earth would shine by itself (since the sun would then have disappeared if there were no other light source), so we let our little earth shine by itself.
We could put the Earth into a carefree orbit about 30 km away from the crushed black hole.
This crushed black hole would be about the size of Manhattan.
It would pour a little more into the Hudson before it destroyed the earth.
But that's something we're talking about.
We're talking about something you can squeeze until it's half the size of Manhattan.
Now we bring the Earth very close, up to about 30 km, and see how it moves in a completely flawless orbit around the black hole.
There is a kind of myth that black holes devour everything in the universe, but in fact you have to get very close to them to fall into them.
But what is particularly impressive from our point of view is the fact that we can always see the Earth.
She cannot hide behind the black hole.
The light that comes from the earth, some of it falls into it, but some is scattered and returns to us.
So you can't hide anything behind a black hole.
If this is the battle star Galactica and you are fighting against the Cylons, then you better not hide behind the black hole.
They can see them.
So our sun will not collapse into a black hole, its mass is not enough, but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
If one of them wiped out the Milky Way, it would look like this.
We would see a shadow of the black hole against the backdrop of billions of stars in the Milky Way galaxy and their glowing dust tracks.
If we were to fall towards this black hole, we would see all the light bent around it, and we could even step into the shadow without noticing anything unusual happening.
It would be bad if we tried to ignite our engines and escape, because we could not, just as the light could not escape.
But even if the black hole is dark from the outside, it is not dark inside, because all the light from the galaxy could fall behind us.
And although due to a phenomenon of the theory of relativity (the so-called time dilation) our clocks seemed to go slower in relation to galactic time, it would appear as if the development of the galaxy had accelerated and shot towards us just before we were crushed to death by the black hole.
It would be like a near-death experience to see the light at the end of the tunnel, but it would be a comprehensive death experience.
(Laughter) And you couldn't tell anyone about the light at the end of the tunnel.
Now we have never seen such a shadow of a black hole, but black holes can be heard, even if they are invisible.
Imagine an astrophysically realistic situation: imagine two black holes that have lived a long life together.
Perhaps it was once stars that collapsed into two black holes, each with a mass ten times that of the Sun.
We are now squeezing them together to a diameter of 60 km.
They can rotate several hundred times per second.
At the end of their lives, they orbit each other almost at the speed of light.
They can travel thousands of kilometres in a fraction of a second, and while doing so, they not only bend space, but also leave behind in their wake a sound of space, a real wave of space-time.
Space contracts and expands as it flows out of these black holes and hammers onto the universe.
And they travel out into the cosmos at the speed of light.
We owe this computer simulation to a relativity working group at NASA Goddard.
It took almost 30 years for someone to solve this problem.
This was one of those groups.
Here we see two black holes circling each other, again with the helpful painted lines.
Maybe you can see - it's a bit indistinct - but when you see the red waves coming out, they are gravitational waves.
They actually represent the sound of sounding outer space and will emerge from these black holes at the speed of light as they become quieter and quieter and eventually merge into a rotating, silent black hole.
If you were close enough, the sound of space contracting and expanding would roar in your ears.
You could literally hear the sound.
Of course, your head would also be pressed and stretched, which would be quite unpleasant, which is why you would have trouble understanding what is happening.
But I would like to show you what sounds we would predict here.
This is from my working group - a somewhat less glamorous computer model.
Imagine a lighter black hole falling into a very heavy black hole.
What you hear is the sound with which the light black hole hammers onto space, every time it comes close to it.
When it moves away, it's a bit too quiet.
But it hits like a mallet and literally shatters the universe, making it vibrate like a drum.
We can predict what that will sound like.
We know that when it falls in, it gets faster and louder.
And finally we hear the little guy fall into the big guy.
I've never heard it so loud - it's really much more dramatic.
At home it sounds a bit disappointing.
More like ding, ding, ding.
This is another sound from my group.
No, I'm not going to show you any pictures, because black holes don't leave any helpful ink marks.
But if you were floating around in space during a space holiday and you would hear this here, then you should make sure that you get away.
(Laughter) You really should get away from that noise.
Both black holes are moving.
Both black holes are getting closer to each other.
In this case, they first vibrate very strongly.
And then they merge.
This chirping is typical for the fusion of two black holes, so that it chirps at the end.
This is our conception of what we would see.
Fortunately, we are at a safe distance here in Long Beach, California.
But it is highly likely that two black holes have just merged somewhere in the universe.
And it is just as certain that space oscillates around us after it has probably taken millions of light years, or a million years to travel to us at the speed of light.
But the sound is far too quiet for us to ever hear.
Experiments are being carried out on Earth with great zeal, one of which is called LIGO - which are intended to detect deviations in the way space contracts and expands again, deviations in the order of magnitude smaller than an atomic nucleus over a distance of four kilometres.
It is an incredibly ambitious project and its sensitivity will be further developed in the coming years - in order to be able to perceive it here.
There will also be a mission for outer space, which will hopefully be launched within the next ten years: LISA.
LISA will be able to see huge black holes, black holes with millions or billions of times the density of the sun.
In this image from the Hubble telescope, we see two galaxies.
They look as if they are frozen in an embrace.
Each probably contains a huge black hole inside.
But they are not frozen. They merge with one another.
These two black holes collide and become one over the course of billions of years.
Our human faculty of perception is not able to grasp a song of such duration.
But LISA could see the final stages of two giant black holes, at an earlier stage in the history of the universe, the last 15 minutes before they merge.
And it's not just about black holes, but also about all the major disturbances in the universe - and the biggest of all is the Big Bang.
When the term was coined, it was meant contemptuously - " Who believes in a Big Bang, a Big Bang? "
This animation by friends of mine in the Proton Studios shows an outside view of the Big Bang.
We never really want to try; we never want to be within the universe, because you can never be outside the universe.
So imagine that you are in the Big Bang.
It is everywhere, all around you, and outer space wobbles and oscillates completely uncontrollably.
14 billion years have passed, but this song still rings out around us.
Galaxies form and generations of stars are born in these galaxies, and a habitable planet orbits around one of these stars, at least a single one.
And here we sit, working like crazy on these experiments, making calculations and writing computer code.
Imagine that two black holes collided a billion years ago.
Their song has been sounding through space ever since, all the time.
We didn't even exist back then.
It is getting closer and closer - 40,000 years ago we still painted cave paintings.
If it were the Big Bang we were recording, it would sound like that.
It is literally the epitome of noise.
It's white noise, it's such a chaotic sound.
But it is all around us, probably at least if it has not been wiped out by another process in the universe.
When we record it, it will sound like music to our ears, because it will be a quiet echo, an echo of the moment of our creation, of our visible universe.
Within the next two years, we will be able to make the soundtrack a little louder and present the universe as a sound image.
But if we can grasp those very earliest moments, it will bring us much closer to understanding the Big Bang, which in turn will bring us closer to some of the most complex, most elusive questions.
If we played a film of the universe backwards, we would know that there was a Big Bang in the past, and we could even perceive the cacophony of its sound.
I think we have to ask the question: Has something like this ever happened before?
Will it be repeated?
I think in the spirit of the challenge posed by TED - to rekindle wonder - we can ask questions, at least at this last minute, which might otherwise elude us forever.
But we have to ask ourselves: Is it possible that our universe is just an offshoot of a larger story?
Or is it possible that we are just an offshoot of a multiverse - each offshoot with its own Big Bang in its past - perhaps some of them have drum-playing black holes, others perhaps not - in some there may be intelligent life, in others not - not in our past, not in our future, but in some way fundamentally connected to us?
So we have to ask ourselves: if there is a multiverse, do living beings exist in another fragment of this multiverse?
These are my creatures of the Multiverse.
Are there other living beings in this multiverse who are concerned about us and their own origins?
And if they exist, I can imagine that they are like us, that they calculate and write computer codes, build instruments, try to make out the most distant sound of their origin and wonder who else is out there.
Thank you. Thank you.

Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvest workers infected
Following a mass corona infection on a large vegetable farm in Mamming, Lower Bavaria, almost 500 people are under quarantine and are no longer allowed to leave the business.
A security service monitors the ban on going out.
A total of 174 harvest workers were tested positive for the corona pathogen Sars-CoV-2 during the screening, as the Dingolfing-Landau District Office announced on Saturday evening.
" In order to avoid further spread, we unfortunately have to take this step to protect the population, " explained District Administrator Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees in the company had already been infected - this was the reason for the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm that grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and beetroot - but the cucumbers are only for jars.
Mamming is a rural community with a population of around 3,300, not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.

On the farm, infected employees were separated from non-infected employees, and the site is now surrounded by a fence.

Many people believe that driving is an activity reserved only for people who can see.
A blind person driving a car safely and independently has so far been considered an impossible task.
Hello, my name is Dennis Hong, and we want to give blind people freedom and independence by building a vehicle for the blind.
So, before I talk about this car for the blind, let me talk briefly about another project I've been working on, called the DARBA Urban Challenge.
The aim was to build a robotic car that could drive itself.
You press Start, nobody touches anything, and it can reach its destination completely automatically.
Thus, in 2007, our team won half a million dollars by finishing third in the competition.
Around this time, the National Association for the Blind, or NFB, challenged the Investigation Committee to produce a car that could be safely and independently driven by a blind person.
We decided to give it a try, because we thought, hey, how difficult it can be.
We already have an automatic vehicle.
We put a blind person in and it's done, isn't it?
(Laughter) We couldn't have been wrong.
What the National Association for the Blind (NFB) wanted was not a vehicle that drives blind people around, but a vehicle where a blind person can make active decisions and drive.
So we had to throw everything away and start all over again.
Therefore, in order to test this crazy idea, we developed a small buggy prototype vehicle to test its feasibility.
And in the summer of 2009, we invited dozens of young blind people from all over the country and gave them the opportunity to take a spin.
It was an absolutely amazing experience.
But the problem with this car was that it was designed so that it could only be driven in a controlled environment, a level, traffic-free car park, and that even the lanes were highlighted with red cones.
Therefore, with this success, we decided to take the next big step to develop a true car that can be driven on the right roads.
So how does it work?
Well, it's a rather complicated system, but let me try to explain it, and maybe I can simplify it.
Well, we have three steps.
We have perception, computation and non-visual interfaces.
Well, it is clear that the driver cannot see, so the system must be able to perceive the environment and collect information for the driver.
For this, we use an initial measuring unit.
It measures the acceleration, the angular acceleration, like a human ear, an inner ear.
We merge the information with a GPS unit to get approximately the position of the car.
We also use two cameras to detect the lanes of the road.
And we also use three laser distance measurements.
The lasers scan the environment to detect obstacles, a car approaching us from the front or from behind, and also any obstacles entering the road, any obstacles around the vehicle.
After that, all this enormous amount of information is passed on to the computer, and the computer can do two things.
First, first of all, process the information to understand what the environment is like; these are lanes on the road, the obstacles, and convey this information to the driver.
The system is also smart enough to calculate the safest way to operate the car.
We can also generate instructions on how to operate the controls of the vehicle.
But, the problem is this: how can we convey this information and these instructions to a person who cannot see quickly enough and fairly accurately so that they can drive?
For this, we have developed different types of non-visual user interface technology.
We started with a three-dimensional ping sound system, a vibrating vest, a click wheel with voice commands, a foot strip, and even a shoe that puts pressure on the leg.
But today, we're going to talk about three of these non-visual user interface technologies.
Well, the first interface technology is called DriveGrip.
This is a pair of gloves, and it has its vibrating elements on the ankle side, so they can give instructions on how to control, direction and intensity.
Another device is called the SpeedStrip.
This is a chair, strictly speaking, it is a massage chair.
We hollow it out, and we reorganize the vibrating elements into different patterns, and we use them to convey information about the speed, and also to give instructions on how to use the accelerator and brake pedal.
Therefore, here they can see how the computer sees the environment, and since they cannot see the vibration, we even equip the driver with red LEDs so that he can really see what's going on.
This is the sensory data, and this data is forwarded to the devices via a computer.
Therefore, these two devices, DriveGrip and SpeedGrip, are very effective.
But the problem is that they are stitch instructions devices.
Therefore, this is not a real freedom, is it?
The computer tells you how to drive, turn left, turn right, accelerate, stop.
We call it the back seat driver problem.
Therefore, let's move away from the stitch instruction devices and now focus more on the information devices.
A good example of this non-visual information interface technology is AirPix.
Think of it as a monitor for the blind.
Well, it's a small tray, it has lots of holes, and it releases compressed air, so it can even draw pictures.
Therefore, even if they are blind, they can put their hand on it, see the lanes and the obstacles on the road.
In fact, they can also change the air frequency that escapes, and possibly the temperature.
Therefore, it is in fact a multidimensional user interface.
Well, here you can look at the left camera, the right camera seen from the vehicle, and see how the computer interprets this and sends the information to the AirPix.
For this, we show a simulator, a blind person who drives and uses the AirPix.
This simulator was also very useful for training blind riders and also quickly testing different kinds of ideas for different types of non-visual user interfaces.
Therefore, that's how it mainly works.
But this vehicle is a prototype, and it will not enter the road until it is proven to be safe, or safer than today's vehicles.
And I really believe that this can happen.
But nevertheless, will society, would they accept such a radical idea?
How will we manage the insurance?
How will we issue driving licences?
Apart from the technological challenges, there are many kinds of hurdles that we have to overcome before it becomes a reality.
Of course, the main objective of this project is to produce a car for a blind person.
But potentially more important than this is the huge benefit of the spin-off technology that can be drawn from this project.
The sensors that are needed can see in the dark in fog and rain.
And together with these new types of interfaces, we can use this technology and use it in safer cars for people with normal vision.
Or for blind people, in everyday appliances in the home, in training and in the office.
Imagine a teacher writing on a blackboard in a classroom, and a blind student can see and read what he has written using these non-visual interface technologies.
This is priceless.
Therefore, the things I have shown you today are just the beginning.
Thank you very much.

Discuss the abolition of the 50 + 1 rule
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended that consideration be given to abolishing the 50 + 1 rule.
" German football should at least discuss laying down conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates a fait accompli, " Grindel told " Bild am Sonntag. "
He stressed: " For the clubs that are most likely to pose a threat to Bayern and Dortmund, the 50 + 1 rules don't work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, there is no getting around the debate as to whether it is not appropriate to make it easier for clubs that want to break into this phalanx to involve investors. "
However, he has doubts as to whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority participation, which is prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50 + 1 rule.
" It remains a legal risk to erect investment fences around the Bundesliga as a business location in a European internal market, " said Grindel.
The former DFB boss sees the danger that " the attempts to create a more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will ultimately only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs on a European level, but will not lead to more tension in the championship. "

He had received the gift worth around 11,000 euros from a Ukrainian official.
" I have committed a breach of compliance, and it was right to draw the consequences from this, " said Grindel.
" I handled the ominous watch gift in a completely transparent and unsuspecting manner.
Many in the DFB knew about it. "
He had never " made a secret of the gift, " the 58-year-old assured.

Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes defy Corona
Although there was no big party in the spa town, visitors and performers enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative programme.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organisers: the Rakoczy weekend without the Rakoczy festival.

Argentina rejects creditors' counter-offer
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economy in Buenos Aires announced on Saturday.
" That would not only be irresponsible, but also unfair, " it said in a statement.
" While 50 percent of children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors. "
The debts of the second largest economy in South America are no longer sustainable under current conditions.
For this reason, Argentina is demanding that its private creditors waive part of their claims of around 66 billion US dollars (around 59 billion euros).

It would be the ninth default in Argentina's history.

For the current year, experts predict a decline in economic power of around ten percent.

Professionally arrived - privately not yet
" It's going really well " - this is the conclusion drawn by Dr Stefanie Kramer after her first days in the notary's office in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very quickly: in mid-May, Dr Stefanie Kramer learned that she was going to succeed Lutz Feller in the notarial office in Eggenfelden.
Just six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the doctor of law began work, and normal day-to-day business has long been in full swing.
" However, I still have to arrive privately, " she explains in an interview with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
Of course, the short lead time was not enough to completely relocate the centre of life from Regensburg to Eggenfelden, reports the Dingolfing native.
Together with her husband, who works as a judge at the Regional Court in Regensburg, she is currently looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city.
At least her husband was able to apply for parental leave at short notice in order to be able to take care of their two daughters (3 ½ and 1 ½ years old).
In order not to have to commute from Regensburg every day, the 39-year-old explains that for the time being she also has accommodation with her parents in Dingolfing.
Having grown up in the neighbouring district, she has of course long been familiar with the town of Eggenfelden.
During on-site visits with her family over the past few months, she has once again discovered that " Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town. "
She was all the more pleased that she had won the race in the selection process for the vacant position.
Her native Lower Bavaria also plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career: After studying law in Passau, she completed her legal traineeship and the second state examination in Regensburg.
After several positions as a notary assessor, including in Rehau and Hof in Upper Franconia, Babenhausen in the Unterallgäu and Regensburg - during which time she also " incidentally " shouldered her doctorate in employment law - she took up her first position as a notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016 she took parental leave, which was followed by a move to Regensburg.
Since then she has taken over representation services in various notarial offices.
When the position in Eggenfelden was advertised due to the approaching retirement of Lutz Feller, the 39-year-old explained that the time had come for her full return to work.
The team of her predecessor, who will take over the holiday replacement in the notarial office in the future, has completely taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer - and immediately has praise for the firm's team: " It's going really well! "
The fact that she can rely on well-coordinated processes here makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of her private centre of life.
In terms of nursery and nursery places, she has already made contact with a local institution.
And if everything goes as planned, she hopes to be able to pursue her hobby here soon - and get to know the most beautiful jogging routes in the Rottal.

BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be 20 percent full at the start of the season if fans return.
" Due to the distance regulation, which must be adhered to, we are currently planning with 12,000 to 15,000 spectators, " said Borussia Dortmund's managing director Carsten Cramer to the " Tagesspiegel. "
Normally, the arena in the district town holds slightly more than 81,000 spectators for Bundesliga matches.
In the ghost games last season caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BVB lost around four million euros per game.
Cramer, who is responsible for marketing, digitalisation and internationalisation at BVB, hopes that in addition to the normal spectator seats, some of the approximately 4000 seats in the hospitality sector can also be opened again: " It is of course a blow to the office if these revenues are completely lost. "
In view of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, everyone is currently " well advised to take a stable page first. "
" If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people in Germany alone are on short-time work, then the need for entertainment is limited, " explained Cramer.
The head of marketing in Dortmund praised the BVB pros for their partial salary waiver, which is intended to help overcome the crisis: " Of course, the players know that their salary waiver has a different effect than if we put 100 people working in merchandising on short-time work. "

Kalbitz's expulsion from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of " Feigenblatt "
From the point of view of the FDP, the expulsion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is just a " fig leaf " and does not change the character of the party.
" The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the far right in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD, " FDP politician Benjamin Strasser told the dpa news agency in Berlin.
On Saturday in Stuttgart, after several hours of hearings, the Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD confirmed the expulsion of Kalbitz, which was decided by a majority of the Federal Executive Board in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD faction in the Brandenburg state parliament.
" If the AfD really wanted to consistently remove right-wing extremists from their party, functionaries such as Björn Höcke and his supporters would have been excluded long ago, " said Strasser.
" However, there is no political will in the AfD to do so, because right-wing extremism is now part of the party. "
CSU General Secretary Markus Blume expressed a similar view: " The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded says nothing and does not change anything, " he told " Welt am Sonntag. "
" It speaks volumes how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist in the midst of the AfD still has. "
Blume assumes that the AfD will again end up under five percent in future elections.
" The AfD's days in parliament are numbered. "
Kalbitz was one of the spokesmen of the now officially dissolved " wing " around the Thuringian AfD regional and parliamentary party chairman Björn Höcke; the Office for the Protection of the Constitution classifies the tone as a " certain right-wing extremist endeavor. "
In May, the AfD national executive threw Kalbitz out of the party.
The reason he gave was that when he joined the party, Kalbitz did not state that he had previously been a member of the now banned far-right " Heimattreue Deutsche Jugend " (HDJ) or of the Republicans.
Kalbitz denies membership in the HDJ.
The chairman of the left-wing parliamentary group in the Brandenburg state parliament, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court did not change the character of the AfD: " The wolf has only eaten chalk.
The AfD remains a far-right party, with or without Kalbitz. "
This decision would neither weaken the federal party nor the right wing.
" The manoeuvre of the Meuthen troops is transparent.
They want to avoid further observation by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution and try to get through under the radar, " said Walter.
" The AfD cannot rid itself of the ghosts it has invoked.
Being kicked out won't change anything, " commented Brandenburg SPD General Secretary Erik Stohn on the decision in the Kalbitz case.
" Here, the AfD regional association and the parliamentary group have remained their right-wing leader to this day. "
The legal battle over Kalbitz's membership in the AfD will continue.
The latter announced on Saturday that he would now take civil action against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court.

North Sea wind farms provide a good 21 percent more electricity
The wind power plants on the German North Sea fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid in the first six months of the year.
This is a good 21 percent more than in the same period last year, according to network operator Tennet in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of North Sea electricity to the mainland and its transmission through the German electricity grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of Tennet's grid area, have fed in a further 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, wind power from the North and Baltic Seas thus comes to 13.73 TWh, compared to a good 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of total wind power in Germany; that is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms ensure higher generation capacities
In addition to wind conditions, the increased contribution of offshore wind energy results from higher generation capacities because new wind farms have been connected to the grid over the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea were all running at full power at the same time, they could mathematically generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this, amounting to 7.1 gigawatts, according to Tennet.
It is expected to increase to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea by 2030.
" In Germany and the Netherlands, we will invest 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore grid connections by then, " said Tennet Managing Director Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, even at sea, wind farms cannot make full use of their capacity, reaching around 40 percent.
The previous record day this year is 2 January, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce around 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
This would enable almost seven million households to be supplied with electricity.

More air traffic controllers in Worms in the future
Worms University continues to take to the skies: " DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung " endows a professorship for " Air Traffic Management. "
A corresponding contract between the university and DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and will start in 2021.
The professorship makes it possible to start your studies not only in the summer semester, but also in the winter semester.
This means that twice as many students can be trained as before.
At the same time, capacities at both the university and the DFS Air Navigation Academy are being used to their full potential.
DFS will advise the university on the establishment and appointment of the professorship.
Represented at the university since 2019
Since the summer semester of 2019, the first students have been enrolled in the Air Traffic Management degree programme as part of their training as air traffic controllers at Worms University of Applied Sciences.
Nine students have already started this year.
So far, the experience of DFS has been very positive, and the achievements of the students are outstanding.
The combination of studies and pilot training makes a significant contribution to further increasing the attractiveness of the pilot profession.
" In these times, funding is not easy for us economically.
However, we firmly expect air traffic to recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to be able to fulfil our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel, " said Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman and CEO of DFS, at the signing ceremony.
" For DFS, the endowed professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, interdisciplinary knowledge base in the long term.
We are therefore continuing the good cooperation with the university and at the same time underpinning our attractiveness as an employer. "
This is also underlined by Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of Worms University of Applied Sciences: " The endowed professorship forms an important bridge between science and industry.
With it, we would like to build on the existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual bachelor's programme in Air Traffic Management. "
The trust of German air traffic control is both a motivation and an obligation for Worms University of Applied Sciences to further expand its teaching and research expertise in the future-oriented fields of aviation.
Working for the air traffic controllers of tomorrow, the university can set very special highlights and innovative priorities for its students with the first endowed professorship for a dual course of study.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary in the Ministry of Science, Continuing Education and Culture, emphasises: " With its focus on aviation, Worms University of Applied Sciences has a unique selling point in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the university's profile. "

Heil wants to examine other sectors after the meat industry
The COVID-19 crisis brought the situation in parts of the meat industry to light once again.
Tightening of laws is imminent.
But are they right - and will they remain so?
Following the now planned strict regulations against abuses in the meat industry, Federal Minister of Labour Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to examine other sectors as well.
" We will look at industry by industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary, " Heil told the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employers are already warning against restricting work contracts in general.
Following the mass outbreak of corona at meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet wants to pass a law by Heil this Wednesday.
Large-scale slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to employ external personnel for slaughter, cutting and meat processing.
To this end, the use of contract and temporary workers is to be banned there.
Employer President Ingo Kramer told dpa: " Stay away from a general restriction on work contracts and temporary employment if you do not want to strangle the economy completely. "
Contracts for work and services are, for example, the essential basis for creating added value for customers in a wide range of trades, the construction industry and plant engineering.
" The mistakes of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument. "
Heil assured: " My aim is not to ban contracts for work and services everywhere in the German economy. "
Contracts for work and services make sense.
" If an industrial company commissions a tradesman to install a security system, this is a completely normal work contract. "
The German meat industry considers a ban on work contracts and temporary agency work to be unconstitutional in its sector alone.

Wages were withheld for protective equipment or rent.
It was also noted that the situation regarding the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively strict law for the meat industry had already come into force in 2017.
However, these have been circumvented by " tricky constructions. "
" A fundamental clean-up is now required. "
The politician announced: " The Occupational Safety and Health Act, which we want to pass in the Cabinet at the end of July, also includes measures that not only affect the meat industry - for example, higher examination rates for occupational safety and health or clear criteria for communal accommodation. "
The draft presented to dpa includes amendments to the Act on the Protection of Workers' Rights in the Meat Industry and the Occupational Health and Safety Act.

Juventus Turin champions in Italy
Turin - After a redeeming goal by Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in a row.
The team around the five-time world football player completed the 36th Scudetto in the club's history with a score of 2: 0 (1: 0) on Sunday evening in their home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo scored 1-0 before half-time.
With 83 points, Turin, which competed without former international Sami Khedira, who was recently injured for a long time, can no longer be pushed out of first place two match days before the end of the Serie A season.
Inter Milan, second in the standings, is seven points behind.
Juventus were harmless despite their optical superiority in the first half, then Ronaldo scored with the final action after a free kick variant.
The 35-year-old scored a pass from Miralem Pjanic directly from the boundary of the penalty area with a flat shot (45 + 7).
Against the now more offensive guests, Ronaldo was also involved in the 2-0, with Federico Bernardeschi (67) gathering dust after his shot.
This ensured the lackluster but decisive success.
The foul in the 89th minute, which was missed to the bar, was probably only the fault of Ronaldo himself with regard to the goal scorer's score.

Due to the defeat, the team from Turin had not yet been able to complete the championship.
In the end, Juve's reassuring lead at the top of the standings was mainly due to the weakness of his competitors.
In the eleven games leading up to Sunday's game, the Sarri team had only managed to score five wins.
Whether Ronaldo will also become the top scorer is questionable.

Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - Despite all the threatened penalties and court rulings, drivers continue to step on the gas in countless illegal races on the roads of Baden-Württemberg: In the past year and the first four months of this year, the police in the south-west have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
There are no comparable figures for previous years, but the speeders are increasingly making work for the judicial authorities: A total of 155 investigations into illegal races were conducted at the public prosecutor's offices between Konstanz and Mannheim in 2018, a year later there were already 252 and in the current year by the beginning of June 151.
The races were less about organised events, as can be seen from the response of the Ministry of the Interior to an inquiry by the Landtag-SPD.
In most cases, the drivers competed against each other spontaneously or fled from the police - this is also reported as an illegal race.
The drivers were mainly German men between the ages of 18 and 60.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases are speeders caught and asked to pay: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines have been imposed and 15 prison sentences handed down since 2018.
However, there are no indications that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
On the contrary, other drivers reacted more sensitively than in the past due to the numerous tragic accidents and lawsuits, and reported more frequently, said a ministry spokesman.
Autobahn 8 is particularly popular with racers. Again and again, drivers brake the traffic there in order to make room for themselves and use the free track for a race.
Last August, a dozen drivers were caught near Kirchheim unter Teck; three months earlier, there were as many as 18 drivers on the A8 near Merklingen.
The A81 is the most popular " race track "
The police even register more races on the A81 than on any other federal motorway.
With a speed limit, an attempt is being made to slow down the speeders on the particularly affected section between Engen and Geisingen.
The mostly high-priced and pimped-up sports and luxury cars often have Swiss license plates because drivers resort to racing in Germany because of the high penalties for driving too fast and car racing in the neighbouring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit must not be reduced to a few routes: " With a general speed limit of 130 kilometres per hour, we would get rid of this problem on motorways, " says Martin Rivoir, the traffic expert for the SPD parliamentary group.
" The inhibition threshold for speeders would be significantly higher if you were not allowed to travel legally here and there at 200 kilometres per hour or more. "
Rivoir thinks less of education or image campaigns: " Anyone who ignores all the rules in this way and puts not only their own lives, but also the lives of other road users at risk, can hardly be reached with reason. "
ADAC calls for stronger police crackdown
However, this is not enough for the ADAC: " We assume that racers will not be deterred by the speed limits, " says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and Environment at ADAC Württemberg.
He is calling for additional and tougher checks on the affected routes.
Not infrequently, the high-speed trial of strength turns into painful and momentous seriousness: Since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people across the country have died in the races, two of them innocent bystanders in a night-time crash in the centre of Stuttgart and one in Gerlingen.
Two young men are said to have competed in a car race there in November.
One of the vehicles came off the road, crashed into a garden wall and stopped on its side, and the 18-year-old co-driver died.
21 other people have been injured in the races over the past two years.
However, in the opinion of Minister of the Interior Thomas Strobl, stricter penalties are not necessary: " There is no need for legislative action to sanction illegal motor vehicle races more severely, " says the paper of the Ministry of the Interior.

I first visited Antarctica almost 10 years ago, where I saw my first icebergs.
I was seized with awe.
My heart was racing, I was dizzy, trying to grasp what was in front of me.
The icebergs around me protruded almost 60 metres out of the water, and I could only marvel that it was a snowflake on top of another snowflake, year after year.
Icebergs are born as the calf of a glacier or by breaking out of ice floes.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They interact in a clear way with their environment and their experiences.
Some refuse to give up and cling to the bitter end, while others can no longer stand it and collapse in a fit of dramatic passion.
When you look at an iceberg, it's easy to think that they are isolated, separate and alone, just as we humans often see ourselves.
But the truth is far from that.
As an iceberg melts, I breathe in its ancient atmosphere.
As the iceberg melts, it releases mineral-rich drinking water that feeds many life forms.
In my photographs of these icebergs, I proceed as if I were taking portraits of my ancestors, aware that in these individual moments they exist in this way, and will never exist in this way again.
It is not death when they melt; it is not an end, but a continuation of their path along the life cycle.
Part of the ice in the icebergs I photograph is very young - a few thousand years old.
And part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old.
The last pictures I would like to show you show an iceberg that I photographed in Kekertsuatsiak in Greenland.

You can see here, he starts rolling, and the boat has moved to the other side, the man is standing there.
This is the average size of a Greenland iceberg.
It protrudes about 120 feet from the water, or 40 meters.
And this video is in real time.
(Music) And just like that, the iceberg shows you another side of his personality.
Thank you.

Nuremberg: Unauthorised tuning meeting - police intervene, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and at times more than 1000 people took part in a " tuning meeting " on Saturday night in the parking lot of a furniture store.
The police implemented their announcement that they would increase their control of such events.
A major tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (25 July 2020) in the south of Nuremberg.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the police of Middle Franconia, the Nuremberg traffic police noticed an increased number of vehicles in the area of a large car park in Ingolstädter Straße at around 10: 30 p.m.
As a result, the police carried out a large number of vehicle inspections there.
Only recently, the police announced that they would step up their efforts to combat so-called autoposers.
Illegal tuning meeting in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the " scene "
At the top of the list were around 700 vehicles and around 1100 people, according to the police.
Of these, however, only a small proportion of those present can be attributed to the " autoposer " and tuning scene.
Apparently, the majority of the relevant scene complied with the police's appeal.
On the basis of the vehicles and people on site, it can be assumed that these were mainly onlookers.
In addition, the vast majority of those present complied with the applicable infection protection regulations, in particular compliance with the minimum distance and wearing a mouth-nose protection.
The control measures carried out on site were completed at around 1: 00 a.m.
In total, the officials noticed such structural changes to 10 vehicles that the operating permit had expired.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.

Employment Agency figures: 900 suspected cases of abuse of short-time work
Berlin - According to its own statement, the Federal Employment Agency (BA) is investigating around 900 suspected cases of misuse of short-time work allowances.
" With more than 880,000 companies reporting short-time work, this is extremely low, " said Daniel Terzenbach, the managing director responsible for operations, to the " Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. "

In addition, the BA uses analysis software to identify patterns of misuse.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible wave of insolvency in the autumn.
" Will there be significantly more insolvencies than in the previous year?
The assessments differ, but we are preparing ourselves for the eventuality and are already training our employees in the employment agencies to process applications for insolvency money. "
The figures are still inconspicuous, said Terzenbach.

Austria: Mass tests after corona outbreak in tourist resort
Authorities have responded to a corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist resort of St. Wolfgang with hundreds of tests.
The number of confirmed cases rose to 48, according to the state authorities in Linz.
More than 100 results were still to come in the evening.
According to the study, many of those infected are young trainees in tourism businesses, but at least one holiday guest also tested positive.
Residents, guests and tourism staff were asked to stay in their accommodation on Saturday evening.
The curfew was set at 23: 00.
" There are cancellations and cancellations of bookings here and there, " the head of the Wolfgangsee Tourism Association, Hans Wieser, told dpa.
A few guests also left early.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist resort in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, around one third of the guests are Germans.
The first infections became public knowledge on Friday.
On Saturday, the head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended the behaviour of the trainees, who had celebrated in several restaurants and could have been infected there.
" We all enjoyed doing this in our youth, " he told radio station Ö1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The tourism association has launched an information campaign to raise awareness among young employees of the dangers of COVID-19.
Starting on Saturday, hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from 15 July were contacted.
The outbreak evokes memories of the Austrian ski and party resort of Ischgl in Tyrol, which in the early stages of the pandemic was a centre for the spread of COVID-19 throughout Europe.
In total, more than 1500 people in Austria are currently infected with the virus.
The focus of new infections is on Vienna and Upper Austria.

They all know that what I'm about to say is true.
The intuition that inequality weakens social cohesion existed even before the French Revolution.
What is new is that we now have evidence: we can compare societies, more equal and more unequal, and see what inequality does.
I would like to show you statistics and explain why there are connections between them.
Let's see what a poor bunch we are.
(Laughter) I'd like to start with a paradox.
This shows life expectancy and gross national income - on average in rich countries.
You can see that the countries on the right, Norway and the USA, for example, are twice as rich as Israel, Greece and Portugal on the left.
And that doesn't change their life expectancy at all.
There is nothing to be said for a connection.
But within societies, there are huge social gaps in health across society.
Here, once again, life expectancy.
Here are small areas in England and Wales - the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.
A big difference between the poor and the rest of us.
Even people just below the top are in worse health than those at the top.
So income is very important within individual societies, and none at all between them.
The explanation for this paradox is that within societies we are dealing with relative income, social position, status - where we stand in relation to each other, and how large the gaps between us are.
And when you understand this, you immediately ask yourself: What happens when the differences become larger, or smaller, when income differences rise or fall?
And that's what I'll show you now.
Not with hypothetical data.
Using data from the UN - the same that the World Bank uses - on the extent of income disparities in rich, developed market democracies.
The measure we use, because it is easy to understand and available for download, is how much richer the top 20 percent are than the bottom 20 percent of any country.
You can see that in the same countries on the left - Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden - the top 20 percent are around 3 ½, 4 times as rich as the bottom 20 percent.
But on the other hand - Great Britain, Portugal, the USA, Singapore - the differences are twice as great.
On this scale, we are twice as unequal as some of the other successful market democracies.
Now I'm going to show you what that does to our societies.
We have collected data on problems with social disparities, the problems that are more common at the bottom of the social ladder.
Internationally comparable data on life expectancy, children's knowledge of mathematics, reading and writing, infant mortality and murder rates, what proportion of the population is imprisoned, teenage pregnancies, trust, obesity, mental illness - which in standard diagnostics include drug and alcohol addiction - and social mobility.
We have summarised them in an index.
All with the same weight.
For each country there is a kind of average value of these factors.
And here you see it in relation to the degree of inequality that I have shown you, to which I will return again and again.
The more unequal countries are doing worse for all these social problems.
This is an unusually high correlation.
But if you put the same index of health and social problems in relation to GNI per capita, to gross national income, there is nothing more, no correlation.
We have worried that people think we have only chosen the problems that support our reasoning and constructed this evidence, which is why we have also published an article in the British Medical Journal on the UNICEF Index of Child Welfare.
In it, 40 different components were put together by other people.
The index contains whether children can talk to their parents, whether they have books at home, their immunization rates, whether there is bullying at school.
Everything flows into it.
Here is the index in relation to our inequality values.
Children perform worse in unequal societies.
A highly significant ratio.
And again, when comparing the child welfare index to national per capita income, there is no correlation, not even a hint.
All the data I've shown you so far say the same thing.
The average well-being of our societies no longer depends on national income and economic growth.
These are crucial in poorer countries, but not in the rich developed world.
But the differences between us, where we stand in comparison to each other has become very important.
I will now show you individual parts of our index.
Here, for example, is trust.
Simply the proportion of the population that believes that most people can be trusted.
The data comes from the World Values Survey.
On the more unequal side, around 15 percent of the population believe that others can be trusted.
But in the same societies, the figure is as high as 60 or 65 percent.
And for the degree of integration into communal life or social capital, there are similarly close references to inequality.
We have done all this work twice.
First with the rich, developed countries, and then in a second test field once again with the 50 American states - with the same question: do the more unequal states perform worse on all these scales?
Here, according to data collected by the US government, trust is correlated with inequality.
A very similar distribution across a similar range of trust levels.
The same thing is happening here.
Our fundamental conclusion is that almost all factors that are internationally linked to trust do the same in the 50 US states, in a separate test environment.
And that's not just a happy coincidence.
Here are mental illnesses.
WHO compiled these figures by conducting the same diagnostic interviews with randomly selected test subjects in order to be able to compare the rates of mental illness in societies.
This is the percentage of the population who were mentally ill in the previous year.
It ranges from 8 percent to three times that - entire societies that have three times the rates of mental illness as others.
And again a high correlation to inequality.
And here violence.
These red dots are American states, the blue triangles are Canadian provinces.
Note the scale of differences.
It ranges from 15 murders per million to 150.
That is the proportion of the population that is in prison.
There is about a tenfold difference on the lateral log scale.
It is estimated that between 40 and 400 people have been detained.
This ratio is not primarily due to higher crime rates.
In some places, this is a sub-factor.
But the main reason is tougher court rulings.
And more unequal societies are also more likely to adhere to the death penalty.
Here are children who drop out of school.
Again, quite large differences.
With devastating effects in terms of the use of talents in the population.
Here is social mobility.
Actually a measurement of mobility based on income.
The question is: Do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons, or is there no connection between them?
On the more unequal side, fathers' income is much more important -- in Great Britain, in the USA.
And in the Scandinavian countries, fathers' income is far less important.
There is more social mobility.
We like to say - and I know that many Americans are here in the audience - that if Americans want to live the American dream, they should go to Denmark.
(Laughter) (Applause) I have just introduced you to a few things.
I could have shown you a host of other problems.
All of these problems are more common at the lower end of the social gradient.
But there are countless problems with social disparities that are worse in more unequal countries - not just a bit, but somewhere between 2 times and 10 times as common.
Imagine these costs, the human costs.
But I would like to come back to the graph, in which we have summarized everything to show two things.
On the one hand, graph by graph, it shows that the countries that do poorly, regardless of the outcome, are apparently the more unequal, and those that do better seem to be the Nordic countries and Japan.
So what we are seeing is a general social dysfunction that goes hand in hand with inequality.
This applies not only to one or two things, but to most.
The other very important aspect of this graph can be seen below: Sweden and Japan - in many respects very different countries.
The position of women, how much they cling to the nuclear family, here they lie at the opposite poles of the rich, developed world.
Another very important difference is how they achieve their greater equality.
In Sweden there are enormous differences in earnings, which are offset by taxation, the general welfare state, generous social benefits, etc.
It's completely different in Japan.
There are fewer differences in earnings even before the tax.
There are lower taxes.
A smaller welfare state.
And in our analysis of the American states we find the same contradiction.
Some states are successful through redistribution, others are doing well because they have small income differences before taxes.
Our conclusion is that it doesn't really matter how you achieve greater equality, as long as you somehow achieve it.
I'm not talking about perfect equality, I'm talking about something that already exists in rich market democracies.
Another surprising part of the picture is that it is not only the poor who are affected by inequality.
Apparently there is some truth in John Donne's " No one is an island. "
In several studies it is possible to compare how people in more or less the same countries perform at every level of the social hierarchy.
This is just one example.
Infant mortality.
Some Swedes have kindly classified the majority of their infant deaths according to the British Register of Socio-economic Classification.
This is an anachronistic classification according to fathers' occupations, meaning that single parents are managed separately.
But where " low social class " is noted, this means unskilled manual work.
Then there are the skilled craft professions in the middle, then the subordinate non-craft professions, up to the higher professions - doctors, lawyers, managers of larger companies.
You can see that Sweden is better than Britain, across the entire social hierarchy.
The biggest differences are at the bottom of society.
But even at the top, living in a more equal society seems to bring a small advantage.
We show this in five different data sets that deal with educational success and health in the USA and internationally.
This seems to be generally the case - greater equality matters the most at the bottom, but has some advantages even at the top.
But I should say something about what is happening.
I am interested in the psychosocial effects of inequality.
This has to do with feelings of superiority and inferiority, the feeling of being valued or devalued, respected or despised.
And, of course, the feeling of status competition that results from this drives consumerism in our society.
It also leads to status uncertainty.
We are more concerned about how we are judged by others, whether we are seen as attractive, smart, etc.
Social judgements are increasing, and so is the fear of these judgements.
Interestingly, there is similar research in social psychology: some people have evaluated 208 different studies in which volunteers were invited to psychological laboratories to measure their stress hormones and their response to stressful tasks.
What interested them in the evaluation was which types of stress most reliably raised the cortisol level, that of the central stress hormone.
And the result was: tasks that posed a threat to social assessment - threats to self-confidence or social status in which others can judge their own performance negatively.
These types of stress have a very specific effect on the physiology of stress.
We have been criticized.
Of course, there are people who can't handle this and people who find it amazing.
However, I should tell you that if we are criticised for a targeted selection of our data, we will never make a specific selection for our purposes.
Our absolute principle is that if our data source has data for one of the countries we are looking at, it is included in the analysis.
Our data source determines whether it is reliable data, not us.
Anything else would be bias.
What about other countries?
There are 200 studies on health in relation to income and equality in academic peer-reviewed journals.
This is not limited to these countries, it is a very simple demonstration.
The same countries, the same inequality scale, one problem after another.
Why don't we check other factors?
We have shown that per capita income makes no difference.
And, of course, others have also used more sophisticated methods to examine poverty and education, and others.
What about causality?
A correlation does not yet prove causality.
We spent a lot of time doing this.
In fact, people know the causal relationships very well in some of these results.
The big news in our understanding of the drivers of long-term health in the rich developed world is how much chronic social stress strains the immune system, the cardiovascular system.
Or, for example, the reason why violence is more widespread in more unequal societies is because people are sensitive to being despised.
To cope with this, we need to clarify what happens after the tax and what happens before the tax.
We have to limit income, with bonus culture incomes at the top.
We must hold our bosses accountable to our employees as best we can.
But the message to take away is that we can improve the actual quality of human life by addressing the income gap between us.
Suddenly there is a lever for the psychosocial well-being of entire societies, and that is very exciting.
Thank you.

Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualified for the Champions League
London (dpa) - The English football record champions Manchester United are returning to the Champions League after a year of absence.
On the final day of the Premier League, the Red Devils secured third place in the standings with a 2-0 (0-0) victory over their direct rivals Leicester City.
The Foxes will now have to settle for the Europa League, as Chelsea FC passed by and also qualified for the premier class in fourth place.
Aston Villa was able to cheer in the fight against relegation.
Manchester United took the lead with a penalty kick from Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in injury time, Jesse Lingard (90 + 8) scored the final score.
Chelsea, FC Bayern's opponent in the Champions League round of 16, won 2: 0 (2: 0) against Wolverhampton Wanderers in parallel thanks to Mason Mount (45th + 1) and Olivier Giroud (45th + 4).
" That means a lot to me, " said coach Frank Lampard, who in his first season as Chelsea coach is also up against Arsenal in the FA Cup final.
Chelsea's victory against Wolverhampton also benefited Tottenham Hotspur, who passed the Wolves with a meagre 1: 1 (1: 0) win at Crystal Palace and started sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa won the long-distance duel with Watford FC and AFC Bournemouth, but had to tremble for a long time for a place in the league at West Ham United.
Andrej Yarmolenko (85) immediately made up for the late lead of Jack Grealish (84).
However, the 1: 1 (0: 0) score was enough because Watford lost 2: 3 (1: 3) to Arsenal.
The club, which lost three coaches in the season, is relegated after five years in the premier league.
Just like Bournemouth, which could no longer save itself with a 3: 1 (2: 1) victory at Everton.
In the end, one point was missing.
Liverpool FC, who have been the English champions since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3: 1 (1: 1) victory at Newcastle United.
99 points is the highest score the Reds have ever scored in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team narrowly missed the points record in English football.
Manchester City holds the record with 100 points in the 2017 / 18 season.
After the Newcastle lead in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) turned the game for Liverpool on Sunday.
" It was an extraordinary season for this wonderful club, " said goalscorer van Dijk after the match, " which should spur us on to defend the title.
It will be difficult. "
The Premier League bosses should also be satisfied in the end.
Due to the coronavirus crisis, football operations in England were interrupted from 13 March to 17 June.
In the meantime, it has even been discussed whether the games should be abandoned prematurely or whether the remaining games should be played on neutral ground.
In the end, however, the season could be played to the end without any special incidents - albeit as in Germany without spectators in the stadiums.

Today I would like to show you how we will manufacture things in the future.
I believe that our buildings and machines will soon assemble, duplicate and repair themselves.
I will show you what I think of today's production methods, and then compare them with some natural systems.
In the current manufacturing industry we have skyscrapers - two and a half years [construction period], half a million to a million parts, quite complex, new and exciting technologies made of steel, concrete, glass.
We have exciting machines that take us into space - five years [of construction], two and a half million parts.
On the other hand, if you look at natural systems, you will find proteins that have two million types and can fold in ten microseconds, or DNA with three billion base pairs that can be copied in about an hour.
So there is all this complexity in our natural systems, but they are extremely efficient, much more efficient than anything we can make, far more complex than anything we can build.
They are much more energy efficient.
They almost never make mistakes.
And they are durable because they can repair themselves.
So there are many interesting things to discover about natural systems.
And if we manage to incorporate this into our built environment, then we have exciting potential for new construction methods.
And I believe that the key is self-assembly.
If we want to use self-assembly in our physical environment, I think there are four key factors.
The first is that we need to decipher all the complexity of the things we want to build - our buildings and machines.
And we have to translate that into simple sequences - the DNA of how our buildings function, so to speak.
Then we need programmable parts that can use this sequence and use it for folding or reconfiguring.
We need activation energy so that our parts can fold up from the programme.
And we need a kind of redundancy for error correction to really create what we want to build.
I will show you some of the projects that my colleagues and I at MIT are working on so that self-assembly can be realised in the future.
The first two are MacroBot and DeciBot.
These projects are large-scale, reconfigurable robots - proteins two and a half to four metres long.
They are equipped with electromechanical devices, sensors.
You decode what you want to fold into a sequence of angles - minus 120, minus 120, 0, 0, 120, minus 120 - something like that; a sequence of angles, or rotations, and you send that sequence through the chain.
Each unit picks up its message - i.e. minus 120 - it rotates accordingly, checks whether it has arrived, and forwards it to the neighbouring unit.
These are the brilliant scientists, engineers and designers who have worked on this project.
And I think it makes one thing really clear: is this really scalable?
I mean, thousands of dollars, many hours of work to create this two and a half meter tall robot.
Can we really scale it up? Can we really embed robotics in every part?
The next project questions this and looks at the passive nature or the passive attempt to make reconfiguration programmable.
But it goes one step further and attempts to make actual calculations possible.
It basically integrates the most fundamental component of IT, the digital logic gate, directly into the parts.
This is a NAND gate.
You have a tetrahedron, which is the gate that will perform the calculations, and you have two input tetrahedrons.
One represents the input of the user while creating the blocks.
The other comes from the previous component that was arranged.
And then it provides an output in three-dimensional space.
This means that the user can enter what the components should do.
It performs calculations based on what it has done before and what the user requires of it.
And now it begins to move in three-dimensional space - up and down.
On the left, the input [1,1] corresponds to the output 0, which goes down.
On the right, the input [0,0] corresponds to the output 1 that goes up.
What this really means is that our structures now contain the plans of what we want to build.
They therefore have all the information they need about what has been built.
This means that we can achieve a form of self-replication.
In this case, I call it self-directed replication, because the structure contains the exact blueprints.
If errors occur, a part can be replaced.
All the local information is integrated to show how to fix it.
So you could have something that climbs and reads along and delivers an output of one to one.
It is directly integrated; there are no external instructions.
The last project I'm going to show is called Biased Chains, and it's probably the most exciting example of self-assembling systems we have at the moment.
It takes up the ability for reconfiguration and programming and creates a completely passive system.
Basically, you have a chain of elements.
Each element is completely identical and they are polarized.
Every chain, or element, wants to turn to the right or to the left.
So while you're putting the chain together, you're basically programming it.
Each unit is told whether it should turn to the right or to the left.
When you shake the chain, it folds together to form a configuration that you have programmed in - in this case a spiral or, in this case, two adjacent cubes.
Basically, you can program any three-dimensional shape - or one-dimensional, two-dimensional - completely passively into this chain.
What does that tell us about the future?
I think it tells us that there are possibilities of self-assembly, replication and repair in our physical structures, our buildings and machines.
There are new possibilities for programming in these parts.
And this opens up new possibilities for IT.
We will have spatial programming.
Imagine that our buildings, bridges, machines, all our components could carry out calculations.
This would mean parallel and distributed computing power, new design possibilities.
So there is an exciting potential for this.
I think that these projects, which I have shown here, are only a tiny step towards this future if we implement these new technologies for a new, self-creating world.
Thank you.
(Applause)

Arrests and violence at demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against Prime Minister Netanyahu are becoming increasingly fierce.
Violent clashes broke out during the night.
The Israeli police took violent action in Jerusalem on Sunday night against participants in a demonstration against right-wing conservative Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu.
According to police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld, twelve people have been arrested for participating in riots.
Among other things, the police used water cannons to disperse the rally.
According to media reports, a total of around 6,000 people gathered near Netanyahu's official residence on Saturday evening.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu's handling of the COVID-19 crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew horns and called on Netanyahu to resign.
Participants in a counter-demonstration who supported Netanyahu have also been arrested, reported the news website " ynet. "
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the Prime Minister's private villa in the coastal town of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
According to the police, a man was arrested near Tel Aviv on suspicion of spraying pepper spray from a moving car on demonstrators on the side of the road.
Another man was detained following a stabbing attack on a demonstrator in the south of the country.
The demonstrator's neck was slightly injured.
There have recently been several demonstrations against Netanyahu in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
The rallies accompany the corruption case against the head of government.

North Korea seals off border town following suspected case of corona
North Korea has so far seen its own measures to ward off the coronavirus as a " shining success. "
The country is now reporting a suspected case for the first time.
Due to a first official case of suspected corona in the country, North Korea has completely cordoned off a major city for fear of a catastrophe.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defence measures in the past six months, " the malignant virus could have been introduced into the country, " the state media reported.
A state of emergency has been declared for the region around the border town of Kaesong.
The communist leadership declared the highest level of alarm.
If the suspected case is confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the isolated country.
According to its own statements, North Korea has not yet registered a single infection and has described its defence measures as a " shining success. "
The information was doubted abroad.
According to reports, the symptoms of the disease were found in an " outlier " who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on 19 July.
The person fled to South Korea three years ago and has now returned across the border.
For the time being, there was no confirmation from South Korea that the border had been crossed within the military buffer zone, which is four kilometres wide and for the most part still mined.
However, according to reports by the national news agency Yonhap, South Korea's military acknowledged the possibility of an illegal border crossing to North Korea as high.
Investigations have been carried out on a number of individuals.
According to its own statements, North Korea called an emergency meeting of the Workers' Party Politburo, chaired by leader Kim Jong Un, on Saturday because of the suspicion.
The " dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive catastrophe. "
As a preventive measure, Kim had already ordered on Friday that " Kaesong be completely blocked and that every district and region be isolated from others, " the statement went on.
The affected person, as well as all people in Kaesong who have had contact with them, have been put under quarantine.
Accordingly, the party's central military commission is to investigate the " runaway case " as well as the conduct of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose severe punishment.
It is estimated that around 300,000 people live in Kaesong.

Tension ahead of Council meeting: City East and noise protection to be discussed before the summer break
" In addition to environmental issues, the committee members will also vote on the development plan for the large-scale project Innenstadtentwicklung-Ost, " it says rather casually in the middle section of the city's press release on the next city council meeting on Tuesday, 28 July, at 4.30 p.m. in the Great Hall of the CongressCentrum Pforzheim.
However, the upgrading of the eastern part of the city is the subject of heated debate right up to the end.
The majorities for this are scarce, most recently even negative in individual committees, depending on attendance.
An appeal from industry (construction, real estate, trade and IT) not to let the project developed by the citizens and then by the administration and the local council fail after almost ten years of preparation was criticized by project opponent Reinhard Klein as an " extra-parliamentary opposition, " " unaware, " " speculation, " " defamation " and " deliberate false statements. "
" Everyone thinks they know better, " said Klein, who has been a member of the municipal council for a year as the only representative on the citizens' list in Pforzheim.
In fact, after reading the contracts, he was in this position: " I know what I'm talking about. "
The exit would be cheaper for the city, and contrary to statements by the city administration, the Technical Town Hall is looking for subsidies, the existence of which Klein is convinced will cost 8.5 million euros to renovate.
The development of the town will be very different from that predicted by the town hall and by supporters from the business community.
Shaping the city through his own efforts and not an investor: that is his plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP / FW / UB / LED faction, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
Essentially, it also provides for the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, keeping the Schloßberg open, renting the Ex-Thales for administrative areas and a smaller-scale redesign of the city centre, ideally with local sponsors.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues in particular will play a central role.
Among other things, the local council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the population of Pforzheim from health-related noise pollution caused by road traffic, many of which include speed reductions.
In a press release, the local Verkehrsclub Deutschland welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of the fact that this must happen, because they have only contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus noise by neglecting regular bus services with thinned-out cycles and little commitment to cycling, according to the VCD.
The town council will also vote on the city's participation in the Pforzheim / Enzkreis Energy and Climate Protection Agency.
The agenda also includes accession to the Climate Protection Pact of the state of Baden-Württemberg, the resetting of parental contributions in municipal day-care centres and the application for admission to federal smart city funding.
Citizens are welcome, but must take corona protection measures to heart.

Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with much delay
With a delay of almost six months, Tim Zimmermann will start his debut season in the ADAC GT Masters on 31 July.
Before the league of super sports cars can go into regular operation, it was time for the first test runs.
For Zimmermann, the main objective was to get to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 better.
For a long time, the corona crisis prevented Tim Zimmermann from embarking on his first business trip in Grasser Racing's new Lamborghini Huracan.
This was now possible under special hygiene conditions.
The 23-year-old driver from Langenargen completed his first laps at the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his debut in a GT3 car.
" There are already a few things that are different from the Porsche from the previous season, " says Zimmermann.
" With the ABS, for example, you have to go into corners differently.
But it was really a lot of fun. "
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite being only 25 years old, the Dutchman is already experienced in GT racing and has been able to help his new team mate in many ways.
" I'm not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series brings with it new challenges, " says Zimmermann.
" Steijn and I understand each other brilliantly and we have also made enormous progress from session to session at the Lausitzring. "
It is precisely there - at the Lausitzring - that the GT Masters will hold its first race.
From 31 July, the 33 super sports cars will race through Lusatia.
However, Zimmermann, who is one of 15 newcomers to the series, knows the track.
In 2015 he was most recently a guest at the Motodrom.
" It worked out quickly and I didn't really have to get used to the track, " says Zimmermann, who is competing for the Graf Zeppelin racing team in Friedrichshafen.
" The Lausitzring has many fast sections that you have to hit optimally to be fast. "
How fast Zimmermann really is will be revealed in two weeks' time.
" Of course, the teams play poker a bit during the tests, " he says.
" Ultimately, however, we are very satisfied and are looking forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring. "
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a tightly packed calendar.
Seven races are scheduled until the beginning of November.
The current situation is that no spectators will be allowed - but there will be a prominent guest.

British Minister of Transport caught off guard by quarantine decision
According to press reports, the British government's decision to put holidaymakers in Spain under quarantine for two weeks after their return has caught the country's Minister of Transport off guard.
According to the report, Grant Shapps is currently on holiday in Spain of all places, while his colleagues at home decided on the measure on Saturday.
Due to the rise in corona numbers in Spain, the cabinet in London removed the country from the list of countries from which entry is possible without quarantine requirements.
The new regulation will apply from today, Sunday, which means that Shapps will also have to go into quarantine after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But for those who are just on holiday on the cut-off date, the regulation only applies from Saturday, 1 August, and was not introduced overnight.
Incidentally, Spain is currently regarded in Austria as one of the " safe countries " for which no quarantine in Austria is required.
" Many ministers must have known in advance that there is a possibility that a quarantine will be imposed on holidaymakers in Spain, " commented Labour MP Diane Abbot.
" But apparently nobody bothered to let Grant Shapp know. "

Do you know how many kinds of flowering plants there are?
A quarter of a million - that is the number of known species - a quarter of a million species of flowering plants.
And flowers are real Teufelskerle.
Plants struggle to produce them.
They require an enormous amount of energy and raw materials.
Why are they making this effort?
The answer is, of course, like so many other things in the world: sex.
I know what you are thinking of when you look at these pictures.
And the answer to why sexual reproduction is so important -- there are many other ways for plants to reproduce.
Let's take offshoots; they can have sex with themselves, so to speak; they can pollinate themselves.
But they actually have to spread their genes in order to mix them with other genes so that they can occupy ecological niches.
This is how evolution works.
Plants pass on this information via pollen.
Some of you may have seen some of these pictures before.
As I always say, everyone needs to have a scanning electron microscope at home to be able to see them.
There are as many different types of pollen as there are flowering plants.
And this is very useful for forensics and so on.
Most of the pollen that triggers hay fever comes from plants that use the wind to spread their pollen, which is a very inefficient process, which is why so much of it ends up in our noses.
Because the plants throw out very large quantities, in the hope that the male sex cells, which are in the pollen, will only hit another flower by chance.
All grasses, i.e. all cereal crops and most trees, transport pollen through the wind.
However, most species use insects for their own purposes, and this is the smarter way, as it requires less pollen.
The insects and other species can bring the pollen directly to its destination.
We are of course aware of the relationship between insects and plants.
Whether flies, birds or bees, they also benefit from it, usually through the nectar.
This symbiosis has led to some wonderful adaptations - the hummingbird moth is a beautiful adaptation.
The plant benefits from the fact that the hummingbird spreads the pollen further.
Plants have developed small runways for bees that would otherwise not find their way.
On many plants there are markings similar to other insects.
When an unsuspecting insect lands on it, the bags fold up and hit the insect on the back, where the pollen gets stuck and is taken to other plants.
This is an orchid that looks like it has a mouth, forcing the insects to crawl out and become covered with pollen.
There are at least 20,000 species of orchids - an impressive variety.
And they have all sorts of tricks up their sleeve.
They must attract pollinators to help them.
This orchid, known from the investigations of Charles Darwin, who put forward a great thesis at the sight of it: you see a very long nectar tube coming down from the orchid.
And what insects have to do there in the middle of the flower - they have to put their little proboscis in there and down the entire nectar tube to get to the nectar.
And when Darwin saw this flower, he said, " Something must have developed in parallel. "
And indeed, here is this insect.
Usually it rolls up the proboscis, but in its elongated shape it looks like this.
You can imagine that if nectar is so valuable and laborious for the plant to produce and attracts many pollinators, then it is like human sex that people begin to deceive.
For example, they say, " I have nectar, do you want to come and get it? "
This is a plant.
This is a plant that insects in South Africa simply love, and they have developed a long proboscis to get their nectar.
And this is an imitator,
a plant that copies the original.
And here is the fly with a long trunk that has not received any nectar from the imitator, because the imitator, contrary to what the fly expected, has no nectar at all.
But the fly has not only not received nectar, it also has - if you look very closely, at the head of the proboscis you can see pollen that it would have transferred to other plants if only a botanist had not come by and glued it to blue paper.
(Laughter) Deception runs through the entire plant kingdom.
These black dots on the flower, they look to us like black dots, but for male insects of certain species they look like two females that are very hot.
(Laughter) And when the insect lands there, it picks up pollen, which takes it to other plants.If you look at the " Every household should have one " electron microscope image, you can see that there are certain three-dimensional patterns.
It not only looks good for the insect, but also feels good.
And these electron microscope images - here one of an orchid imitating an insect - show that different parts of the shape have different colors and seemingly different surfaces, and for the perception of an insect, the textures are very, very different.
This plant has developed the imitation of a shiny metallic surface, as can be seen on some beetles.
And under the electron microscope, you can see that this surface is completely different from the one we have looked at so far.
Sometimes the whole plant imitates an insect, even in our perception.
I think it looks like a flying animal.
It's a wonderful thing.
This one is clever. It's called obsidium.
I sometimes see them as malice.
For certain bees, it looks like another, particularly aggressive bee, so it flies there and hits it on the head several times to drive it away and naturally absorbs a lot of pollen in the process.
At the same time, this plant imitates another orchid, which provides a rich food supply for insects.
But this one has nothing for them.
So she cheats on two levels - fabulous.
(Laughter) Here we see the cananga tree, an ingredient in many perfumes.
I smelled one on someone earlier.
The flowers don't really have to be so colourful.
They send a fantastic spectrum of scents to all insects.
This one doesn't smell so good.
This is a flower that smells really horrible, and it has evolved to imitate carrion.
That's why flies love them.
They fly in and pollinate them.
This is a Helicodiceros, also known as the " dead horse. "
I don't know what a dead horse smells like, but the plant probably does it quite well.
It is really terrible.
And blowflies cannot hold back.
They fly straight to the back
and lay their eggs where they think it is carrion, without realizing that there is no food for the eggs, which therefore die, but the plant benefits from it, as the fly full of pollen flies on again and pollinates the next flower - fantastic.
This is Arum maculatum, the spotted aron rod.
I photographed him in Dorset last week.
It heats up to about 15 ° above ambient temperature - fascinating.
And if you look inside the plant, there is a kind of barrier behind the inflorescences. Flies are attracted by the heat that creates volatile chemicals. They are then trapped at the bottom of the container.
They drink the wonderful nectar and are sticky afterwards.
At night they get a pollen shower, and then the bristles we saw above slacken, clearing the way for mosquitoes that are full of pollen - a great thing.
If you think that's great, now comes one of my favorites.
This is the Philodendron Selloum.
If someone from Brazil is here, you will know the plant.
It is really fascinating.
This species of phallus there is about 30cm long.
And it does something that no other plant I know does, namely when it flowers. There in the middle are the inflorescences - for about 2 days it has a metabolism that is very similar to that of mammals.
Instead of feeding on starch, which is the food of plants, it takes something similar to brown adipose tissue and burns it so quickly that the fat burning rate, the metabolism, corresponds to that of a small cat.
This is twice the energy production of a hummingbird in relation to its weight - incredibly impressive.
But he does something else that is unusual.
It not only heats up to 43 to 44 ° C for around two days, but also maintains a constant temperature.
It can regulate its temperature and thus keep it constant.
They ask themselves, " Why is he doing this? "
As you can imagine, there are some bugs that love to mate at this temperature.
And they fly inside and set off.
(Laughter) And the plant showers them with pollen, and they fly on and pollinate.
What a wonderful thing.
The typical pollinator for us is an insect, but in the tropics many birds and butterflies also pollinate.
And many tropical flowers are red, and we believe this is because birds and butterflies look similar to us and can therefore see the colour red very well.
If you look at the spectrum of birds and humans, we see red, green and blue in this spectrum.
Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet, and different levels of ultraviolet.
In other words, something that goes beyond our spectrum.
And I hear you ask, " Wouldn't it be great if we could see that too? "
Of course, we can.
So what does an insect see?
Last week I photographed this sunflower in Dorset.
As you can see, these are small yellow flowers, small yellow flowers everywhere.
And that's what they look like in visible light.
That's what it looks like when you remove the red.
Most bees don't see red.
And then I photographed with ultraviolet filters and exposed the special ultraviolet frequencies for a very, very long time, and that was the result.
And that is a fantastic target.
We don't know exactly what bees see, just like you don't know what I see when I say " That's red. "
We cannot look into the thoughts of insects or other people.
But the contrast will be something like that. It stands out against the background.
Here is another small flower - different bandwidth of ultraviolet frequencies, other filters similar to pollinators.
And that's what they would see.
If you now think all yellow flowers have this property - no flower was harmed for this picture; it was only attached to the tripod, not killed - but under ultraviolet light it looks like this.
And this could serve as the basis for a sunscreen, because sunscreens absorb UV light.
The substances in the plant could be helpful in this regard.
Finally, we have an evening primrose that Bjorn Rorslett sent me from Norway - fantastic hidden patterns.
I love the idea of hidden things.
I think it contains something poetic, namely that these images were taken with UV filters, filters that are mainly used by astronomers to photograph Venus - more precisely, its nebulae.
This is the main purpose of these filters.
Venus is the goddess of love and fertility, and that, in turn, is the story of flowers.
And flowers not only show great efforts to attract pollinators, they also manage that we plant large fields full of them and give them to each other during births and deaths, and especially at weddings, which, when you think about it, are the moment when the exchange of genetic material from one organism to another is determined.
Thank you very much.

FC Bayern München: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start of the heated preparation phase for the Champions League began with a setback for double winners FC Bayern.
Having recovered " reasonably well " after a short holiday and a few training days, Hansi Flick has to think about how he can rebuild his successful defence after the injury of world champion Benjamin Pavard.

Greta Thunberg: Evil eye against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest on Stephen Colbert's well-known late-night show via video and revealed in an interview what she had in mind when she met Donald Trump.
Climate activist Greta Thunberg was a guest in a popular US late-night show via video.
Among other things, she talked about her fight against the powerful of the world.
The teenager also talked about her famous " evil eye " when she met Donald Trump.
New York City - Over the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has drawn attention to herself with her tireless commitment to the " Fridays For Future " movement.
Now she spoke in a well-known late-night show about her plans for the future and her meeting with US President Donald Trump at the UN climate summit last year.
Late-night presenter Stephen Colbert welcomed 17-year-old Thunberg to your programme on Tuesday and conducted a longer interview with the Swede.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the world's powerful.
" There are some things that surprised me, " she said.
" How far people are going to steer the focus away from the climate crisis, " she said, was shocking.
" Everything from organised hate campaigns to threats just because a group of children are taking to the streets, " she said.
Heads of state and leading politicians who scoff at her on social media or even try to silence her find her " funny " because the reactions show her " because they have no other answer. "
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview, when Greta Thunberg was asked about a well-known scene in which she cast a bitterly angry look after US President Trump.
At the UN Climate Summit 2019 in New York, for which the activist sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive gaze was captured by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
The short clip resulted in a GIF, i.e. an animated image, which ultimately became one of the most frequently used images for Trump opponents.
But what was the 17-year-old thinking about the US president at that moment?
To the relatively open question posed by Stephen Colbert, she answered only briefly and dryly: " To be honest, I think that needs no further explanation. "
The experienced satirist Colbert had probably not reckoned with the quick-witted answer and disappeared from the picture with a brief laugh.
With her " How dare you? " speech on the principles of climate protection, she was remembered by many at the climate conference.
