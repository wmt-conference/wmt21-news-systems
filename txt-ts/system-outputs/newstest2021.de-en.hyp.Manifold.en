Jan Christopher Horak wrote: "The film is a remarkable achievement of the director.
We shouldn't know.
You could have known.
Please be aware for a moment of a very simple fact: Pretty much everything we know about the universe, we know through light.
We can stand on earth and look into the night sky, looking at stars with our naked eyes.
The sun burns our peripheral vision.
We see light reflected from the moon.
And in the time that has passed since Galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope at the celestial bodies, the universe known to us has traveled to us as visible light, passing through immeasurable ages of cosmic history.
With the help of all our modern telescopes, we have been able to study all this: This impressive silent film of the universe, this series of snapshots dating back to the Big Bang.
But the universe is not a silent movie, because the universe is not silent.
I want to convince you that the universe has a soundtrack and that this soundtrack is played in space itself: Because space can vibrate like a drum.
It can be a kind of sound recording that can be heard throughout the universe; of some of the most dramatic events when they occurred.
Now we would like to add a tonal component to the wonderful visual arrangement we have of the universe.
And even if we have never heard the sounds of the universe before, we should slowly turn up the volume control for what is happening out there over the next few years.
Out of this ambition to capture songs of the universe, we focus our interest on black holes and their inherent promise. Black holes hammer against space-time like wooden mallets on a drum. They have a very characteristic sound that I would like to play to you; or our idea of how this song will sound.
One day we might see a shadow cast by a black hole against a bright background, but we haven't succeeded so far.
And yet you can hear black holes, even if they are invisible, because they play on space-time like a drum.
We owe the idea that the universe sounds like a drum to Albert Einstein, to whom we owe so much.
Einstein realized that if space were empty, if the universe were empty, it would have to look like this picture, but without this helpful grid.
But if we moved through space in free fall, even without this helpful grid, then perhaps we could paint it ourselves, because we would realize that we are moving along straight lines, along undistorted, straight paths through the universe.
Einstein also realized (and this is exactly what it is about) that if you bring energy or mass into the universe, it curves the universe. If a free-falling body, say, passed the sun, it would be distorted along the natural curvature lines in space.
This is Einstein's great General Theory of Relativity.
Even light is bent along these paths.
And a body can be bent so strongly that it enters into orbit around the sun, like the earth, or like the moon in orbit around the earth.
These are natural curvatures in space.
What Einstein didn't know was this: If you took the Sun and squeezed it into a ball six kilometers in diameter, if you took something with a million times the mass of the Earth and squeezed it into six kilometers, you would create a black hole; a body of such density that light coming too close to it could never escape. It would be a black shadow in front of the universe.
But Einstein considered black holes a mathematical curiosity all his life.
He didn't believe that they really existed.
He was convinced that nature would protect us from its creation.
It was to take decades for the notion to be coined and for people to understand that black holes are astrophysical bodies. In fact, they are the lifeless state of extremely dense stars that collapse in a horrific catastrophe at the end of their lives.
Our Sun, however, will not end as a black hole.
It's just not big enough for that.
But we did a small thought experiment, as Einstein liked to do. Let's imagine that we compress the Sun to six kilometers in diameter and put a tiny Earth into orbit, say, 30 kilometers away from this black Sun.
This earth would shine by itself (because then the sun would have disappeared, there would be no other source of light) so we let our little earth shine by itself.
We could put the Earth into a carefree orbit about 30 km away from the crushed black hole.
This crushed black hole would be about the size of Manhattan.
It would pour a little into the Hudson before it destroyed the earth.
But we're talking about that.
We're talking about something that can be squeezed together until it's half the size of Manhattan.
Now we bring the Earth very close, down to about 30 km, and see how it moves in a completely flawless orbit around the black hole.
There is a kind of myth that black holes engulf everything in the universe, but in fact you have to get very close to them to fall into them.
But what is particularly impressive from our point of view is the fact that we can always see the Earth.
She cannot hide behind the black hole.
The light that comes from the earth, some of it falls in, but some is scattered and returns to us.
So you can't hide anything behind a black hole.
If this is the Battlestar Galactica and you are fighting against the Cylons, don't hide behind the Black Hole.
They can see them.
So our Sun will not collapse into a black hole, its mass is not enough, but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
If one of them wiped out the Milky Way, it would look like that.
We would see a shadow of the black hole against the backdrop of billions of stars in the Milky Way galaxy and its glowing dust orbits.
If we were to fall on this black hole, we would see all the light that would be bent around it, and we could even enter the shadows without realizing that something unusual is happening.
It would be bad if we tried to ignite our engines and escape, because we couldn't, just as the light can't escape.
But even if the black hole is dark from the outside, it is not dark inside, because all the light of the galaxy could enter behind us.
And although due to a phenomenon of relativity (the so-called time dilation) our clocks seemed to go slower in relation to galactic time, it would look as if the evolution of the galaxy had accelerated and shot at us just before we were crushed to death by the black hole.
It would be like a near-death experience to see the light at the end of the tunnel. However, it would be a comprehensive death experience.
(Laughter) And you couldn't tell anyone about the light at the end of the tunnel.
Now we have never seen such a shadow of a black hole, but black holes can be heard, even though they are invisible.
Imagine an astrophysically realistic situation. Imagine two black holes that have spent a long life together.
Perhaps it was once stars that collapsed into two black holes, each with a mass ten times that of the Sun.
We are now squeezing them together to a diameter of 60 km.
They can rotate several hundred times per second.
At the end of their lives, they orbit each other almost at the speed of light.
They can travel thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second, and while they do, they not only bend space, but leave a sound of space in their wake, a real wave of space-time.
Space contracts and expands as it pours out of these black holes and hammering into the universe.
And they travel out into the cosmos at the speed of light.
We owe this computer simulation to a relativity working group of NASA Goddard.
It took almost 30 years for someone to solve this problem.
This was one of those groups.
Here we see two black holes orbiting each other, again with the helpful painted lines.
Maybe you can see - it's a bit indistinct - but when you see the red waves coming out, they're gravitational waves.
They actually represent the sound of sounding space and will exit these black holes at the speed of light as they become quieter and quieter and eventually merge into a spinning, silent black hole.
If you were close enough, the sound of contracting and expanding space would roar in your ears.
You would literally hear the sound.
Of course, your head would also be pressed and stretched, which would be quite unpleasant, which is why you would have difficulty understanding what is happening.
But I would like to show you what sounds we would predict here.
This is from my working group - a slightly less glamorous computer model.
Imagine a lighter black hole falling into a very heavy black hole.
What you hear is the sound of the light black hole hammering into space every time it passes close by.
When it leaves, it's a little too quiet.
But it hits like a mallet and literally shatters the universe, making it vibrate like a drum.
We can predict what that will sound like.
We know that when it falls, it becomes faster and louder.
And finally we hear the little guy falling into the big guy.
I've never heard it so loudly - it's really much more dramatic.
At home it sounds rather disappointing.
More like ding, ding, ding.
This is another noise from my group.
No, I don't show you any pictures, because black holes don't leave any helpful ink marks. Space has no colorful, painted lines.
But if you were floating around in space during a space vacation and you would hear this here, then you should make sure you get away.
(Laughter) You really should get away from that noise.
Both black holes are moving.
Both black holes come closer to each other.
In this case, they vibrate very strongly at first.
And then they merge.
This chirping is typical of the merging of two black holes, so that it chirps at the end.
This is our conception of what we would see.
Luckily we are here in Long Beach, California at a safe distance.
But it is very likely that just somewhere in the universe two black holes have merged.
And it is just as certain that space swings around us after presumably taking millions of light years, or a million years to travel to us at the speed of light.
But the sound is far too quiet for us ever to hear.
Experiments are being carried out on Earth with great zeal, one of which is called LIGO - to detect deviations in the way space contracts and expands again, deviations in the order of magnitude smaller than an atomic nucleus over a distance of four kilometres.
It is an incredibly ambitious project and its sensitivity will be further developed in the coming years - in order to be able to perceive this here.
There will also be a space mission, which I hope will be launched within the next ten years. It is called LISA.
Lisa will be able to see huge black holes, black holes with millions or billions of times the density of the Sun.
This image of the Hubble telescope shows two galaxies.
They look like they're frozen in a hug.
Each probably contains a huge black hole inside.
But they are not frozen. They merge together.
These two black holes collide and become one over billions of years.
Our human perception is unable to grasp a song of such duration.
But LISA could see the final stage of two giant black holes, earlier in the history of the universe, the last 15 minutes before they merge.
And it's not just about black holes, it's about all the big disturbances in the universe - and the biggest of them all is the Big Bang.
When the term was coined, it was meant contemptuously. Who believes in a big bang, a big bang
This animation of friends of mine at Proton Studios shows an exterior view of the Big Bang.
We never really want to try; we never want to be inside the universe because you can never be outside the universe.
So imagine you're in the Big Bang.
It is everywhere, all around you and space is wafting and swinging completely uncontrollably.
14 billion years pass, but this song still rings out around us.
Galaxies form and generations of stars are born in these galaxies, and around one of these stars, at least one, orbits a habitable planet.
And here we sit and work like crazy on these experiments, doing calculations and writing computer code.
Imagine that a billion years ago two black holes collided.
Their song has been sounding through space ever since.
We didn't even exist at that time.
It is getting closer and closer - 40,000 years ago we still painted cave paintings.
If it's the big bang we're recording, it would sound like that.
It is literally the epitome of noise.
It's white noise, it's such a chaotic noise.
But it's all around us, probably if it hasn't been wiped out by another process in the universe.
When we record it, it will sound like music to our ears, because it will be a quiet echo, an echo of the moment of our creation, of our visible universe.
Within the next two years we will be able to make the soundtrack a little louder and present the universe as a sound image.
But if we can grasp those earliest moments, it will bring us much closer to an understanding of the Big Bang, which in turn will bring us closer to some of the most complex, elusive questions.
If we played a movie of the universe backwards, we would know that there was a Big Bang in the past and we could even perceive the cacophony of its sound. But was our Big Bang the only Big Bang
I think we have to ask the question: Has something like this happened before
Will it be repeated
I believe that, in the spirit of the challenge posed by TED - to rekindle amazement - we can ask questions, at least at this last minute, which might otherwise elude us forever.
But we must ask ourselves: Is it possible that our universe is only an offshoot of a larger story
Or is it possible that we are just an offshoot of a multiverse - each offshoot with its own Big Bang in its past - maybe some of them have drum-playing black holes, others maybe not - in some there may be intelligent life, in others not - not in our past, not in our future, but in some way fundamentally connected with us
So we have to ask ourselves: If there is a multiverse, do living beings exist in another fragment of that multiverse
These are my creatures of the multiverse.
Are there other beings in this multiverse who think about us and their own origins
And if they exist, I can imagine that they are like us, that they calculate and write computer codes, build instruments, try to make out the remotest noise of their origin and wonder who is still out there.
Thank you. Thank you.

After a corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in Mamming, Lower Bavaria, almost 500 people are quarantined and are no longer allowed to leave the company.

A total of 174 harvesters were tested positive for the corona pathogen Sars-CoV-2 during the series examination, as reported by the Dingolfing-Landau district office on Saturday evening.

Many people believe that driving is an activity reserved only for people who can see.
A blind person driving a car safely and independently has so far been considered an impossible task.
Hello, my name is Dennis Hong, and we want to give blind people freedom and independence by building a vehicle for blind people.
Therefore, before I talk about this car for the blind, let me briefly talk about another project I worked on called the Darba Urban Challenge.
This involved building a robotic car that could drive itself.
You press Start, nobody touches anything, and it can reach its destination completely automatically.
In 2007, our team won half a million dollars by finishing third in the competition.
Around this time, the National Association of the Blind, or NFB, challenged the Investigation Committee to make a car that can be driven safely and independently by a blind person.
We decided to try, because we thought, hey, how difficult that can be.
We already have an automatic vehicle.
We're putting a blind person in and it's done, isn't it
(Laughter) We couldn't have been wrong.
What the National Association of the Blind (NFB) wanted was not a vehicle that drives blind people around, but a vehicle where a blind person can make active decisions and drive.
Therefore, we had to throw everything away and start again.
Therefore, to test this insane idea, we developed a small buggy prototype vehicle to test its feasibility.
And in the summer of 2009, we invited dozens of young blind people from all over the country and gave them the opportunity to take a spin.
It was an absolutely great experience.
But the problem with this car was that it was designed so that it could only be driven in a controlled environment, a level, traffic-free parking lot, and that even the lanes were highlighted with red guide cones.
Therefore, with this success, we decided to take the next big step, to develop a true car that can be driven on real roads.
So how does it work
Well, it's a pretty complicated system, but let me try to explain it, and maybe I can simplify it.
Well, we have three steps.
We have perception, calculation and non-visual interfaces.
Well, it is clear that the driver cannot see, so the system must be able to perceive the environment and gather information for the driver.
For this, we use an initial measuring unit.
It measures the acceleration, the angular acceleration, like a human ear, an inner ear.
We merge the information with a GPS unit to get approximately the position of the car.
We also use two cameras to detect the lanes of the road.
And we also use three laser distance measurements.
The lasers scan the surroundings to detect obstacles, a car approaching us from the front or from behind, and also any obstacles that come onto the road, any obstacles around the vehicle.
After that, all this enormous amount of information is passed on to the computer, and the computer can do two things.
First of all, process the information to understand what the environment is like; these are lanes on the road, the obstacles, and this information is conveyed to the driver.
The system is also smart enough to calculate the safest way to operate the car.
We can also generate instructions on how to control the vehicle.
But, the problem is this: How can we convey this information and these instructions to a person who cannot see quickly enough and fairly accurately so that they can drive
For this purpose, we have developed various types of non-visual user interface technology.
We started with a three-dimensional ping sound system, a vibration vest, a click wheel with voice commands, a foot strip, and even a shoe that puts pressure on the leg.
But today, we will talk about three of these non-visual user interface technologies.
Well, the first interface technology is called DriveGrip.
This is a pair of gloves, and it has its vibrating elements on the ankle side, so they can give instructions on how to control, the direction and the intensity.
Another device is called SpeedStrip.
These are a chair, strictly speaking, it is a massage chair.
We hollow it out, and we reorganize the vibrating elements into different patterns. And we use them to convey information about the speed, and also to convey instructions about how to use the accelerator and brake pedal.
So, here you can see how the computer sees the environment. And since you can't see the vibration, we even equip the driver with red LEDs so he can really see what's going on.
These are the sensory data, and these data are transmitted via computer to the devices.
Therefore, these two devices, DriveGrip and Speedgrip, are very effective.
But the problem is that there are engraving instructions devices.
Therefore, this is not a real freedom, is it
The computer tells you how to drive, turn left, turn right, accelerate, stop.
We call it rear-seat driver problem.
Therefore, we move away from the engraving instructions devices, and now focus more on the information devices.
A good example of this non-visual information interface technology is AirPix.
Consider it as a monitor for the blind.
Well, it's a small tray, it has many holes and it releases compressed air, so it can even draw pictures.
Therefore, even if they are blind, they can put their hand on it, see the lanes and obstacles on the road.
In fact, they can also change the air frequency that escapes, and possibly the temperature.
Therefore, it is in fact a multidimensional user interface.
Well, here you can look at the left camera, the right camera seen from the vehicle, and see how the computer interprets this and sends the information to AirPix.
For this, we show a simulator, a blind person who drives and uses the AirPix.
This simulator was also very useful to train the blind drivers and also fast in testing different kinds of ideas for different types of non-visual user interfaces.
So, that's how it mainly works.
But this vehicle is a prototype, and it will not enter the road until it is proven to be safe, or safer than today's vehicles.
And I really believe that this can happen.
But nevertheless, will society, would they accept such a radical idea
How will we regulate the insurance
How will we issue driving licences
Apart from the technological challenges, there are many kinds of hurdles that we have to overcome before it becomes a reality.
Of course, the main objective of this project is to produce a car for a blind person.
But potentially more important than this is the huge benefit of spin-off technology that can be derived from this project.
The sensors that are needed can see in the darkness in fog and rain.
And along with these new types of interfaces, we can use this technology and apply it in safer cars for normal sighted people.
Or for blind people, in everyday appliances in the home, in training and in the office.
Imagine a teacher writing in a classroom on the blackboard, and a blind student can see and read what he has written using these non-visual interface technologies.
This is priceless.
Therefore, the things I have shown you today are just the beginning.
Thank you very much.

Discussing the abolition of the 50 + 1 rule
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended that consideration be given to abolishing the 50 + 1 rule.
"German football should at least discuss laying down conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates a fait accompli," Grindel told Bild am Sonntag.
He stressed: "For the clubs that are most likely to be dangerous in Bavaria and Dortmund, the 50 + 1 rules do not work anyway: See Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, there is no getting around the debate as to whether it is not advisable to facilitate the involvement of investors in clubs that want to break into this phalanx ".
However, he has doubts whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority participation, which is prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50 + 1 rule.
"It remains a legal risk to build investment fences around the Bundesliga as a business location in a European internal market," said Grindel.
The former head of the DFB sees the danger that "the attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will ultimately only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but will not lead to more tension in the championship."

Looking back at the past, Grindel feels betrayed.

"That has already occupied me very much in human terms."
He had received the gift worth around 11,000 euros from a Ukrainian official.
"I committed a breach of compliance and it was right to draw the consequences," Grindel said.
"I handled the ominous watch gift completely transparently and innocently.
Many people in the DFB knew about it. "
He never "made a secret of the gift," the 58-year-old assured.
"This may be called naive, but this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."

Argentina rejects counteroffer from creditors
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economy in Buenos Aires announced on Saturday.
"That would not only be irresponsible, but also unfair," a statement said.
"While 50 percent of children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors".
The debt of the second largest economy in South America is no longer sustainable under current conditions.
Argentina is therefore asking its private creditors to forego some of their claims of around 66 billion US dollars (around 59 billion euros).
If no agreement is reached, the country is once again threatened with bankruptcy.
It would be the ninth default in Argentine history.
Most recently, lenders had called for higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to some contractual clauses.
However, the Argentine government is sticking to its last offer and is not prepared to make any further concessions.
Argentina is in a severe financial and economic crisis.
The inflation rate was recently more than 50 percent.
Experts expect economic power to decline by around ten percent in the current year.
By the end of May, Argentina had failed to settle interest claims amounting to $503 million and had slipped into a limited default.

Arrived at work - not yet privately
"Things are going super well" - this is the conclusion drawn by Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first days at the notary's office in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very quickly: In mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she would succeed Lutz Feller at the Eggenfelden notary's office.
Just six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the doctor of law started work, and normal day-to-day business has long been running at full speed.
"Privately, however, I still have to arrive," she explains in an interview with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
Of course, the short lead time was not enough to completely relocate the center of life from Regensburg to Eggenfelden, reports the native of Dingolfing.
She and her husband, who works as a judge at the regional court in Regensburg, are currently looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city.
At least her husband was still able to apply for parental leave at short notice in order to be able to guarantee the care of the two daughters (3 gifted and 1 gifted).
In order not to have to commute every day from Regensburg, she also has an overnight stay with her parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-old.
Growing up in the neighboring district, the city of Eggenfelden has of course long been known to her.
During visits on site with her family in recent months, she once again stated: "Eggenfelden is a really nice small town".
She was all the more pleased that she had won the competition for the vacancy.
Her native Lower Bavaria also plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career: After studying law in Passau, she completed her legal clerkship and the second state examination in Regensburg.
After several positions as a notary assessor, including in Rehau and Hof in Upper Franconia, Babenhausen im Unterallg ä u and Regensburg - during which time she also "incidentally" shouldered her doctorate in labour law - she took up her first position as a notary in Rotthalm ü nster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016, she took parental leave and finally moved to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken over representation services in various notarial offices.
When the position in Eggenfelden was advertised due to the approaching retirement of Lutz Feller, she saw the right time for a full return to work, explains the 39-year-old.
Dr. Stefanie Kramer has taken over the entire team of her predecessor, who will take over the holiday representation in the notary's office in the future - and immediately has praise for the team of the law firm: "Things are going super well!"
The fact that she can rely on well-rehearsed processes makes it easier for her to take care of the impending relocation of the private center of life.
She has already contacted a local institution regarding kindergarten and nursery places.
And if everything works out as desired, she hopes to be able to pursue her hobby here soon - and get to know the most beautiful jogging routes in the Rottal.

BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be 20 percent full at the start of the season in the event of a fan return.
"Due to the distance regulation, which must be complied with, we are currently planning with 12,000 to 15,000 spectators," Borussia Dortmund's managing director Carsten Cramer told the "Tagesspiegel".
Normally, the arena in the district city holds a little more than 81,000 spectators at Bundesliga games.
In the ghost games caused by the Corona pandemic last season, BVB lost around four million euros per game.
Cramer, who is responsible for marketing, digitisation and internationalisation at BVB, hopes that in addition to the normal spectator seats, some of the approximately 4,000 seats in the hospitality sector can also be opened again: "It is of course a blow to the office if these revenues completely disappear".
In view of the ongoing corona crisis, everyone is currently "well advised to take a stable page length for the time being".
"If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people are in short-time work in Germany alone, then the need for entertainment is limited," Cramer explained.
The head of marketing in Dortmund praised the BVB professionals for their partial salary waiver, which is intended to help overcome the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their salary waiver has a different effect than if we put 100 people who work in merchandising on short-time work."

Kalbitz expulsion from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "fig leaf"
The expulsion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is in the view of the FDP only a "fig leaf" and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the extreme right in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD, "said FDP interior politician Benjamin Strasser to the news agency dpa in Berlin.
The Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD had confirmed on Saturday in Stuttgart after several hours of hearing the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Executive Board had decided by a majority in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD parliamentary group in the Brandenburg state parliament.
"If the AfD really wanted to consistently remove right-wing extremists from their party, officials like Bj ö rn H ö cke and his supporters would have been expelled long ago," Strasser said.
"However, there is no political will in the AfD because right-wing extremism is now part of the party."
Similarly, CSU General Secretary Markus Blume said: "The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded says nothing and does not change anything," he told the "Welt am Sonntag".
"It speaks volumes how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist in the middle of the AfD still has."
Blume assumes that the AfD will land below five percent in future elections.
"The days of the AfD in the parliaments are numbered".
Kalbitz was one of the spokesmen of the now officially dissolved "wing" around the Thuringian AfD state and parliamentary group chairman Bj ö rn H ö cke; the Verfassungsschutz classifies the coronation as a "secured right-wing extremist aspiration".
In May, the AfD federal executive had thrown Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason, he stated that Kalbitz had not stated an earlier membership in the now banned right-wing extremist "Heimattreue Deutsche Jugend" (HDJ) and the Republicans when he joined the party.
Kalbitz denies membership in the HDJ.
The chairman of the Left faction in the Brandenburg state parliament, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court did not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf has only eaten chalk.
The AfD remains a far-right party, with or without Kalbitz. "
Neither the federal party nor the right wing would be weakened by this decision.
"The maneuver of the mutineers is transparent.
They want to avoid further observation by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution and try to get through under the radar, "said Walter.
"The AfD can't get rid of the ghosts they called.
Expulsion does not change anything, "said Brandenburg SPD General Secretary Erik Stohn, commenting on the decision in the Kalbitz case.
"Here the AfD regional association and the fraction held to their right-wing leader until today".
The legal dispute over Kalbitz's membership in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he would now take civil action against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court.

North Sea wind farms deliver a good 21 percent more electricity
The wind power plants on the German North Sea fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid in the first six months of the year.
This is a good 21 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, said the network operator Tennet in Bayreuth.
TenneT is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea electricity to the mainland and the transmission through the German power grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of Tennet's grid area, have fed in a further 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, wind power from the North Sea and the Baltic Sea will reach 13.73 TWh, compared to a good 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of total wind power in Germany, which is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms ensure higher generation capacities
In addition to wind conditions, the increased contribution of offshore wind energy results from higher generation capacities, because new wind farms have been connected to the grid in the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea were all running at full power at the same time, they could generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatts.
It is expected to increase to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea by 2030.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore grid connections by then," said Tim Meyerj ü rgens, Managing Director of Tennet.
In reality, even at sea, wind farms are not able to exploit their capacity, but reach about 40 percent.
The record day so far this year is 2 January, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce around 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could supply almost seven million households with electricity.

Freital: Windbergfest cancelled because of Corona

The city of Freital has cancelled the three-day festival planned for September.

More air traffic controllers in Worms in future
The University of Applied Sciences in Worms continues to take to the skies: DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung is donating a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and will start in 2021.
The professorship gives students the opportunity to start their studies not only in the summer semester, but also in the winter semester.
This means that twice as many students can be trained as before.
At the same time, capacities at both the university and the DFS Air Traffic Control Academy are utilised equally.
DFS will advise the university on setting up and filling the professorship.
Represented at the university since 2019
Since the summer semester of 2019, the first students have been enrolled in the Air Traffic Management program as part of their training as air traffic controllers at Worms University of Applied Sciences.
Nine students have already started this year.
So far, DFS 'experience has been very positive, and the students' performance has been outstanding.
The combination of studies and pilot training contributes significantly to further increasing the attractiveness of the pilot profession.
"In these times, funding is not easy for us economically.
However, we firmly expect air traffic to recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to continue to fulfil our legal mandate, we need highly qualified personnel, "says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman and CEO of DFS, at the signing of the contract.
"For DFS, the endowed professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, interdisciplinary knowledge base in the long term.
We are therefore continuing our good cooperation with the university and at the same time underpinning our attractiveness as an employer. "
Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of the University of Applied Sciences Worms, also underlines this: "The endowed professorship forms an important bridge between science and business.
With it, we would like to build on the existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual bachelor's degree programme in Air Traffic Management. "

Heil wants to examine other industries after meat industry
The Corona crisis brought the situation in parts of the meat industry back to light.
Legislative tightening is imminent.
But are they rightful - and will they remain so
Federal Minister of Labour Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to review other sectors in accordance with the strict regulations now planned against maladministration in the meat industry.
"We will look at industry by industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary," said Heil of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employers are already warning against restricting work contracts in general.

Large slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to employ external personnel for slaughter, cutting and meat processing.
For this purpose, the use of contract workers and temporary workers is to be prohibited there.
Employer President Ingo Kramer told the dpa: "Stay away from a general restriction of work contracts and hiring workers, if you do not want to completely strangle the economy".
Work contracts, for example, are mandatory for large areas of the trade, the construction industry and plant construction as the basis for their added value at the customer.
"The misdeeds of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument".
Heil assured: "My goal is not to ban work contracts everywhere in the German economy".
Work contracts are useful.

Heil said that a relatively harsh law had already come into force for the meat industry in 2017.
However, these were circumvented by "tricky constructions".
"Now we have to clean up fundamentally".
The politician announced: "In the Occupational Safety and Health Act, which we want to pass in the cabinet at the end of July, there are also measures that do not only affect the meat industry - for example, higher inspection rates for occupational safety or clear criteria for community accommodation".
The draft submitted to the DPA includes amendments to the Act on the Protection of Workers' Rights in the Meat Industry and the Occupational Safety and Health Act.
Brandenburg's Consumer Protection Minister Ursula Nonnemacher (Greens) believes that more intensive controls are necessary.

Juventus Turin champion in Italy
Turin - After a redeeming goal by Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in a row.
The team around the five-time world footballer made the 36th Scudetto in the club's history perfect with a 2-0 (1-0) on Sunday evening in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo scored 1-0 before half time.
With 83 points, Turin, which competed without the last long-injured former international Sami Khedira, can no longer be ousted from first place two days before the end of the season of Serie A.
The runner-up Inter Milan is seven points behind.
Juventus was harmless despite optical superiority in the first half, then Ronaldo hit after a free-kick variant with the last action.
The 35-year-old exploited a match of Miralem Pjanic directly from the penalty box with a flat shot (45. + 7).
Against the now more offensive guests Ronaldo was also involved in the 2-0, after his shot Federico Bernardeschi (67.) dusted off.

Because of the defeat, the Turinese had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
In the end, Juve's reassuring lead at the top of the standings was mainly due to the weakness of the competitors.
In the eleven games before the game on Sunday, the Sarri-team had only managed five victories.
Whether Ronaldo will also become the top scorer is questionable.
While the Portuguese superstar has scored 31 goals so far, the former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile has already scored 34 goals after his three-pack in the 5-1 (1-1) of the fourth-placed Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the title win of FC Bayern.

Baden-W ü rttemberg: Over 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - Despite all the threats of punishment and court judgments, motorists continue to accelerate in countless illegal races on the roads of Baden-W ü rttemberg: Last year and the first four months of this year, the police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
There are no comparative figures for the years before, but the rapists are increasingly making work of the judicial authorities: In 2018, a total of 155 investigations were conducted at the public prosecutors' offices between Constance and Mannheim for illegal races, one year later there were already 252 and in the current year until the beginning of June already 151.
The races were less about organized events, as can be seen from the response of the Interior Ministry to a request of the state parliament SPD.
In most cases, the drivers spontaneously competed against each other or fled from the police - this is also reported as an illegal race.
At the wheel were mainly German men between the ages of 18 and 60.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases are the racers caught and also asked to pay: According to the Interior Ministry, a total of 113 fines have been imposed since 2018 and 15 prison sentences have been pronounced.
However, there is no evidence that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
Rather, other motorists reacted more sensitively than before because of the many tragic accidents and trials in recent years and reported more frequently, a ministry spokesman said.
The Autobahn 8 is particularly popular with racers. Again and again, motorists slow down the traffic there in order to make room for themselves and to use the free track for a race.
Last August, a dozen drivers were caught near Kirchheim unter Teck, three months earlier there were even 18 drivers on the A8 near Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular "racetrack"
On the A81, the police register even more races than on any other federal highway.
A speed limit is used there to try to slow down the racers on the particularly affected section between Engen and Geisingen.
The mostly high-priced and pimped up sports and luxury cars often have Swiss license plates, because the drivers evade because of the high penalties for driving too fast and car racing in the neighboring country to the lawn to Germany.
For the SPD, the speed limit must not be reduced to a few routes: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometers per hour, we would get rid of this problem on motorways," says Martin Rivoir, the transport expert of the SPD parliamentary group.
"The inhibition threshold for speedsters would be significantly higher if you were not allowed to travel legally here and there at 200 kilometers per hour or more."
Rivoir thinks less of education or image campaigns: "Anyone who defies all rules in this way and puts not only their own lives but also the lives of other road users at risk is hardly reachable with reason."
ADAC calls for stronger police crackdown
However, this is not enough for the ADAC: "We assume that speeders will not be deterred by the speed limits," says Holger Bach, Head of the Transport and Environment Department at the ADAC W ü rttemberg.
It calls for additional and tougher controls on the routes concerned.
Not infrequently, the high-speed test of strength becomes painful and serious: Since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people have died in the races nationwide, two of them uninvolved in a nightly crash in Stuttgart's city center and one in Gerlingen.
Two young men are said to have competed in a car race there in November.
One of the vehicles came off the road, crashed into a garden wall and remained on the side, the 18-year-old passenger died.
21 other people were injured in the races over the past two years.
In the opinion of Interior Minister Thomas Strobl, however, harsher penalties are not necessary: "There is no need for legislative action to impose tougher sanctions on illegal motor vehicle races," says the Interior Ministry's paper.

Nuremberg: Unauthorized tuning meeting - police intervene, 700 vehicles and about 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and at times more than 1000 people took part in a "tuning meeting" on Saturday night in the parking lot of a furniture store.
The police implemented their announcement to intensify their control of such events.
A major tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (25 July 2020) in Nuremberg's S ü dstadt district.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the police of Middle Franconia, an increased number of vehicles in the area of a large car park in Ingolst ä dter Stra ß e was detected by the Nuremberg traffic police around 10.30 pm.
The police then carried out a large number of vehicle inspections there.
Only recently, the police had announced that they wanted to step up their action against so-called autoposers.
Illegal tuning meeting in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the "scene"
The officers numbered a good 700 vehicles and about 1100 people at the top, according to the police.
However, only a small part of those present can be attributed to the "autoposer" and tuning scene.
Apparently, the majority of the relevant scene complied with the police's appeal.
On the basis of the vehicles and people on site, it can be assumed that these were mainly onlookers.
In addition, the majority of those present adhered to the applicable infection protection regulations, in particular the observance of the minimum distance and the wearing of a mouth-nose protection.
The control measures carried out on site were completed at around 1: 00 a.m.
In total, the officials noticed such structural changes in 10 vehicles that the operating license had expired.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No car racing
There were no illegal car races.

Employment Agency figures: 900 suspected cases of abuse in short-time work
Berlin - The Federal Employment Agency (BA) claims to be investigating around 900 suspected cases of abuse of short-time pay.
"With more than 880,000 companies reporting short-time work, this is extremely low," said Daniel Terzenbach, the Executive Board member responsible for operations, to the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung".
When, at the beginning of the Corona crisis, a large number of companies suddenly applied for short-time work, the BA had to react quickly.
The examination usually takes up to three weeks.

Evidence of abuse would often come from the employees or trade unions concerned.
In addition, the BA uses analysis software to detect abuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible wave of insolvency in the autumn.
"Will there be significantly more insolvencies than in the previous year
The assessments differ, but we are preparing ourselves in the event of a case and are already training our employees in the employment agencies to process applications for insolvency money. "
The figures are still inconspicuous, said Terzenbach.

Austria: Mass tests after Corona outbreak in tourist resort
Authorities have responded to a corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist resort of St. Wolfgang with hundreds of tests.
The number of confirmed cases rose to 48, as reported by the state authorities in Linz.
More than 100 results were still outstanding in the evening.
According to this, many of the infected are young interns in tourism companies, but at least one holiday guest was tested positive.
Residents, guests and tourism staff were asked to stay in their accommodation on Saturday evening.
The curfew was set at 23: 00.
"There are cancellations and cancellations here and there" of bookings, said the head of the tourism association Wolfgangsee, Hans Wieser, the dpa.
Some guests also left prematurely.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist resort in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, about a third of the guests are Germans.
On Friday, the first infections had become public knowledge.
The head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended the behaviour of the interns on Saturday, who had celebrated in several restaurants and may have contracted the disease there.
"We all enjoyed doing that in our youth," he told the radio station Ö 1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The tourism association launched an information campaign to raise awareness among young employees of the dangers of Covid-19.
Starting on Saturday, hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from 15 July were contacted.
The outbreak evokes memories of the Austrian ski and party resort of Ischgl in Tyrol, which in the early phase of the pandemic was a center of corona spread throughout Europe.
In total, more than 1,500 people in Austria are currently infected with the virus.

They all know that what I'm about to say is true.
The intuition that inequality weakens social cohesion existed even before the French Revolution.
What is new is that we now have evidence; we can compare societies, more equal and more unequal, and see what causes inequality.
I would like to show you statistics and explain why they are interrelated.
Look what a miserable bunch we are.
(Laughter) I would like to start with a paradox.
This shows life expectancy and gross national income - on average in rich countries.
You can see that the countries on the right, Norway and the USA, for example, are twice as rich as Israel, Greece and Portugal on the left.
And that doesn't change their life expectancy.
There is nothing to suggest a connection.
But within societies, there are huge social disparities in health across society.
Here, once again, life expectancy.
Here are small areas in England and Wales - the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.
A big difference between the poor and the rest of us.
Even people just below the top are worse off than those at the top.
So income is very important within individual societies, and not between them at all.
The explanation for this paradox is that within societies we are dealing with a relative income, the social position, the status - where we stand in relation to each other, and how great the gaps between us are.
And when you understand this, you immediately ask yourself: What happens when the differences get bigger, or smaller, when income differences rise or fall
And that's what I'm showing you now.
Not with hypothetical data.
With data from the UN - the same as the World Bank uses - on the extent of income disparities in rich developed market democracies.
The measure we use, because it is easy to understand and available for download, is how much richer the top 20 percent are than the bottom 20 percent of each country.
You can see that in the same countries on the left - Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden - the top 20 percent are around 3 percent, 4 times as rich as the bottom 20 percent.
But on the other hand - the United Kingdom, Portugal, the United States, Singapore - the differences are twice as great.
On this scale, we are twice as unequal as some of the other successful market democracies.
Now I'll show you what this does to our societies.
We have collected data on problems with social disparities, the problems that are more common at the bottom of the social ladder.
Internationally comparable data on life expectancy, children's math, reading and writing skills, infant mortality and murder rates, which proportion of the population is imprisoned, teenage pregnancies, confidence, obesity, mental illnesses - which include drug and alcohol addiction in standard diagnostics - and social mobility.
We have summarized them in an index.
All with the same weight.
For each country there is a kind of average value of these factors.
And here they see it in relation to the degree of inequality that I have shown you, to which I will return again and again.
The more unequal countries are doing worse in all these social problems.
This is an unusually high correlation.
But if you put the same index of health and social problems in relation to GNI per capita, to gross national income, there is nothing, no correlation.
We were worried that people would think that we had only chosen the problems that supported our reasoning and constructed this evidence, so we also published an article in the British Medical Journal on the UNICEF Child Welfare Index.
In it, 40 different components were put together by other people.
The index includes whether children can talk to their parents, whether they have books at home, their immunization rates, whether there is bullying at school.
Everything flows in.
Here is the index relative to our inequality values.
Children perform worse in unequal societies.
A highly significant ratio.
Again, when the child welfare index is compared to national per capita income, there is no correlation, not even a hint.
All the data I've shown you so far says the same thing.
The average well-being of our societies no longer depends on national income and economic growth.
These are crucial in poorer countries, but not in the rich developed world.
But the differences between us where we stand in comparison to each other has become very important.
I will now show you individual parts of our index.
Here, for example, is trust.
Simply the proportion of the population that believes you can trust most people.
The data comes from the World Values Survey.
On the more unequal side, about 15 percent of the population believe that others can be trusted.
But in more equal societies, the figure is up to 60 or 65 percent.
And the degree of involvement in community life or social capital is similarly closely related to inequality.
We've done all this work twice.
First with the rich, developed countries, and then in a second test field again with the 50 American states - with the same question: Do the more unequal states perform worse on all these scales
According to data collected by the US government, trust is associated with inequality.
A very similar distribution over a similar range of degrees of confidence.
The same thing is happening here.
Our basic result is that almost all factors that are internationally related to trust do the same in the 50 US states, in a separate test environment.
And this is not just a happy coincidence.
Here are mental illnesses.
Who compiled these figures by conducting the same diagnostic interviews with randomly selected subjects to compare rates of mental illness in societies.
This is the percentage of the population who were mentally ill last year.
It ranges from 8 percent to three times that - entire societies that have three times the rates of mental illness than others.
And again a high correlation to inequality.
And here violence.
These red dots are American states, the blue triangles are Canadian provinces.
Note the scale of differences.
It ranges from 15 murders per million to 150.
That is the proportion of the population that is in detention.
There is about ten times the difference on the lateral log scale.
It goes from about 40 to 400 imprisoned people.
This ratio is not primarily due to higher crime rates.
In some places, this is a partial factor.
But the main reason is tougher court rulings.
And more unequal societies are more likely to cling to the death penalty.
Here are children dropping out of school.
Again quite big differences.
With devastating effects in terms of the use of the population's talents.
Here is social mobility.
Actually a measurement of mobility based on income.
The question is: Do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons, or is there no connection between them
On the more unequal side, fathers' incomes are much more important -- in the UK, in the US.
And in the Scandinavian countries, fathers' incomes are much less critical.
There is more social mobility.
We like to say - and I know there are many Americans here in the audience - that if Americans want to live the American dream, they should go to Denmark.
(Laughter) (Applause) I've just presented a few things to you.
I could have shown you a lot of other problems.
All these problems are more common at the lower end of the social gradient.
But there are countless problems with social disparities that are worse in more unequal countries - not just a bit, but somewhere between 2 times and 10 times as common.
Imagine these costs, the human costs.
But I would like to return to the graph, in which we have summarized everything to show two things.
On the one hand, graph by graph, the countries that perform poorly, regardless of the outcome, appear to be the more unequal, and those that perform better seem to be the Nordic countries and Japan.
So what we see is a general social dysfunction that goes hand in hand with inequality.
This applies not only to one or two things, but to most things.
The other very important aspect of this graph is seen here below, Sweden and Japan - in many ways very different countries.
The position of women, however much they cling to the nuclear family, here they lie at opposite poles of the rich, developed world.
Another very important difference is how they achieve their greater equality.
In Sweden, there are enormous differences in earnings, which are compensated by taxation, the general welfare state, generous social benefits, etc.
In Japan it is completely different.
There are smaller differences in earnings even before tax.
There are lower taxes.
A smaller welfare state.
And in our analysis of the American states we find the same contradiction.
Some countries are successful through redistribution, others are doing well because they have small income differences before tax.
Our conclusion is that it doesn't matter how you achieve greater equality as long as you somehow achieve it.
I do not mean perfect equality, I am talking about something that already exists in rich market democracies.
Another surprising part of the picture is that inequality does not only affect the poor.
Apparently there is some truth in John Donnes' "Nobody is an island."
In several studies, one can compare how people in more or less the same countries perform at every level of the social hierarchy.
This is just one example.
Infant mortality.
Some Swedes have kindly classified a large part of their infant deaths according to the British register of socio-economic classification.
This is an anachronistic classification according to the professions of the fathers, so single parents are kept separately.
But where "low social class" is noted, this means unskilled manual activities.
Then there are the skilled trades in the middle, then the subordinate non-skilled trades, up to the higher trades - doctors, lawyers, executives of larger companies.
You can see that Sweden is better than Britain, across the entire social hierarchy.
The biggest differences are down in society.
But even at the top, living in a more equal society seems to bring a small advantage.
We show this in five different datasets dealing with educational success and health in the US and internationally.
That seems to be the case in general - greater equality matters most at the bottom, but has some advantages even at the top.
But I should say something about what is happening.
I am interested in the psychosocial effects of inequality.
This has to do with feelings of superiority and inferiority, the feeling of being valued or devalued, respected or despised.
And, of course, the sense of status competition that results from this drives consumer thinking in our society.
It also leads to status uncertainty.
We are more concerned about how we are judged by others, whether we are considered attractive, smart, etc.
The socially judgmental judgments are increasing, and the fear of these judgments.
Interestingly, there is similar research in social psychology: Some people have evaluated 208 different studies in which volunteers were invited to psychological laboratories to measure their stress hormones and their response to stressful tasks.
What interested them in the evaluation was which types of stress most reliably raised the cortisol level, that of the central stress hormone.
And the result was: Tasks that posed a threat to social assessment - threats to self-confidence or social status, where others can negatively assess one's own performance.
These types of stress have a very specific effect on the physiology of stress.
We have been criticised.
Of course there are people who don't like this and people who find it very amazing.
I should tell you, however, that when we are criticised for a targeted selection of our data, we never select specifically for our purposes.
Our absolute principle is: If our data source has data for one of the countries we are looking at, it will be analysed.
Our data source determines whether it is reliable data, not us.
Anything else would be biased.
What about other countries
There are 200 studies on health relative to income and equality in academic peer-reviewed journals.
This is not limited to these countries, it is a very simple demonstration.
The same countries, the same inequality scale, one problem after another.
Why do we not check other factors
We have shown that per capita income makes no difference.
And, of course, others have used more sophisticated methods to check poverty and education, and more.
What about causality
A correlation does not yet prove causality.

But the message to take away is that we can improve the actual quality of human life by closing the income gap between us.
Suddenly, there is a lever for the psychosocial well-being of entire societies, and that is very exciting.

Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualified for Champions League
London (AP) - Record English football champion Manchester United returns to the Champions League after a year's absence.
The Red Devils finished third in the Premier League with a 2-0 win over Leicester City.
The Foxes now have to settle for the Europa League, because Chelsea FC was still passing by and also qualified for the premier league in fourth place.
In the fight against relegation, Aston Villa was able to cheer.
Manchester United took the lead with a penalty kick from Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in extra time, Jesse Lingard (90. + 8) scored the final score.
Chelsea, Bayern's opponent in the Champions League round of 16, won 2-0 (2-0) against Wolverhampton Wanderers thanks to Mason Mount (45th + 1) and Olivier Giroud (45th + 4).
"That means a lot to me," said coach Frank Lampard, who is also in the FA Cup final against Arsenal in his first season as Chelsea coach.
Chelsea's win over Wolverhampton also benefited Tottenham Hotspur, who passed the Wolves 1-1 (1-0) at Crystal Palace and finished sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa won the long-distance duel with Watford and Bournemouth, but had to tremble for a long time for West Ham United.
The late lead of Jack Grealish (84th) was immediately compensated by Andrei Yarmolenko (85th).
Watford lost 2-3 (1-3) at Arsenal.
The club, which fired three coaches in the season, is relegated after five years in the first division.
Just like Bournemouth, which could not save itself by a 3: 1 (2: 1) at Everton.
In the end, one point was missing.
Liverpool, who have been the English champions since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3-1 (1: 1) victory at Newcastle United.
99 points is the highest score the Reds have ever scored in a football season.
Coach J ü rgen Klopp and his team narrowly missed the point record in English football.
Manchester City holds the record with 100 points in the 2017 / 18 season.
After the Newcastle lead in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38.), Divock Origi (59.) and Sadio Mann (89.) turned the game on Sunday for Liverpool.
"It was an exceptional season for this wonderful club," said goalscorer van Dijk after the match, "which should spur us on to defend the title.
It will be difficult. "
In the end, the Premier League bosses should also be satisfied.
Due to the Coronavirus crisis, football operations in England were suspended from 13 March to 17 June.
In the meantime, there were even discussions about a premature termination or a staging of the remaining games on neutral ground.

I would like to show you today how we will produce things in the future.
I believe that our buildings and machines will soon assemble, duplicate and repair themselves.
I will show you what I think of today's production methods and then compare them with some natural systems.
In the current manufacturing industry we have skyscrapers - two and a half years [construction time], half a million to a million parts, quite complex, new and exciting technologies of steel, concrete, glass.
We have exciting machines that take us into space - five years [construction time], two and a half million parts.
On the other hand, if you look at natural systems, you will find proteins that have two million types and can fold in ten microseconds, or DNA with three billion base pairs that can be copied in about an hour.
So there is all this complexity in our natural systems, but they are extremely efficient, much more efficient than anything we can produce, far more complex than anything we can build.
They are much more energy efficient.
They almost never make mistakes.
And they are durable because they can repair themselves.
So there are a lot of interesting things to discover with natural systems.
And if we manage to incorporate this into our built environment, then we have an exciting potential for new construction methods.
And I believe that the key is self-assembly.
If we want to use self-assembly in our physical environment, I think there are four key factors.
The first is that we need to decipher all the complexity of the things we want to build - our buildings and machines.
And we have to translate that into simple sequences - the DNA of how our buildings work, so to speak.
Then we need programmable parts that can use this sequence for folding or reconfiguring.
We need activation energy so that our parts can fold up from the program.
And we need a kind of redundancy for error correction, so that what we want to build really comes into being.
I will show you some projects that my colleagues and I are working on at MIT so that self-assembly can be realized in the future.
The first two are MacroBot and DeciBot.
These projects are large-scale, reconfigurable robots - proteins two and a half to four meters long.
They are equipped with electromechanical devices, sensors.
You decode what you want to fold into a sequence of angles - minus 120, minus 120, 0, 0, 120, minus 120 - something like that; a sequence of angles, or rotations, and you send that sequence through the chain.
Each unit picks up its message - i.e. minus 120 - it rotates accordingly, checks whether it has arrived and forwards it to the neighbouring unit.
These are the brilliant scientists, engineers and designers who have worked on this project.
And I think it makes one thing really clear: Is this really scalable
I mean, thousands of dollars, many hours of work to create this two and a half meter high robot.
Can we really scale this up Can we really embed robotics in every part
The next project questions this and looks at the passive nature or the passive attempt to make reconfiguration programmable.
But it goes a step further and tries to make actual calculations possible.
It basically integrates the most fundamental component of computing, the digital logic gate, directly into the parts.
This is a NAND gate.
You have a tetrahedron, which represents the gate that will perform the calculations, and you have two input tetrahedrons.
One represents the input of the user while creating the blocks.
The other comes from the previous component that was arranged.
And then it delivers an output in three-dimensional space.
This means that the user can enter what the components should do.
It performs calculations based on what it has done before, and what the user asks of it.
And now it begins to move in three-dimensional space - up and down.
On the left, the input [1.1] corresponds to the output 0 going down.
On the right side, the input [0,0] corresponds to the output 1, which goes up.
What this really means is that our structures now contain the plans of what we want to build.
So they have all the information about what has been built.
This means that we can achieve some form of self-replication.
In this case, I call it self-guided replication because the structure contains the exact blueprints.
If errors occur, you can replace a part.
All the local information is integrated to show how to fix it.
So you could have something that climbs and reads along and delivers an output from one to one.
It is directly integrated; there are no instructions from outside.
The last project I'm going to show is called Biased Chains, and it's probably the most exciting example of self-assembling systems we have at the moment.
It takes up the ability to reconfigure and program and creates a completely passive system.
Basically, you have a chain of elements.
Each element is completely identical and they are polarized.
Each chain, or element, wants to rotate to the right or left.
So while you're putting the chain together, you're basically programming it.
Each unit is told whether to turn right or left.
When you shake the chain, it folds into a configuration that you have programmed in - in this case a spiral or in this case two adjacent cubes.
Basically, you can program any three-dimensional form - or one-dimensional, two-dimensional - completely passively into this chain.
What does this tell us about the future
I think it tells us that there are possibilities of self-assembly, replication and repair in our physical structures, our buildings and machines.
There are new possibilities for programming in these parts.
And this creates new opportunities for IT.
We will have spatial programming.
Imagine that our buildings, bridges, machines, all our components could perform calculations.
This would mean parallel and distributed computing power, new design possibilities.
So there is an exciting potential for this.
I think that these projects that I have shown here are only a tiny step towards this future, if we implement these new technologies for a new, self-creating world.
Thank you.

Arrests and violence at demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against Prime Minister Netanyahu are becoming increasingly violent.
During the night there were violent clashes.
On the night of Sunday, the Israeli police violently attacked participants in a demonstration against the right-wing conservative Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu.
Twelve people were arrested for participating in riots, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said.
Among other things, the police used water cannons to disperse the rally.
According to media reports, a total of around 6,000 people gathered near Netanyahu's office on Saturday evening.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu's handling of the Corona crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew horns and called on Netanyahu to resign.
Participants in a counter-demonstration supporting Netanyahu were also arrested, the news site "ynet" reported.
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the head of government's private villa in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
According to police reports, a man was arrested near Tel Aviv on suspicion of spraying pepper spray from a moving car on demonstrators on the roadside.
Another man was arrested after a stabbing attack on a demonstrator in the south of the country.
The demonstrator was slightly injured in the neck.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv there have recently been several demonstrations against Netanyahu.
The rallies accompany the corruption process against the head of government.
Most recently, Netanyahu has also been criticized for his handling of the Corona crisis.
Among other things, he is accused of premature easing and a lack of preparation for a second corona wave.

North Korea seals off border town after Corona suspected case
North Korea has so far seen its own measures to ward off the coronavirus as a "shining success".
The country is now reporting a suspected case for the first time.
Because of a first official Corona suspicion in the country, North Korea has completely sealed off a large city for fear of a catastrophe.
Despite the most stringent epidemiological defenses in the past six months, "the malignant virus may have been introduced into the country," the state media reported.
A state of emergency has been declared for the region around the border town of Kaesong.
The Communist leadership declared the highest level of alarm.
If confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the isolated country.
North Korea has not yet registered a single infection and described its defenses as a "shining success."
The information was doubted abroad.
The symptoms of the disease were reportedly detected in an "outlier" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
The person fled to South Korea three years ago and has now returned across the border.
South Korea initially did not confirm the crossing of the border within the military buffer zone, which is four kilometres wide and still largely mined.
According to the Yonhap National News Agency, South Korea's military acknowledged the possibility of an illegal border crossing to North Korea as high.
Investigations were carried out on a number of people.
North Korea claimed to have called an emergency meeting of the Workers' Party Politburo chaired by Kim Jong Un on Saturday on suspicion of the incident.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive catastrophe."
Kim had already ordered on Friday, as a preventive measure, "to completely block Kaesong and isolate each district and the region from others," it continued.
The person concerned, as well as all people in Kaesong who had had contact with her, had been quarantined.
The central military commission of the party is therefore to investigate the "outbreak" and the behavior of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose severe punishment.
It is estimated that there are about 300,000 people living in Kaesong.

Excitement ahead of Council meeting: City East and noise abatement are still up for discussion before a major summer break
"In addition to environmental issues, the committee members will also vote on the development plan for the major project Innenstadtentwicklung-Ost," it says rather casually in the middle part of the city press release for the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, July 28, at 4.30 pm in the large hall of the Congress Center Pforzheim.
In particular, the upgrading of the eastern city is controversial until the end.
The majorities in favour of this are scarce, and in some committees, depending on their attendance, they are even opposed.
An appeal from the economy (construction, real estate, trade and IT) not to let the project developed by the citizenry and then by the administration and local council fail after almost ten years of preparation, criticized project opponent Reinhard Klein as "extra-parliamentary opposition", "unsuspecting", "speculation", "denigration" and "deliberate false statements".
"Everyone thinks they know better," says Klein, who has been the only representative of the Pforzheim Citizens' List on the municipal council for the past year.
In fact, after reading the treaties, he was in this position: "I know what I am talking about".
The exit would be cheaper for the city, the Technical Town Hall would be renovated for 8.5 million euros, contrary to statements of the city administration after subsidies, of whose existence Klein is convinced.
The development of the city will be very different from what was predicted in the town hall and by the supporters of the economy.
To shape the city by one's own efforts and not by an investor: That is his plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP / FW / UB / LED faction, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It also essentially provides for the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, the opening of the Schlo ß berg, the lease of the ex-Thales for administrative space and a small-scale inner-city redevelopment, ideally with local agencies.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues will play a central role.
Among other things, the municipal council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the population of Pforzheim from health noise pollution caused by road traffic, including many speed reductions.
In a press release, the local traffic club Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of the fact that this must happen because they have only contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus noise by neglecting regular bus traffic with thinned cycles and by little commitment to cycling, according to the VCD.
The municipal council also votes on the participation of the city of the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim / Enzkreis.
In addition, the agenda includes accession to the Climate Protection Pact of the State of Baden-W ü rttemberg, the reassessment of parental contributions in the municipal day care centers and the application for inclusion in the Smart City funding of the federal government.

Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with a lot of delay
Tim Zimmermann starts his debut season in the ADAC GT Masters on 31 July with a delay of almost half a year.
Before the league of super sports cars can start regular operation, the first test drives were now scheduled.
For Zimmermann, it was all about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 better.
For a long time, the Corona crisis prevented Tim Zimmermann from starting his first official race in the new Lamborghini Huracan of Grasser Racing.
This was now possible under special hygiene conditions.
The 23-year-old Langenargener completed his first laps at the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his debut in the GT3 car.
"There are a few things that are different from the Porsche from the previous season," says Zimmermann.
"With ABS, for example, you have to go into the corners differently.
But it was really great fun. "
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
The Dutchman is already experienced in GT sports despite his only 25 years and was able to help his new teammate in many things.
"I'm not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series also brings new challenges," says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I get along brilliantly and we have also made enormous progress from session to session at the Lausitzring."
It is precisely there - at the Lausitzring - that the GT Masters will also be staging its first race.
From 31 July, the 33 supercars will race through Lusatia.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 newcomers to the series, knows the track.
In 2015, he was the last guest at the Motodrom.
"It worked quickly and I didn't have to get used to the track very much," says Zimmermann, who competes for the Friedrichshafen racing community Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has many fast passages that you have to hit optimally in order to be fast."
How fast Zimmermann really is will become clear in two weeks.
"Of course, the teams play a little poker during the tests," he says.
"In the end, however, we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring."
The race in Brandenburg will be the prelude to a densely packed calendar.
Seven races are scheduled until the beginning of November.
The current situation is that no spectators will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
At the N ü rburgring in mid-August, former Formula 1 driver Niko H ü lkenberg will take up the GT steering wheel.

British Transport Minister caught cold by quarantine decision
The British government's decision to quarantine holidaymakers in Spain for two weeks after their return has, according to press reports, caught the country's transport minister cold.
Grant Shapps is currently on holiday in Spain, of all places, while his colleagues at home decided on the measure on Saturday.
Due to the increasing corona numbers in Spain, the Cabinet in London removed the country from the list of countries from which entry is possible without quarantine requirements.
The new regulation will apply from today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to quarantine after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But the regulation applies to those who are only on holiday on the cut-off date, only from Saturday, 1 August, and was not introduced overnight.
Incidentally, Spain is still considered one of the "safe countries" in Austria for which quarantine is not required.
"Many ministers must have known in advance that there is a possibility of a quarantine being imposed on holidaymakers in Spain", commented Labour MEP Diane Abbot.
"But apparently nobody bothered to tell Grant Shapps."

Do you know how many species of flowering plants there are
A quarter of a million - that is the number of known species - a quarter of a million species of flowering plants.
And blossoms are real devils.
Plants have great difficulty producing them.
They require an enormous amount of energy and raw materials.
Why are they making this effort
The answer is, of course, like so much in the world: Sex.
I know what you're thinking of when you look at these pictures.
And the answer to why sexual reproduction is so important -- there are many other ways for plants to reproduce.
Take offshoots; they can have sex with themselves, so to speak; they can pollinate themselves.
But they actually have to spread their genes to mix them with other genes so that they can occupy ecological niches.
This is how evolution works.
Plants pass on this information via pollen.
Some of you may have seen some of these pictures before.
As I always say, everyone would have to have a scanning electron microscope at home to see them.
There are as many different types of pollen as there are flowering plants.
And this is very useful for forensics and so on.
Most of the pollen that causes hay fever in us comes from plants that use the wind to spread their pollen, which is a very inefficient process, which is why so much of it ends up in our noses.
Because the plants eject very large quantities, in the hope that the male sex cells that are in the pollen will only hit another flower by chance.
All grasses, i.e. all cereal plants and most trees transport pollen by the wind.
Most species, however, use insects for their purposes. And this is the smarter way, as less pollen is needed.
The insects and other species can bring the pollen directly to its destination.
We are of course aware of the relationship between insects and plants.
This is a symbiotic relationship. Whether flies, birds or bees, they also benefit from it, usually through the nectar.
This symbiosis has led to some wonderful adaptations - the hummingbird warmer is a beautiful adaptation.
The plant benefits from the fact that the hummingbird spreads the pollen.
Plants have developed small runways for bees that would otherwise not find their way.
On many plants are markings that resemble other insects.
These are the anthers of a lily, a very clever construction. When an unsuspecting insect lands on it, the bags fold up and hit the insect on the back, where the pollen gets stuck and taken to other plants.
This is an orchid that looks like it has a mouth. The insects are forced to crawl out and are covered by pollen.
There are at least 20,000 species of orchids - an impressive variety.
And they have all sorts of tricks in store.
They must attract pollinators to help them.
This orchid, known from the investigations of Charles Darwin, who made a great thesis at their sight. You see a very long nectar tube coming down from the orchid.
And what insects have to do there in the middle of the flower - they have to put their little suction trunk there and the whole nectar tube down to get the nectar.
And when Darwin saw this flower, he said, "Something must have developed in parallel."
And indeed, here is this insect.
It usually rolls up the trunk, but in its elongated form it looks like this.
You can imagine that if nectar is so valuable and expensive to produce for the plant and attracts many pollinators, then it is like human sex that people begin to deceive.
They say, "I have nectar, will you come and fetch it"
This is a plant.
This is a plant that insects in South Africa simply love. And they have developed a long sucking trunk to get the nectar.
And this is an imitator,
A plant that copies the original.
And here is the fly with a long trunk that has not received any nectar from the imitator. Because the imitator, unlike the fly expected, has no nectar at all.
Not only did the fly not get any nectar, it also had - if you look very closely, at the head of the trunk you can see pollen that would have transferred it to other plants, if only a botanist had not passed by and stuck it on blue paper.
(Laughter) Deception runs through the whole plant kingdom.
These black dots on it flower, they look to us like black dots, but to male insects of certain species they look like two females that are very hot.
(Laughter) And when the insect lands there, it picks up pollen that brings it to more plants. If you look at the "Everybody Should Have One" electron microscope image, you see that there are certain three-dimensional patterns.
It not only looks good for the insect, but also feels good.
And these electron microscope images - here one of an orchid imitating an insect - show that different parts of the shape have different colors and seemingly different surfaces, and for the perception of an insect the textures are very, very different.
This plant has developed the imitation of a shiny metallic surface, as seen on some beetles.
And under the electron microscope, you can see that this surface is very different from the one we have looked at so far.
Sometimes the whole plant imitates an insect, even in our perception.
I think it looks like a flying animal.
It's a wonderful thing.
This one is clever. It's called Obsidium.
I sometimes regard them as treacherous.
For certain bees, it looks like another, particularly aggressive bee, so it flies there and hits its head several times to drive it away, naturally absorbing a lot of pollen.
At the same time, this plant imitates another orchid, which provides a rich food supply for insects.
This one, however, has nothing for them.
So it's cheating on two levels - fabulous.
(Laughter) Here we see the cananga tree, an ingredient of many perfumes.
I smelled one of them earlier.
The flowers should not be so colorful.
They send a fantastic spectrum of fragrances to all insects.
This one doesn't smell so good.
This is a flower that smells really horrible and that has evolved to imitate carrion.
Therefore, flies love them.
They fly in and pollinate them.
This is a Helicodiceros, also known as "dead horse".
I don't know how a dead horse smells, but the plant probably hits it quite well.
It's really terrible.
And blowflies can't hold back.
They fly straight to the back
And lay their eggs there, they think it's carrion, without realizing that there is no food for the eggs that die because of it, but the plant benefits from it, as the fly full of pollen flies on again and pollinates the next flower - fantastic.
This is Arum maculatum, the spotted Aron staff.
I photographed him last week in Dorset.
It warms up to about 15 degrees Celsius above ambient temperature - fascinating.
And when you look inside the plant, there is a kind of barrier behind the inflorescences. Flies are attracted by the heat that creates volatile chemicals and are then trapped in the bottom of the container.
They drink the wonderful nectar and are sticky afterwards.
At night, they get a pollen shower and then the bristles we saw above slacken, clearing the way for mosquitoes that are full of pollen - great thing.
If you think that's great, now comes one of my favorites.
This is the Philodendron Selloum.
If someone from Brazil is here, you will know the plant.
It is really fascinating.
This species of phallus there is about 30cm long.
And it does something that no other plant I know does, when it blooms. There in the middle are the inflorescences - for about 2 days it has a metabolism very similar to that of mammals.
Instead of feeding on starch, which is the food of plants, it takes something similar to brown adipose tissue and burns it so quickly that the fat burning rate, the metabolism, corresponds to that of a small cat.
This is twice the energy production of a hummingbird, in relation to its weight - incredibly impressive.
But he does something else that is unusual.
It not only heats up to 43 to 44 degrees Celsius for about 2 days, but also maintains a constant temperature.
It can regulate its temperature and thus keep it constant.
They ask themselves, "Why does he do that"
As you can imagine, there are some beetles that love to mate at this temperature.
And they fly in and get started.
(Laughter) And the plant shoots them with pollen, and they fly on and pollinate.
What a wonderful thing.
The typical pollinator for us is an insect. But in the tropics also pollinate many birds and butterflies.
And many tropical flowers are red and we think this is because birds and butterflies look similar to us and therefore can see the color red very well.
If you look at the spectrum of birds and people, we see red, green and blue, so this spectrum here.
Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet and different levels of ultraviolet.
So something that goes beyond our spectrum.
And I hear you asking, "Wouldn't it be great if we could see that"
Of course, we can.
So what does an insect see
Last week I photographed this sunflower in Dorset.
As you can see, these are small yellow flowers, small yellow flowers everywhere.
And that's what they look like in visible light.
That's what it looks like when you remove the red.
Most bees don't see red.
And then I photographed with ultraviolet filters and exposed the special ultraviolet frequencies for a very, very long time and that came out.
And that's a fantastic target.
We don't know exactly what bees see, just like you don't know what I see when I say, 'That's red.'
We cannot look into the thoughts of insects or other people.
But the contrast will be something like that. It stands out against the background.
Here is another small bloom - other bandwidth of ultraviolet frequencies, other filters that are similar to pollinators.
And that's what they would see.
If you now think all yellow flowers have this property - no flower was damaged for this picture; it was only attached to the tripod, not killed - but under ultraviolet light it looks like that.
And that could serve as the basis of a sunscreen, because sunscreens absorb UV light.
The substances in the plant could be helpful.
Finally, we have an evening primrose that Bjorn Rorslett sent me from Norway - fantastic hidden patterns.
I love the idea of hidden things.
I think there is something poetic about it, namely that these images were taken with UV filters, filters that are mainly used by astronomers to photograph Venus - more precisely, its nebulae.
This is the main purpose of these filters.
Venus is the goddess of love and fertility, and that in turn is the story of flowers.
And flowers not only show great efforts to attract pollinators, they also make it possible for us to plant large fields full of them and give them to each other at births and deaths, and especially at weddings, which, if you think about it, are the moment when the exchange of genetic material from one organism to another is determined.
Thank you very much.

Hurricane "Hanna" reaches Texas: Help made more difficult because of Corona
Washington, DC - This year's first hurricane over the Atlantic has landed in Texas.
Life-threatening floods, strong winds and heavy rainfall now threatened parts of the US state, the National Hurricane Center of the US Climate Protection Agency (NOAA) announced on Sunday night (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of emergency for many districts.
The Corona pandemic, which is rampant in Texas, is making the work of the helpers more difficult, Abbott continued, according to the US media.
Evacuees called for caution
"Every hurricane is a huge challenge," Abbott said, according to the Houston Chronicle.
With regard to the hurricane in Texas, he added, "This challenge is complicated and exacerbated by the fact that it is sweeping through an area that is the most affected by Covid-19 in the state."
According to John Hopkins University, about 5,000 people have died in Texas alone as a result of the corona pandemic.

In the Pacific, Hurricane Douglas was heading for Hawaii overnight on Sunday with wind speeds of around 150 kilometers per hour.

New York City - Over the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has attracted attention with her tireless commitment to the Fridays For Future movement.

Late-night host Stephen Colbert welcomed 17-year-old Thunberg to your show on Tuesday and conducted a lengthy interview with the Swede.

The musician's life ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") resembled a roller coaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise - but the band celebrated their greatest successes without him.

The song "Albatross", composed by Green, gave the group their first number one hit in the winter of 1968 / 69 and catapulted them to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed its downsides: Green could not cope with the media hype, his experiments with the drug LSD became more and more extreme.
He later commented on the life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in life is the drugs - the best thing was to land a number one hit".
Towards the end of the decade, Green surprisingly achieved a respectable success in 1979 with an album inspired by religious themes.
Meanwhile, Fleetwood Mac swam without him in a new formation on a wave of success.
Their 1977 album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
