We're not going to know.
You could have known.
Please remember for a moment a very simple fact: Pretty much everything we know about the universe, we know through light.
We can stand on Earth and look at the night sky and look at stars with our naked eyes.
The sun burns our peripheral vision.
We see light reflected from the moon.
and in the time that has passed since Galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope at the celestial bodies, the universe we know has travelled to us as visible light, traversing vast ages of cosmic history.
With the help of all our modern telescopes, we have been able to study all this: this impressive silent film of the universe, this series of snapshots dating back to the Big Bang.
But the universe is not a silent movie, because the universe is not silent.
I want to convince you that the universe has a soundtrack and that this soundtrack is played in space itself: because space can vibrate like a drum.
It can sound like a sound recording that can be heard throughout the universe; of some of the most dramatic events when they occurred.
Now we would like to add a sonic component to the wonderful visual arrangement we have of the universe.
And even if we have never heard the sounds of the universe before, we should slowly turn up the volume knob for what is happening out there over the next few years.
Out of this ambition to capture songs of the universe, we turn our attention to black holes and their inherent promise, because black holes hammer against space-time like wooden mallets on a drum. They have a very characteristic sound that I would like to play to you; or our idea of how this song will sound.
One day we may see a shadow cast by a black hole against a bright background, but so far we have not succeeded.
And yet you can hear black holes, even if they are invisible, because they play on space-time like a drum.
We owe the idea that the universe sounds like a drum to Albert Einstein, to whom we owe so much.
Einstein realized that if space were empty, if the universe was empty, it would have to look like this image, just without this helpful grid.
But if we were to move through space in free fall, even without this helpful grid, then perhaps we could paint it ourselves, because we would see that we are moving along straight lines, along undistorted, straight paths through the universe.
Einstein also realized (and this is what it is about) that when you bring energy or mass into the universe, it bends the universe, and if a body in freefall passed, say, the sun, it would be distorted along the natural curvature lines in space.
This is Einstein's great General Theory of Relativity.
Even light is bent along these paths.
And a body can be bent so much that it goes into orbit around the sun, like the earth, or like the moon in orbit.
These are natural curvatures in space.
What Einstein did not know was that if you were to take the sun and squeeze it into a ball six kilometers in diameter, if you were to take something with a million times the mass of the Earth and squeeze it into six kilometers, you would create a black hole; a body of such density that light passing too close to it would never escape; it would be a black shadow in front of the universe.
But Einstein considered black holes a mathematical curiosity throughout his life.
He did not believe that they really existed.
He was convinced that nature would protect us from its formation.
It would take decades for the term "black hole" to be coined and people to understand that black holes are astrophysical bodies; in fact, they are the lifeless state of extremely dense stars collapsing in a horrific catastrophe at the end of their lives.
Our sun will not end up as a black hole.
It's just not big enough for that.
But we did a little thought experiment, as Einstein liked to do: imagine that we compress the sun to six kilometers in diameter and put a tiny Earth into its orbit, say 30 kilometers away from this black sun.
This Earth would shine by itself, (because since the sun would then have disappeared, there would be no other light source) so we let our little Earth shine by itself.
We could put the Earth into a carefree orbit about 30 km away from the crushed black hole.
This crushed black hole would be about the size of Manhattan.
It would spill into the Hudson for a while before destroying the Earth.
But we're talking about that.
We're talking about something that can be squeezed until it's half the size of Manhattan.
Now we bring the Earth very close, up to about 30 km, and see how it moves in a perfectly perfect orbit around the black hole.
There is a kind of myth that black holes devour everything in the universe, but in fact you have to get very close to them to fall into them.
But what is particularly impressive from our point of view is the fact that we can always see the Earth.
She can't hide behind the black hole.
The light that comes from the Earth, some of it falls in, but some is scattered and returns to us.
So you can't hide anything behind a black hole.
If this is the Battlestar Galactica and you are fighting against the Cylons, then you better not hide behind the black hole.
They can see it.
So our sun will not collapse into a black hole, its mass is insufficient, but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
If one of them wiped out the Milky Way, it would look like this.
We would see a shadow of the black hole against the backdrop of billions of stars of the Milky Way galaxy and their glowing dust orbits.
If we were to fall towards this black hole, we would see all the light bent around it, and we could even enter the shadows without noticing that something unusual was happening.
It would be bad if we tried to ignite our engines and escape, because we could not do that, any more than the light can escape.
But even if the black hole is dark from the outside, it is not dark inside, because all the light of the galaxy could fall behind us.
And although, due to a phenomenon of relativity (the so-called time dilation), our clocks seemed to be slower relative to galactic time, it would appear that the evolution of the galaxy had accelerated and was shooting at us just before we were crushed to death by the black hole.
It would be like a near-death experience to see the light at the end of the tunnel, but it would be a comprehensive death experience.
(Laughter) And you couldn't tell anyone about the light at the end of the tunnel.
Now, we have never seen such a shadow of a black hole, but black holes can be heard, even if they are invisible.
Imagine an astrophysically realistic situation: Imagine two black holes that have lived a long life together.
Perhaps it was once stars that collapsed into two black holes, each with a mass ten times that of the Sun.
We now squeeze them together to a diameter of 60 km.
They can rotate several hundred times per second.
At the end of their lives, they circle each other almost at the speed of light.
They can travel thousands of kilometers in a split second, and as they do so, they not only bend space, but leave in their wake a sound of space, a real wave of space-time.
Space contracts and expands as it pours out of these black holes and hammers into the universe.
And they travel out into the cosmos at the speed of light.
We owe this computer simulation to a NASA Goddard Relativity Working Group.
It took almost 30 years for someone to solve this problem.
This was one of those groups.
Here we see two black holes circling each other, again with the helpful painted lines.
Maybe you can see - it's a bit indistinct - but when you see the red waves coming out, these are gravitational waves.
They actually represent the sound of sounding space and will emerge from these black holes at the speed of light as they become ever quieter and eventually merge into a spinning, silent black hole.
If you were close enough, the sound of contracting and expanding space would roar in your ears.
You could literally hear the sound.
Of course, your head would also be pressed and stretched, which would be quite unpleasant, which is why you would have difficulty understanding what is happening.
But I would like to show you what sounds we would predict here.
This is from my working group - a slightly less glamorous computer model.
Imagine that a lighter black hole falls into a very heavy black hole.
What you hear is the sound of the light black hole hammering into space every time it passes close by.
When it moves away, it is a bit too quiet.
But it hits like a mallet and literally shatters the universe, making it swing like a drum.
We can predict what that will sound like.
We know that when it falls in, it gets faster and louder.
And finally we hear the little guy falling into the big guy.
I've never heard it so loud - it's really much more dramatic.
At home, it sounds rather disappointing.
More like ding, ding, ding.
This is another noise from my group.
No, I don't show you any pictures, because black holes don't leave any helpful traces of ink.
But if you were floating around in space during a space vacation and you would hear this here, then you should make sure you get away.
(Laughter) You really should get away from that noise.
Both black holes are moving.
Both black holes are coming closer together.
In this case, they vibrate very strongly at first.
And then they merge.
This chirping is typical of the merging of two black holes, so that it chirps at the end.
This is our idea of what we would see.
Luckily, we're at a safe distance here in Long Beach, California.
But it is highly probable that two black holes have merged somewhere in the universe.
And it is just as certain that space is vibrating around us, having probably taken millions of light years, or having travelled to us at the speed of light for a million years.
But the sound is far too quiet for us to ever hear it.
Experiments are being carried out on Earth with great zeal, one of which is called LIGO - to detect deviations in the way space contracts and expands again, deviations of the order of magnitude smaller than an atomic nucleus over a distance of four kilometres.
It is an incredibly ambitious project and its sensitivity will be further developed over the next few years - to be able to perceive this here.
There will also be a mission for space, which will hopefully be launched within the next ten years, called LISA.
LISA will be able to see huge black holes, black holes with a million or billion times the density of the Sun.
In this image from the Hubble telescope, we see two galaxies.
They look like they are frozen in a hug.
Each presumably contains a huge black hole in its interior.
But they are not frozen. They are merging.
These two black holes collide and become one over billions of years.
Our human ability to perceive is not capable of capturing a song of such duration.
But LISA could see the final stages of two giant black holes, at an earlier point in the history of the universe, the last 15 minutes before they merge.
And it's not just about black holes, it's about all the big disruptions in the universe - and the biggest of all is the Big Bang.
When the term was coined, it was meant contemptuously - "Who believes in a big bang, a big bang?"
This animation from friends of mine at Proton Studios shows an exterior view of the Big Bang.
We never really want to try; we never want to be inside the universe because you can never be outside the universe.
So imagine you are in the Big Bang.
It is everywhere, all around you, and space wafts and vibrates completely uncontrollably.
14 billion years go by, but this song is still ringing around us.
Galaxies form and generations of stars are born in these galaxies, and a habitable planet orbits around one of these stars, at least a single one.
And here we sit and work like crazy on these experiments, doing calculations and writing computer code.
Imagine that two black holes collided a billion years ago.
Her song has been ringing through space ever since, all the time.
We didn't even exist at the time.
It's getting closer and closer - 40,000 years ago we painted cave paintings.
If it's the Big Bang we're recording, that's how it would sound.
It is literally the epitome of noise.
It's white noise, it's such a chaotic noise.
But it is all around us, probably at least if it has not been wiped out by another process in the universe.
When we record it, it will sound like music to our ears, because it will be a faint echo, an echo of the moment of our creation, of our visible universe.
So within the next two years we will be able to make the soundtrack a little louder and present the universe as a sound image.
But if we can grasp those very earliest moments, it will bring us much closer to understanding the Big Bang, which in turn brings us closer to some of the most complex, elusive questions.
If we played a movie of the universe backwards, we would know there was a big bang in the past and we could even perceive the cacophony of its sound, but was our big bang the only one?
I think we have to ask the question: has this happened before?
Will it be repeated?
I think in the spirit of the challenge that TED presents - to rekindle wonder - we can ask questions, at least at this last minute, that might otherwise elude us forever.
But we must ask ourselves: Is it possible that our universe is just an offshoot of a larger story?
Or is it possible that we are just an offshoot of a multiverse - each offshoot with its own big bang in its past - perhaps some of them have drum-playing black holes, others may not - in some there may be intelligent life, in others not - not in our past, not in our future, but in some way fundamentally connected to us?
So we have to ask ourselves: if there is a multiverse, do living beings exist in another fragment of that multiverse?
These are my creatures of the Multiverse.
Are there other beings in this multiverse who are concerned about us and their own origins?
And if they exist, I can imagine that they are like us, that they are calculating and writing computer codes, building instruments, trying to make out the farthest noise of their origin and wondering who else is out there.
Thank you.

Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvest workers infected
After a corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in Mamming in Lower Bavaria, almost 500 people are under quarantine and are no longer allowed to leave the farm.
A security guard monitors the curfew.
A total of 174 harvest workers were tested positive for the corona pathogen Sars-CoV-2 during the screening, as the Dingolfing-Landau district office announced on Saturday evening.
"In order to avoid further spread, we unfortunately have to take this step to protect the population," explained District Administrator Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees had already been infected in the company - this was the reason for the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm that grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and beetroot - but the cucumbers are only for jars.
Mamming is a rural community with about 3300 inhabitants not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to keep calm: "According to our information, it is a closed group of people.".
On the farm, infected employees were separated from non-infected employees, and the site is now surrounded by a barrier fence.
Greens and SPD blamed the state government.
The two opposition factions accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting to control the accommodation of seasonal workers.

The SPD takes a similar view: "After the corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof slaughterhouse in mid-May, we have already called for a special control program for farms with harvest workers," said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"From our point of view, hygiene conditions at the workplace and living conditions in particular must be strictly monitored.

Many people believe that driving is an activity reserved only for people who can see.
A blind person driving a car safely and independently was considered an impossible task until now.
Hello, my name is Dennis Hong, and we want to give blind people freedom and independence by building a vehicle for the blind.
Therefore, before I talk about this car for the blind, let me briefly talk about another project I worked on, which was called the DARBA Urban Challenge.
This was about building a robotized car that can drive itself.
You press start, nobody touches anything, and it can reach its destination completely automatically.
So in 2007 our team won half a million dollars by finishing third in the competition.
Around this time, the National Association of the Blind, or NFB, challenged the Investigation Committee to produce a car that could be driven safely and independently by a blind person.
We decided to give it a try, because we thought, hey, how difficult it can be.
We already have an automatic vehicle.
We put a blind person in and it's done, isn't it?
(Laughter) We couldn't have been more wrong.
What the National Federation of the Blind (NFB) wanted was not a vehicle that would drive blind people around, but a vehicle where a blind person could make active decisions and drive.
So we had to throw everything away and start again.
Therefore, to test this crazy idea, we developed a small buggy prototype vehicle to test its feasibility.
And in the summer of 2009, we invited dozens of young blind people from all over the country and gave them the opportunity to take a spin.
It was an absolutely amazing experience.
But the problem with this car was that it was designed so that it could only be driven in a controlled environment, a level, traffic-free parking lot, and that even the lanes were highlighted with red cones.
Therefore, with this success, we decided to take the next big step, to develop a real car that can be driven on real roads.
So how does it work?
Well, it's quite a complicated system, but let me try to explain it, and maybe I can simplify it.
Well, we have three steps.
We have perception, calculation and non-visual interfaces.
Well, it is clear that the driver cannot see, so the system must be able to perceive the environment and collect information for the driver.
For this, we use an initial measuring unit.
It measures acceleration, angular acceleration, like a human ear, an inner ear.
We merge the information with a GPS unit to approximate the position of the car.
We also use two cameras to detect the lanes of the road.
And we also use three laser distance measurements.
The lasers scan the surroundings to detect obstacles, a car approaching us from the front or from behind, and also any obstacles coming onto the road, any obstacles around the vehicle.
After that, all this enormous amount of information is fed into the computer, and the computer can do two things.
First, first of all, process the information to understand what the environment is like; these are lanes on the road, the obstacles, and convey this information to the driver.
The system is also smart enough to calculate the safest way to operate the car.
We can also generate instructions on how to control the vehicle.
But, the problem is this: how can we communicate this information and these instructions to a person who cannot see quickly enough and fairly accurately so that they can drive?
For this, we have developed different types of non-visual user interface technology.
We started with a three-dimensional ping sound system, a vibrating vest, a click wheel with voice commands, a foot strip, and even a shoe that puts pressure on the leg.
But today, we will talk about three of these non-visual user interface technologies.
Well, the first interface technology is called DriveGrip.
This is a pair of gloves, and it has its vibrating elements on the ankle side, so they can give instructions on how to control, direction and intensity.
Another device is called SpeedStrip.
This is a chair, strictly speaking, it is a massage chair.
We hollow it out, and we reorganize the vibrating elements into different patterns, and we actuate them to give information about the speed, and also to give instructions on how to use the accelerator and brake pedal.
So, here you can see how the computer sees the environment, and since you can't see the vibration, we even equip the driver with red LEDs so that he can really see what's going on.
This is the sensory data, and this data is transmitted to the devices via computer.
Therefore, these two devices, DriveGrip and SpeedGrip, are very effective.
But the problem is that there are stitch instructions devices.
So this is not a real freedom, is it?
The computer tells you how to drive, turn left, turn right, accelerate, stop.
We call it backseat driver problem.
Therefore, let's move away from the stitch instruction devices, and focus more on the information devices.
A good example of this non-visual information interface technology is AirPix.
Think of it as a monitor for the blind.
Well, it's a small tray, it has many holes and it releases compressed air, so it can even draw pictures.
Therefore, even if they are blind, they can put their hand on it and see the lanes and obstacles on the road.
In fact, they can also change the air frequency that escapes, and possibly the temperature.
Therefore, it is in fact a multidimensional user interface.
Well, here you can look at the left camera, the right camera seen from the vehicle and see how the computer interprets this and sends the information to the AirPix.
For this, we show a simulator, a blind person driving and using the AirPix.
This simulator was also very useful for training the blind drivers and also quick in testing different kinds of ideas for different types of non-visual user interfaces.
So, that's how it works.
But this vehicle is a prototype, and it will not hit the road until it is proven that it is safe, or safer than today's vehicles.
And I really believe that this can happen.
But still, will society, would they accept such a radical idea?
How will we regulate insurance?
How will we issue driving licences?
Aside from the technological challenges, there are many types of hurdles that we have to overcome before it becomes a reality.
Of course, the main goal of this project is to produce a car for a blind person.
But potentially more important than this is the huge benefit of spin-off technology that can be drawn from this project.
The sensors that are needed can see in the dark in fog and rain.
And along with these new types of interfaces, we can use this technology and apply it in safer cars for normal-sighted people.
Or for blind people, in everyday devices in the home, in training and in the office.
Imagine a teacher writing on the blackboard in a classroom, and a blind student can see and read what he has written using these non-visual interface technologies.
This is priceless.
Therefore, the things I have shown you today are just the beginning.
Thank you.

In this respect, there is no getting around the debate as to whether it is not necessary to facilitate the involvement of investors for clubs that want to break into this phalanx. ".
However, he doubts whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority participation, which is prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50 + 1 rule.
"It remains a legal risk to draw investment fences around the Bundesliga as a business location in a European single market," said Grindel.

He had never "made a secret of the gift," assured the 58-year-old.

Professionally arrived - privately not yet
"Things are going very well" - this is the conclusion of Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first days in the notary's office in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very quickly: In mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she would succeed Lutz Feller in the Eggenfelden notarial office.
Just six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the lawyer with a doctorate took up work, and normal day-to-day business has long been in full swing.
"Privately, however, I still have to arrive," she explains in conversation with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
Of course, the short lead time was not enough to completely relocate the centre of life from Regensburg to Eggenfelden, reports the native of Dingolfingen.
She and her husband, who works as a judge at the regional court in Regensburg, are currently looking for a suitable apartment or a house in the city.
At least her husband was able to apply for parental leave at short notice to ensure the care of their two daughters (3 and 1 years old).
In order not to have to commute from Regensburg every day, she also has an overnight stay with her parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-old.
Growing up in the neighboring district, the city of Eggenfelden has of course long been known to her.
During visits to Eggenfelden with her family over the past few months, she said: "Eggenfelden is a really nice small town.".
She was all the more pleased that she had won the race for the vacancy in the selection process.
Her native Lower Bavaria also plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career: After studying law in Passau, she completed her legal traineeship and the 2nd state examination in Regensburg.
After several positions as a notary, including in Rehau and Hof in Upper Franconia, Babenhausen im Unterallgäu and Regensburg - during which time she also shouldered her doctorate in employment law "on the side" - she started her first job as a notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016, she took parental leave, which was followed by the move to Regensburg.
Since then, she has represented various notaries.
When the position in Eggenfelden was advertised because of the approaching retirement of Lutz Feller, she saw the right time for a full return to work, explains the 39-year-old.
Dr. Stefanie Kramer has completely taken over the team of her predecessor, who will in future take over the holiday substitution in the notarial office - and immediately has a praise for the team of the law firm: "Things are going super well!"
The fact that she can rely on well-established processes here makes it easier for her to take care of the imminent relocation of her private centre of life.
She has already contacted a local institution about nursery and crche places.
And if everything works out as desired, she hopes to be able to pursue her hobby here too soon - and get to know the most beautiful jogging routes in the Rottal.

BVB plans to start the league with maximum 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be 20 percent full at the start of the season if fans return.
"Due to the distance regulation, which is mandatory, we are currently planning with 12,000 to 15,000 spectators," Borussia Dortmund's managing director Carsten Cramer told the "Tagesspiegel.".
Normally, the arena in the Revierstadt can accommodate a little more than 81,000 spectators for Bundesliga matches.
In last season's ghost games caused by the corona pandemic, BVB lost around four million euros per game.
Cramer, who is responsible for marketing, digitisation and internationalisation at BVB, hopes that in addition to the normal spectator seats, some of the approximately 4000 seats in the hospitality area can be opened again: "It is of course a blow to the office if these revenues completely disappear.".
In view of the ongoing corona crisis, everyone is currently "well advised to take a stable side first.".
"If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people in Germany alone are in short-time work, then the need for entertainment is limited," Cramer explained.
The Dortmund marketing boss praised the BVB pros for their partial salary cut, which should contribute to overcoming the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their salary cut has a different effect than if we put 100 people who work in merchandising on short-time work.".

Kalbitz expulsion from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "fig leaf"
The expulsion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is only a "fig leaf" from the perspective of the FDP and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the far right in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD, "FDP politician Benjamin Strasser told the dpa news agency in Berlin.
After several hours of negotiations, the AfD's Federal Court of Arbitration confirmed Kalbitz's expulsion on Saturday in Stuttgart, which the federal board had decided by a majority in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD faction in the Brandenburg state parliament.
"If the AfD really wanted to remove right-wing extremists from its party, functionaries like Björn Höcke and his supporters would have been excluded long ago," said Strasser.
"However, there is no political will in the AfD, because right-wing extremism is now part of the party.".
CSU General Secretary Markus Blume expressed a similar opinion: "The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded says nothing and changes nothing," he told the "Welt am Sonntag.".
"It speaks volumes how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist still has in the middle of the AfD.".
Blume assumes that the AfD will again land below five percent in future elections.
"The days of the AfD in the parliaments are numbered.".
Kalbitz was one of the spokesmen of the now officially dissolved "wing" around the Thuringian AfD state and parliamentary group chairman Björn Höcke; the constitutional protection classifies the coronation as a "secure right-wing extremist effort.".
In May, the AfD federal executive had kicked Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason, he stated that Kalbitz had not stated a previous membership in the now banned right-wing extremist "Heimattreuen Deutsche Jugend" (HDJ) and the Republicans when he joined the party.
Kalbitz denies membership in the HDJ.
Sebastian Walter, chairman of the Left Party in the Brandenburg state parliament, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court did not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf has only eaten chalk.
The AfD remains a far-right party, with or without Kalbitz. ".
Neither the federal party nor the right wing will be weakened by this decision.
"The manoeuvre of the Meuthen troop is transparent.
They want to evade further surveillance by the constitutional protection and try to get through under the radar, "said Walter.
"The AfD can't get rid of the ghosts it called out.
A dismissal does not change anything, "commented the Brandenburg SPD General Secretary Erik Stohn on the decision in the Kalbitz case.
"Here, the AfD regional association and the parliamentary group stuck to their right-wing leader to this day.".
The legal battle over Kalbitz's membership in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he would now take civil action against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court.

North Sea wind farms provide 21 percent more electricity
Wind power plants on the German North Sea fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid in the first six months of the year.
This is a good 21 percent more than in the same period last year, announced the network operator Tennet in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea electricity to the mainland and the transmission through the German power grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of Tennet's grid area, have fed another 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, wind power from the North Sea and Baltic Sea thus comes to 13.73 TWh, compared to a good 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind power in Germany; this is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms increase generation capacity
In addition to wind conditions, the increased contribution of offshore wind energy results from higher generation capacities, because new wind farms have been connected to the grid in the past twelve months.
If the 1,270 wind turbines in the North Sea were all running at full power at the same time, they could generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatts.
By 2030, it is to rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore grid connections," said Tennet Managing Director Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind farms cannot reach their full capacity even at sea, but reach around 40 percent.
The previous record day this year is January 2, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce around 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, equivalent to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could supply almost seven million households with electricity.

More air traffic controllers in Worms
Worms University continues to take to the skies: "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" is endowing a professorship for "Air Traffic Management.".
A corresponding contract between the university and DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and will start in 2021.
The professorship allows students to start their studies not only in the summer semester, but also in the winter semester.
This means that twice as many students can be trained as before.
At the same time, the capacities of both the university and the DFS air traffic control academy will be equally utilised.
DFS will advise the university on the establishment and appointment of the professorship.
Represented at the university since 2019
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students have been studying Air Traffic Management as part of their training as air traffic controllers at Worms University of Applied Sciences.
Nine students have already started this year.
So far, the experiences of DFS have been very positive, and the performance of the students has been outstanding.
The combination of studies and pilot training contributes significantly to further increasing the attractiveness of the pilot profession.
"In these times, funding is not easy for us economically.
However, we firmly expect air traffic to recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to be able to fulfil our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel, "said Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, CEO of DFS, at the signing of the contract.
"For DFS, the endowed professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, interdisciplinary knowledge base in the long term.
We are therefore continuing the good cooperation with the university and at the same time underlining our attractiveness as an employer. ".
Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of Worms University of Applied Sciences, emphasizes this: "The endowed professorship forms an important bridge between science and business.
With it, we want to build on the existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual bachelor's degree course in Air Traffic Management. ".
For Worms University of Applied Sciences, the trust of German air traffic control is both a motivation and an obligation to further expand its teaching and research expertise in the future-oriented fields of air traffic.
Working for the air traffic controllers of tomorrow, the university can set very special highlights and innovative focuses for its students with the first endowed professorship for a dual course of study.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary in the Ministry of Science, Further Education and Culture, emphasizes: "Worms University of Applied Sciences has a unique selling point in Rhineland-Palatinate with its focus on air transport.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the university's profile. ".

Juventus Turin champions in Italy
Turin - After a redeeming goal from Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in a row.
The team around the five-time world footballer completed the 36th Scudetto in the club's history with a 2-0 (1-0) on Sunday evening in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo scored 1-0 before half-time.
With 83 points, Turin, which started without the recently long-injured ex-national player Sami Khedira, can no longer be relegated from first place two match days before the end of the Serie A season.
Second-placed Inter Milan are seven points behind.
Juventus were harmless in the first half despite optical superiority, then Ronaldo scored after a free-kick with the last action.
The 35-year-old exploited a play from Miralem Pjanic directly from the penalty area with a flat shot (45. + 7).
Against the now more offensive guests, Ronaldo was also involved in the 2-0, after his shot Federico Bernardeschi (67th) dusted off.
This secured the lackluster but decisive success.
The foul penalty shot to the crossbar in the 89th minute should only have annoyed Ronaldo himself with regard to the scorer's score.
"It's complicated to stay mentally and physically on the ball for 90 minutes.
The games are strange and the momentum changes very slightly, "explained coach Maurizio Sarri after the 2-1 draw at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.

Because of the defeat, Turin had not yet been able to perfect the championship.
Juve's calming lead at the top of the standings was mainly due to the weakness of its competitors.
In the eleven games before Sunday's game, the Sarri team had managed only five wins.
Whether Ronaldo will also be the top scorer is questionable.
While the Portuguese superstar has scored 31 goals so far, the former Dortmund Ciro Immobile has already scored 34 goals after his three-pack in the 5: 1 (1: 1) of fourth-placed Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to FC Bayern's title win.
The record in Italy is held by the current Juve professional Gonzalo Higuan.

Baden-Württemberg: More than 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - Despite all the threatened penalties and court verdicts, motorists continue to step on the gas in countless illegal races on the roads of Baden-Württemberg: Last year and the first four months of this year, the police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
Although there are no comparative figures for the previous years, the speeders are increasingly making work for the judicial authorities: In 2018, the public prosecutors between Konstanz and Mannheim conducted a total of 155 investigations into illegal races, a year later there were already 252 and in the current year up to the beginning of June already 151.
The races were less about organized events, as can be seen from the reply of the Ministry of the Interior to a request from the SPD.
In most cases, the drivers spontaneously competed against each other or fled from the police - this is also reported as an illegal race.
At the wheel were mainly German men between the ages of 18 and 60.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases are the speeders caught and asked to pay: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines and 15 prison sentences have been imposed since 2018.
However, there is no indication that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
Rather, because of the numerous tragic accidents and lawsuits of recent years, other drivers reacted more sensitively than before and reported more frequently, a ministry spokesman said.
Highway 8 is particularly popular with speeders. Again and again, drivers slow down the traffic there in order to make room for themselves and use the free distance for a race.
Last August, a dozen drivers were caught near Kirchheim unter Teck, three months earlier there were even 18 drivers on the A8 near Merklingen.
A81 is most popular "racetrack"
The police even register more races on the A81 than on any other federal highway.
A speed limit is being set to try to slow down the speeders on the particularly affected section between Engen and Geisingen.
The mostly high-priced and pimped-up sports and luxury cars often have Swiss license plates, because the drivers avoid racing in Germany because of the high penalties for driving too fast and racing cars in the neighboring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit must not be reduced to a few routes: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometers per hour, we would get rid of this problem on motorways," says Martin Rivoir, the transport expert of the SPD parliamentary group.
"The inhibition threshold for speeders would be significantly higher if you were not allowed to travel legally here and there at 200 kilometres per hour and more.".
Rivoir thinks less of education or image campaigns: "Anyone who defies all rules in such a way and puts not only their own lives, but also the lives of other road users at risk, is hardly reachable with reason.".
ADAC calls for stronger police crackdown
For the ADAC, however, this is not enough: "We assume that speeders will not be deterred by the speed limits," says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and Environment at the ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and also tougher controls on the affected routes.
Not infrequently, the high-speed showdown turns into painful and momentous seriousness: Since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people have died nationwide in the races, two of them bystanders in a night-time crash in Stuttgart's city center and one in Gerlingen.
There, two young men are said to have competed in a car race in November.
One of the vehicles came off the road, crashed into a garden wall and remained on its side, the 18-year-old passenger died.
Another 21 people have been injured in the races of the past two years.
However, according to Interior Minister Thomas Strobl, harsher penalties are not necessary: "There is no need for legislative action to sanction illegal motor vehicle races more harshly," says the Interior Ministry paper.

Nuremberg: Unauthorized tuning meeting - police intervene, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and at times over 1000 people took part in a "tuning meeting" on Saturday night in the parking lot of a furniture store.
The police carried out their announcement to intensify their control of such events.
A big tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (July 25, 2020) in Nürnberger Südstadt.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the police of Middle Franconia, an increased volume of vehicles in the area of a large parking lot in Ingolstädter Straße was detected by the Nuremberg traffic police at 22.30.
As a result, the police carried out a variety of vehicle checks.
Only recently, the police had announced that they wanted to take more action against so-called autoposers.
Illegal tuning meeting in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the "scene"
The officers counted about 700 vehicles and about 1,100 people at the top, according to the police.
However, only a small proportion of those present can be assigned to the "autoposer" and tuning scene.
Apparently, most of the scene responded to the police's appeal.
Based on the vehicles and people on site, it can be assumed that these were mainly onlookers.
In addition, the majority of those present adhered to the applicable infection protection regulations, in particular the observance of the minimum distance and the wearing of mouth-nose protection.
The control measures carried out on site were completed by 1: 00 a.m.
In total, the officials found such structural changes in 10 vehicles that the operating license had expired.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No car races
There were no illegal car races.

Employment agency figures: 900 suspected cases of abuse in short-time work
Berlin - According to its own statement, the Federal Employment Agency (BA) is investigating around 900 suspected cases of abuse of short-time work allowances.
"With more than 880,000 companies reporting short-time work, this is extremely low," said Daniel Terzenbach, the board member responsible for operations, to the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.".
When, at the beginning of the corona crisis, a large number of companies suddenly applied for short-time work, BA had to react quickly.

Indications of abuse often come from the employees or unions concerned.
In addition, the BA uses analysis software to identify patterns of abuse.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible wave of insolvency in autumn.
"Will there be significantly more insolvencies than in the previous year?
The assessments differ, but we are preparing ourselves for the eventuality and are already training our employees in the employment agencies to process applications for insolvency money. ".
The figures are still inconspicuous, said Terzenbach.

Austria: Mass tests after corona outbreak
Authorities have responded to a corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist town of St. Wolfgang with hundreds of tests.
The number of confirmed cases rose to 48, according to the state authorities in Linz.
More than 100 results were still pending in the evening.
Many of those infected are young interns in tourism companies, but at least one holidaymaker has also tested positive.
Residents, guests and tourism staff were asked to stay in their accommodation on Saturday evening.
The curfew was set at 11 p.m.
"There are cancellations and cancellations here and there" of bookings, said the head of the Wolfgangsee Tourism Association, Hans Wieser, to the dpa.
Occasional guests had also left early.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist destination in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, around a third of the guests are Germans.
The first infections became public knowledge on Friday.
The head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended on Saturday the behaviour of the interns, who had celebrated in several restaurants and could have become infected there.
"We all enjoyed doing that in our youth," he told radio station 1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The tourism board launched an information campaign to raise awareness among young employees about the dangers of COVID-19.
From Saturday, hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from 15 July were contacted.
The outbreak brings back memories of the Austrian ski and party resort of Ischgl in Tyrol, which was a centre of corona spread throughout Europe in the early stages of the pandemic.

You all know that what I am about to say is true.
The intuition that inequality weakens social cohesion existed even before the French Revolution.
What is new is that we now have evidence, we can compare societies, more equal and more unequal, and see what causes inequality.
I want to show you statistics and explain why they are connected.
Look at what a poor bunch we are.
(Laughter) I would like to start with a paradox.
This shows life expectancy and gross national income - on average in rich countries.
You see that the countries on the right, Norway and the USA for example, are twice as rich as Israel, Greece, Portugal on the left.
And that doesn't change their life expectancy at all.
There is nothing to suggest a connection.
But within societies there are huge social gaps in health across society.
Here, once again, life expectancy.
Here are small areas in England and Wales - the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.
A big difference between the poor and the rest of us.
Even people just below the top are in worse health than those at the top.
So income is very important within individual societies, and none between them.
The explanation for this paradox is that within societies we are dealing with relative income, social position, status - where we are in relation to each other, and how large the gaps between us are.
And when you understand this, you immediately ask yourself: What happens when the differences increase or decrease, when income differences increase or decrease?
And I'll show you that now.
Not with hypothetical data.
Using data from the UN - the same as that used by the World Bank - on the extent of income disparities in rich developed market democracies.
The measure we use, because it is easy to understand and available for download, is how much richer the top 20 percent are than the bottom 20 percent of each country.
You see that in the more equal countries on the left - Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden - the top 20 percent are around 3.4 times as rich as the bottom 20 percent.
But on the other hand - Britain, Portugal, the US, Singapore - the differences are twice as great.
On this scale, we are twice as unequal as some of the other successful market democracies.
Now I'll show you what that does to our societies.
We collected data on problems with social disparities, the problems that are more common at the bottom of the social ladder.
Internationally comparable data on life expectancy, children's math, reading and writing skills, infant mortality and murder rates, the proportion of the population incarcerated, teenage pregnancies, confidence, obesity, mental illnesses - which include drug and alcohol addiction in the standard diagnosis - and social mobility.
We have summarized them in an index.
All with the same weight.
For each country there is a kind of average value of these factors.
And here you see it in relation to the degree of inequality that I have shown you, to which I will come back again and again.
The more unequal countries do worse on all these social problems.
This is an unusually high correlation.
But if you put the same index of health and social problems in relation to GNI per capita, to gross national income, there is nothing left, no correlation.
We were worried that people would think we had only picked the issues that support our argument and constructed this evidence, which is why we also published an article in the British Medical Journal on the UNICEF Index of Child Welfare.
In it, 40 different ingredients were put together by other people.
The index includes whether children can talk to their parents, whether they have books at home, their immunization rates, whether there is bullying at school.
Everything flows in.
Here is the index relative to our inequality values.
Children do worse in unequal societies.
A highly significant relationship.
And again, when you compare the child welfare index with national per capita income, there is no correlation, not even a hint.
All the data I have shown you so far say the same.
The average well-being of our societies no longer depends on national income and economic growth.
These are crucial in poorer countries, but not in the rich developed world.
But the differences between us, where we stand in comparison to each other, has become very important.
I will now show you individual parts of our index.
Here, for example, is trust.
Simply the proportion of the population that believes that most people can be trusted.
The data comes from the World Values Survey.
On the more unequal side, about 15 percent of the population believe that others can be trusted.
But in more equal societies it is up to 60 or 65 percent.
And for the degree of integration into communal life or social capital, there are similarly close links to inequality.
We did all this work twice.
First with the rich, developed countries, and then in a second test field again with the 50 American states - with the same question: do the more unequal states perform worse on all these scales?
Here, trust is correlated with inequality, according to data collected by the US government.
A very similar distribution over a similar range of confidence levels.
The same thing happens here.
Our basic finding is that almost all factors related to trust internationally do the same in the 50 US states, in a separate testing environment.
And this is not just a happy coincidence.
Here are mental illnesses.
The WHO compiled these figures by conducting the same diagnostic interviews with randomly selected test subjects to compare the rates of mental illness in societies.
This is the percentage of the population that was mentally ill last year.
It goes from 8 percent to three times that - entire societies that have rates of mental illness three times higher than others.
And again a high correlation to inequality.
And here violence.
These red dots are American states, the blue triangles are Canadian provinces.
Notice the scale of differences.
It goes from 15 murders per million to 150.
This is the proportion of the population that is in detention.
Here there is about a tenfold difference on the lateral log scale.
It is about 40 to 400 people detained.
This ratio is not primarily due to higher crime rates.
In some places, this is a partial factor.
But the main reason is tougher court rulings.
And more unequal societies tend to stick to the death penalty.
Here are children dropping out of school.
Again, quite big differences.
With devastating consequences in terms of using the talent of the population.
Here is social mobility.
Actually, a measurement of mobility based on income.
The question is: Do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons, or is there no connection between them?
On the more unequal side, fathers' income is much more important -- in Britain, in the US.
And in the Scandinavian countries, the income of fathers is much less decisive.
There is more social mobility.
We like to say - and I know there are many Americans here in the audience - if Americans want to live the American dream, they should go to Denmark.
(Laughter) (Applause) I have just introduced you to a few things.
I could have shown you a lot of other problems.
All these problems are more common at the lower end of the social gradient.
But there are countless problems with social disparities that are worse in more unequal countries - not just a little, but somewhere between 2 and 10 times as common.
Imagine these costs, the human costs.
But I want to come back to the graph in which we summarized everything to show two things.
On the one hand, graph by graph, the countries that do poorly, regardless of the outcome, appear to be the more unequal, and the ones that do better seem to be the Nordic countries and Japan.
So what we see is a general social dysfunction that goes hand in hand with inequality.
This applies not just to one or two things, but to most.
The other very important aspect of this graph you can see below, Sweden and Japan - in many ways very different countries.
The position of women, how much they adhere to the nuclear family, here they are at opposite poles of the rich, developed world.
Another very important difference is how they achieve their greater equality.
In Sweden there are huge differences in earnings which are compensated by taxation, the general welfare state, generous social benefits, etc.
In Japan, it is completely different.
Even before the tax, there are smaller differences in earnings.
There are lower taxes.
A smaller welfare state.
And in our analysis of the American states we find the same contrast.
Some states are successful through redistribution, others are doing well because they have small pre-tax income disparities.
Our conclusion is that it does not matter how you achieve greater equality, as long as you somehow achieve it.
I don't mean perfect equality, I'm talking about something that already exists in rich market democracies.
Another surprising part of the picture is that inequality does not only affect the poor.
Apparently there is some truth in John Donne's "Nobody is an island."
In several studies, one can compare how people in more or less the same countries perform at every level of the social hierarchy.
This is just one example.
Infant mortality.
Some Swedes have kindly classified most of their infant deaths according to the British Register of Socio-Economic Classification.
This is an anachronistic classification according to the professions of fathers, so single parents are kept separately.
But where "low social class" is noted, this means unskilled manual activities.
Then there are the skilled trades in the middle, then the subordinate non-trades, up to the higher professions - doctors, lawyers, executives of larger companies.
You can see that Sweden is better than Britain, across the entire social hierarchy.
The biggest differences are at the bottom of society.
But even at the top, there seems to be a small advantage to living in a more equal society.
We show this in five different datasets that deal with educational success and health in the United States and internationally.
This seems to be the case in general - greater equality matters most at the bottom, but has some advantages even at the top.
But I should say something about what is happening.
I am interested in the psychosocial effects of inequality.
This has to do with feelings of superiority and inferiority, the feeling of being valued or devalued, respected or despised.
And, of course, the feeling of status competition that results from this drives consumerism in our society.
It also leads to status uncertainty.
We care more about how we are judged by others, whether we are seen as attractive, smart, etc.
Social judgments are increasing, and the fear of these judgments is increasing.
Interestingly, there is similar research in social psychology: some people have evaluated 208 different studies in which volunteers were invited to psychological labs to measure their stress hormones and their response to stressful tasks.
What interested them in the evaluation was which types of stress most reliably raised the level of cortisol, the central stress hormone.
And the result was: tasks that posed a threat to social assessment - threats to self-confidence or social status, where others can judge their own performance negatively.
These types of stress have a very specific effect on the physiology of stress.
We have been criticised.
Of course there are people who don't like this and people who find it very amazing.
However, I should tell you that when we are criticised for a targeted selection of our data, we never select specifically for our purposes.
Our absolute principle is that if our data source has data for one of the countries we are looking at, it comes into the analysis.
Our data source determines whether it is reliable data, not us.
Anything else would be bias.
What about other countries?
There are 200 studies on health relative to income and equality in academic peer-reviewed journals.
This is not limited to these countries, it is a simple demonstration.
The same countries, the same scale of inequality, one problem after another.
Why don't we check other factors?
We have shown that per capita income makes no difference.
And, of course, others have used more sophisticated methods to examine poverty and education, among others.
What about causality?
A correlation does not prove causality.
We spent a lot of time on that.
In fact, people know the causal relationships very well in some of these results.
The big news in our understanding of the drivers of long-term health in the rich developed world is how much chronic social stress strains the immune system, the cardiovascular system.
Or, for example, the reason why violence is more prevalent in more unequal societies is because people are sensitive to being despised.
To deal with this, we need to clarify what happens after tax and what happens before tax.
We need to limit income, the bonus culture income at the top.
We have to hold our bosses accountable to the employees as best we can.
But the takeaway message is that we can improve the actual quality of human life by fixing the income gap between us.
Suddenly there is a lever for the psychosocial well-being of entire societies, and that is very exciting.
Thank you.
(Applause)

Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualified for Champions League
London (dpa) - The English football record champions Manchester United returns to the Champions League after a year's absence.
The Red Devils secured third place in the Premier League with a 2-0 (0-0) win over direct rivals Leicester City on the final day of the Premier League.
The Foxes now have to content themselves with the Europa League, because Chelsea FC passed by and qualified for the premier class in fourth place.
In the fight against relegation, Aston Villa could cheer.
Manchester United took the lead through a penalty kick from Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in added time, Jesse Lingard (90th + 8) scored the final score.
Chelsea, FC Bayern's opponent in the Champions League round of 16, won 2-0 (2-0) against Wolverhampton Wanderers thanks to Mason Mount (45th + 1) and Olivier Giroud (45th + 4).
"That means a lot to me," said coach Frank Lampard, who is also in the FA Cup final against Arsenal in his first season as Chelsea coach.
Chelsea's win over Wolverhampton also benefited Tottenham Hotspur, who moved past Wolves with a meager 1-1 (1-0) at Crystal Palace to start sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa won the long-distance duel with Watford FC and AFC Bournemouth, but had to shiver for a long time at West Ham United.
The late lead of Jack Grealish (84th) immediately equalized Andrey Yarmolenko (85th).
But the 1: 1 (0: 0) was enough, because Watford lost 2: 3 (1: 3) at Arsenal.
The club, which sacked three coaches during the season, is relegated after five premier league years.
Just like Bournemouth, which could not save itself by a 3: 1 (2: 1) at FC Everton.
In the end, one point was missing.
Liverpool FC, who have been English champions since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3-1 (1-1) win at Newcastle United.
99 points is the highest the Reds have ever scored in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team narrowly missed the points record in English football.
Manchester City holds the record with 100 points in the 2017 / 18 season.
After the Newcastle lead in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) turned the game on Sunday for Liverpool.
"It has been an extraordinary season for this wonderful club," goal scorer van Dijk said after the game, "that should spur us on to defend the title.
It will be hard. ".
The Premier League bosses should also be happy in the end.
Football operations in England were suspended from 13 March to 17 June due to the coronavirus crisis.
In the meantime, there was even discussion about prematurely stopping or holding the remaining games on neutral ground.

I want to show you today how we will make things in the future.
I believe that our buildings and machines will soon assemble, multiply and repair themselves.
I will show you what I consider to be today's production methods and then compare them with some natural systems.
In the current manufacturing industry, we have skyscrapers - two and a half years construction time, half to a million parts, quite complex, new and exciting technologies of steel, concrete, glass.
We have exciting machines that take us into space - five years construction time, two and a half million parts.
On the other hand, if you look at natural systems, you find proteins that have two million types and can fold in ten microseconds, or DNA with three billion base pairs that can be copied in about an hour.
So there is all this complexity in our natural systems, but they are extremely efficient, much more efficient than anything we can make, far more complex than anything we can build.
They are much more energy-efficient.
They almost never make mistakes.
And they are durable because they can repair themselves.
So there are many interesting things to discover in natural systems.
And if we manage to incorporate this into our built environment, then we have an exciting potential for new construction methods.
And I believe that the key is self-assembly.
If we want to use self-assembly in our physical environment, I think there are four key factors.
The first is that we need to decipher all the complexity of the things we want to build - our buildings and machines.
And we have to translate that into simple sequences - the DNA of how our buildings work.
Then we need programmable parts that can pull this sequence and use it for folding or reconfiguring.
We need activation energy so that our parts from the program can flip up.
And we need a kind of redundancy for error correction, so that what we want to build actually occurs.
I will show you some projects that my colleagues and I are working on at MIT, so that self-assembly can be realized in the future.
The first two are MacroBot and DeciBot.
These projects are large-scale, reconfigurable robots - two-and-a-half to four-meter-long proteins.
They are equipped with electromechanical devices, sensors.
You decode what you want to fold into a sequence of angles - minus 120, minus 120, 0, 0, 120, minus 120 - something like that; a sequence of angles, or turns, and you send that sequence through the chain.
Each unit picks up its message - minus 120 - it rotates accordingly, checks whether it has arrived, and forwards it to the neighboring unit.
These are the brilliant scientists, engineers and designers who worked on this project.
And I think it makes one thing really clear: Is this really scalable?
I mean, thousands of dollars, many hours of work to create this two-and-a-half meter high robot.
Can we really scale it up? Can we really embed robotics in every part?
The next project questions this and looks at the passive nature or the passive attempt to make reconfiguration programmable.
But it goes a step further and tries to make actual calculations possible.
It basically integrates the most fundamental component of computing, the digital logic gate, directly into the parts.
This is a NAND gate.
You have a tetrahedron, which is the gate that will do the calculations, and you have two input tetrahedrons.
One represents the input of the user while creating the blocks.
The other is from the previous component that was arranged.
And then it delivers an output in three-dimensional space.
This means that the user can enter what the components should do.
It performs calculations based on what it has done before and what the user asks of it.
And now it begins to move in three-dimensional space - up and down.
On the left, the input 1,1 corresponds to the output 0, which goes down.
On the right side, the input 0,0 corresponds to the output 1 that goes up.
What this really means is that our structures now contain the plans of what we want to build.
So they have all the information about what has been built.
This means that we can achieve a form of self-replication.
In this case, I call it self-guided replication because the structure contains the exact blueprints.
If errors occur, a part can be replaced.
All the local information is integrated to show how to fix it.
So you could have something that climbs and reads and delivers an output of one to one.
It is directly integrated; there are no instructions from the outside.
The last project I'm going to show is called Biased Chains, and it's probably the most exciting example of self-assembling systems we have at the moment.
It takes up the ability to reconfigure and program and creates a completely passive system.
Basically, you have a chain of elements.
Each element is completely identical and they are polarized.
Every chain, or every element, wants to turn to the right or to the left.
So while you're putting the chain together, you're basically programming it.
Each unit is told to turn to the right or to the left.
When you shake the chain, it folds into a configuration that you have programmed in - in this case a spiral, or in this case two cubes next to each other.
So you can basically program any possible three-dimensional form - or one-dimensional, two-dimensional - completely passively into this chain.
What does this tell us about the future?
I think it tells us that there are possibilities of self-assembly, replication and repair in our physical structures, our buildings and machines.
There are new ways of programming in these parts.
And this gives rise to new possibilities for IT.
We will have spatial programming.
Imagine if our buildings, bridges, machines, all our components could perform calculations.
This would mean parallel and distributed computing power, new design possibilities.
So there is an exciting potential for this.
I think that these projects that I have shown here are only a tiny step towards this future, if we implement these new technologies for a new, self-creating world.
Thank you.

Arrests and violence at demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against Prime Minister Netanyahu are becoming increasingly violent.
During the night there were violent clashes.
The Israeli police took violent action against participants in a demonstration against the right-wing conservative Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Sunday night.
Twelve people have been arrested for participating in riots, said police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld.
The police used water cannons to disperse the rally.
According to media reports, around 6,000 people had gathered near Netanyahu's official residence on Saturday evening.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu's handling of the corona crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew horns and called on Netanyahu to resign.
Participants in a counter-demonstration supporting Netanyahu were also arrested, the news website "ynet" reported.
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the prime minister's private villa in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man has been arrested near Tel Aviv on suspicion of spraying pepper spray on roadside demonstrators from a moving car, according to police.
Another man was arrested after a knife attack on a demonstrator in the south of the country.
The demonstrator was slightly injured in the neck.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv there have recently been several demonstrations against Netanyahu.
The rallies accompany the corruption trial against the head of government.
Recently, Netanyahu has also been criticized for his handling of the corona crisis.
Among other things, he is accused of premature relaxation and a lack of preparation for a second corona wave.

North Korea seals off border town after suspected corona case
North Korea has so far seen its own measures to ward off the coronavirus as a "shining success.".
The country is now reporting a suspected case for the first time.
Due to a first official case of suspected corona in the country, North Korea has completely sealed off a major city for fear of a catastrophe.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defenses in the past six months, "the malignant virus may have been introduced into the country," the state media reported.
A state of emergency has been declared for the region around the border town of Kaesong.
The Communist leadership declared the highest level of alert.
If the suspected case is confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the isolated country.
North Korea said it had not registered a single infection and described its defenses as a "shining success.".
The information was doubted abroad.
Symptoms of the disease were reportedly detected in a "runaway" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
The person defected to South Korea three years ago and has now returned across the border.
Initially, there was no confirmation from South Korea of the border crossing within the four-kilometer-wide and largely still-mined military buffer zone.
South Korea's military, however, acknowledged the possibility of an illegal border crossing into North Korea as high, according to reports by the national news agency Yonhap.
Investigations were underway on some people.
North Korea said it called an emergency meeting of the Labor Party's Politburo, chaired by leader Kim Jong Un, on Saturday over the suspected case.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive disaster.".
As a preventive measure, Kim had already ordered on Friday to "completely blockade Kaesong and isolate every district and the region from others," it added.
The person concerned and all people in Kaesong who had contact with her were quarantined.
The party's central military commission is to investigate the "runaway case" as well as the conduct of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose severe punishment.
An estimated 300,000 people live in Kaesong.

Tension ahead of council meeting: City-East and noise protection to be discussed before big summer break
"In addition to environmental issues, the committee members will also vote on the development plan for the major city centre development east project," reads rather casually in the middle section of the municipal press release for the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, 28 July, at 4.30 p.m. in the Great Hall of the CongressCentrum Pforzheim.
Above all, the revaluation of the eastern city is controversial until the end.
The majorities for this are narrow, most recently in individual committees, depending on their attendance, even negative.
An appeal from the economy (construction, real estate, trade and IT) not to let the project, developed by the citizens and then by the administration and the municipal council, now fail after almost ten years of preparation, criticized project opponent Reinhard Klein as "extra-parliamentary opposition," "clueless," "speculation," "denigration" and "deliberate false statements.".
"Everyone thinks they know better," says Klein, who has been a member of the municipal council for a year as the only representative of the Pforzheim citizens' list.
In fact, after reading the contracts, he is in this position: "I know what I am talking about.".
Contrary to statements by the city administration, the Technical Town Hall is to be redeveloped for 8.5 million euros after subsidies, of which Klein is convinced that it exists.
The city will develop very differently than predicted by the town hall and by the supporters from the business community.
Shaping the city by his own efforts and not by an investor: This is his plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP / FW / UB / LED faction, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
Essentially, it also provides for the redevelopment of the Technical Town Hall, keeping the Schloßberg open, renting the Ex-Thale for administrative space and a smaller-scale redesign of the city centre, ideally with local authorities.
Environmental issues play a central role
Environmental issues will also play a central role.
Among other things, the municipal council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the population of Pforzheim from noise pollution caused by road traffic, including speed reductions in many cases.
In a press release, the local transport club Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of the fact that this has to happen, because they have contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus noise by neglecting the regular bus service with thinned out clocks and by little commitment to bicycle traffic, according to the VCD.
The municipal council also votes on the city's participation in the Energy and Climate Protection Agency Pforzheim / Enzkreis.
In addition, the agenda includes the accession to the Climate Protection Pact of the State of Baden-Württemberg, the reassessment of parental contributions in the municipal day care centers and the application for admission to the federal smart city funding.

Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with much delay
With a delay of almost half a year, Tim Zimmermann will start his debut season in the ADAC GT Masters on 31 July.
Before the league of supercars can start regular operation, the first test drives were now due.
For Zimmermann, it was all about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 better.
For a long time, the Corona crisis prevented Tim Zimmermann from taking his first business trip in the new Lamborghini Huracan of Grasser Racing.
This was now possible under special hygiene conditions.
The 23-year-old from Langenargen completed his first laps at the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his debut in the GT3 car.
"There are already a few things that are different from the Porsche from the previous season," says Zimmermann.
"With the ABS, for example, you have to go into corners differently.
But it was really a lot of fun. ".
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite his only 25 years, the Dutchman is already experienced in GT racing and was able to help his new team-mate in many ways.
"I'm not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series brings new challenges," says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I get along brilliantly and we have also made enormous progress from session to session at the Lausitzring.".
Right there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also hold its first race.
From 31 July, the 33 supercars will race through Lusatia.
But Zimmermann, who is one of 15 series newcomers, knows the track.
In 2015, he was a guest at the Motodrom.
"It worked quickly and I didn't have to get used to the track," says Zimmermann, who is competing for the Friedrichshafen-based racing community Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has many fast passages that you have to hit optimally in order to be fast.".
How fast Zimmermann really is will be revealed in two weeks.
"Of course, the teams play a bit of poker in the tests," he says.
"Ultimately, however, we are very satisfied and are looking forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring.".
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a packed calendar.
There are seven races scheduled until the beginning of November.
The current situation is that no spectators will be allowed - but there is a celebrity guest.

British transport minister caught cold by quarantine decision
The British government's decision to quarantine holidaymakers in Spain for two weeks after their return has caught the country's transport minister cold, according to press reports.
Grant Shapps is currently on holiday in Spain, of all places, while his colleagues at home decided on the measure on Saturday.
Due to the rising corona numbers in Spain, the cabinet in London removed the country from the list of countries from which entry without quarantine conditions is possible.
The new rule will apply from today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to quarantine after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But the scheme will only apply to those who are just on holiday from Saturday, August 1, and has not been introduced overnight.
Incidentally, Spain is still considered one of the "safe countries" in Austria for which no quarantine is required in Austria.
"Many ministers must have known in advance that there was a possibility of a quarantine being imposed on holidaymakers in Spain," commented Labour MP Diane Abbot.
"But apparently no one bothered to tell Grant Shapps.".

Do you know how many types of flowering plants there are?
A quarter of a million - that is the number of known species - a quarter of a million species of flowering plants.
And blossoms are real devils.
Plants have great difficulty in producing them.
They require an enormous amount of energy and raw materials.
Why are they making this effort?
The answer to this, of course, as to so much in the world: sex.
I know what you're thinking of when you look at these images.
And the answer to why sexual reproduction is so important -- there are many other ways for plants to reproduce.
Take offshoots; they can have sex with themselves, so to speak; they can pollinate themselves.
But they actually have to spread their genes to mix them with other genes so they can occupy ecological niches.
This is how evolution works.
Plants pass on this information via pollen.
Some of you may have seen some of these images before.
As I always say, everyone would have to have a scanning electron microscope at home to see them.
There are as many different types of pollen as there are flowering plants.
And this is very useful for forensics and so on.
Most of the pollen that causes hay fever comes from plants that use the wind to spread their pollen, which is a very inefficient process, which is why so much of it ends up in our noses.
Because the plants eject very large quantities, hoping that the male sex cells that are in the pollen will just accidentally hit another flower.
All grasses, i.e. all cereals and most trees transport pollen through the wind.
However, most species use insects for their purposes, and this is the smarter way, as it requires less pollen.
The insects and other species can bring the pollen directly to their destination.
We are of course aware of the relationship between insects and plants.
This is a symbiotic relationship, and whether it's flies, birds or bees, they also benefit from it, usually through the nectar.
This symbiosis has led to some wonderful adaptations - the hummingbird warmer is a beautiful adaptation.
The plant benefits from the fact that the hummingbird spreads the pollen.
Plants have developed small airstrips for bees that otherwise cannot find their way.
On many plants there are markings that resemble other insects.
These are the anthers of a lily, a very clever construction. When an unsuspecting insect lands on it, the bags flip up and hit the insect on the back, where the pollen gets stuck and is taken to other plants.
This is an orchid that looks like it has a mouth, forcing the insects to crawl out and get covered in pollen.
There are at least 20,000 orchid species - an impressive variety.
And they have all kinds of tricks in store.
They need to attract pollinators to help them.
This orchid, known from the research of Charles Darwin, who made a great thesis when he saw it, you see a very long nectar tube coming down from the orchid.
And what insects have to do there in the middle of the flower - they have to put their little proboscis in there and down the whole nectar tube to get the nectar.
And when Darwin saw this flower he said, "Something must have developed in parallel."
And indeed, here is this insect.
Normally it rolls the trunk, but in its stretched form it looks like this.
You can imagine that if nectar is so valuable and expensive for the plant to produce and attracts many pollinators, then it is like human sex, people begin to deceive.
They say, "I have nectar, do you want to come and get it?"
This is a plant.
This is a plant that insects in South Africa simply love, and they have developed a long proboscis to get the nectar.
And this is an imitator,
a plant that copies the original.
And here is the fly with a long proboscis that has not received any nectar from the imitator, because the imitator, contrary to what the fly expects, has no nectar at all.
Not only did the fly not get any nectar, it also has - if you look very closely, at the head of the proboscis you can see pollen that it would have transferred to other plants if only a botanist had not come by and glued it on blue paper.
(Laughter) Deception runs through the whole plant kingdom.
These black dots on the flower, they look to us like black dots, but for male insects of certain species they look like two females that are very hot.
(Laughter) And when the insect lands there, it picks up pollen, which it brings to other plants, and if you look at the "Every household should have one" electron microscope image, you see that there are certain three-dimensional patterns.
It probably not only looks good for the insect, but also feels good.
And these electron microscope images - here one of an orchid imitating an insect - show that different parts of the shape have different colors and seemingly different surfaces, and for the perception of an insect, the textures are very, very different.
This plant has developed the imitation of a shiny metallic surface, as seen on some beetles.
And under the electron microscope, you can see that this surface is very different from the one we have looked at so far.
Sometimes the whole plant imitates an insect, even in our perception.
I think it looks like a flying animal.
It's a wonderful thing.
This one is clever. It's called Obsidium.
I sometimes see them as insidious.
For certain bees, it looks like another, particularly aggressive bee, so it flies there and hits it on the head several times to drive it away and of course takes in a lot of pollen.
At the same time, this plant imitates another orchid that provides rich food for insects.
But this one has nothing for them.
So she cheats on two levels - fabulous.
(Laughter) Here we see the cananga tree, an ingredient in many perfumes.
I smelled one on someone earlier.
The flowers do not have to be so colorful.
They send a fantastic spectrum of scents to all insects.
This one doesn't smell so good.
This is a flower that really smells very hideous and that has evolved to mimic carrion.
Therefore, flies love them.
They fly in and pollinate them.
This is a Helicodiceros, also known as "dead horse.".
I don't know how a dead horse smells, but the plant probably hits it quite well.
It is really terrible.
And blowflies can't hold back.
They fly in all the way to the back
and lay their eggs there, thinking it is carrion, without realizing that there is no food for the eggs, which die because of it, but the plant benefits from it, because the fly full of pollen flies on again and pollinates the next flower - fantastic.
This is Arum maculatum, the speckled arum stick.
I photographed him in Dorset last week.
It warms up to about 15 ° above ambient temperature - fascinating.
And if you look inside the plant, there is a kind of barrier behind the inflorescences. Flies are attracted by the heat, which creates volatile chemicals, and are then trapped in the bottom of the container.
They drink the wonderful nectar and are sticky afterwards.
At night they get a pollen shower and then the bristles that we saw above sag and give way to the mosquitoes that are full of pollen - great thing.
If you think that's great, now comes one of my favorites.
This is the Philodendron Selloum.
If someone from Brazil is here, you will know the plant.
It is really fascinating.
This type of phallus there is about 30cm long.
And it does something that no other plant I know does, namely when it flowers. There in the middle are the inflorescences - for about 2 days it has a metabolism very similar to that of mammals.
Instead of feeding on starch, which is the food of plants, it takes something similar to brown adipose tissue and burns it so quickly that the fat burning rate, the metabolism, is equivalent to that of a small cat.
This is twice the energy production of a hummingbird in relation to its weight - incredibly impressive.
But he does something else that is unusual.
It not only warms up to 43 to 44 ° C for about 2 days, but maintains a constant temperature.
It can regulate its temperature and thus keep it constant.
They ask themselves, "Why is he doing this?"
As you can guess, there are some bugs that love to mate at this temperature.
And they fly in and get going.
(Laughter) And the plant pours pollen on them, and they fly on and pollinate.
What a wonderful thing.
The typical pollinator for us is an insect, but in the tropics many birds and butterflies also pollinate.
And many tropical flowers are red and we think that's because birds and butterflies look similar to us and therefore can see the color red very well.
If you look at the spectrum of birds and humans, we see red, green and blue so this spectrum here.
Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet and different levels of ultraviolet.
So something that goes beyond our spectrum.
And I hear you ask, "Wouldn't it be great if we could see that too?"
Of course we can.
So what does an insect see?
Last week I photographed this sun rose in Dorset.
As you can see, these are small yellow flowers, small yellow flowers everywhere.
And this is how they look in visible light.
This is what it looks like when you take out the red.
Most bees do not see red.
And then I photographed with ultraviolet filters and exposed the special ultraviolet frequencies for a very, very long time and that came out.
And that's a fantastic target.
We don't know exactly what bees see, just like you don't know what I see when I say "This is red.".
We cannot see into the thoughts of insects or other people.
But the contrast will be something like that. It stands out against the background.
Here is another small flower - different range of ultraviolet frequencies, other filters similar to pollinators.
And that is what they would see.
If you now think all yellow flowers have this property - no flower was harmed for this image; it was only attached to the tripod, not killed - but under ultraviolet light it looks like this.
And that could serve as the basis of a sunscreen, because sunscreens absorb UV light.
The substances in the plant could be helpful.
Finally, we have an evening primrose that Bjorn Rorslett sent me from Norway - fantastic hidden patterns.
I love the idea of hidden things.
I think there is something poetic about it, and that is that these images were taken with UV filters, filters that are mainly used by astronomers to photograph Venus - more specifically, its nebulae.
This is the main purpose of these filters.
Venus is the goddess of love and fertility, and that in turn is the story of flowers.
And flowers not only show great efforts to attract pollinators, they also manage to make us plant large fields full of them and give them to each other at births and deaths, and especially at weddings, which, if you think about it, are the moment when the exchange of genetic material from one organism to another is determined.
Thank you.

FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start of the hot preparation phase for the Champions League began with a setback for double winner FC Bayern.
After a short holiday and a few days of training, Hansi Flick, who has recovered "reasonably well," already has to consider after the first team training how he can rebuild his successful defense after the injury of world champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who has the third most minutes behind captain Manuel Neuer and midfielder Joshua Kimmich, suffered a ligament injury to his left foot and is in danger of missing crucial premier class duels.
In Munich's dirty weather, the right-back broke off a training game and was driven off the course with a golf cart.

The 24-year-old is unlikely to be able to play in the second leg against Chelsea on 8 August, but can hope for the final tournament starting on 12 August in Lisbon.
The Bavarians do not want to be stopped by the mishap from the training on Sunday.
In his personal triple formula, Flick named the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on the way to Portugal's capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration should show his victory-hungry title collectors in the ideally following 28 days until the premier class final on 23 August.
"We have mastered the compulsory tasks with the championship and trophy simply outstandingly.
Now we have to create something special, "said Flick.
Until the Munich team can deal with the final tournament and before that a training camp in the Algarve, the obligation to play in the last 16 against FC Chelsea is pending.
After the 3: 0 in the first leg before the Corona break, the Londoners should not become a Bayern nightmare again in the home arena as in the lost "Finale dahoam" in 2012.
"We have to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and gain confidence with a good game, "demanded Flick.
A test for the tuning-up is on Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn his stars, who had 13 days vacation after the double, to a unique August.
He welcomed 31 players to Säbener Strasse, including the new players around high-end shopping Leroy Sané, who met all his new colleagues on the pitch for the first time after his move from Manchester City.
"Leroy, like all newcomers, has fitted in well," Flick said.
But instead of talking about the new season, when Sané & Co. are no longer just allowed to train, Flick preferred to talk about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of individual and small-group training, the Londoners are now training in team strength, who, unlike the Flick ensemble, are in the rhythm of the game.
After that, Munich could face a quarter-final against FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, in the semi-finals Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are possible opponents.
A path to the finals in Lisbon "is not that easy," stressed the head coach, who can rely on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training from Tuesday.
The World Cup record scorer Klose and Flick know from many a joint tournament preparation, what is particularly important in the 0-to-100 tuning.
Working with his current team is "a pleasure," praised Flick.
The "focus on winning" is an impressive trait of his team.

Greta Thunberg: Evil eye against Donald Trump went around the world

New York City - Over the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has attracted attention with her tireless commitment to the "Fridays For Future" movement.
