We will not know.
You could have known.
Please all be aware of a very simple fact for a moment: Pretty much everything we know about the universe, we know through light.
We can stand on Earth and look into the night sky and look at stars with our naked eyes.
The sun burns our peripheral vision.
We see light reflected from the moon.
and in the time that has passed since Galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope at the celestial bodies, the universe known to us has traveled to us as visible light, traversing immeasurable ages of cosmic history.
With the help of all our modern telescopes, we have been able to study it all: this impressive silent film of the universe, this series of snapshots that go back to the Big Bang.
But the universe is not a silent movie, because the universe is not silent.
I want to convince you that the universe has a soundtrack and that this soundtrack is played in space itself: because space can swing like a drum.
It can sound a kind of sound recording that can be heard throughout the universe; of some of the most dramatic events when they happened.
Now we would like to add a sonic component to the wonderful visual arrangement we have of the universe.
And even though we've never heard the sounds of the universe before, over the next few years we should slowly turn up the volume control for what's happening out there.
Out of this ambition to capture songs of the universe, we focus our interest on black holes and their inherent promise. Black holes hammer against space-time like wooden malice on a drum. They have a very characteristic sound that I would like to play to you; or our idea of what this song will sound like.
One day we may see a shadow cast by a black hole against a bright background, but so far we have not succeeded.
And yet you can hear black holes, even if they are invisible. The reason for this is that they play on space-time like a drum.
We owe the idea that the universe sounds like a drum to Albert Einstein, to whom we owe so much.
Einstein realized that if space were empty, if the universe were empty, it would have to look like this image, just without this helpful grid.
But if we were moving through space in free fall, even without this helpful grid, then maybe we could paint it ourselves. Because we would realize that we are moving along straight lines, along undisguised, straight paths through the universe.
Einstein also realized (and that's what it's all about) that when you bring energy or mass into the universe, it bends the universe. If a body in free fall passed the sun, say, it would be distorted, along the natural lines of curvature in space.
This is Einstein's great General Theory of Relativity.
Even light is bent along these paths.
And a body can be bent so much that it enters an orbit around the sun, like the Earth, or like the moon in Earth's orbit.
These are natural curvatures in space.
What Einstein didn't know was this: if you took the sun and squeezed it into a ball six kilometers in diameter, if you took something with millions of times the mass of the Earth and compressed it into six kilometers, then you would create a black hole; a body of such density that light that would pass too close to it could never escape. It would be a black shadow in front of the universe.
But Einstein thought of black holes as a mathematical curiosity throughout his life.
He didn't believe they really existed.
He was convinced that nature would protect us from its creation.
It would take decades for the term "black hole" to be coined and for people to understand that black holes are astrophysical bodies. In fact, they are the lifeless state of extremely dense stars that collapse in a horrific catastrophe at the end of their lives.
Our Sun, on the other hand, will not end up as a black hole.
It's just not big enough for that.
But we did a little thought experiment, just as Einstein liked to do. Let's imagine that we compress the sun to six kilometers in diameter and bring a tiny Earth into its orbit, say 30 km away from this black sun.
This earth would shine by itself, because since the sun would then have disappeared, there would be no other light source) so we let our little earth shine by itself.
We could put the Earth into a carefree orbit about 30 km away from the crushed black hole.
This crushed black hole would be about the size of Manhattan.
It would pour into the Hudson a little more before it destroyed the Earth.
But that's about what we're talking about.
We're talking about something you can squeeze together until it's half the size of Manhattan.
Now we bring the Earth very close, up to about 30 km, and see how it moves in a completely perfect orbit around the black hole.
There's a kind of myth that black holes devour everything in the universe, but in fact you have to get very close to them to fall into it.
But what is particularly impressive from our point of view is the fact that we can always see the Earth.
It cannot hide behind the black hole.
The light that comes from the earth, some of it falls into it, but some is scattered and returns to us.
So you can't hide anything behind a black hole.
If this is the battlestar Galactica and you are fighting against the Cylons, then you better not hide behind the black hole.
They can see them.
So our sun will not collapse into a black hole, its mass is not sufficient for this. But there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
If any of them wiped out the Milky Way, it would look like this.
We would see a shadow of the black hole, against the background of billions of stars of the Milky Way galaxy and its glowing dust orbits.
Should we fall on this black hole, we would see all the light that would be bent around it, and we could even enter the shadow without noticing that something unusual is happening.
It would be bad if we tried to ignite our engines and flee, because we couldn't, any more than the light can escape.
But even if the black hole is dark from the outside, it is not dark inside, because all the light of the galaxy could fall behind us.
And although due to a phenomenon of relativity (called time dilation), our clocks seemed to go slower relative to galactic time, it would look as if the evolution of the galaxy had accelerated and would shoot at us just before we were crushed to death by the black hole.
It would be like a near-death experience to see the light at the end of the tunnel. However, it would be a comprehensive death experience.
(Laughter) And you couldn't tell anyone about the light at the end of the tunnel.
Now we have never seen such a shadow of a black hole, but black holes can be heard, even if they are invisible.
Please imagine an astrophysically realistic situation. Imagine two black holes that have spent a long life together.
Perhaps once it was stars that collapsed into two black holes, each with a mass ten times the size of that of the Sun.
We now squeeze them together to a diameter of 60 km.
They can rotate several hundred times per second.
At the end of their lives, they orbit each other almost at the speed of light.
You can travel thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second. And while they do that, they not only bend the space, but they leave in their wake a sound of space, a real wave of space-time.
Space contracts and expands as it pours out of these black holes and hammers into the universe.
And they travel out into the cosmos at the speed of light.
We owe this computer simulation to a relativity working group of NASA Goddard.
It took almost 30 years for someone to solve this problem.
This was one of those groups.
Here we see two black holes orbiting each other, again with the helpful, painted lines.
Maybe you can see – it's a bit indistinct – but when you see the red waves coming out, these are gravitational waves.
They actually represent the sound of sounding space and will emerge from these black holes at the speed of light as they become quieter and quieter and eventually merge into a spinning, silent black hole.
If you were close enough, the sound of contracted and expanding space would roar in your ears.
You would literally be able to hear the sound.
Of course, your head would also be pressed and stretched, which would be quite unpleasant, which is why you would also have trouble understanding what was happening.
But I would like to show you what sounds we would predict here.
This is from my research group – a slightly less glamorous computer model.
Imagine that a lighter black hole falls into a very heavy black hole.
What you hear is the sound with which the light black hole hammers into space every time it passes close to it.
When it removes again, it is a little too quiet.
But it hits like a mallet and literally smashes the universe, makes it swing like a drum.
We can predict what that will sound like.
We know that if it falls into it, it will be faster and louder.
And finally, we hear the little guy fall into the big guy.
I've never heard this so loud – it's really much more dramatic.
At home it sounds rather disappointing.
More like ding, ding, ding.
This is another sound from my group.
No, I'm not going to show you pictures, because black holes don't leave any helpful ink traces. Space has no colorful, painted lines.
But if you're drifting around in space during a space vacation and you'd hear this here, then you should make sure you get away.
(Laughter) You should really get away from this noise.
Both black holes are moving.
Both black holes are getting closer to each other.
In this case, at first they vibrate very strongly.
And then they merge.
This chirping is typical of the merging of two black holes, so that it chirps at the end.
This is our idea of what we would see.
Luckily, we are at a safe distance here in Long Beach, California.
But it is very likely that two black holes have merged somewhere in the universe.
And it is just as certain that space oscillates around us, having probably taken millions of light years, or traveled to us at the speed of light for a million years.
But the sound is far too quiet for us to ever hear.
Experiments are being carried out on Earth with great zeal, one of which is called LIGO – the aim is to detect deviations in the way space pulls together and expands again, deviations of the order of magnitude smaller than an atomic nucleus over a distance of four kilometers.
It is an incredibly ambitious project and its sensitivity will be further developed in the coming years – in order to be able to perceive this here.
There will also be a mission for space, which will hopefully start within the next ten years. Her name is LISA.
LISA will be able to see huge black holes, black holes with millions or billions of times the density of the Sun.
In this image from the Hubble Telescope, we see two galaxies.
They look as if they are frozen in a hug.
Each one probably contains a huge black hole inside.
But they are not frozen. They merge with each other.
These two black holes collide and become one over the course of billions of years.
Our human perceptual ability is not able to grasp a song of such a length of time.
But LISA could see the final stage of two giant black holes, at an earlier point in the history of the universe, the last 15 minutes before they merge.
And it's not just about black holes, but also about all the big disturbances in the universe – and the biggest of them all is the Big Bang.
When the term was coined, it was meant contemptuously – "Who believes in a Big Bang, a Big Bang?"
This animation by friends of mine at Proton Studios shows an exterior view of the Big Bang.
We never really want to try that; we never want to be inside the universe because you can never be outside the universe.
So imagine you're in the Big Bang.
It's everywhere, all around you, and space wafts and swings completely uncontrollably.
14 billion years pass, but this song still resounds around us.
Galaxies form and generations of stars are born in these galaxies. And around one of these stars, at least a single one, orbits a habitable planet.
And here we sit and work like crazy on these experiments, doing calculations and writing computer code.
Imagine that a billion years ago, two black holes collided.
Their song has been sounding through space ever since, all the time.
We didn't even exist at that time.
It's getting closer and closer – 40,000 years ago we were still painting cave paintings.
If it's the Big Bang we're recording, it would sound like it.
It is literally the epitome of noise.
It's white noise, it's such a chaotic sound.
But it's all around us, probably at least if it hasn't been wiped out by another process in the universe.
When we record it, it will sound like music to our ears because it will be a soft echo, an echo of the moment of our creation, our visible universe.
So within the next two years, we'll be able to make the soundtrack a little louder and output the universe as a sound image.
But if we can capture those very earliest moments, it will bring us much closer to understanding the Big Bang, which in turn will bring us closer to some of the most complex, elusive questions.
If we played a film of the universe backwards, we would know that there had been a Big Bang in the past and we could even perceive the cacophony of its sound. But was our Big Bang the only Big Bang?
I think we need to ask the question: Has something like this ever happened?
Will it happen again?
I think, in the spirit of the challenge that TED presents – to re-ignite amazement – we can ask questions, at least at this last minute, that might otherwise elude us forever.
But we have to ask ourselves: Is it possible that our universe is just an offshoot of a larger story?
Or is it possible that we are just an offshoot of a multiverse – each offshoot with its own Big Bang in its past – maybe some of them have drum-playing black holes, others may not – in some there may be intelligent life, in others not – not in our past, not in our future, but in some way fundamentally connected to us?
So we have to ask ourselves: If there is a multiverse, do living beings exist in another fragment of that multiverse?
These are my creatures of the multiverse.
Are there other living beings in this multiverse that are concerned about us and their own origins?
And if they exist, I can imagine that they are like us, that they calculate and write computer codes, build instruments, try to make out the most distant sound of their origin and wonder who else is out there.
Thank you. Thank you.

Many people believe that driving is an activity reserved only for people who can see.
A blind person driving a car safely and independently has until now been considered an impossible task.
Hello, my name is Dennis Hong, and we want to give freedom and independence to blind people by building a vehicle for the blind.
Therefore, before I talk about this car for the blind, let me talk briefly about another project I worked on and was called the DARBA Urban Challenge.
This was about building a robotized car that can drive itself.
You press Start, no one touches anything, and it can reach its destination completely automatically.
So in 2007, our team won half a million dollars by finishing third in the competition.
Around this time, the National Federation of the Blind, or NFB, challenged the Investigative Committee to produce a car that could be driven safely and independently by a blind person.
We decided to give it a try, because we thought, hey, how difficult this can be.
We already have an automatic vehicle.
We put a blind person in and it's done, right?
(Laughter) We couldn't have been wrong anymore.
What the National Federation of the Blind (NFB) wanted was not a vehicle that drives blind people around, but a vehicle where a blind person can make active decisions and drive.
So we had to throw everything away and start all over again.
Therefore, in order to test this crazy idea, we developed a small buggy prototype vehicle to test its feasibility.
And in the summer of 2009, we invited dozens of young blind people from all over the country and gave them the opportunity to take a spin.
It was an absolutely amazing experience.
But the problem with these cars was that it was designed so that it could only be driven in a controlled environment, a level, traffic-free parking lot, and that even the lanes were highlighted with red guide cones.
Therefore, with this success, we decided to take the next big step, to develop a true car that can be driven on real roads.
So how does it work?
Well, it's a pretty complicated system, but let me try to explain it, and maybe I can simplify it.
Well, we have three steps.
We have perception, computation and non-visual interfaces.
Well, it is clear that the driver cannot see, so the system must be able to perceive the environment and collect information for the driver.
For this, we use an initial measuring unit.
It measures acceleration, angular acceleration, like a human ear, an inner ear.
We merge the information with a GPS unit to get approximately the position of the car.
We also use two cameras to perceive the lanes of the road.
And we also use three laser distance measurements.
The lasers scan the environment to detect obstacles, a car approaching us from the front or from behind, and also any obstacles that get onto the road, any obstacles around the vehicle.
After that, all this enormous amount of information is passed on to the computer, and the computer can do two things.
First, first of all, process the information to understand what the environment is like; these are lanes on the road, the obstacles, and this information conveys to the driver.
The system is also smart enough to calculate the safest way to operate the car.
We can also generate instructions on how to operate the control of the vehicle.
But, the problem is this: how can we convey this information and these instructions to a person who can't see fast enough and pretty accurate so that he can drive?
For this, we have developed different types of non-visual user interface technology.
We started with a three-dimensional ping sound system, a vibrating vest, a click wheel with voice commands, a foot strip, and even a shoe that puts pressure on the leg.
But today, we're going to talk about three of these non-visual user interface technologies.
Well, the first interface technology is called DriveGrip.
This is a pair of gloves, and it has its vibrating elements on the ankle side, so they can convey instructions on how to steer, direction and intensity.
Another device is called SpeedStrip.
These are a chair, strictly speaking, it is a massage chair.
We hollow it out, and we reorganize the vibrating elements into different patterns. And we operate them to provide information about the speed, and also to give instructions on how to use the accelerator and brake pedal.
Therefore, you can see here how the computer sees the environment. And since they can't see the vibration, we even equip the driver with red LEDs so that he can really see what's going on.
This is the sensory data, and this data is forwarded to the devices via computer.
Therefore, these two devices, DriveGrip and SpeedGrip, are very effective.
But the problem is that they are stitch instruction devices.
So this is not a real freedom, is it?
The computer tells you how to drive, turn left, turn right, accelerate, stop.
We call it the rear seat driver problem.
Therefore, let's move away from the stitch instruction devices, and now focus more on the information devices.
A good example of this non-visual information interface technology is AirPix.
Think of it as a monitor for the blind.
Well, it's a small tray, it has a lot of holes and it releases compressed air, so it can even draw pictures.
Therefore, even if they are blind, they can put their hand on it, see the lanes and the obstacles on the road.
In fact, they can also change the air frequency that escapes and possibly the temperature.
Therefore, it is indeed a multidimensional user interface.
Well, here you can look at the left camera, the right camera seen from the vehicle and see how the computer interprets this and sends the information to the AirPix.
For this, we show a simulator, a blind person who drives and uses the AirPix.
This simulator was also very useful for training the blind riders and also quick to test different types of ideas for different types of non-visual user interfaces.
Therefore, this is how it works mainly.
But this vehicle is a prototype, and it will not enter the road until it is proven to be safe, or safer than today's vehicles.
And I really believe that this can happen.
But still, will society, would they accept such a radical idea?
How will we regulate the insurance?
How will we issue driving licences?
Apart from the technological challenges, there are many types of hurdles that we have to overcome before it becomes a reality.
Of course, the main goal of this project is to produce a car for a blind person.
But potentially more important than this is the huge benefit of spin-off technology that can be deriveed from these projects.
The sensors that are needed can see in the dark in fog and rain.
And along with these new types of interfaces, we can use this technology and apply it in safer cars for normal-sighted people.
Or for blind people, in everyday devices in the household, in education and in the office.
Imagine a teacher writing on the blackboard in a classroom, and a blind student can see and read what he has written using these non-visual interface technologies.
This is priceless.
Therefore, the things I have shown you today are just the beginning.
Thank you very much.

Discuss the abolition of the 50+1 rule
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended considering abolishing the 50+1 rule.
"German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates a fait accompli," Grindel told Bild am Sonntag.
He stressed: "For the clubs that are most likely to be dangerous to Bayern and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules do not work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, one cannot avoid the debate as to whether it is not necessary to make it easier for associations that want to break into this phalanx to involve investors."
However, he has doubts as to whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority shareholdings, which are prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50+1 rule.
"It remains a legal risk to draw investment fences around the Bundesliga as a business location in a European internal market," said Grindel.
The former DFB boss sees the danger that "the attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will ultimately only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but will not lead to more tension in the championship".

Looking at the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there have been people who have noticed this mistake and leaked it to the press instead of talking to me about it," Grindel said of accepting an expensive watch that led to his resignation in April 2019.
"That has already occupied me very much on a human level."
He had received the gift worth around 11,000 euros from a Ukrainian official.

"I dealt with the ominous watch gift completely transparently and innocently.

He had never "made a secret of the gift," assured the 58-year-old.
"This may be called naïve, but at least this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."

Arrived professionally - privately not yet
"Things are going very well" - this is the conclusion drawn by Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first days in the notary's department in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very quickly: In mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she would succeed Lutz Feller in the Eggenfelden notary's office.
Just six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the doctor of law began work, and normal day-to-day business has long been running at full speed.
"Privately, however, I still have to arrive," she explains in an interview with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
Of course, the short lead time was not enough to completely relocate the center of life from Regensburg to Eggenfelden, reports the native dingolfingerin.
She is currently looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city with her husband, who works as a judge at the regional court in Regensburg.
At least her husband was able to apply for parental leave at short notice in order to ensure the care of the two daughters (31/2 and 11/2 years old).
In order not to have to commute every day from Regensburg, she also has an overnight stay with her parents in Dingolfing for the time being, explains the 39-year-old.
Growing up in the neighbouring district, the city of Eggenfelden has of course long been known to her.
During visits to the site with her family in recent months, she again realized: "Eggenfelden is a really nice small town".
She was all the more pleased that she had won the race in the selection process for the vacancy.
Her native Lower Bavaria also plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career: After studying law in Passau, she completed her legal clerkship and the 2nd state examination in Regensburg.
After several positions as a notary assessor, including in Rehau and Hof in Upper Franconia, Babenhausen in the Unterallgäu and Regensburg - during this time she also shouldered her doctorate in employment law "on the side" - she took up her first position as a notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016, she went on parental leave, which was finally followed by the move to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken over representation services in various notarial offices.
When the position in Eggenfelden was advertised because of Lutz Feller's approaching retirement, she saw the right time for full professional re-entry, explains the 39-year-old.
The team of her predecessor, who will take over the holiday replacement in the notary's office in the future, has taken over Completely by Dr. Stefanie Kramer - and immediately has praise for the team of the law firm: "It's going great!"
The fact that she can rely on well-rehearsed processes makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of her private center of life.
In terms of kindergarten and crèche places, she has already made contact with a local institution.

BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be 20 percent full at the start of the season in the event of a fan return.
"Due to the distance regulation, which must be adhered to, we are currently planning with 12,000 to 15,000 spectators," Borussia Dortmund's managing director Carsten Cramer told the "Tagesspiegel".
Normally, the arena in the district city holds just over 81,000 spectators at Bundesliga matches.
In last season's ghost games caused by the corona pandemic, BVB lost around four million euros per game.
Cramer, who is responsible for marketing, digitization and internationalization at BVB, hopes that in addition to the normal spectator seats, some of the approximately 4,000 seats in the hospitality sector can be opened again: "It is of course a blow to the office if these revenues break away completely."
In view of the ongoing corona crisis, everyone is currently "well advised to take a stable page-long time".
"If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people in Germany alone are on short-time work, then the need for entertainment is limited," explained Cramer.
The Dortmund marketing boss praised the BVB professionals for their partial salary waiver, which should help to overcome the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their salary waiver has a different effect than if we put 100 people who work in merchandising on short-time work".

Kalbitz expulsion from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "fig leaf"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is from the point of view of the FDP only a "fig leaf" and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the right-wing extremists in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD," fdp interior politician Benjamin Strasser told the dpa news agency in Berlin.
The Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD had confirmed on Saturday in Stuttgart after several hours of hearing the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Executive Board had decided in May by a majority.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD parliamentary group in the Brandenburg state parliament.
"If the AfD really wanted to consistently remove right-wing extremists from its party, functionaries like Björn Höcke and his supporters would have been excluded long ago," Strasser said.
"However, there is no political will in the AfD to do this, because right-wing extremism is now part of the party."
CSU General Secretary Markus Blume made a similar statement: "The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded says nothing and changes nothing," he told the "Welt am Sonntag".
"Rather, it speaks volumes how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist in the middle of the AfD still has."
Blume assumes that the AfD will end up below five percent in elections in the future.
"The days of the AfD in the parliaments are numbered."
Kalbitz was one of the spokesmen of the now officially dissolved "wing" around the Thuringian AfD state and parliamentary group chairman Björn Höcke; the Office for the Protection of the Constitution classifies the border as a "certain right-wing extremist aspiration".
In May, the AfD federal executive had thrown Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason, he stated that Kalbitz had not indicated a previous membership in the now banned right-wing extremist "Heimattreue Deutsche Jugend" (HDJ) and the Republicans when he joined the party.
Kalbitz denies membership in the HDJ.
The chairman of the Left Party in the Brandenburg state parliament, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Court of Arbitration did not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf has only eaten chalk.
The AfD remains a far-right party, with or without Kalbitz."
Neither the federal party nor the right wing will be weakened with this decision.
"The manoeuvre of the Meuthen troops is transparent.
You want to avoid further observation by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution and try to get through under the radar," said Walter.
"The AfD will not get rid of the ghosts it called.
An expulsion does not change anything," commented Brandenburg SPD General Secretary Erik Stohn on the decision in the Kalbitz case.
"Here, the AfD regional association and the parliamentary group held to their right-wing leader to this day."
The legal dispute over Kalbitz's membership in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he would now take civil action against the decision of the Federal Court of Arbitration.

North Sea wind farms supply a good 21 percent more electricity
The wind power plants on the German North Sea fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid in the first six months of the year.
This is a good 21 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, said the network operator Tennet in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of North Sea electricity to the mainland and the transmission through the German power grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of Tennet's grid area, have fed in a further 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, wind power from the North Sea and Baltic Sea thus comes to 13.73 TWh, compared to a good 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of all wind power in Germany; that's about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms ensure higher generation capacities
In addition to the wind conditions, the increased contribution of offshore wind energy results from higher generation capacities because new wind farms have been connected to the grid in the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea were all running at full power at the same time, they could mathematically generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatts.
By 2030, it is expected to rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore grid connections by then," said Tennet Managing Director Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind farms cannot exhaust their capacity even at sea, but reach about 40 percent.
The record day so far this year is January 2, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could supply almost seven million households with electricity.

Freital: Windbergfest cancelled due to Corona
The Windbergfest will not take place this year.
The city of Freital has cancelled the three-day festival planned for September.
In other years, over 30,000 people had visited this city festival.
"We really did not make this decision easy for ourselves and - aware of how difficult it is economically for those involved - hoped until the last minute," said Lord Mayor Uwe Rumberg (independent).
"But ultimately, as organizers, we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people."
If tens of thousands had flocked to the festival grounds and the marquee, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact tracing in accordance with the current corona protection regulation could not have been complied with.
Or the restrictions would have been so severe that not much would have remained of a folk festival.
In addition, the organisational and monitoring effort would increase disproportionately many times over.
Rumberg put off until next year.
Then the city of Freital will celebrate its 100th anniversary with the WinterbergFest from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the Day of the Saxons from 10 to 12 September 2021.

More air traffic controllers in Worms in the future
The University of Applied Sciences in Worms continues to take to the skies: "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" (DFS German Air Traffic Control) is endowing a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and will start in 2021.
With the professorship, it is possible to start studies not only in the summer semester, but also in the winter semester.
This means that twice as many students can be trained as before.
At the same time, capacities at both the university and DFS's air traffic control academy are being used evenly.
DFS will advise the university on the establishment and appointment of the professorship.
Represented at the university since 2019
Since the summer semester of 2019, the first students have been enrolled in air traffic management as part of their training as air traffic controllers at Worms University of Applied Sciences.
This year, nine students have already started.
So far, DFS's experience has been very positive, and the students' achievements are outstanding.
The combination of studies and pilot training makes a significant contribution to further increasing the attractiveness of the pilot profession.
"In these times, funding is not easy for us economically.
However, we firmly expect air traffic to recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to be able to continue to fulfil our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel," says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman of the Managing Board of DFS, at the signing of the contract.
"For DFS, the endowed professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, interdisciplinary knowledge base in the long term.
We are therefore continuing the good cooperation with the university and at the same time underpinning our attractiveness as an employer."
This is also underlined by Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of Worms University of Applied Sciences: "The endowed professorship forms an important bridge between science and industry.
With it, we would like to build on the already existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual bachelor's degree program in Air Traffic Management."
The trust of the German Air Traffic Control is both a motivation and an obligation for Worms University of Applied Sciences to further expand its teaching and research competence in the future fields of air traffic.
Working for the air traffic controllers of tomorrow, the university can set very special highlights and innovative priorities for its students with the first endowed professorship for a dual course of study.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary in the Ministry of Science, Further Education and Culture, emphasizes: "Worms University of Applied Sciences has a unique selling point in Rhineland-Palatinate with its focus on air transport.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university."

Heil wants to test other industries after meat industry
The corona crisis brought the conditions in parts of the meat industry back to light.
Tightening of the law is imminent.
But are they legal - and will it stay that way?
Federal Labor Minister Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to check other industries after the now planned strict regulations against grievances in the meat industry.
"We will look at industry by industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary," Heil told the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employers are already warning against restricting work contracts in general.
After the mass corona outbreak at the meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet wants to pass a law by Heil this Wednesday.
Large slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to use external personnel for slaughter, cutting and meat processing.
To this end, the use of contract workers and temporary workers is to be prohibited there.
Employer President Ingo Kramer told the dpa: "Stay away from a general restriction of work contracts and temporary employment, if you do not want to completely strangle the economy".
Work contracts, for example, are the basis for their added value at the customer for large areas of the trade, the construction industry and plant construction.
"The misdeeds of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument."
Heil assured: "My goal is not to ban work contracts everywhere in the German economy."
Contracts for work and services make sense.
"If an industrial company commissions a craftsman to install a security system, this is a completely normal contract for work."
The German meat industry considers a ban on work contracts and temporary work in its industry alone to be unconstitutional.

Often they had no break.
Wages were withheld for protective equipment or rent.
It was also noted that the situation with the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively strict law had already come into force for the meat industry in 2017.
However, these were circumvented by "tricky constructions".
"Now we have to clean up fundamentally."
The politician announced: "In the Occupational Health and Safety Act, which we want to adopt in the cabinet at the end of July, there are also measures that do not only affect the meat industry - for example, higher inspection rates for occupational health and safety or clear criteria for shared accommodation".
The draft presented to dpa includes amendments to the Act on safeguarding workers' rights in the meat industry and the Occupational Health and Safety Act.
Brandenburg's Consumer Protection Minister Ursula Nonnemacher (Greens) believes that more intensive controls are necessary.

Juventus Turin champions in Italy
Turin - After a redemptive goal by Cristiano Ronaldo, record champions Juventus Turin have secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in a row.
The team around the five-time world footballer made the 36th Scudetto in the club's history perfect with a 2-0 (1-0) on Sunday evening in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo scored to make it 1-0 before half-time.
With 83 points, Turin, which started without the recently long-injured ex-international Sami Khedira, can no longer be ousted from first place two matchdays before the end of the Serie A season.
Second in the table Inter Milan are seven points behind.
Juventus were harmless despite optical superiority in the first half, then Ronaldo scored after a free-kick variant with the last action.
The 35-year-old converted a feed from Miralem Pjanic directly from the edge of the penalty area with a flat shot (45.+7).
Against the now more offensive guests, Ronaldo was also involved in the 2-0, after his shot Federico Bernardeschi (67th) dusted off.
This ensured the lackluster but decisive success.

In the eleven games before Sunday's game, the Sarri team had only managed five victories.
Whether Ronaldo will also be top scorer is questionable.

Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - Despite all the threatened penalties and court rulings, motorists continue to step on the gas in countless illegal races on Baden-Württemberg's roads: Last year and the first four months of this year, the police in the southwest already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
Although there are no comparative values for the years before, the speeders are increasingly doing the judicial authorities work: In 2018, a total of 155 investigations were conducted at the public prosecutor's offices between Konstanz and Mannheim for illegal races, a year later there were already 252 and in the current year until the beginning of June already 151.
The races were less about organized events, as can be seen from the response of the Ministry of the Interior to a request from the SPD in the state parliament.
In most cases, the drivers spontaneously competed against each other or they fled from the police - this is also reported as an illegal race.
At the wheel were mainly German men between the ages of 18 and 60.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases are the speeders caught and also asked to pay: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines have been imposed since 2018 and 15 prison sentences have been imposed.
However, there is no evidence that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
Rather, other motorists reacted more sensitively than before because of the numerous tragic accidents and processes of past years and reported more often, said a ministry spokesman.
The Autobahn 8 is particularly popular with speeders. Again and again, drivers slow down the traffic there in order to make room for themselves and use the free track for a race.
Last August, a dozen drivers were caught near Kirchheim unter Teck, three months earlier there were even 18 drivers on the A8 near Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular "race track"
On the A81, the police register even more races than on any other federal highway.
With a speed limit, an attempt is made to slow down the speeders on the particularly affected section between Engen and Geisingen.
The mostly high-priced and pimped-up sports and luxury cars often have Swiss license plates, because the drivers dodge to the lawn in Germany because of the high penalties for driving too fast and car racing in the neighboring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit must not be reduced to a few routes: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometers per hour, we would solve this problem on motorways," says Martin Rivoir, the traffic expert of the SPD parliamentary group.
"The inhibition threshold for speeders would be significantly higher if you were not allowed to travel legally here and there at 200 kilometers per hour and more."
Rivoir thinks less of education or image campaigns: "Anyone who defies all the rules in this way and puts not only their own lives, but also the lives of other road users at risk, is hardly achievable with reason."
ADAC calls for stronger police crackdown
For the ADAC, on the other hand, this is not enough: "We assume that speeders will not be deterred by the speed limits," says Holger Bach, Head of the Transport and Environment Department at ADAC Württemberg.
He calls for additional and also tougher controls on the affected routes.
Not infrequently, the high-speed showdown turns into painful and momentous seriousness: Since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people have died nationwide in the races, two of them bystanders in a nightly crash in Stuttgart's city center and one in Gerlingen.
There, two young men are said to have delivered a car race in November.

The first time I was in Antarctica was almost 10 years ago, where I saw my first icebergs.
I was gripped by reverence.
My heart was racing, Dizzy as I tried to grasp what was in front of me.
The icebergs around me protruded almost 60 meters out of the water. And I could only marvel that this was one snowflake on another snowflake, year after year.
Icebergs are born as the calf of a glacier or by breaking out of ice floes.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They interact in a clear way with their environment and their experiences.
Some refuse to give up and cling to the bitter end, while others can no longer stand it and collapse in a fit of dramatic passion.
When you look at an iceberg, it's easy to think that they are isolated, separate and alone, just as we humans often see ourselves.
But the truth is far from it.
As an iceberg melts, I breathe in its ancient atmosphere.
As the iceberg melts, it releases mineral-rich drinking water that feeds many life forms.
I proceed in my photographs of these icebergs as if I were taking portraits of my ancestors, knowing that they exist in these individual moments from this way, and will never exist that way again.
It is not death when they melt; it is not an end, but a continuation of their path along the life cycle.
Some of the ice in the icebergs I photograph is very young – several thousand years old.
And some of the ice is more than 100,000 years old.
The last pictures I would like to show you show you show an iceberg that I photographed in Kekertsuatsiak in Greenland.

That's the average size of a Greenland iceberg.
It protrudes about 120 feet out of the water, or 40 meters.
And this video is in real time.
(Music) And just like that, the iceberg shows you a different side of its personality.
Thank you.

Nuremberg: Unauthorized tuning meeting - police intervene, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and at times over 1000 people took part in a "tuning meeting" in the parking lot of a furniture store on Saturday night.
The police implemented their announcement to intensify control of such events.
A big tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (25 July 2020) in Nuremberg's Südstadt.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the police of Middle Franconia, around 10.30 p.m., the Nuremberg traffic police found an increased number of vehicles in the area of a large parking lot in the Ingolstädter Straße.
As a result, the police carried out a large number of vehicle checks there.
Only recently, the police had announced that they wanted to take stronger action against so-called autoposers.
Illegal tuning meeting in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the "scene"
The officers counted at the top a good 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, the police balance.
Of these, however, only a small part of those present can be assigned to the "autoposer" and tuning scene.
Apparently, the majority of the relevant scene complied with the appeal of the police.
On the basis of the vehicles and persons on site, it can be assumed that these were mainly onlookers.
In addition, the majority of those present adhered to the applicable infection protection regulations, in particular compliance with the minimum distance and the wearing of mouth-nose protection.
The on-site inspection measures were completed around 1:00 a.m.
In total, the officials noticed such structural changes in 10 vehicles that the operating license had expired.
Four of these vehicles had to be seized.

Figures from the Employment Agency: 900 suspected cases of abuse in short-time work
Berlin - The Federal Employment Agency (BA) is looking into around 900 suspected cases of abuse of short-time working allowance.
"With more than 880,000 companies that have reported short-time work, this is extremely little," Daniel Terzenbach, the board member responsible for operations, told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
When, at the beginning of the corona crisis, a large number of companies suddenly applied for short-time work, the BA had to react quickly.
Normally, the exam takes up to three weeks.
"We didn't have that much time in this hot phase.
The more closely we will take a closer look at the final accounts.

We are not naïve and have staying power."
Indications of abuse often come from the affected employees or trade unions.
In addition, the BA uses analysis software to identify patterns of abuse.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible wave of insolvency in the autumn.
"Will there be significantly more insolvencies than in the previous year?
The assessments differ, but we are preparing ourselves for the worst-case event and are already training our employees in the employment agencies to process applications for insolvency money."
The figures are still inconspicuous, said Terzenbach.

You all know that what I'm about to say is true.
The intuition that inequality weakens social cohesion existed even before the French Revolution.
What is new is that we now have evidence. We can compare societies, more equal and unequal, and see what inequality does.
I want to show you statistics and explain why there are connections between them.
Look what a pathetic bunch we are.
(Laughter) I would like to start with a paradox.
This shows life expectancy and gross national income – on average in rich countries.
You see that the countries on the right, Norway and the USA e.B., are twice as rich as Israel, Greece, Portugal on the left.
And that doesn't change their life expectancy at all.
There is nothing to suggest a connection.
But within societies, there are enormous social disparities in health across society.
Here, again, life expectancy.
Here are small areas in England and Wales – the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.
A big difference between the poor and the rest of us.
Even the people just below the top are worse off in health than those at the top.
So income has a very great importance within individual societies, and none at all between them.
The explanation for this paradox is that within societies we are dealing with a relative income, the social position, the status – where we stand in relation to each other, and how large the distances between us are.
And when you understand this, you immediately ask yourself: What happens when the differences become larger, or smaller, when income differences rise or fall?
And I'll show you that now.
Not with hypothetical data.
With data from the UN – the same one used by the World Bank – on the extent of income disparities in rich developed market democracies.
The measure we use because it's easy to understand and available for download is how much richer the top 20 percent are than the bottom 20 percent of any country.
You see that in the same countries on the left – Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden – the top 20 percent are around 31/2.4 times as rich as the bottom 20 percent.
But on the other hand – the UK, Portugal, the US, Singapore – the differences are twice as great.
On this scale, we are twice as unequal as some of the others of the successful market democracies.
Now I'll show you what that does to our societies.
We have collected data on problems with social disparities, the problems that are more common at the bottom of the social ladder.
Internationally comparable data on life expectancy, children's math, reading and writing skills, infant mortality and murder rates, the proportion of the population incarcerated, teenage pregnancies, confidence, obesity, mental illnesses – which include drug and alcohol addiction in standard diagnostics – and social mobility.
We have summarized them in an index.
All with the same weight.
For each country, there is a kind of average value of these factors.
And here you see it in relation to the degree of inequality that I have shown you, which I will come back to again and again.
The more unequal countries perform worse on all these social problems.
This is an unusually high correlation.
But if you put the same index of health and social problems in relation to GNI per capita, to gross national income, there is nothing left, no correlation.
We've worried that people think we've only selected the problems that support our reasoning and constructed that evidence, so we've also published an essay in the British Medical Journal on the UNICEF Index of child welfare.
In it, 40 different components were put together by other people.
The index includes whether children can talk to their parents, whether they have books at home, their immunization rates, whether there is bullying at school.
Everything flows in.
Here is the index in relation to our inequality scores.
Children perform worse in unequal societies.
A highly significant ratio.
And again, if you contrast the index of child welfare with national per capita income, there is no correlation, not even a hint.
All the data I've shown you so far says the same thing.
The average well-being of our societies no longer depends on national income and economic growth.
These are crucial in poorer countries, but not in the rich developed world.
But the differences between us, where we stand in comparison to each other, has become very important.
I'll show you individual parts of our index now.
Here is, for .B, trust.
Simply the proportion of the population that believes that you can trust most people.
The data comes from the World Values Survey.
On the more unequal side, about 15 percent of the population believe that others can be trusted.
But in the same societies, it's up to 60 or 65 percent.
And for the degree of integration into communal life or social capital, there are similarly close links to inequality.
We did all this work twice.
First with the rich, developed countries, and then again in a second test field with the 50 American states – with the same question: do the more unequal states perform worse on all these scales?
Here, according to a data collection by the US government, trust is related to inequality.
A very similar distribution over a similar range of trust levels.
The same thing is happening here.
Our basic finding is that almost all factors that are internationally related to trust do the same in the 50 US states, in a separate test environment.
And that's not just a happy coincidence.
Here are mental illnesses.
The WHO compiled these figures by conducting the same diagnostic interviews with randomly selected subjects to compare rates of mental illness in societies.
This is the percentage of the population that were mentally ill last year.
It goes from 8 percent to three times that – entire societies that have three times the rates of mental illness as others.
And again, a high correlation to inequality.
And here violence.
These red dots are American states, the blue triangles are Canadian provinces.
Note the scale of differences.
It goes from 15 murders per million to 150.
That is the proportion of the population that is in detention.
Here there is about a tenfold difference on the lateral log scale.
It goes from about 40 to 400 imprisoned people.
This ratio does not arise primarily from higher crime rates.
In some places, this is a partial factor.
But the main reason is harsher court rulings.
And more unequal societies are also more likely to adhere to the death penalty.
Here are children droping out of school.
Again, pretty big differences.
With devastating effects in terms of the use of talents of the population.
Here is social mobility.
Actually, a measurement of mobility based on income.
The question is: Do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons, or is there no connection between them?
On the more unequal side, fathers' income is much more important -- in Britain, in the US.
And in the Scandinavian countries, fathers' income is much less decisive.
There is more social mobility.
We like to say – and I know there are a lot of Americans here in the audience – if Americans want to live the American Dream, they should go to Denmark.
(Laughter) (Applause) I have just introduced you to a few things.
I could have shown you a lot of other problems.
All of these problems are more common at the lower end of the social gradient.
But there are countless problems with social disparities that are worse in more unequal countries – not just a little, but somewhere between 2 times and 10 times as common.
Imagine these costs, the human cost.
But I want to come back to the graph where we summarized everything to show two things.
On the one hand, graph by graph shows that the countries that perform poorly, regardless of the outcome, appear to be the more unequal ones, and those that are doing better seem to be the Nordic countries and Japan.
So what we're seeing is a general social dysfunction that comes with inequality.
This applies not only to one or two things, but to most.
The other very important aspect of this graph you can see down here, Sweden and Japan – in many ways very different countries.
The position of women, how much they cling to the nuclear family, here they lie at opposite poles of the rich, developed world.
Another very important difference is how they achieve their greater equality.
In Sweden, there are enormous differences in earnings that are compensated by taxation, the general welfare state, generous social benefits, etc.
In Japan, it's completely different.
There are even before the tax smaller differences in earnings.
There are lower taxes.
A smaller welfare state.
And in our analysis of the American states, we find the same contrast.
Some states are successful through redistribution, others are doing well because they have small income differences before tax.
Our implication is that it doesn't really matter how you get greater equality as long as you somehow achieve it.
I don't mean perfect equality, I'm talking about something that already exists in rich market democracies.
Another surprising part of the picture is that it's not just the poor who are affected by inequality.
Apparently, there is some truth in John Donne's "Nobody is an island."
In several studies, one can compare how people in more or less the same countries perform at each level of the social hierarchy.
This is just one example.
child mortality.
Some Swedes have kindly classified a large proportion of their child deaths according to the UK Register of Socioeconomic Classification.
This is an anachronistic classification according to the professions of the fathers, so single referred to them separately.
But where "low social class" is noted, this means unskilled manual activities.
Then there are the skilled craft professions in the middle, then the subordinate non-manual, up to the higher-ranking professions – doctors, lawyers, executives of larger companies.
You can see that Sweden is better than Britain, across the entire social hierarchy.
The biggest differences are down in society.
But even at the top, there seems to be a small advantage to living in a more equal society.
We show this in five different data sets that deal with educational success and health in the U.S. and internationally.
This seems to be generally the case – greater equality makes the most of the case at the bottom, but has some advantages even at the top.
But I should say something more about what is happening.
I am concerned with the psychosocial effects of inequality.
This has to do with feelings of superiority and inferiority, the feeling of being appreciated or devalued, respected or despised.
And, of course, the sense of status competition that results from this drives consumerism in our society.
It also leads to status uncertainty.
We are more concerned about how we are judged by others, whether we are seen as attractive, smart, etc.
The socially assessing judgments are increasing, and the fear of these judgments is increasing.
Interestingly, there is similar research in social psychology: some people have evaluated 208 different studies in which volunteers were invited to psychological labs to measure their stress hormones and their response to stressful tasks.
What interested them in the evaluation was which types of stress most reliably raised cortisol levels, the central stress hormone.
And the result was: tasks that posed a threat to social assessment – threats to self-confidence or social status in which others can judge one's own performance negatively.
These types of stress have a very specific effect on the physiology of stress.
We have been criticised.
Of course, there are people who don't like this and people who find it very amazing.
However, I should tell you that if we are criticised for a targeted selection of our data, we never select specifically for our purposes.
Our absolute principle is: if our data source has data for one of the countries we are looking at, they come into the analysis.
Our data source determines whether it is reliable data, not us.
Anything else would be bias.
What about other countries?
There are 200 studies on health relative to income and equality in academic peer-reviewed journals.
This is not limited to these countries, this is a very simple demonstration.
The same countries, the same inequality scale, one problem after another.
Why don't we check other factors?
We have shown that per capita income makes no difference.
And, of course, others have also used more sophisticated methods to check poverty and education, and others.
What about causality?
A correlation does not yet prove causality.
We spent a lot of time on that.
In fact, people know the causal references very well in some of these results.
The big news in our understanding of the driving forces for long-term health in the rich developed world is how much chronic social stress puts a strain on the immune system, the cardiovascular system.
Or, for example, the reason why violence is more prevalent in more unequal societies is because people are sensitive to being despised.
To cope with this, we need to clarify what happens after the tax and what happens before the tax.
We need to limit income, bonus culture incomes at the top.
We need to make our bosses accountable to the employees as best we can.
But the message to take away is that we can improve the actual quality of human life if we fix the income disparities between us.
Suddenly, there is a lever for the psychosocial well-being of entire societies, and that is very exciting.
Thank you.

Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualified for Champions League
London (dpa) - The English football record champion Manchester United returns to the Champions League after a year of absence.
The Red Devils secured third place in the table on the last matchday of the Premier League with a 2-0 (0-0) victory against direct rivals Leicester City.
The Foxes now have to settle for the Europa League, because Chelsea FC still passed and qualified for the premier class in fourth place.
In the fight against relegation, Aston Villa was allowed to celebrate.
Manchester United took the lead through a penalty kick from Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in injury time, Jesse Lingard (90.+8) scored the final score.
Chelsea, opponents of FC Bayern in the Champions League knockout round, won thanks to Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4) in parallel with 2:0 (2:0) against Wolverhampton Wanderers.
"That means a lot to me," said coach Frank Lampard, who is also in the FA Cup final against Arsenal in his first season as Chelsea coach.
Chelsea's win over Wolverhampton also benefited Tottenham Hotspur, who moved past Wolves with a meagre 1-1 (1-0) win at Crystal Palace and start sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa won the long-distance duel with Watford FC and AFC Bournemouth, but had to tremble at West Ham United for a long time for the class retention.
The late lead of Jack Grealish (84th) was immediately compensated for by Andrei Yarmolenko (85th).
The 1:1 (0:0) was enough, because Watford lost 2:3 (1:3) at Arsenal.
The club, which had three coaches in the season, is relegated after five years in the first division.
Just like Bournemouth, who could not save themselves by a 3-1 (2-1) at Everton FC.
In the end, a point was missing.
Liverpool FC, who have been English champions since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3-1 (1-1) win at Newcastle United.
99 points is the highest the Reds have ever scored in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team narrowly missed the points record in English football.
Manchester City holds the record with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After the Newcastle lead in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) turned Sunday's game around for Liverpool.
"It's been an extraordinary season for this wonderful club," said goal scorer van Dijk after the game, "that should spur us on to defend the title.
It's going to be hard."
In the end, the Premier League bosses should also be satisfied.
Due to the coronavirus crisis, football operations in England had been suspended from 13 March to 17 June.
In the meantime, there was even discussion about a premature termination or a hosting of the remaining games on neutral ground.
In the end, however, the season could be played to the end without any special incidents - but as in Germany without spectators in the stadiums.

I want to show you today how we will make things in the future.
I believe that our buildings and machines will soon assemble, duplicate and repair themselves.
I will show you what I think are today's production methods and then compare them with some natural systems.
In the current manufacturing industry, we have skyscrapers – two and a half years [construction time], half a million to a million parts, quite complex, new and exciting technologies made of steel, concrete, glass.
We have exciting machines that take us into space – five years [construction time], two and a half million parts.
On the other hand, if you look at natural systems, you find proteins that have two million types and can fold in ten microseconds, or DNA with three billion base pairs that can be copied in about an hour.
So there's all this complexity in our natural systems, but they're extremely efficient, much more efficient than anything we can make, far more complex than anything we can build.
They are much more energy efficient.
They almost never make mistakes.
And they are durable because they can repair themselves.
So there are many interesting things to discover in natural systems.
And if we manage to incorporate that into our built environment, then we have an exciting potential for new construction methods.
And I believe that the key is self-assembly.
If we want to use self-assembly in our physical environment, I think there are four central factors.
The first is that we have to decipher all the complexity of the things we want to build – our buildings and machines.
And we have to translate that into simple sequences – the DNA of how our buildings work, so to speak.
Then we need programmable parts that can pull this sequence and use it to fold or reconfigure.
We need activation energy so that our parts can fold up from the program.
And we need a kind of redundancy for error correction, so that what we want to build really arises.
I'll show you some of the projects my colleagues and I are working on at MIT so that self-assembly can be realized in the future.
The first two are MacroBot and DeciBot.
These projects are large-scale, reconfigurable robots – proteins two and a half to four meters long.
They are equipped with electromechanical devices, sensors.
You decode what you want to fold into a sequence of angles – so minus 120, minus 120, 0, 0, 120, minus 120 – something like that; a sequence of angles, or rotations, and you send that sequence through the chain.
Each unit picks up its message – i.e. minus 120 – rotates accordingly, checks whether it has arrived, and forwards it to the neighboring unit.
These are the brilliant scientists, engineers and designers who worked on this project.
And I think it makes one thing really clear: Is this really scalable?
I mean, thousands of dollars, many hours of work to create this two-and-a-half-meter-high robot.
Can we really scale this up? Can we really embed robotics in every part?
The next project questions this and looks at the passive nature or the passive attempt to make reconfiguration programmable.
But it goes one step further and tries to make actual calculations possible.
It basically integrates the most fundamental part of EDP, the digital logic gate, directly into the parts.
This is a NAND gate.
You have a tetrahedron, which is the gate that will perform the calculations, and you have two input tetrahedrons.
One is the input of the user while the blocks are being made.
The other comes from the previous component that was arranged.
And then it delivers an output in three-dimensional space.
This means that the user can enter what the components should do.
It performs calculations based on what it has done before and what the user requires of him.
And now it begins to move in three-dimensional space – up and down.
On the left, the input [1,1] corresponds to the output 0 that goes down.
On the right, the input [0.0] corresponds to the output 1, which goes up.
What this really means is that our structures now contain the plans of what we want to build.
So you have all the information about what has been built.
This means we can achieve some form of self-replication.
In this case, I call it self-directed replication because the structure contains the exact blueprints.
If errors occur, you can replace a part.
All the local information is integrated to show how to fix it.
So you could have something that climbs and reads along and delivers an output of one to one.
It is directly integrated; there are no instructions from the outside.
The last project I'm going to show is called Biased Chains, and it's arguably the most exciting example of self-assmounting systems we have right now.
It takes up the ability to reconfigure and program and creates a completely passive system.
Basically, you have a chain of elements.
Each element is completely identical and they are polarized.
Every chain, or element, wants to turn to the right or to the left.
So while you're assing the chain, you're basically programming it.
Each unit is told whether to turn right or left.
When you shake the chain, it folds into a configuration that you have programmed in – in this case, a spiral or in this case two cubes next to each other.

North Korea seals off border town after Corona suspected case
North Korea has so far seen a "shining success" in its own measures to ward off the coronavirus.
Now the country is reporting for the first time on a suspected case.
Because of a first official corona suspected case in the country, North Korea has completely sealed off a major city for fear of a catastrophe.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defenses in the past six months, "the malignant virus may have been introduced into the country," state media reported.
For the region around the border town of Kaesong, the state of emergency had been imposed.
The communist leadership declared the highest alert level.
If confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the isolated country.
North Korea has not yet registered a single infection and described its defensive measures as a "shining success".
The information was doubted abroad.
The symptoms of the disease were reportedly found in an "outlier" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
The person had left for South Korea three years ago and has now returned across the border.
For the border crossing within the four kilometers wide and mostly still mined military buffer zone, there was initially no confirmation from South Korea.
South Korea's military, however, admitted the possibility of an illegal border crossing to North Korea as high, according to reports by the national news agency Yonhap.
Investigations were carried out on some people.
North Korea called an emergency meeting of the Politburo of the Workers' Party chaired by leader Kim Jong Un on Saturday because of the suspected case.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive catastrophe."
Kim had already ordered on Friday as a preventive measure to "completely block Kaesong and isolate each district and the region from others," it said.
The affected person, as well as all people in Kaesong who had had contact with her, had been quarantined.
The central military commission of the party should therefore investigate the "outlier case" as well as the behavior of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose harsh punishment.
According to estimates, about 300,000 people live in Kaesong.

Tension ahead of Council meeting: City-Ost and noise protection are still up for discussion before the big summer break
"In addition to environmental issues, the committee members will also vote on the development plan for the large-scale inner-city development-east project," it says rather casually in the middle section of the municipal press release for the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, July 28, at 4:30 p.m. in the Great Hall of the CongressCentrum Pforzheim.
Above all, the upgrading of the eastern city, however, is controversially discussed until the end.
The majorities for this are narrow, most recently in individual committees depending on the presence even negative.
An appeal from the economy (construction, real estate, trade and IT) not to let the project developed from the citizenry and then by the administration and the municipal council fail after almost ten years of preparation, criticized project opponent Reinhard Klein as "extra-parliamentary opposition", "clueless", "speculation", "denigration" and "deliberate false statements".
"Everyone thinks they know better," says Klein, who has been the only representative of the Pforzheim Citizens' List for a year now.
In fact, after reading the treaties, he is in this position: "I know what I'm talking about.".
The exit will be cheaper for the city, the Technical Town Hall is contrary to statements of the city administration after grants, of whose existence Klein is convinced, to renovate for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop very differently than predicted in the town hall and on the part of the supporters from the economy.
To shape the city by his own strength and not an investor: That is his plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP/FW/UB/LED parliamentary group, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It also essentially provides for the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, the keeping of the Schloßberg open, the rental of the Ex-Thal for administrative areas and a smaller-scale redesign of the city centre ideally with local sponsors.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues in particular will play a central role.
Among other things, the municipal council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the population of Pforzheim from health noise pollution caused by road traffic, including often speed reductions.
In a press release, the local traffic club Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of 30 km/h. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of the fact that this must happen, because they have contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus the noise by neglecting the regular bus service with thinned out intervals and by little commitment to cycling, according to the VCD.
The municipal council also votes on the participation of the city of the Energy and Climate Protection Agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
In addition, the agenda includes membership of the climate protection pact of the state of Baden-Württemberg, the redefinition of parental contributions in the municipal day care centers and the application for inclusion in the smart city funding of the federal government.

Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with a lot of delay
With a delay of almost half a year, Tim Zimmermann will start his debut season in the ADAC GT Masters on 31 July.
Before the league of super sports cars can start regular operation, the first test drives were now due.
For Zimmermann, it was all about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 better.
For a long time, the corona crisis prevented Tim Zimmermann from embarking on his first business trip in grasser Racing's new Lamborghini Huracan.
Under special hygiene conditions, this was now possible.
The 23-year-old from Langenargen completed his first laps at the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his debut in the GT3 car.
"There are already a few things that are different from the Porsche from the previous season," says Zimmermann.
"With ABS, for example, you have to go into the curves differently.
But it was really a lot of fun."
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite being only 25 years old, the Dutchman is already experienced in GT racing and was able to help his new team-mate in many things.
"I'm not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series brings new challenges," says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I get along brilliantly and we have made enormous progress at the Lausitzring from session to session."
It is precisely there - at the Lausitzring - that the GT Masters will also be holding its first race.
From 31 July, the 33 super sports cars will race through Lusatia.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 newcomers to the series, knows the track.
In 2015 he was last a guest at the Motodrom.
"It worked quickly and I didn't have to get used to the track very much," says Zimmermann, who competes for the Friedrichshafen racing community Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has many fast passages that you have to hit optimally to be fast."
How fast Zimmermann really is then, that turns out in two weeks.
"Of course, the teams play a little poker in the tests," he says.
"In the end, however, we are very satisfied and are looking forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring."

British Transport Secretary caught cold by quarantine decision
The British government's decision to quarantine Spain holidaymakers for two weeks after their return has caught the country's transport minister off guard, according to press reports.
Accordingly, Grant Shapps is currently on vacation in Spain, of all places, while his colleagues at home decided on Saturday the measure.
Due to the rising corona numbers in Spain, the cabinet in London removed the country from the list of countries from which entry without quarantine requirements is possible.
The new regulation will apply from today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to quarantine after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But for those who are just on vacation, the rule does not apply until Saturday, August 1, and was not introduced overnight.
By the way, Spain is still considered one of the "safe countries" in Austria for which no quarantine in Austria is required.
"Many ministers must have known in advance that there is a possibility of a quarantine being imposed on holidaymakers in Spain," commented Labour MP Diane Abbot.
"But apparently no one bothered to tell Grant Shapps."

Do you know how many types of flowering plants there are?
A quarter of a million – that's the number of known species – a quarter of a million species of flowering plants.
And flowers are real devil guys.
Plants have great difficulty in producing them.
They require an enormous amount of energy and raw materials.
Why do they make this effort?
The answer, of course, is, as to so much in the world: sex.
I know what you're thinking about when you look at these pictures.
And the answer to why sexual reproduction is so important -- there are many other ways for plants to reproduce.
Take offshoots; they can have sex with themselves, so to speak; they can pollinate themselves.
But they actually have to spread their genes to mix them with other genes so that they can occupy ecological niches.
This is how evolution works.
Plants pass on this information about pollen.
Some of you may have seen a few of these images before.
As I always say, everyone would have to have a scanning electron microscope at home to see them.
There are as many different types of pollen as there are flowering plants.
And this is very useful for forensics and so on.
Most of the pollen that causes hay fever comes from plants that use the wind to spread their pollen. This is a very inefficient process, which is why so much of it ends up in our noses.
Because the plants eject very large amounts, hoping that the male sex cells that are in the pollen will only accidentally hit another flower.
All grasses, i.e. all cereal plants and most trees, transport pollen through the wind.
However, most species use insects for their own purposes. And this is the smarter way, as it requires less pollen.
The insects and other species can bring the pollen directly to its destination.
We are naturally aware of the relationship between insects and plants.
This is a symbiotic relationship. Whether flies, birds or bees, they also benefit from it, usually through the nectar.
This symbiosis has led to some wonderful adaptations - the hummingbird swarmer is a beautiful adaptation.
The plant benefits from the fact that the hummingbird spreads the pollen.
Plants have developed small runways for bees that otherwise won't find their way.
On many plants are markings that resemble other insects.
These are the anthers of a lily, a very clever construction. When an unsuspecting insect lands on her, the bags fold up and hit the insect on the back, where the pollen gets stuck and is taken to other plants.
This is an orchid that looks like it has a mouth. The insects are forced to crawl out and are thus covered by pollen.
There are at least 20,000 species of orchids - an impressive variety.
And they have all sorts of tricks in store.
You need to attract pollinators to help them.
This orchid, known for the research of Charles Darwin, who made a great thesis at its sight. You will see a very long nectar tube going down from the orchid.
And what insects have to do there in the middle of the flower - they have to put their little proboscis in there and down the whole nectar tube to get to the nectar.
And when Darwin saw this flower, he said, "Something must have evolved in parallel."
And indeed, here is this insect.
Usually it rolls up the proboscis, but in its stretched shape it looks like this.
You can imagine that if nectar is so valuable and elaborate for the plant to produce and attracts many pollinators, then it is like human sex that people begin to deceive.
They say, "I have nectar, do you want to come and get it?"
This is a plant.
This is a plant that insects in South Africa simply love. And they have developed a long proboscis to get to the nectar.
And this is a copycat,
a plant that copies the original.
And here is the fly with a long proboscis that did not get nectar from the imitator. Because the imitator, contrary to what the fly expects, has no nectar at all.
Not only did the fly not get any nectar, it also has - if you look very closely, at the head of the proboscis you will see pollen that it would have transferred to other plants, if only a botanist had not come by and glued it to blue paper.
(Laughter) Deception runs through the whole plant kingdom.
These black dots on the flower, they look to us like black dots, but for male insects of certain species they look like two females that are very hot.
(Laughter) And when the insect lands there, it picks up pollen, which brings it to further plants. If you look at the "Everyone-household-should-have-one" electron microscope image, you can see that there are certain three-dimensional patterns.
It probably not only looks good to the insect, but also feels good.
And these electron microscope images — here one of an orchid imitating an insect — show that different parts of the shape have different colors and seemingly different surfaces, and for the perception of an insect, the textures are very, very different.
This plant has developed the imitation of a shiny metallic surface, as seen on some beetles.
And under the electron microscope you can see that this surface is very different from the one we have looked at so far.
Sometimes the whole plant imitates an insect, even in our perception.
I think it looks like a flying animal.
It's a wonderful thing.
This one is clever. It is called Obsidium.
I sometimes see them as insidiousness.
For certain bees, it looks like another, particularly aggressive bee, so it flies there and hits it several times on the head to drive it away and of course absorbs a lot of pollen.
At the same time, this plant imitates another orchid, which provides a rich food supply for insects.
But this one has nothing for them.
So she cheats on two levels - fabulous.
(Laughter) Here we see the cananga tree, an ingredient of many perfumes.
I smelled one on someone earlier.
The flowers should not be so colorful.
They send a fantastic spectrum of scents to all insects.
This one doesn't smell so good.
This is a flower that really smells very hideous and this has developed to imitate carrion.
Therefore, flies love them.
They fly in and pollinate them.
This is a Helicodiceros, also known as a "dead horse".
I don't know what a dead horse smells like, but the plant probably hits it quite well.
It's really terrible.
And flies can't hold back.
They fly in all the way to the back
and lay their eggs there, that they think it is carrion, without realizing that there is no food for the eggs that die because of it, but the plant benefits from it, as the fly continues to fly full of pollen and pollinanates the next flower - fantastic.
This is Arum maculatum, the Spotted Aron Staff.
I photographed him last week in Dorset.
It heats up to about 15° above ambient temperature - fascinating.
And if you look inside the plant, there is a kind of barrier behind the inflorescences. Flies are attracted to the heat that creates volatile chemicals and are then trapped at the bottom of the container.
They drink the wonderful nectar and are sticky afterwards.
At night they get a pollen shower and then the bristles we saw above slacken, thereby clearing the way for the mosquitoes that are full of pollen - great thing.
If you think that's great, now comes one of my favorites.
This is the Philodendron Selloum.
If someone from Brazil is here, you will know the plant.
It's really fascinating.
This species phallus there is about 30cm long.
And he does something that no other plant I know does when he blooms. There in the middle are the inflorescences - for about 2 days it has a metabolism very similar to that of mammals.
Instead of feeding on starch, which is the diet of plants, it takes something similar to brown adipose tissue and burns it so quickly that the fat burning rate, metabolism, is equal to that of a small cat.
That's twice the energy production of a hummingbird, relative to the weight - insanely impressive.
But he does something else that is unusual.
It not only heats up to 43 to 44 °C for about 2 days, but also maintains a constant temperature.
It can regulate its temperature and thus keep it constant.
They ask themselves, "Why is he doing this?"
As you can imagine, there are some bugs that love to mate at this temperature.
And they fly in and get started.
(Laughter) And the plant showers them with pollen, and they continue to fly and pollinate.
What a wonderful thing.
The typical pollinator for us is an insect. But in the tropics, many birds and butterflies also pollinate.
And many tropical flowers are red and we believe this is because birds and butterflies look similar to us and therefore can see the color red very well.
If you look at the spectrum of birds and humans, we see red, green and blue so this spectrum here.
Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet and different levels of ultraviolet.
So something that goes further behind our spectrum.
And I hear you ask, "Wouldn't it be great if we could see that too?"
Of course we can.
So what does an insect see?
Last week I photographed this sunflower in Dorset.
As you can see, these are small yellow flowers, small yellow flowers everywhere.
And this is what they look like in visible light.
This is what it looks like when you take out the red.
Most bees don't see red.
And then I photographed with ultraviolet filters and exposed the special ultraviolet frequencies for a very, very long time and that came out of it.
And that's a fantastic target.
We don't know exactly what bees see, just like you don't know what I see when I say ,"That's red."
We cannot look into the thoughts of insects or other people.
But the contrast will be something like this. It stands out against the background.
Here is another small flower - different range of ultraviolet frequencies, other filters similar to pollinators.
And that's what they would see.
In case you now think all yellow flowers have this property - no flower was harmed for this picture; it was only attached to the tripod, not killed - but under ultraviolet light it looks like this.
And that could serve as the basis of a sunscreen, because sunscreens absorb UV light.
The substances in the plant could be helpful.
Finally, we have an evening primrose that Bjorn Rorslett sent me from Norway - fantastic hidden patterns.
I love the idea of hidden things.
I think there is something poetic about it. Namely that these images were taken with UV filters, filters that are mainly used by astronomers to photograph Venus - more precisely its nebulae.
That is the main purpose of these filters.
Venus is the goddess of love and fertility, and that, in turn, is the story of flowers.
And flowers not only show great efforts to attract pollinators, they also manage to make us plants large fields full of them and give them to each other at births and deaths, and especially at weddings, which, if you think about it, are the moment when the exchange of genetic material from one organism to another is determined.
Thank you very much.

FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start of the hot preparation phase for the Champions League began for double winner FC Bayern with a setback.
Hansi Flick, who recovered "reasonably well" after a short holiday and a few days of training, has to think about how he can rebuild his successful defence after the injury of world champion Benjamin Pavard after the first team training.
The Frenchman, who has the third most minutes behind captain Manuel Neuer and midfield boss Joshua Kimmich, suffered a ligament injury to the left foot root and threatens to be missing in decisive premier class duels.
In Munich's muddy weather, the right-back broke off a training game and was driven off the course with a golf kart.
How long the unrestricted regular player has to pause in the fight for the title is open.
A deployment in the second leg of the second round against Chelsea FC on 8 August is likely to be difficult, the 24-year-old can hope for the final tournament starting on 12 August in Lisbon.
However, Bayern do not want to be stopped by the mishap from training on Sunday.
In his personal triple formula, Flick named the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on their way to Portugal's capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration should show his victory-hungry title collectors in the ideally following 28 days until the royal class final on 23 August.
"We have mastered the mandatory tasks with championship and cup simply excellently.
Now it's time to create something special," said Flick.
Until the Munich can deal with the final tournament and before a training camp in the Algarve concretely, but first the knockout round obligation against FC Chelsea is due.
After the 3-0 win in the first leg before the Corona break, the Londoners should not become a Bayern nightmare again in the home arena as in the lost "Finale dahoam" in 2012.
"We have to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and regain confidence with a good game," Flick demanded.
A test to get in the mood is scheduled for Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn his stars, who had 13 days of vacation after the double, to a unique August.
He welcomed 31 players to Säbener Straße, including the new players around edel-Einkauf Leroy Sané, who met all new colleagues on the pitch for the first time after his move from Manchester City.
"Leroy, like all the newcomers, has adapted well," Flick reported.
But instead of talking about the new season, when Sané &amp; Co. are no longer allowed to train only, Flick much preferred to talk about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of individual and small group training, training is now being done in team strength for the Londoners, who, in contrast to the Flick ensemble, are in the rhythm of playing.
After that, the Munich could face a quarter-final against FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, in the semi-finals Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are possible opponents.
A way to the final in Lisbon "is not quite so easy," emphasized the head coach, who can rely on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training from Tuesday.
The World Cup record scorer Klose and Flick know from many a joint tournament preparation, what is particularly important in the 0-to-100 attunement.
With his current team, working is "a pleasure," praised Flick.
The "focus on winning" is an impressive trait of his team.
At the tournament with teams of nine on Sunday, it was also ambitious to the point.

Greta Thunberg: Evil eye against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.

New York City - Over the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has attracted attention with her tireless commitment to the Fridays For Future movement.
Now she spoke on a well-known late-night show about her plans for the future as well as her encounter with US President Donald Trump at the UN climate summit last year.
Latenight host Stephen Colbert welcomed 17-year-old Thunberg to your show on Tuesday and conducted a lengthy interview with the Swede.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the powerful of the world.
"There are some things that surprised me," she said.
"How far people are going to shift the focus away from the climate crisis," she said.
"Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats just because a group of children take to the streets," she said.
She finds heads of state and leading politicians who mock her on social media or even try to silence her "funny" because the reactions show her "because they have no other answer".
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview, when Greta Thunberg was asked about a well-known scene in which she cast a bitter look after US President Trump.
At the 2019 UN climate summit in New York, for which the nude artist sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive gaze was captured by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
The short clip resulted in a GIF, an animated image that ultimately became one of the most commonly used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the US president at that moment?
To Stephen Colbert's relatively open question, she replied only briefly and dryly: "To be honest, I don't think this needs any further explanation".
The experienced satirist Colbert had probably not expected the quick-witted answer and disappeared from the picture laughing briefly.
With her "How dare you?" speech on the principles of climate protection, she was remembered by many at the climate conference.

Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green died
His life was like a roller coaster ride: after a rapid ascent with Fleetwood Mac, it went steeply downhill and then slowly up again.
Now the blues rock guitarist Peter Green has died at the age of 73.
Brilliant guitarist, drug junkie, cult follower: The co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 73, family members said in an official statement on Saturday, with another statement announced for the next few days.
Top musicians such as Peter Frampton praised Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional reaction of a "monumental loss" for all former and current members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
The drummer Fleetwood and the guitarist Green had founded the now legendary band in London in 1967, and his dreamy instrumental hit "Albatross" is still unforgotten today.
The life of the musician ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") resembled a roller coaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated their greatest successes but then without him.
Among other things, there was a dispute because Green wanted to donate all the profits of the group to charity.
He began to appear in wide robes and with a large crucifix.
Psychological problems are also said to have played a role.
Just three years after its formation, Green left the band in 1970.
A social decline followed.
The blues rock guitarist suffered from substance abuse and schizophrenia, biographers reported.
For a long time, Green was treated in psychiatry.
During much of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the scene.
He is said to have lived on the streets for a time, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent some time in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946 to a Jewish working-class family in the London borough of Bethnal Green.
From a young age he was enthusiastic about American blues musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of eleven he learned the first guitar handles.
At the age of 15, the teenager began playing guitar professionally and five years later got the chance to be the lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners on stage.
A little later he was hired as a replacement for his idol Eric Clapton with the Bluesbreakers.
In the midst of the blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 together with his Bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross" composed by Green gave the group their first number 1 hit in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted them to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed its downsides: Green could not cope with the media hype, his experiments with the drug LSD became more and more extreme.
He later commented on life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that has happened to me in life are the drugs - the best thing was to land a number 1 hit".
Towards the end of the decade, Green surprisingly achieved a respectable success in 1979 with an album inspired by religious themes.
Fleetwood Mac, meanwhile, swam without him in a new formation on a wave of success.
Their 1977 album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Despite various small solo successes, Green did not manage a major comeback until he started in 1996 with a group of musician friends.
The British "Daily Telegraph" spoke at the time of a rock star who had returned to earth.
