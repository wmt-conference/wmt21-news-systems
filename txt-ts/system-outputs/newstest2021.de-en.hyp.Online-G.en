Jan Christopher Horak wrote: "The film is a remarkable achievement of the director.
We're not supposed to know.
You could have known.
Please, all of you, for a moment, make yourself aware of a very simple fact: pretty much everything we know about the universe we know through light.
We can stand on Earth and look into the night sky and look at stars with our naked eyes.
The sun burns our peripheral vision.
We see light reflected from the moon.
and in the time that has passed since Galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope at the heavenly bodies, the universe known to us has traveled to us as visible light, passing through immeasurable ages of cosmic history.
With the help of all our modern telescopes, we have been able to study all this: this impressive silent film of the universe, this series of snapshots that go back to the Big Bang.
But the universe is not silent, because the universe is not silent.
I want to convince you that the universe has a soundtrack and that this soundtrack is played in space itself: because space can swing like a drum.
It can sound a kind of sound recording that can be heard throughout the universe; of some of the most dramatic events when these occurred.
Now we would like to add a tonal component to the wonderful visual arrangement we have of the universe.
And even if we've never heard the sounds of the universe before, we should slowly turn up the volume knob for what's happening out there in the next couple of years.
Out of this ambition to capture songs of the universe, we focus our interest on black holes and their inherent promise. Black holes hammer against space-time like wooden mallets on a drum. They have a very characteristic sound, which I would like to play to you; or our idea of how this song will sound.
One day we may see a shadow cast by a black hole against a light background, but so far we have not succeeded.
And yet you can hear black holes, even if they are invisible. The reason for this is that they play on space-time like on a drum.
We owe the idea that space sounds like a drum to Albert Einstein, to whom we owe so much.
Einstein realized that if space were empty,if the universe were empty, it would have to look like this picture, just without this helpful grid.
But if we were moving through space in free fall, even without this helpful grid, then maybe we could paint it ourselves. Because we would realize that we are moving along straight lines, along undistorted, straight paths through the universe.
Einstein also realized (and that's what it's all about) that when you bring energy or mass into the universe, it bends the universe. If a body in free fall were to pass, say, the Sun, it would be distorted along the natural lines of curvature in space.
This is Einstein's great General Theory of Relativity.
Even light is diffracted along these paths.
And a body can be bent so much that it goes into orbit around the Sun, like the Earth, or like the Moon in Earth orbit.
These are natural curvatures in space.
What Einstein did not know was this: if you took the Sun and compressed it into a ball six kilometers in diameter, if you took something with a million times the mass of the Earth and compressed it into six kilometers, you would create a black hole; a body of such density that light that came too close to it could never escape. It would be a black shadow in front of the universe.
But Einstein throughout his life considered black holes a mathematical curiosity.
He didn't believe they really existed.
He was convinced that nature would protect us from its creation.
It should be decades before the term" black hole " was coined and people realized that black holes are astrophysical bodies. In fact, they are the lifeless state form of extremely dense stars that collapse into themselves in a terrible catastrophe at the end of their lives.
Our Sun, on the other hand, will not end up as a black hole.
It's just not big enough for that.
But we did a little thought experiment, as Einstein liked to do. Let's imagine that we squeeze the Sun to six kilometers in diameter and put a tiny Earth in its orbit, say 30 km away from this black Sun.
This earth would shine by itself (because since the Sun would then have disappeared, there would be no other light source) so we let our little Earth shine by itself.
We could put the Earth into a carefree orbit about 30 km away from the crushed black hole.
This crushed black hole would be about the size of Manhattan.
It would pour into the Hudson a little more before it destroyed the Earth.
But about this we are talking.
We're talking about something you can squeeze until it's half the size of Manhattan.
Now we bring the Earth very close, up to about 30 km, and see how it moves in a completely perfect orbit around the black hole.
There is a kind of myth that black holes devour everything in the universe, but in fact you have to get very close to them to fall into it.
But what is particularly impressive from our point of view is the fact that we can always see the Earth.
She can't hide behind the black hole.
The light that comes from the earth, some of it falls in, but some is scattered and returns to us.
So you can't hide anything behind a black hole.
If this is the battle star Galactica and you are fighting the Cylons, then you better not hide behind the black hole.
You can see them.
So our Sun will not collapse into a black hole, its mass is not enough for this. But there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
If one of them wiped out the Milky Way, it would look like this.
We would see a shadow of the black hole, against the background of billions of stars of the Milky Way Galaxy and its luminous dust orbits.
Should we fall towards this black hole, we would see all the light that would be bent around it, and we could even enter the shadow without noticing that something unusual is happening.
It would be bad if we tried to ignite our engines and escape, because we couldn't, any more than the light can escape.
But even if the black hole is dark from the outside, it is not dark inside, because all the light of the Galaxy could come in behind us.
And although due to a phenomenon of the theory of relativity (the so-called time dilation) our clocks seemed to slow down in relation to galactic time, it would seem that the evolution of the Galaxy had accelerated and was coming towards us, just before we were crushed to death by the black hole.
It would be like a near-death experience to see the light at the end of the tunnel. However, it would be a comprehensive death experience.
(Laughter) And you couldn't tell anyone about the light at the end of the tunnel.
Now we have never seen such a shadow of a black hole, but black holes can be heard even if they are invisible.
Please imagine an astrophysically realistic situation. Imagine two black holes that have spent a long life together.
Perhaps it was once stars that collapsed into two black holes, each with a mass ten times that of the Sun.
We now squeeze them to a diameter of 60 km.
They can rotate several hundred times per second.
At the end of their lives, they circle each other almost at the speed of light.
They can travel thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second. And while they do this, they not only bend the space, but they leave in their wake a sounding of space, a real wave of space-time.
Space contracts and expands as it emerges from these black holes and hammers into the universe.
And they travel out into the cosmos at the speed of light.
We owe this computer simulation to a relativity working group at NASA Goddard.
It took almost 30 years for someone to solve this problem.
This was one of those groups.
Here we see two black holes orbiting each other, again with the helpful, painted lines.
Maybe you can see – it's a bit indistinct – but when you see the red waves coming out, those are gravitational waves.
They actually represent the sound of sounding space and will emerge from these black holes at the speed of light as they become quieter and quieter, eventually merging into a spinning, silent black hole.
If you were close enough, the sound of contracting and expanding space would roar in your ears.
You would literally be able to hear the sound.
Of course, your head would also be pressed and stretched, which would be quite uncomfortable, which is why you would also have trouble understanding what is happening.
But I would like to play to you what sounds we would predict here.
This is from my workgroup - a slightly less glamorous computer model.
Imagine that a lighter black hole falls into a very heavy black hole.
What you hear is the sound with which the light black hole hammers on space every time it passes close to it.
If it moves away again, it is a little too quiet.
But it hits like a mallet and literally smashes the universe, makes it swing like a drum.
We can predict how this will sound.
We know: when it falls in, it gets faster and louder.
And finally, we hear the little guy falling into the big guy.
I've never heard this so loud – it's really much more dramatic.
At home, it sounds rather disappointing.
More like ding, ding, ding.
This is another sound from my group.
No, I don't show you pictures, because black holes don't leave helpful ink marks. Space has no colorful, painted lines.
But if you were drifting in space during a space vacation and you would hear this here, then you should make them get away.
(Laughter) You really should get away from that noise.
Both black holes are moving.
Both black holes come closer to each other.
In this case, at first they swing very strongly.
And then they merge.
This chirping is typical of the merging of two black holes, that it chirps at the end.
This is our idea of what we would see.
Luckily, we're at a safe distance here in Long Beach, California.
But there is a high probability that two black holes have just merged somewhere in the universe.
And it is just as certain that space is swinging around us, having probably taken millions of light years, or a million years to travel to us at the speed of light.
But the sound is far too quiet than we could ever hear.
On Earth, experiments are being carried out with great zeal, one of them is called LIGO – the purpose of which is to detect deviations in the way space contracts and expands again, deviations of the order of magnitude smaller than an atomic nucleus on a distance of four kilometers.
It is an incredibly ambitious project and its sensitivity will be further developed in the coming years - in order to be able to perceive this here.
There should also be a mission for space, which will hopefully start within the next ten years. Her name is LISA.
LISA will be able to see huge black holes, black holes with millions or billions of times the density of the Sun.
In this image from the Hubble telescope, we see two galaxies.
They look as if they are frozen in an embrace.
Each probably contains a huge black hole inside.
But they are not frozen. They merge with each other.
These two black holes collide and become one over the course of billions of years.
Our human perceptiveness is not able to grasp a song of such duration.
But LISA could see the final stage of two giant black holes, at an earlier point in the history of the universe, the last 15 minutes before they merge.
And it's not just about black holes, it's also about all the big disturbances in the universe – and the biggest of all is the Big Bang.
When the term was coined, it was meant contemptuously – " Who believes in a Big Bang?«
This animation from friends of mine at Proton Studios shows an exterior view of the Big Bang, the Big Bang.
We never really want to try; we never want to be inside the universe, because you can never be outside the universe.
So imagine that you are in the Big Bang.
He is everywhere, everywhere around you, and space is swirling and swinging completely uncontrollably.
14 Billion years pass, but this song still sounds around us.
Galaxies form and generations of stars are born in these galaxies. And around one of these stars, at least a single one, there is a habitable planet.
And here we sit and work like crazy on these experiments, doing calculations and writing computer code.
Imagine that a billion years ago, two black holes collided.
Their song has been sounding through space ever since, all along.
We didn't even exist then.
It's getting closer and closer – 40,000 years ago we were still painting cave paintings.
If it was the Big Bang we were recording, it would sound like it.
It is literally the epitome of noise.
It's white noise, it's such a chaotic noise.
But it's all around us, probably at least if it wasn't wiped out by some other process in the universe.
When we record it, it will sound like music in our ears, because it will be a quiet echo, an echo of the moment of our creation, of our visible universe.
So within the next two years, we'll be able to make the soundtrack a little louder and make the universe sound.
But if we can capture those very earliest moments, it will bring us much closer to an understanding of the Big Bang, which in turn brings us closer to some of the most complex, elusive questions.
If we played a movie of the universe backwards, we would know that there has been a Big Bang in the past and we could even perceive the cacophony of its sound. But was our Big Bang the only Big Bang?
I think we need to ask the question: has something like this happened before?
Will it repeat itself?
I think in the spirit of the challenge TED presents-to rekindle wonder - we can ask questions, at least at this last minute, that might otherwise elude us forever.
But we have to ask ourselves: is it possible that our universe is just an offshoot of a larger story?
Or is it possible that we are just an offshoot of a multiverse-each offshoot with its own Big Bang in its past-perhaps some of them have drum – playing black holes, others perhaps not – in some there may be intelligent life, in others not-not in our past, not in our future, but yet in some way fundamentally connected to us?
So we have to ask ourselves: if there is a multiverse, do living beings exist in another fragment of this multiverse?
These are my creatures of the multiverse.
Are there other beings in this multiverse who are concerned about us and about their own origins?
And if they exist, I can imagine that they are like us, that they are calculating and writing computer codes, building instruments, trying to make out the most distant sound of their origin and wondering who else is out there.
Thanks. Thanks.

Mamming: Corona-Mass infection: 174 harvest helpers infected
After a corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in Mamming, Lower Bavaria, almost 500 people are quarantined and are no longer allowed to leave the farm.
A security service monitors the ban on going out.
A total of 174 harvest helpers were tested positive for the corona pathogen Sars-CoV-2 during the series examination, as the Dingolfing-Landau district office announced on Saturday evening.
"In order to avoid further spread, we unfortunately have to take this step to protect the population," explained District Administrator Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees had already been infected in the company - this was the occasion of the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm that grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and beetroot - but the cucumbers are only for pickles.
Mamming is a rural municipality with a population of over 3,300 not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder appealed to citizens to keep calm: "According to our information, it is a closed circle of people".
On the farm, infected people were separated from uninfected employees, the site is now surrounded by a barrier fence.

Many people believe that driving a car is an activity reserved only for people who can see.
A blind person who safely and independently drives a car has until now been considered an impossible task.
Hello, my name is Dennis Hong, and we want to give blind people freedom and independence by building a vehicle for the blind.
Therefore, before talking about this car for the blind, let me briefly talk about another project that I worked on and was called the DARBA Urban Challenge.
This was about building a robotized car that can drive itself.
You press start, no one touches anything, and it can reach its destination completely automatically.
Thus, in 2007, our team won half a million dollars by finishing third in the competition.
Around this time, the National Federation of the Blind, or NFB, challenged the Investigation committee to produce a car that could be driven safely and independently by a blind person.
We decided to give it a try because we thought, hey, how difficult can this be?
We already have an automatic vehicle.
We put a blind person in and it's done, right?
(Laughter) We couldn't have been more wrong.
What the National Federation of the Blind (NFB) wanted was not a vehicle for blind people to drive around, but a vehicle where a blind person can make active decisions and drive.
Therefore, we had to throw everything away and start all over again.
Therefore, to test this insane idea, we developed a small buggy prototype vehicle to test its feasibility.
And in the summer of 2009, we invited dozens of young blind people from all over the country and gave them the opportunity to go for a ride.
It was an absolutely great experience.
But the problem with this car was that it was designed so that it could only be driven in a controlled environment, a level, traffic-free parking lot, and that even the lanes were highlighted with red traffic cones.
Therefore, with this success, we decided to take the next big step, to develop a true car that can be driven on the right roads.
So how does it work?
Well, it's a pretty complicated system, but let me try to explain it, and maybe I can simplify it.
Well, we have three steps.
We have perception, calculation and non-visual interfaces.
Well, it is clear that the driver can not see, so the system must be able to perceive the environment and collect information for the driver.
For this, we use an initial measurement unit.
It measures the acceleration, the angular acceleration, like a human ear, an inner ear.
We merge the information with a GPS unit to get approximately the position of the car.
We also use two cameras to detect the lanes of the road.
And we also use three laser distance measurements.
The lasers scan the environment to detect obstacles, a car coming at us from the front or from the back, and also any obstacles coming onto the road, any obstacles around the vehicle.
After that, all this enormous amount of information is passed into the computer, and the computer can do two things.
First, first of all, process the information to understand what the environment is like; these are lanes on the road, the obstacles, and convey this information to the driver.
The system is also smart enough to calculate the safest way to operate the car.
We can also generate instructions on how to operate the vehicle's controls.
But, the problem is this: How can we convey this information and these instructions to a person who cannot see quickly enough and fairly accurately so that he can drive?
For this, we have developed different types of non-visual user interface technology.
We started with a three-dimensional ping sound system, a vibration vest, a click wheel with voice commands, a foot strip, and even a shoe that puts pressure on the leg.
But today, we will talk about three of these non-visual user interface technologies.
Well, the first interface technology is called DriveGrip.
This one is a pair of gloves, and it has its vibrating elements on the ankle side, so you can give instructions on how to control, the direction and the intensity.
Another device is called SpeedStrip.
These are a chair, strictly speaking, it is a massage chair.
We hollow it out, and we reorganize the vibrating elements into different patterns. And we press them to convey information about the speed, and also to convey instructions on how to use the gas and brake pedals.
Therefore, here you can see how the computer sees the environment. And since you can't see the vibration, we even equip the driver with red LEDs so he can really see what's going on.
These are the sensory data, and this data is transmitted to the devices via computer.
Therefore, these two devices, DriveGrip and SpeedGrip, are very effective.
But the problem is that there are stitch instructions devices.
Therefore, this is not a real freedom, is it?
The computer tells you how to drive, turn left, turn right, accelerate, stop.
We call it backseat driver problem.
Therefore, we move away from the stitch instructions devices, and now focus more on the information devices.
A good example of this non-visual information interface technology is AirPix.
Think of it as a monitor for the blind.
Well, it's a small tray, it has a lot of holes and it releases compressed air, so it can even draw pictures.
Therefore, even if you are blind, you can put your hand on it, see the lanes and the obstacles on the road.
In fact, you can likewise change the air frequency that escapes, and possibly the temperature.
Therefore, it is in fact a multidimensional user interface.
Well, here you can look at the left camera, the right camera seen from the vehicle, and see how the computer interprets this and sends the information to the AirPix.
For this, we show a simulator, a blind person driving and using the AirPix.
This simulator was also very useful for training the blind drivers and also fast in testing different kinds of ideas for different types of non-visual user interfaces.
Therefore, this is how it works mainly.
But this vehicle is a prototype, and it will not enter the road until it is proven to be safe, or safer than today's vehicles.
And I really believe that this can happen.
But still, will society, would you accept such a radical idea?
How will we regulate the insurance?
How will we issue driver's licenses?
Apart from the technological challenges, there are many kinds of hurdles that we have to overcome until it becomes a reality.
Of course, the main goal of this project is to make a car for a blind person.
But potentially more important than this is the huge benefit of spin-off technology that can be derived from these projects.
The sensors that are needed can see in the dark in fog and rain.
And together with these new types of interfaces, we can use this technology and apply it in safer cars for people with normal vision.
Or for blind people, in everyday appliances in the home, in training and in the office.
Imagine a teacher writing on the blackboard in a classroom, and a blind student can see and read what he has written using these non-visual interface technologies.
That's priceless.
So, the things I showed you today are just the beginning.
Thank you very much.

Discussing the abolition of the 50 + 1 rule
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended thinking about abolishing the 50+1 rule.
"German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates a fait accompli, "Grindel told the"Bild am Sonntag".
He stressed: "For the clubs that are most likely to be dangerous Bayern and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules do not work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, one cannot avoid the debate whether it is not necessary to facilitate the involvement of investors in associations that want to break into this phalanx".
However, he had doubts whether there was a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority shareholdings, which are prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50+1 rule.
"It remains a legal risk to pull investment fences around the business location Bundesliga in a European internal market," said Grindel.
The former head of the DFB sees the danger that"the attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the Bundesliga ultimately only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but do not lead to more tension in the championship".

Looking at the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there have been people who have noticed this error and poked through to the press instead of addressing it to me," Grindel said of accepting an expensive watch that led to his resignation in April 2019.
"This has already occupied me very much from a human point of view."
He had received the gift, worth around 11,000 euros, from a Ukrainian official.
"I committed a compliance violation, and it was right to take the consequences," Grindel said.
"I handled the ominous watch gift completely transparently and innocently.
Many in the DFB knew about it".
He never "made a secret of the gift," assured the 58-year-old.
"This may be called naive, but this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."

Professionally arrived-not yet privately
"It's going great" - this is the conclusion Dr. Stefanie Kramer draws after her first days in the notary's office in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very quickly: In mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will succeed Lutz Feller in the Eggenfelden notary office.
Just six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the doctor of law started work, the normal daily business has long been running at full speed.
"Privately, however, I still have to arrive," she explains in conversation with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
Of course, the short lead time was not enough to completely move the center of life from Regensburg to Eggenfelden, reports the native Dingolfing woman.
She is currently looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city with her husband, who works as a judge at the regional court in Regensburg.
At least her husband was still able to apply for parental leave at short notice in order to be able to ensure the care of the two daughters (3½ and 1½ years old).
In order not to have to commute from Regensburg every day, she also has an overnight stay with her parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-old.
Growing up in the neighboring district, the city of Eggenfelden has of course long been known to her.
During visits on site with her family in recent months, she said, "Eggenfelden is a really nice small town."
She was all the more pleased that she had made the race for the vacant position in the selection process.
Her homeland of Lower Bavaria also plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career: After studying law in Passau, she completed her legal traineeship and the 2nd state examination in Regensburg.
After several positions as a notary assessor, including in Rehau and Hof in Upper Franconia, Babenhausen in the Lower Allgäu and Regensburg - during this time she also "incidentally" shouldered the doctorate in labor law - she started her first job as a notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016, she took parental leave, followed by the move to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken over representation services in various notarial offices.
When the job in Eggenfelden was advertised because of the approaching retirement of Lutz Feller, she saw the right time for the full professional re-entry, explains the 39-year-old.
Dr. Stefanie Kramer has completely taken over the team of her predecessor, who will take over the vacation representation in the notary's office in the future-and immediately has praise for the team of the law firm ready: "It's going super well!"
The fact that she can rely on well-established processes makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of the private center of life.
She has already made contact with a local institution regarding kindergarten or crèche places.
And if everything works as desired, she hopes to be able to pursue her hobby here soon - and get to know the most beautiful jogging routes of the Rottal.

BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be filled to 20 percent at the start of the season in the event of a fan return.
"Due to the distance regulation, which is mandatory to comply, we are currently planning with 12.000 to 15.000 spectators", said Borussia Dortmund's managing director Carsten Cramer the"Tagesspiegel".
Normally, the arena in the district city holds a little more than 81,000 spectators at Bundesliga matches.
In the ghost games of last season caused by the corona pandemic, BVB lost around four million euros per game.
Cramer, who is responsible for marketing, digitization and internationalization at BVB, hopes that in addition to the normal spectator seats, some of the approximately 4,000 seats in the hospitality area can be opened again: "It is of course a blow to the office if these revenues completely disappear".
In view of the ongoing corona crisis, everyone is currently "well advised to take a stable page length first".
"If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people are in short-time work in Germany alone, then the need for entertainment is limited," Cramer explained.
The Dortmund marketing boss praised the BVB professionals for their partial salary waiver, which should help overcome the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their salary waiver has a different effect than if we put 100 people who work in merchandising on short-time work".

Kalbitz-Expulsion from AfD confirmed-FDP speaks of " Feigenblatt"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is only a "fig leaf" from the point of view of the FDP and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the far right in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD," said FDP interior politician Benjamin Strasser of the dpa news agency in Berlin.
The Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD had confirmed on Saturday in Stuttgart after several hours of negotiation the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the federal Executive Board had decided by a majority in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD group in the Brandenburg state parliament.
"If the AfD were really concerned with consistently removing right-wing extremists from their party, officials like Björn Höcke and his supporters would have been excluded long ago," said Strasser.
"However, there is no political will for this in the AfD, because right-wing extremism is now part of the party."
CSU General Secretary Markus Blume expressed a similar opinion:" The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded says nothing and does not change anything, "he told the"Welt am Sonntag".
"Rather, it speaks volumes how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist in the middle of the AfD still has."
Blume assumes that the AfD will again land below five percent in elections in the future.
"The days of the AfD in the parliaments are numbered".
Kalbitz was one of the spokesmen of the officially dissolved "wing" around the Thuringian AfD state and faction chairman Björn Höcke; the Constitutional protection classifies the Strönung as "secured right-wing extremist aspiration".
In May, the AfD federal executive threw Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason, he stated that Kalbitz had not indicated a previous membership in the now banned right-wing extremist "Heimattreuen Deutschen Jugend" (HDJ) and among the Republicans when he joined the party.
Kalbitz denies membership in the HDJ.
The chairman of the left faction in the Brandenburg state parliament, Sebastian Walter, stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court does not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf has only eaten chalk.
The AfD remains a far-right party, whether with or without Kalbitz".
Neither the Federal Party nor the right wing will be weakened by this decision.
"The maneuver of the Meuthen troops is transparent.
You want to avoid further observation by the Verfassungsschutz and try to get through under the radar, " said Walter.
"The AfD does not get rid of the spirits it called.
A expulsion does not change anything, " commented the Brandenburg SPD General Secretary Erik Stohn the decision in the case of Kalbitz.
"Here the AfD-Landesverband and the faction held to this day to their right leader".
The legal dispute over Kalbitz's membership in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he would now take civil action against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court.

North Sea wind farms deliver a good 21 percent more electricity
The wind power plants on the German North Sea fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid in the first six months of the year.
This is a good 21 percent more than in the same period last year, said the network operator Tennet in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of North Sea electricity to the mainland and the transmission through the German power grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of Tennet's grid area, have fed in an additional 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
In total, wind power from the North Sea and the Baltic Sea comes to 13.73 TWh, compared to just over 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind power in Germany; this is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms increase generation capacity
In addition to the wind conditions, the increased contribution of offshore wind energy results from higher generation capacities, because new wind farms have been connected to the grid in the past twelve months.
If the 1,270 wind power plants in the North Sea were all running at full power at the same time, they could generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatts.
By 2030, it is expected to increase to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore grid connections by then," said Tennet Managing Director Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, even at sea, wind farms are not able to use their capacity, but reach about 40 percent.
The record day so far this year is January 2, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, the equivalent of three to four nuclear power plants.
This could supply nearly seven million households with electricity.

Freital: Windbergfest cancelled due to Corona
The Windbergfest will not take place this year.
The city of Freital has canceled the three-day festival planned in September.
In other years, over 30,000 people had attended this city festival.
"We really did not make this decision easy for ourselves and - aware of how difficult it is economically for those involved - hoped until the last minute," said Lord Mayor Uwe Rumberg (non-party).
"But ultimately, as organizers, we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people."
Because if tens of thousands had poured onto the festival grounds and into the marquee, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact tracking in accordance with the current corona Protection regulation could not have been complied with.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that not much would have remained of a folk festival.
In addition, the organizational and monitoring effort would increase disproportionately many times.
Rumberg put off until next year.

More air traffic controllers in Worms in the future
The University of Worms continues to take to the skies: The "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" is donating a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and will start in 2021.
With the professorship, it is possible to start studies not only in the summer semester, but also in the winter semester.
This means that twice as many students can be trained as before.
At the same time, the capacities of both the university and the DFS Air Navigation Academy are equally utilized.
The DFS will advise the university on the establishment and appointment of the professorship.
Represented at the university since 2019
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students have been enrolled in the Air Traffic Management program as part of their training as air traffic controllers at the University of Applied Sciences Worms.
This year, nine students have already started.
So far, the experiences of the DFS are very positive, the achievements of the students are excellent.
The combination of studies and pilot training makes a significant contribution to further increasing the attractiveness of the pilot profession.
"In these times, extraction is not easy for us economically.
However, we firmly expect air traffic to recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to continue fulfilling our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel, " says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman and CEO of DFS at the signing of the contract.
"For DFS, the endowed professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, interdisciplinary knowledge base in the long term.
We therefore continue the good cooperation with the university and at the same time underpin our attractiveness as an employer".
This is also underlined by Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of the University of Applied Sciences Worms: "The Endowed professorship forms an important bridge between science and industry.
With it, we would like to build on the already existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual Bachelor's program Air Traffic Management."
The trust of German Air Traffic Control is both a motivation and an obligation for Worms University of Applied Sciences to further expand its teaching and research competence in the future fields of aviation.
With the first endowed professorship for a dual course of study, the university can set very special highlights and innovative focal points for its students in their work for the air traffic controllers of tomorrow.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary at the Ministry of Science, Further Education and Culture, emphasizes: "Worms University of Applied Sciences has a unique selling point in Rhineland-Palatinate with its focus on air transport.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the university's profile".

Heil wants to check other industries after meat industry
The corona crisis brought the conditions in parts of the meat industry to light again.
Legislation is about to be tightened.
But are they right - and will they remain so?
Federal Labor Minister Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to check other industries after the now planned strict regulations against maladministration in the meat industry.
"We will look at industry by industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary," Heil told the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employers are already warning against restricting work contracts in general.
After the mass corona outbreak at the meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet wants to pass a law of salvation this Wednesday.
Large slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to use external personnel for slaughter, cutting and meat processing.
For this purpose, the use of contract and temporary workers should be prohibited there.
Employer President Ingo Kramer told the dpa:"Stay away from a general restriction of work contracts and temporary employment, if you do not want to completely choke off the economy".
Contracts for work and services are, for example, for wide areas of the craft, construction industry and plant construction necessarily the basis for their value creation at the customer.
"The misdeeds of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument".
Heil assured:"My goal is not to ban work contracts everywhere in the German economy".
Work contracts make sense.
"When an industrial company commissions a craftsman to install a safety system, this is a normal contract for work."
The German meat industry considers a ban on work contracts and temporary work in its industry alone to be unconstitutional.
It is not explainable, why in the portioning and packaging of cheese should apply in the future different labor law than sausage, it says in a statement on the proposed law, as the" Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung " (Saturday) reports.
A ban would therefore increase the consumer price by 10 to 20 percent per kilo and product.
According to the results of an audit by the NRW Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Eastern European employees from work contract companies often worked in the industry, sometimes 16 hours a day.
Often they did not have a break.
Wages were withheld for protective equipment or rent.
It was also noted that the situation with the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said a relatively sharp law had already come into force for the meat industry in 2017.
However, these were circumvented by" tricky constructions".
"Now we have to clean up fundamentally".
The politician announced:"In the Occupational Health and Safety Act, which we want to pass in the cabinet at the end of July, are also measures that affect not only the meat industry - for example, higher inspection rates for occupational health and safety or clear criteria for shared accommodation".
The draft of the dpa includes amendments to the Law on the Protection of Workers ' Rights in the Meat Industry and the Occupational Safety and Health Act.
Brandenburg's Consumer Protection Minister Ursula Nonnemacher (Greens) considers more intensive controls necessary.
"I would like us to be able to carry out even more inspections in many supervisory areas: food inspections, animal welfare, everything possible, including animal transport, "said Nonnemacher on Sunday in the RBB broadcast"Brandenburg aktuell".
But more controls would also require more staff positions.

Juventus Turin Champions in Italy
Turin-After Cristiano Ronaldo's redeeming goal, record-breaking Juventus secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in a row.
The team around the five-time world footballer completed the 36th Scudetto in the club's history with a 2-0 (1-0) on Sunday night in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo scored 1:0 before half-time.
With 83 points, Turin, which competed without the recently long-injured ex-international Sami Khedira, can no longer be displaced from first place two days before the end of the Serie A season.
Inter Milan are seven points behind.
Juventus, despite optical superiority, was harmless in the first half, then Ronaldo, after a free-kick variant, hit with the last action.
The 35-year-old scored a goal from Miralem Pjanic directly from the penalty spot with a low shot (45.+7).
Against the now more attacking guests Ronaldo was also involved in the 2:0, after his shot dusted Federico Bernardeschi (67.).

Because of the defeat, the Turin team had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
In the end, Juve's reassuring lead at the top of the table was mainly due to the weakness of their competitors.
Because in the eleven games before Sunday's game, the Sarri team had managed only five victories.
Whether Ronaldo will also become the top scorer is questionable.
While the Portuguese superstar has scored 31 goals so far, the former Dortmund Ciro Immobile has 34 goals on his account after his three - pack in the 5:1 (1:1) of the fourth-placed Lazio at Hellas Verona-as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the title win of FC Bayern.

Baden-Württemberg: More than 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart-Despite all the threatened penalties and court rulings, motorists continue to accelerate in countless illegal races on the streets of Baden-Württemberg: Last year and the first four months of this year, the police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
There are no comparable figures for the years before, but the speedsters are increasingly making work for the judicial authorities: In 2018, a total of 155 investigations for illegal races were conducted at the public prosecutor's offices between Konstanz and Mannheim, a year later there were already 252 and in the current year until the beginning of June already 151.
The races were less about organized events, as can be seen from the response of the Ministry of the Interior to a request from the Landtag SPD.
In most cases, the drivers spontaneously competed against each other or they fled the police - this is also reported as an illegal race.
At the wheel were mainly German men between the ages of 18 and 60.
113 Fines-15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases are the speeding drivers caught and also asked to pay: According to the Interior Ministry, a total of 113 fines have been imposed since 2018 and 15 prison sentences have been pronounced.
However, there is no evidence that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
Rather, other motorists reacted more sensitively than before because of the several tragic accidents and processes of past years and indicated more often, said a ministry spokesman.
The Autobahn 8 is particularly popular with racers. Drivers repeatedly slow down the traffic there in order to gain space and use the free track for a race.
Last August, a dozen drivers were caught near Kirchheim unter Teck, three months earlier there were even 18 drivers on the A8 near Merklingen.
A81 is most popular "racetrack"
On the A81, the police register even more races than on any other federal highway.
A speed limit is used there to try to slow down the speeders on the particularly affected section between Engen and Geisingen.
The usually high-priced and revamped sports and luxury cars often have Swiss license plates, because the drivers dodge to Germany because of the high penalties for driving too fast and car races in the neighboring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit must not be reduced to a few routes: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometers per hour, we would get rid of this problem on highways," says Martin Rivoir, the transport expert of the SPD parliamentary group.
"The inhibition threshold for speeders would be significantly higher if you were not allowed to travel legally here and there with 200 kilometers per hour and more".
Rivoir thinks less of education or image campaigns: "Anyone who disregards all the rules in such a way and puts not only their own life but also the lives of other road users at risk is hardly achievable with reason".
ADAC calls for stronger police crackdown
However, this is not enough for ADAC: "We assume that speeding drivers will not be deterred by the speed limits," says Holger Bach, Head of the Transport and Environment department at ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and also tougher controls on the affected routes.
Not infrequently, the high-speed showdown becomes more painful and serious: Since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people died in the races nationwide, two of them uninvolved in a night crash in Stuttgart's city center and one in Gerlingen.
Two young men are said to have run a car race there in November.
One of the vehicles came off the road, hit a garden wall and remained on its side, the 18-year-old passenger died.
21 other people were injured in the races of the past two years.
However, in the opinion of Interior Minister Thomas Strobl, tougher penalties are not necessary:" Legislative action to sanction illegal motor vehicle races harder is not seen, " says the Interior Ministry paper.

The first time I was almost 10 years ago in Antarctica, where I saw my first icebergs.
I was in awe.
My heart was racing, I was dizzy while trying to grasp what was in front of me.
The icebergs around me rose almost 60 meters out of the water. And I could only marvel that this was a snowflake on top of another snowflake, year after year.
Icebergs are born as calves of a glacier or by breaking out of ice floes.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They interact with their environment and experiences in a unique way.
Some refuse to give up and cling to the bitter end, while others can no longer stand it and collapse in a fit of dramatic passion.
When you look at an iceberg, you easily think that they are isolated, separate and alone, just like we humans often see each other.
But the truth is far from it.
As an iceberg melts, I breathe in its ancient atmosphere.
As the iceberg melts, it releases mineral-rich drinking water that feeds many life forms.
In my photographs of these icebergs, I act as if I were taking portraits of my ancestors, aware that they exist in this way in these individual moments, and will never exist like this again.
It is not death when they melt; it is not an end, but a continuation of their path along the life cycle.
Some of the ice in the icebergs I photograph is very young - a few thousand years old.
And part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old.
The last pictures I would like to show you show an iceberg I photographed in Kekertsuatsiak in Greenland.
Very rarely do you actually witness a rolling iceberg.
So here it is.
On the left you will see a small boat.
This is about five meters long.
Please pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and where it is located on the water line.
You can see here, he begins to roll, and the boat has moved to the other side, the man is standing there.
This is the average size of a Greenland iceberg.
It protrudes about 120 feet out of the water, or 40 meters.
And this video is in real time.
(Music) And just like that, the iceberg shows you a different side of his personality.
Thanks.
(Applause)

Nuremberg: Unauthorized tuning meeting-police intervene, 700 vehicles and about 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and at times over 1000 people took part in a "tuning meeting" in the parking lot of a furniture store on Saturday night.
The police implemented their announcement to increase control of such events.
A big tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (25 July 2020) in Nuremberg's Südstadt.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the police of Middle Franconia, an increased volume of vehicles in the area of a large parking lot in Ingolstädter Straße was detected by the Nuremberg traffic police around 10.30 pm.
As a result, the police there carried out a variety of vehicle checks.
Only recently, the police had announced that they wanted to take more action against so-called autoposers.
Illegal tuning meeting in Nuremberg: Only a small part from the " scene"
The officers numbered a good 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, the police said.
However, only a small part of those present can be attributed to the "autoposer" and tuning scene.
Apparently, the majority of the relevant scene complied with the police's appeal.
On the basis of the vehicles and people present on site, it can be assumed that these were predominantly onlookers.
In addition, the majority of those present complied with the applicable infection protection regulations, in particular compliance with the minimum distance and wearing mouth-nose protection.
The control measures carried out on site were completed at about 1:00.
In total, the officials found such structural changes in 10 vehicles that the operating license was extinguished.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.

Figures from the Employment Agency: 900 suspected cases of abuse in short-time work
Berlin-According to its own statement, the Federal Employment Agency (BA) is investigating around 900 suspected cases of abuse of short-time work allowance.
"This is extremely low in the case of more than 880,000 companies that have reported short-time work, "said Daniel Terzenbach, Member of the Executive Board responsible for operating business, to the"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung".
When, at the beginning of the corona crisis, many companies suddenly applied for short-time work, BA had to react quickly.

Evidence of abuse often comes from the employees or unions concerned.
In addition, use the BA analysis software to detect patterns of abuse.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible wave of insolvency in the fall.
"Will there be significantly more insolvencies than in the previous year?
The assessments differ, but we prepare ourselves for the event of the case and already train our employees in the employment agencies for processing applications for insolvency money".
The figures are still inconspicuous, said Terzenbach.

You all know that what I'm about to say is true.
The intuition that inequality weakens social cohesion existed even before the French Revolution.
What is new is that we now have evidence. We can compare societies, more equal and more unequal, and see what inequality does.
I want to show you statistics and explain why there are connections between them.
Look what a miserable bunch we are.
(Laughter) Let me start with a paradox.
This shows life expectancy and gross national income-on average in rich countries.
You can see that the countries on the right, Norway and the USA, for example, are twice as rich as Israel, Greece, Portugal on the left.
And that doesn't change your life expectancy.
There is nothing to suggest a connection.
But within societies, there are huge social disparities in health across society.
Here, once again, life expectancy.
Here are small areas in England and Wales – the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.
A big difference between the poor and the rest of us.
Even the people just below the top are in worse health than those at the top.
So income is very important within individual societies, and not between them at all.
The explanation for this paradox is that within societies we are dealing with a relative income, the social position – the status-where we stand in relation to each other, and how big the distances between us are.
And when you understand this, you immediately ask yourself: what happens when the differences get bigger, or smaller, when income differences rise or fall?
And I'll show you that now.
Not with hypothetical data.
Using data from the UN-the same ones used by the World Bank – on the extent of income disparities in rich developed market democracies.
The measure we use because it is easy to understand and available for download is how much richer the top 20 percent is than the bottom 20 percent of each country.
You see that in the more equal countries on the left-Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden – the top 20 percent are around 3½.4 times as rich as the bottom 20 percent.
But on the other hand – the UK, Portugal, the US, Singapore – the differences are twice as large.
On this scale, we are twice as unequal as some of the other successful market democracies.
Now I'll show you what that does to our societies.
We have collected data on problems with social disparities, the problems that are more common at the bottom of the social ladder.
Internationally comparable data on life expectancy, children's maths, literacy, child mortality and murder rates, the proportion of the population imprisoned, teenage pregnancies, confidence, obesity, mental illness-which in standard diagnosis includes drug and alcohol addiction - and social mobility.
We have summarized them in an index.
All with the same weight.
For each country there is a kind of average value of these factors.
And here you see it in relation to the degree of inequality that I have shown you, which I will come back to again and again.
The more unequal countries fare worse in all these social problems.
This is an unusually high correlation.
But if you put the same index of health and social problems in relation to GNI per capita, to gross national income, there is nothing more, no correlation.
We were worried that people would think that we had only chosen the problems that support our argument and constructed this evidence, so we also published an essay in the British Medical Journal on the UNICEF Index of Child Welfare.
In it, 40 different components were compiled by other people.
The index includes whether children can talk to their parents, whether they have books at home, their immunization rates, whether there is bullying at school.
Everything flows in.
Here is the index relative to our inequality values.
Children fare worse in unequal societies.
A highly significant ratio.
And again, when you compare the index of child welfare to national per capita income, there is no correlation, not even a hint.
All the data I've shown you so far say the same thing.
The average well-being of our societies no longer depends on national income and economic growth.
These are crucial in poorer countries, but not in the rich developed world.
But the differences between us, where we stand in comparison to each other has become very important.
I will now show you individual parts of our index.
Here, for example, is confidence.
Simply the proportion of the population who believe that most people can be trusted.
The data comes from the World Values Survey.
On the more unequal side, about 15 percent of the population believes that others can be trusted.
But in more equal societies it is up to 60 or 65 percent.
And for the degree of integration into communal life or social capital, there are similarly close references to inequality.
We did all this work twice.
First with the rich, developed countries, and then in a second test field again with the 50 American states – with the same question: do the more unequal states perform worse on all these scales?
Here, according to data collected by the US government, trust is related to inequality.
A very similar distribution over a similar range of confidence levels.
The same thing happens here.
Our basic result is that almost all factors related to international trust do the same in the 50 US states, in a separate test environment.
And this is not just a happy coincidence.
Here are mental illnesses.
WHO compiled these figures by conducting the same diagnostic interviews with randomly selected test subjects in order to be able to compare rates of mental illness in societies.
This is the percentage of the population that was mentally ill last year.
It goes from 8 percent to three times that – entire societies that have rates of mental illness three times higher than others.
And again, a high correlation with inequality.
And here violence.
These red dots are American states, the blue triangles are Canadian provinces.
Note the scale of differences.
It goes from 15 murders per million to 150.
That is the proportion of the population that is in custody.
Here there is about a tenfold difference on the lateral log scale.
It goes from about 40 to 400 imprisoned people.
This ratio is not primarily caused by higher crime rates.
In some places this is a partial factor.
But the main reason is tougher court rulings.
And more unequal societies are also more likely to adhere to the death penalty.
Here are children who drop out of school.
Again, pretty big differences.
With devastating effects in terms of the use of talents of the population.
Here is social mobility.
Actually, a measurement of mobility based on income.
The question is: do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons, or is there no connection between them?
On the more unequal side, fathers ' incomes are much more important -- in Britain, in the United States.
And in the Scandinavian countries, the income of fathers is much less decisive.
There is more social mobility.
We like to say - and I know there are many Americans in the audience here-if Americans want to live the American Dream, they should go to Denmark.
(Laughter) (Applause) I've just presented a few things to you now.
I could have shown you a lot of other problems.
All these problems are more common at the lower end of the social gradient.
But there are countless problems with social disparities that are worse in more unequal countries – not just a little, but somewhere between 2 times and 10 times as common.
Imagine these costs, the human costs.
But I want to come back to the graph again, where we summarized everything to show two things.
On the one hand, graph by graph shows that the countries that perform poorly, regardless of the result, are apparently the more unequal, and the ones that are better off seem to be the Nordic countries and Japan.
So what we're seeing is a general social dysfunction that comes with inequality.
This affects not just one or two things, but most of them.
You can see the other very important aspect of this graph down here, Sweden and Japan-very different countries in many ways.
The position of women, however much they hold to the nuclear family, here they lie at opposite poles of the rich, developed world.
Another very important difference is how you achieve your greater equality.
In Sweden there are huge differences in earnings, which are compensated by taxation, the general welfare state, generous social benefits, etc.
In Japan, this is completely different.
There, even before the tax, there are smaller differences in earnings.
There are lower taxes.
A smaller welfare state.
And in our analysis of the American states we find the same contrast.
Some states are successful through redistribution, others are doing well because they have small income differences before tax.
Our conclusion is that it doesn't matter how you get to greater equality, as long as you somehow achieve it.
I do not mean perfect equality, I am talking about something that already exists in rich market democracies.
Another, surprising part of the picture is that it's not just the poor who are affected by inequality.
Apparently there is some truth in John Donne's " No one is an island."
In several studies, one can compare how people in more or less the same countries perform at each level of the social hierarchy.
This is just one example.
Child mortality rate.
Some Swedes have kindly classified much of their childhood deaths according to the British Register of Socio-Economic Classification.
This is an anachronistic classification according to the professions of fathers, so single parents are kept separately.
But where "low social class"is noted, this means unskilled manual labor.
Then there are the skilled manual trades in the middle, then the subordinate non – manual trades, up to the higher-ranking professions-doctors, lawyers, executives of larger companies.
You can see that Sweden is better than Britain, across the entire social hierarchy.
The biggest differences are at the bottom of society.
But even at the top, living in a more equal society seems to bring a small advantage.
We show this in five different data sets that look at parenting success and health in the U.S. and internationally.
That seems to be generally the case – greater equality matters most at the bottom, but has some advantages even at the top.
But I should say something about what's happening.
I am concerned with the psychosocial effects of inequality.
This has to do with feelings of superiority and inferiority, the feeling of being valued or devalued, respected or despised.
And, of course, the sense of status competition that results from this drives consumerism in our society.
In addition, it leads to status uncertainty.
We are more concerned about how we are judged by others, whether we are considered attractive, smart, etc.
The socially judgmental judgments are increasing, and the fear of these judgments.
Interestingly, there is similar research in social psychology: some people evaluated 208 different studies in which volunteers were invited to psychological laboratories to measure their stress hormones and their response to stressful tasks.
What interested them in the evaluation was what types of stress most reliably raised the cortisol level, that of the central stress hormone.
And the result was: tasks that meant a threat to social assessment-threats to self-confidence or social status, in which others can negatively assess their own performance.
These types of stress have a very specific effect on the physiology of stress.
We have been criticised.
Of course, there are people who don't like this and people who find it very amazing.
I should tell you, however, that when we are criticized for a targeted selection of our data, we never specifically select for our purposes.
Our absolute principle is: if our data source has data for one of the countries we are looking at, they come into the analysis.
Our data source determines whether it is reliable data, not us.
Anything else would be bias.
What about other countries?
There are 200 studies on health relative to income and equality in academic peer-reviewed journals.
This is not limited to these countries, this is a very simple demonstration.
The same countries, the same inequality scale, one problem at a time.
Why don't we check other factors?
We have shown that per capita income makes no difference.
And, of course, others have also used more sophisticated methods to check poverty and education, and more.
What about causality?
A correlation does not yet prove causality.
We spent a lot of time with that.
In fact, people know the causal references very well in some of these results.
The big news in our understanding of the driving forces for long-term health in the rich developed world is how much chronic social stress puts a strain on the immune system, the cardiovascular system.
Or, for example, the reason violence is more prevalent in more unequal societies is because people are sensitive to being despised.
To deal with this, we need to clarify what happens after the tax and what happens before the tax.
We need to limit income, the bonus culture-income at the top.
We must hold our bosses accountable to the employees as best we can.
But the takeaway message is that we can improve the actual quality of human life if we fix the income disparities between us.
Suddenly there is a lever for the psychosocial well-being of entire societies, and this is very exciting.
Thanks.

Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualify for Champions League
London (reuters) - Manchester United will return to the Champions League after a one-year absence.
The Red Devils secured third place in the table on the final day of the Premier League by a 2-0 (0-0) success against direct rivals Leicester City.
The Foxes must now be content with the Europa League, because Chelsea FC still passed by and qualified for the premier league as fourth.
In the fight against relegation, Aston Villa was allowed to cheer.
Manchester United took the lead through a penalty from Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in injury time Jesse Lingard (90.+8) hit the final score.
Chelsea, opponents of Bayern in the Champions League round of 16, won in parallel with 2:0 (2:0) against Wolverhampton Wanderers thanks to Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4).
"It means a lot to me," said manager Frank Lampard, who is also in his first season as Chelsea coach in the FA Cup final against Arsenal.
Chelsea's victory against Wolverhampton also benefited Tottenham Hotspur, who still passed Wolves with a meager 1-1 (1-0) at Crystal Palace and will start sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa decided the long-distance duel with Watford and AFC Bournemouth for themselves, but had to tremble at West Ham United for a long time for class preservation.
The late lead of Jack Grealish (84.) equalized Andrei Jarmolenko (85.) immediately.
The 1:1 (0:0) was enough, however, because Watford lost with 2:3 (1:3) at Arsenal.
The club, which had three coaches in the season, is relegated after five first division years.
Just like Bournemouth, who could not save themselves by a 3:1 (2:1) at Everton.
In the end, one point was missing.
Liverpool, the English champions since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3-1 (1-1) victory at Newcastle United.
99 Points is the highest the Reds have ever scored in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team narrowly missed out on the points record in English football.
Manchester City hold the record with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After the Newcastle lead in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38.), Divock Origi (59.) and Sadio Mané (89.) turned the game on Sunday for Liverpool.
"It has been an exceptional season for this wonderful club, "said goalscorer van Dijk after the game," which should spur us on to defend the title.
It will be hard".
In the end, the Premier League bosses should also be satisfied.
Due to the coronavirus crisis, football operations in England were interrupted from 13 March to 17 June.

I want to show you today how we will make things in the future.
I believe that our buildings and machines will soon assemble, duplicate and repair themselves.
I will show you what I think of today's production methods, and then compare them with some natural systems.
In the current manufacturing industry, we have skyscrapers-two and a half years [construction time], half to a million parts, quite complex, new and exciting technologies of steel, concrete, glass.
We have exciting machines that take us into space – five years [of construction], two and a half million parts.
On the other hand, if you look at natural systems, you find proteins that have two million types and can fold in ten microseconds, or DNA with three billion base pairs that can be copied in about an hour.
So there's all this complexity in our natural systems, but they're extremely efficient, much more efficient than anything we can make, far more complex than anything we can build.
They are much more energy efficient.
They almost never make mistakes.
And they are durable, since they can repair themselves.
So there's a lot of interesting things to discover about natural systems.
And if we manage to incorporate that into our built environment, then we have exciting potential for new ways of building.
And I believe that the key is in self-assembly.
If we want to use self-assembly in our physical environment, I think there are four key factors.
The first is that we have to decipher the whole complexity of the things we want to build – our buildings and machines.
And we have to translate that into simple sequences - sort of the DNA of how our buildings work.
Then we need programmable parts that can pull this sequence and use it to fold or reconfigure.
We need activation energy so that our parts can fold up from the program.
And we need a kind of redundancy for error correction, so that what we want to build really arises.
I will show you some projects that my colleagues and I at MIT are working on so that self-assembly can be realized in the future.
The first two are MacroBot and DeciBot.
These projects are large-scale, reconfigurable robots-proteins two and a half to four meters long.
They are equipped with electromechanical devices, sensors.
You decode what you want to fold into a sequence of angles – so minus 120, minus 120, 0, 0, 120, minus 120 – something like that; a sequence of angles, or rotations, and you send that sequence through the chain.
Each unit picks up its message – that is, minus 120-it rotates accordingly, checks whether it has arrived, and forwards it to the neighboring unit.
These are the brilliant scientists, engineers and designers who worked on this project.
And I think it makes one thing really clear: is this really scalable?
I mean, thousands of dollars, many hours of work to create this two and a half meter tall robot.
Can we really scale this up? Can we really embed robotics in every part?
The next project questions this and looks at the passive nature or passive attempt to make reconfiguration programmable.
But it goes a step further and tries to make actual calculations possible.
It basically integrates the most fundamental component of EDP, the digital logic gate, directly into the parts.
This is a NAND gate.
You have a tetrahedron, which is the gate that will do the calculations, and you have two input tetrahedra.
One represents the user's input while making the blocks.
The other comes from the previous component that was arranged.
And then it delivers an output in three-dimensional space.
This means that the user can enter what the components should do.
It performs calculations based on what it has done before and what the user requires of it.
And now it begins to move in three-dimensional space - up and down –
On the left, the input [1,1] corresponds to the output 0 going down.
On the right side, the input [0,0] corresponds to the output 1, which goes up.
What this really means is that our structures now contain the plans of what we want to build.
So you have all the information about what was built.
This means we can achieve a form of self-replication.
In this case, I call it self-guided replication because the structure contains the exact blueprints.
If errors occur, you can replace a part.
All the local information is integrated to show how to fix it.
So you could have something that climbs along and reads and delivers an output of one to one.
It is directly integrated; there are no instructions from the outside.
The last project I'm going to show is called Biased Chains, and it's probably the most exciting example of self-assembling systems we have right now.
It takes up the ability to reconfigure and program and creates a completely passive system.
Basically, you have a chain of elements.
Each element is completely identical and they are polarized.
Each chain, or element, wants to rotate to the right or to the left.
So while you're putting the chain together, you're basically programming it.
Each unit is told whether to turn to the right or to the left.
When you shake the chain, it folds into a configuration that you have programmed – in this case a spiral or in this case two cubes lying next to each other.
So you can basically program every possible three – dimensional shape – or one-dimensional, two-dimensional-completely passively into this chain.
What does this tell us about the future?
I think that it tells us that there are possibilities of self-assembly, replication and repair in our physical structures, our buildings and machines.
There are new ways of programming in these parts.
And this creates new opportunities for IT.
We will have spatial programming.
Imagine if our buildings, bridges, machines, all our components could perform calculations.
This would mean parallel and distributed computing power, new design possibilities.
So there is an exciting potential for this.
I think that these projects that I have shown here are just a tiny step towards that future as we implement these new technologies for a new, self-creating world.
Thanks.

Arrests and violence in demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against Netanyahu's government are becoming increasingly violent.
During the night there were violent clashes.
The Israeli police violently attacked participants in a demonstration against the right-wing conservative prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Sunday night.
Twelve people have been arrested for participating in riots, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said.
Among other things, the police used water cannons to disperse the rally.
According to media reports, around 6,000 people had gathered near Netanyahu's official residence on Saturday evening.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu's handling of the corona crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew horns and called on Netanyahu to resign.
Participants of a counter-demonstration supporting Netanyahu were also arrested, the news site "ynet" reported.
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the head of government's private villa in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man has been arrested near Tel Aviv on suspicion of spraying pepper spray on roadside protesters from a moving car, according to police.
Another man was arrested after a knife attack on a protester in the south of the country.
The protester was slightly wounded in the neck.
There have been several demonstrations against Netanyahu in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
The rallies accompany the corruption trial against the head of government.

North Korea seals off border town after Corona suspected case
North Korea has so far seen a "shining success"in its own measures to ward off the coronavirus.
Now the country reports for the first time about a suspected case.
Due to a first official corona suspected case in the country, North Korea has completely sealed off a major city for fear of a disaster.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defenses in the past six months, " the malignant virus may have been introduced into the country," the state media reported.
The state of emergency had been imposed for the region around the border town of Kaesong.
The communist leadership raised the highest level of alarm.
If confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the isolated country.
According to North Korea, it had not registered a single infection so far and described its defensive measures as a "shining success".
The information was doubted abroad.
The symptoms of the disease were reportedly found in an "outlier" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
The person had left for South Korea three years ago and has now returned across the border.
There was initially no confirmation from South Korea of the border crossing within the four-kilometer-wide and largely still mined military buffer zone.
South Korea's military, however, acknowledged the possibility of an illegal border crossing into North Korea as high, according to reports by the national news agency Yonhap.
There were investigations on some people.
North Korea reportedly called an emergency meeting of the Politburo of the Workers ' Party chaired by leader Kim Jong Un on Saturday because of the suspected case.
The " dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive catastrophe."
Kim had already ordered on Friday, as a preventive measure," to completely block Kaesong and isolate each district and the region from others, " it added.
The person concerned and all people in Kaesong who had been in contact with her had been quarantined.
Accordingly, the central military commission of the party should investigate the "runaway case", as well as the behavior of the responsible military unit, and, if necessary, impose harsh punishment.
According to estimates, about 300,000 people live in Kaesong.

Tension before council meeting: City-Ost and noise protection are still up for discussion before the big summer break
"In addition to environmental issues, the committee members will also vote on the development plan for the large-scale project Innenstadtentwicklung-Ost," it says rather casually in the middle section of the municipal press release for the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, July 28, at 4.30 pm in the Great Hall of the Congresscentrum Pforzheim.
In particular, the upgrading of the eastern city is controversial until the end.
The majorities for this are narrow, most recently in individual committees, depending on the presence, even negative.
After almost ten years of preparation, project opponent Reinhard Klein criticized an appeal from the economy (construction, real estate, trade and IT) not to let the project developed by the citizenry and then by the administration and the municipal council fail now as "extra-parliamentary opposition", "clueless", "speculation", "denigration" and "deliberate false statements".
"Everyone thinks they know better," says Klein, who has been a member of the municipal council for a year as the only representative of the Pforzheim citizens ' list.
In fact, after reading the treaties, he is in this position:"I know what I am talking about".
The exit comes the city cheaper, the Technical town Hall is contrary to statements of the city administration after grants, of whose existence Klein is convinced, to renovate for 8,5 million euros.
The city will develop very differently than predicted in the city hall and by supporters from the economy.
One day after Klein, the FDP/FW/UB/LED group, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It essentially also provides for the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, the keeping of the Schloßberg open, the leasing of the former for administrative areas and a more detailed inner city redesign, ideally with local carriers.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues will play a central role.
Among other things, the municipal council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the population of Pforzheim from health-related noise pollution caused by road traffic, including speed reductions in many cases.
In a press release, the local transport club Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of 30 km / h. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of the fact that this has to happen, because they have contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus noise by neglecting the regular bus service with thinned bars and by little commitment to cycling, according to the VCD.
The municipal council also votes on the participation of the city of the Energy and Climate Protection Agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
In addition, the agenda includes the accession to the Climate Protection Pact of the State of Baden-Württemberg, the redefinition of parental contributions in the municipal day care facilities and the application for admission to the Smart City funding of the federal government.

Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with a lot of delay
With a delay of almost half a year, Tim Zimmermann will start his first season in the ADAC GT Masters on 31 July.
Before the League of Super Sports cars can start regular operation, the first test drives were now on.
For Zimmermann, it was all about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 better.
For a long time, the corona crisis prevented Tim Zimmermann from taking his first official ride in the new Lamborghini Huracan from Grasser Racing.
Under special hygiene conditions, this was now possible.
The 23-year-old Langenargener turned his first laps at the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his debut in the GT3 car.
"There are already a few things that are different from the Porsche from the previous season," says Zimmermann.
"With the ABS, for example, you have to go into the corners differently.
But it was really a lot of fun".
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite being only 25 years old, the Dutchman is already experienced in GT sports and was able to help his new team-mate in many things.
"I'm not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series brings new challenges," says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I get along brilliantly and we have made enormous progress from session to session at the Lausitzring."
Right there - at the Lausitzring-the GT Masters will also host its first race.
From 31 July, the 33 supercars will race through Lusatia.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 newcomers to the series, knows the route.
in 2015 he was a guest at the Motodrom.
"It worked quickly and I didn't have to get used to the track much," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafen racing community Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has many fast passages that you have to hit optimally to be fast".
How fast Zimmermann really is, it turns out in two weeks.
"Of course, the teams play poker a little during the tests," he says.
"In the end, however, we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring".
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a crowded calendar.
There are seven races until the beginning of November.

UK Transport minister caught cold by quarantine decision
The British government's decision to quarantine Spanish holidaymakers for two weeks after their return has caught the country's transport minister cold, according to press reports.
According to this, Grant Shapps is currently on vacation in Spain, while his colleagues at home decided on Saturday the measure.
Due to the rising corona numbers in Spain, the Cabinet in London removed the country from the list of countries from which entry without quarantine restrictions is possible.
The new rule will apply from today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to be quarantined after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But the rule applies to those who are just on holiday on the deadline, only from Saturday, August 1, and was not introduced overnight.
By the way, Spain in Austria is still considered one of the "safe countries" for which quarantine in Austria is not required.
"Many ministers may have known in advance that there is a possibility that a quarantine will be imposed on holidaymakers in Spain," commented Labour MP Diane Abbot.
"But apparently no one bothered to tell Grant Shapps".

Do you know how many types of flowering plants there are?
A quarter of a million – this is the number of known species – a quarter of a million species of flowering plants.
And flowers are real devils.
Plants have great difficulty producing them.
They require a huge amount of energy and raw materials.
Why do you bother?
The answer to this is, of course, as to so much in the world: sex.
I know what you're thinking when you look at these pictures.
And the answer to why sexual reproduction is so important -- there are many other ways for plants to reproduce.
Take offshoots; they can have sex with themselves, so to speak; they can pollinate themselves.
But they actually have to spread their genes to mix them with other genes so they can occupy ecological niches.
This is how evolution works.
Plants pass this information on pollen.
Some of you may have seen a few of these images before.
As I always say: everyone would have to have a scanning electron microscope at home to see them.
There are as many different types of pollen as there are flowering plants.
And this is very useful for forensics and so on.
Most of the pollen that causes hay fever comes from plants that use the wind to spread their pollen. This is a very inefficient process, which is why so much of it ends up in our noses.
Because the plants throw out very large quantities, hoping that the male sex cells that are in the pollen will only accidentally hit another flower.
All grasses, i.e. all cereal plants and most trees transport pollen through the wind.
But most species use insects for their purposes. And this is the smarter way, because so less pollen is needed.
The insects and other species can bring the pollen directly to their destination.
We are, of course, aware of the relationship between insects and plants.
This is a symbiotic relationship. Whether flies, birds or bees, they also benefit from it, usually through the nectar.
This symbiosis has led to some wonderful adaptations - the hummingbird hawk moth is a beautiful adaptation.
The plant benefits from the fact that the hummingbird spreads the pollen further.
Plants have developed small runways for bees, which otherwise will not find their way.
On many plants there are markings that resemble other insects.
These are the anthers of a lily, a very clever construction. When an unsuspecting insect lands on her, the bags fold up and hit the insect on the back, where the pollen gets stuck and is taken to other plants.
This is an orchid that looks like it has a mouth. The insects are forced to crawl out and are covered by pollen.
There are at least 20,000 species of orchids - an impressive variety.
And they have all sorts of tricks in store.
You need to attract pollinators to help you.
This orchid, known by the investigations of Charles Darwin, who at the sight of it put forward a magnificent thesis. You see a very long nectar tube going down from the orchid.
And what insects have to do there in the middle of the flower - they have to put their little proboscis in there and down the whole nectar tube to get the nectar.
And when Darwin saw this flower he said, " Something must have developed in parallel with it."
And indeed, here is this insect.
Usually it rolls up the proboscis, but in its stretched form it looks like this.
You can imagine that if nectar is so valuable and laborious for the plant to produce and attracts many pollinators, then it's like human sex, people begin to deceive.
They say, " I have nectar, will you come and get it?"
This is a plant.
This is a plant that insects simply love in South Africa. And they have developed a long proboscis to get at the nectar.
And this is a copycat,
a plant that copies the original.
And here is the fly with a long proboscis that did not get nectar from the imitator. Because the imitator, unlike the fly expects, has no nectar at all.
But not only did the fly not get nectar, it also has - if you look very closely, at the head of the proboscis you see pollen that it would have transferred to other plants, if only a botanist had not come by and glued it on blue paper.
(Laughter) Deception runs throughout the plant kingdom.
These black dots on er flower, they look like black dots for us, but for male insects of certain species they look like two females that are very hot.
(Laughter) And when the insect lands there, it picks up pollen, which it brings to other plants. If you look at the"every-household-should-have-one" electron microscope image, you see that there are certain three-dimensional patterns.
It probably not only looks good for the insect, but also feels good.
And these electron microscope images - here one of an orchid imitating an insect-show that different parts of the shape have different colors and seemingly different surfaces, and for the perception of an insect, the textures are very, very different.
This plant has developed the imitation of a shiny metallic surface, as seen on some beetles.
And under the electron microscope, you can see that this surface is very different from the one we've been looking at so far.
Sometimes the whole plant imitates an insect, even in our perception.
I think it looks like a flying animal.
It's a wonderful thing.
This one is clever. It's called Obsidium.
I sometimes consider them insidious.
For certain bees, it looks like another, particularly aggressive bee, so it flies there and hits it several times on the head to drive it away and of course absorbs a lot of pollen.
At the same time, this plant imitates another orchid, which has a rich supply of food for insects.
But this one has nothing for you.
So she cheats on two levels-fabulous.
(Laughter) Here we see the cananga tree, an ingredient in many perfumes.
I smelled one on someone earlier.
The flowers should actually not be so colorful.
They send a fantastic spectrum of scents to all insects.
This one doesn't smell so good.
This is a flower that smells really hideous and this has evolved to mimic carrion.
Therefore, they love flies.
They fly in and pollinate them.
This is a helicodiceros, also known as a"dead horse".
I do not know what a dead horse smells like, but the plant probably hits it quite well.
It's really terrible.
And throwing flies can not restrain themselves.
They fly in all the way to the back
and lay their eggs there, they think it's carrion, without realizing that there is no food for the eggs that die because of it, but the plant benefits because the fly full of pollen flies on again and pollinates the next flower - fantastic.
This is Arum maculatum, the Spotted Aron Staff.
I photographed him in Dorset last week.
It heats up to about 15° above ambient temperature-fascinating.
And if you look inside the plant, there is a kind of barrier behind the inflorescences. Flies are attracted to the heat that creates volatile chemicals and are then trapped in the bottom of the container.
They drink the wonderful nectar and are sticky afterwards.
At night they get a pollen shower and then the bristles that we saw above slacken, clearing the way for the mosquitoes that are full of pollen-great thing .
If you think that's great, here comes one of my favorites.
This is the Philodendron Selloum.
In case someone from Brazil is here, you will know the plant.
She's really fascinating.
This species phallus there is about 30cm long.
And he does something that no other plant I know does when he blooms. There in the middle are the inflorescences-for about 2 days it has a metabolism that is very similar to that of mammals.
Instead of feeding on starch, which is the food of plants, it takes something similar to brown adipose tissue and burns it so quickly that the rate of fat burning, metabolism, is equal to that of a small cat.
This is twice the energy production of a hummingbird, in relation to weight - insanely impressive.
But he does something else that is unusual.
It not only heats up to 43-44 °C for about 2 days, but maintains a constant temperature.
He can regulate his temperature and thereby keep it constant.
They ask themselves: "Why does he do this?"
As you can guess, there are some bugs that love to mate at this temperature.
And they fly in and set off.
(Laughter) And the plant showers them with pollen, and they fly on and pollinate.
What a wonderful thing.
The typical pollinator for us is an insect. But in the tropics, many birds and butterflies also pollinate.
And many tropical flowers are red and we believe this is because birds and butterflies look similar to us and therefore can see the color red very well.
If you look at the spectrum of birds and humans, we see red, green and blue so this spectrum here.
Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet, and different levels of ultraviolet.
So something that goes further behind our spectrum.
And I hear them ask, " Wouldn't it be great if we could see that too?"
Of course we can.
So what does an insect see?
Last week I took a picture of this little sunbeam in Dorset.
As you can see, these are little yellow flowers, little yellow flowers everywhere.
And this is how they look in visible light.
This is what it looks like when you take out the red.
Most bees do not see red.
And then I photographed with ultraviolet filters and exposed the special ultraviolet frequencies for a very, very long time and that came out of it.
And that's a fantastic target.
We don't know exactly what bees see, just like they don't know what I see when I say "That's red".
We cannot look into the thoughts of insects or other people.
But the contrast will be something like this. She stands out against the background.
Here is another small bloom - different bandwidth of ultraviolet frequencies, other filters similar to pollinators.
And that's what you'd see.
If you think now all yellow flowers have this property - no flower was harmed for this picture; it was only attached to the tripod, not killed-but under ultraviolet light it looks like this.
And this could serve as the basis of a sunscreen, because sunscreens absorb UV light.
The substances in the plant could be helpful.
Finally, we have a evening primrose that Bjorn Rorslett sent me from Norway-fantastic hidden patterns .
I love the idea of hidden things.
I think there is something poetic in it. Namely, that these images were taken with UV filters, filters that are mainly used by astronomers to photograph Venus - more precisely, its nebulae.
That is the main purpose of these filters.
Venus is the goddess of love and fertility, and this, in turn, is the history of flowers.
And flowers not only show great efforts to attract pollinators, they also manage to make us plant large fields full of them and give them to each other at births and deaths, and especially at weddings, which, if you think about it, are the moment when the exchange of genetic material from one organism to another is fixed.
Many thanks.

Greta Thunberg: Evil eye against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest on Stephen Colbert's well-known Latenight show via video link and revealed in an interview what she had in mind when she met Donald Trump.
Klimaatkivistin Greta Thunberg was a guest on a popular US Latenight show via video link.
Among other things, she told about her struggle against the powerful of the world.
The teenager also spoke about her famous "evil eye" during her encounter with Donald Trump.
New York City-Over the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has drawn attention to herself with her tireless commitment to the "Fridays For Future"movement.
Now she spoke on a well-known Latenight show about her plans in the future, as well as her meeting with US President Donald Trump at the UN climate summit last year.
Latenight host Stephen Colbert welcomed 17-year-old Thunberg to your show on Tuesday and conducted a longer interview with the Swede.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the world's powerful.
"There are some things that surprised me," she said.
"How far people go to steer the focus away from the climate crisis," she said.
"Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats just because a group of children takes to the streets," she said.

It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was asked about a well-known scene in which she cast a bitter look behind US President Trump.
At the 2019 UN Climate Summit in New York, for which the actvist sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive gaze was caught by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
The short clip turned into a GIF, that is, an animated image, which ultimately became one of the most used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the US president at that moment?
To Stephen Colbert's relatively open question, she answered only briefly and dryly:"To be honest, I don't think that needs any further explanation".
The experienced satirist Colbert probably did not expect the quick-witted answer and briefly disappeared from the picture laughing.
With their " How dare you?"- Speech on the principles of climate protection, she was remembered by many at the climate conference.

Fleetwood Mac Co-Founder Peter Green Dies
His life was like a rollercoaster ride: after a rapid ascent with Fleetwood Mac, it went steeply downhill and then slowly uphill again.
Now the blues rock guitarist Peter Green has died at the age of 73.
Brilliant guitarist, drug junkie, cult follower: the co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 73, family members said in an official statement on Saturday, another statement would be announced for the next few days.
Top musicians such as Peter Frampton recognized Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
In an emotional response, Mick Fleetwood spoke of a" monumental loss " for all former and current members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
Drummer Fleetwood and guitarist Green had founded the now legendary band in London in 1967, his dreamy instrumental hit "Albatross"is still unforgotten today.
The life of the musician ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") resembled a roller coaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated their greatest successes but then without him.
Among other things, there was a dispute because Green wanted to donate all the profits of the group to charity.
He began to perform in wide robes and with a large crucifix.
Psychological problems are also said to have played a role.
Green left the band in 1970, just three years after the band's formation.
A social decline followed.
The blues rock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographers reported.
For a long time, Green was treated in psychiatry.
During much of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the scene.
He is said to have lived on the streets for a time, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent time in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946 to a Jewish working-class family in the London borough of Bethnal Green.
From a young age he was enthusiastic about US blues musicians such as B. B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of eleven he learned the first guitar handles.
At the age of 15, the teenager began to play the guitar professionally, and five years later got the chance to perform on stage as the lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
A little later, he was hired as a replacement for his idol Eric Clapton with the Bluesbreakers.
In the middle of the blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 together with his Bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross", composed by Green, gave the group their first number one hit in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted them to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed its dark sides: Green could not cope with the media hype, his experiments with the drug LSD became more and more extreme.
He later commented on life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in life is the drugs - the best thing was to land a number 1 hit".
Towards the end of the decade, Green achieved a surprising success in 1979 with an album inspired by religious themes.
Fleetwood Mac, meanwhile, swam without him in a new formation on a wave of success.
Her 1977 album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Despite various small solo successes, Green did not make a major comeback until 1996, when he started again with a group of friendly musicians.
The British "Daily Telegraph" spoke at the time of a rock star returned to Earth.
