P. 381 Jan Christopher Horak wrote: "At the same time, the film is a remarkable achievement of the director.
We are not supposed to know.
You could have known.
Please all realize for a moment a very simple fact: Pretty much everything we know about the universe we know by light.
We can stand on Earth and look up at the night sky and see stars with our naked eyes.
The sun burns our peripheral vision.
We see light reflected from the moon.
and in the time that has passed since Galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope at the celestial bodies, the universe we know has traveled to us as visible light, traversing immeasurable ages of cosmic history.
With the help of all our modern telescopes, we have been able to study it all: this stunning silent movie of the universe, this series of snapshots going back to the Big Bang.
But the universe is not a silent movie, because the universe is not silent.
I want to convince you that the universe has a soundtrack and that this soundtrack is played in space itself: For space can vibrate like a drum.
It can sound a kind of sound recording that can be heard throughout the universe; of some of the most dramatic events as they occurred.
Now we would like to add a sonic component to the wonderful visual arrangement we have of the universe.
And even if we've never heard the sounds of the universe until now, over the next few years we should slowly turn up the volume knob for what's happening out there.
It is out of this ambition to capture songs of the universe that we turn our interest to black holes and their inherent promise. Black holes, in fact, pound against space-time like wooden mallets on a drum. They have a very characteristic sound that I would like to play for you; or our imagination of what that song will sound like.
One day we may see a shadow cast by a black hole against a bright background, but so far we have not been able to.
And yet, black holes can be heard, even when they are invisible. The reason is that they play on space-time like on a drum.
We owe the idea that the universe sounds like a drum to Albert Einstein, to whom we owe so much.
Einstein realized that if space were empty, if the universe were empty, it would have to look like this picture, only without this helpful grid.
But if we were moving through space in free fall, even without this helpful grid, then perhaps we could paint it ourselves. For we would recognize that we are moving along straight lines, along undistorted, straight paths through the universe.
Einstein also recognized (and this is the point) that when you put energy or mass into the universe, it bends the universe. If a body in free fall, say, were to pass by the Sun, it would be distorted, along the natural lines of curvature in space.
This is Einstein's great theory of general relativity.
Even light is bent along these paths.
And a body can be bent so much that it goes into orbit around the sun, like the earth, or like the moon in orbit around the earth.
These are natural curvatures in space.
What Einstein didn't know was this: If you were to take the sun and compress it into a ball six kilometers in diameter, if you were to take something with a mass a million times that of the earth and compress it to six kilometers, you would create a black hole; a body of such density that light passing too close to it could never escape. It would be a black shadow in front of the universe.
But Einstein thought black holes were a mathematical curiosity all his life.
He did not believe that they really existed.
He was convinced that nature would protect us from their formation.
It would be decades before the term "black hole" was coined and people realized that black holes are astrophysical bodies. In fact, they are the lifeless state form of extremely dense stars that collapse in a horrific catastrophe at the end of their lives.
Our sun, on the other hand, will not end up as a black hole.
It is simply not big enough for that.
But we did a little thought experiment, just as Einstein liked to do. Let's imagine that we compress the sun to six kilometers in diameter and put a tiny earth in its orbit, say 30 kilometers away from this black sun.
This earth would shine by itself, (because since the sun would then be gone, there would be no other source of light) so we let our little earth shine by itself.
We could put the earth in a carefree orbit about 30 km away from the squashed black hole.
This squashed black hole would be about the size of Manhattan.
It would pour into the Hudson a little bit before it destroyed the Earth.
But that's about what we're talking about.
We're talking about something that can be squeezed until it's half the size of Manhattan.
Now we bring the Earth in very close, to about 30 kilometers, and watch it move around the black hole in a perfectly perfect orbit.
There is a sort of myth that black holes swallow up everything in the universe, but in fact you have to get very close to them to fall in.
But what is particularly impressive from our point of view is the fact that we can always see the Earth.
It cannot hide behind the black hole.
The light that comes from the Earth, some of it falls in, but some of it is scattered and returns to us.
So you can't hide anything behind a black hole.
If this is Battlestar Galactica and you're fighting the Cylons, you better not hide behind the black hole.
They can see it.
So our sun will not collapse into a black hole, its mass is not enough for that. But there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
If one of them obliterated the Milky Way, it would look like this.
We would see a shadow of the black hole, against the background of billions of stars of the Milky Way Galaxy and their luminous dust lanes.
If we were to fall toward this black hole, we would see all the light bending around it, and we could even enter the shadow without noticing anything unusual happening.
It would be bad if we tried to fire our thrusters and escape, because we couldn't, any more than the light could escape.
But even if the black hole is dark on the outside, it is not dark on the inside, because all the light in the galaxy could come in behind us.
And although, due to a phenomenon of relativity (called time dilation), our clocks seemed to go slower in relation to galactic time, it would appear as if the galaxy's evolution had accelerated and was hurtling toward us just before we were crushed to death by the black hole.
It would be like a near-death experience, seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. However, it would be a full death experience.
(Laughter) And you couldn't tell anyone about the light at the end of the tunnel.
Now we have never seen such a shadow of a black hole, but black holes can be heard, even if they are invisible.
Please imagine an astrophysically realistic situation. Imagine two black holes that have spent a long life together.
Perhaps they were once stars that collapsed into two black holes, each with a mass ten times that of the Sun.
We now squeeze them together to a diameter of 60 km.
They can spin several hundred times per second.
At the end of their lives, they orbit each other almost at the speed of light.
They can travel thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second. And as they do so, they not only bend space, but they leave in their wake a ringing of space, a veritable wave of space-time.
Space contracts and expands as they pour out of these black holes and pound the universe.
And they travel out into the cosmos at the speed of light.
We have a relativity working group at NASA Goddard to thank for this computer simulation.
It took almost 30 years for someone to solve this problem.
This was one of those groups.
Here we see two black holes orbiting each other, again with the helpful lines painted on them.
Maybe you can see - it's a little fuzzy - but if you see the red waves coming out, those are gravitational waves.
They actually represent the sound of sounding space, and they're going to come out of these black holes at the speed of light as they get quieter and quieter and eventually merge into a spinning, silent black hole.
If you were close enough, the sound of space contracting and expanding would roar in your ears.
You would literally be able to hear the sound.
Of course, your head would also be squeezed and stretched, which would be quite uncomfortable, which is why you would also have trouble comprehending what was happening.
But I would like to play for you what sounds we would forecast here.
This one is from my working group - a slightly less glamorous computer model.
Imagine a lighter black hole falling into a very heavy black hole.
What you hear is the sound of the light black hole pounding on space every time it passes close.
When it moves away again, it's a little too quiet.
But it hits like a mallet and really smashes the universe, making it vibrate like a drum.
We can predict what that will sound like.
We know: When it falls in, it will get faster and louder.
And finally, we hear the little guy fall into the big guy.
I've never heard it that loud before - it's really much more dramatic.
At home, it sounds rather a bit disappointing.
More like ding, ding, ding.
This is another sound from my group.
No, I'm not showing you any pictures, because black holes don't leave helpful ink trails. Space doesn't have colorful, painted-on lines.
But if you were drifting in space during a space vacation and you would hear this, you should make that you get away.
(Laughter) You should really get away from this sound.
Both black holes are moving.
Both black holes are getting closer to each other.
In this case, first they oscillate very strongly.
And then they merge.
This chirping is typical of the merging of two black holes, that it ends up chirping like this.
This is our idea of what we would see.
Fortunately, we're at a safe distance here in Long Beach, California.
But in all likelihood, somewhere in the universe, two black holes have just merged.
And it's just as certain that space is oscillating around us, having probably taken millions of light years, or traveled a million years at the speed of light to get to us.
But the sound is much too quiet for us to ever hear it.
On Earth, experiments are being conducted with great zeal, one of them called LIGO - designed to detect deviations in the way space contracts and expands, deviations on the order of smaller than an atomic nucleus over a distance of four kilometers.
It's an incredibly ambitious project, and its sensing capabilities will be developed even further over the next few years - to be able to sense this.
There's also supposed to be a mission for space that will hopefully launch within the next ten years. It's called LISA.
LISA will be able to see giant black holes, black holes millions or billions of times the density of the sun.
In this image from the Hubble telescope, we see two galaxies.
They look as if they have solidified in an embrace.
Each probably harbors a giant black hole inside.
But they are not solidified. They are merging together.
These two black holes collide and become one over billions of years.
Our human perceptual ability is not capable of detecting a song of such duration.
But LISA could see the final stage of two giant black holes at an earlier time in the history of the universe, the last 15 minutes before they merge.
And it's not just about black holes, it's about all the big perturbations in the universe - and the biggest of them all is the Big Bang.
When the term was coined, it was meant contemptuously - "Who believes in a big bang, a big bang?"
This animation by friends of mine at Proton Studios shows an outside view of the Big Bang, the Big Bang.
We never really want to try that; we never want to be inside the universe because you can never be outside the universe.
So imagine that you are inside the Big Bang.
It's everywhere, all around you, and space is wobbling and oscillating completely out of control.
Fourteen billion years go by, but that song is still ringing out around us.
Galaxies are forming and generations of stars are being born in those galaxies. And around one of these stars, at least a single one, orbits a habitable planet.
And here we sit, working like crazy on these experiments, making calculations and writing computer code.
Imagine that a billion years ago, two black holes collided.
Their song has been ringing through space ever since, all this time.
We didn't even exist then.
It's getting closer and closer - 40,000 years ago we were still painting cave pictures.
If it was the Big Bang we were recording, it would sound like this.
It's literally the epitome of noise.
It's white noise, it's such a chaotic noise.
But it's all around us, probably anyway, if it hasn't been obliterated by some other process in the universe.
When we record it, it will sound like music in our ears because it will be a soft echo, an echo of the moment of our creation, our visible universe.
So within the next two years, we'll be able to turn the soundtrack up a little louder and put out the universe as a sound image.
But if we can capture those very earliest moments, it will bring us much closer to an understanding of the Big Bang, which in turn will bring us closer to some of the most complex, elusive questions.
If we played a movie of the universe backwards, we would know that there was a big bang in the past, and we could even perceive the cacophony of its sound. But was our big bang the only big bang?
I think we have to ask the question: Has something like this happened before?
Will it happen again?
I think in the spirit of the challenge that TED represents - to reignite wonder - we can ask questions, at least in this last minute, that might otherwise elude us forever.
But we have to ask: Is it possible that our universe is just an offshoot of a larger story?
Or is it possible that we are just an offshoot of a multiverse - each offshoot with its own big bang in its past - perhaps some of them have drum-playing black holes, others may not - in some there may be intelligent life, in others not - not in our past, not in our future, but still fundamentally connected to us in some way?
So we have to ask: If there is a multiverse, do living creatures exist in another fragment of that multiverse?
These are my creatures of the multiverse.
Are there other living beings in this multiverse who are thinking about us and about their own origins?
And if there are, I can imagine them being like us, calculating and writing computer codes, building instruments, trying to make out the most distant sound of their origins, and wondering who else is out there.
Thank you. Thank you.

Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvesters infected
After a Corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in Mamming, Lower Bavaria, almost 500 people are under quarantine and are no longer allowed to leave the farm.
A security service is monitoring the curfew.
A total of 174 harvesters tested positive for the corona pathogen Sars-CoV-2 during the serial examination, as the district office Dingolfing-Landau announced on Saturday evening.
"In order to prevent further spread, we unfortunately have to take this step to protect the population," explained District Administrator Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees had already been infected at the plant - this was the reason for the row test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm that grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and beet - but only the cucumbers for pickling jars.
Mamming is a rural community with a good 3300 inhabitants not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.

Infected and non-infected employees have been separated on the farm, and the area is now surrounded by a barrier fence.

According to a media report, German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) is calling for an extended data retention period - half a year instead of the planned ten weeks.

Many people believe that driving is an activity reserved for people who can see.
A blind person driving a car safely and independently has been considered an impossible task until now.
Hello, my name is Dennis Hong, and we want to give freedom and independence to blind people by building a car for blind people.
So, before I talk about this car for the blind, let me briefly talk about another project I worked on called the DARBA Urban Challenge.
This one was about building a robotized car that can drive itself.
You press start, nobody touches anything, and it can reach its destination completely automatically.
So in 2007, our team won half a million dollars by finishing third in the competition.
Around that time, the National Federation of the Blind, or NFB, challenged the Investigation Committee to make a car that could be driven safely and independently by a blind person.
We decided to try it because we thought, hey, how difficult can it be.
We already have an automatic vehicle.
We put a blind person in it and that's it, right?
(Laughter) We couldn't have been more wrong.
What the National Federation of the Blind (NFB) wanted was not a vehicle that would drive blind people around, but a vehicle where a blind person could make active decisions and drive.
Therefore, we had to throw everything away and start all over again.
So, to test this insane idea, we developed a small buggy prototype vehicle to test its feasibility.
And in the summer of 2009, we invited dozens of young blind people from all over the country and gave them the opportunity to take a spin.
It was an absolutely great experience.
But the problem with this car was that it was designed so that it could only be driven in a controlled environment, a level, traffic-free parking lot, and that even the lanes were highlighted with red traffic cones.
So, with this success, we decided to take the next big step, to develop a true car that could be driven in real streets.
So how does it work?
Well, it's a rather complicated system, but let me try to explain it, and maybe I can simplify it.
Well, we have three steps.
We have perception, computation and non-visual interfaces.
Now, it is clear that the driver cannot see, so the system must be able to perceive the environment and gather information for the driver.
For this, we use an initial measurement unit.
It measures acceleration, angular acceleration, like a human ear, an inner ear.
We merge the information with a GPS unit to get the approximate position of the car.
We also use two cameras to perceive the lanes of the road.
And we also use three laser rangefinders.
The lasers scan the environment to detect obstacles, a car coming at us from the front or from behind, and also any obstacles that come onto the road, any obstacles around the vehicle.
After that, all this enormous amount of information is transferred to the computer, and the computer can do two things.
First, first of all, process the information to understand what the environment is like, which is the lanes on the road, the obstacles, and convey that information to the driver.
The system is also smart enough to calculate the safest way to operate the car.
We can also generate instructions on how to operate the car's controls.
But, the problem is this: How can we convey this information and these instructions to a person who cannot see fast enough and fairly accurately so that he can drive?
For this, we developed different types of non-visual user interface technology.
We started with a three-dimensional ping sound system, a vibration vest, a click wheel with voice commands, a foot strip, and even a shoe that puts pressure on the leg.
But today, we're going to talk about three of these non-visual user interface technologies.
Now, the first interface technology is called DriveGrip.
This one is a pair of gloves, and it has its vibrating elements on the ankle side, so they can convey instructions about how to steer, the direction, and the intensity.
Another device is called SpeedStrip.
These are a chair, actually, it's a massage chair.
We hollow it out, and we reorganize the vibrating elements into different patterns. And we operate them to convey information about speed, and also to convey instructions about how to use the accelerator and brake pedals.
So, here you can see how the computer sees the environment. And since they can't see the vibration, we even equip the driver with red LEDs so they can really see what's going on.
This is the sensory data, and this data is fed into the devices via computer.
So, these two devices, DriveGrip and SpeedGrip, are very effective.
But the problem is that they are cue devices.
Therefore, this is not a real freedom, is it?
The computer tells you how to drive , turn left, turn right, accelerate, stop.
We call it backseat driver problem.
Therefore, let's move away from the cueing devices, and now focus more on the information devices.
A good example of this non-visual information interface technology is AirPix.
Think of it as a monitor for the blind.
Well, it's a small tablet, it has many holes, and it discharges compressed air, so it can even draw pictures.
Therefore, even if you are blind, you can put your hand on it, see the lanes and obstacles on the road.
In fact, they can also change the air frequency that escapes and possibly the temperature.
Therefore, it is indeed a multidimensional user interface.
Now, here you can look at the left camera, the right camera as seen from the vehicle, and see how the computer interprets this and sends the information to the AirPix.
For this, we show a simulator, a blind person driving and using the AirPix.
This simulator was also very useful to train the blind drivers and also fast in testing different kinds of ideas for different types of non-visual user interfaces.
Therefore, this is mainly how it works.
But this vehicle is a prototype, and it's not going to hit the road until it's proven that it's safe, or safer than today's vehicles.
And I really believe that this can happen.
But still, will society, would they accept such a radical idea?
How are we going to regulate insurance?
How will we issue driver's licenses?
Apart from the technological challenges, there are many kinds of hurdles that we have to overcome until it becomes a reality.
Of course, the main goal of this project is to make a car for a blind person.
But potentially more important than this is the tremendous spin-off technology benefits that can be derived from this project.
The sensors that are needed can see in the dark in fog and rain.
And along with these new type of interfaces, we can use this technology and apply it in safer cars for normal sighted people.
Or for blind people, in everyday devices in the home, in education, and in the office.
Imagine a teacher writing on the board in a classroom, and a blind student being able to see and read what he wrote using these non-visual interface technologies.
That's priceless.
So, the things I showed you today are just the beginning.
Thank you very much.

No one is allowed to leave the premises, and food is being delivered.
The authorities are now offering free Corona tests to the 3300 or so residents of the community.
Since the harvesters had little contact with the local population, the district office so far assumes that the infections have not spread beyond the farm.

Discuss abolition of the 50+1 rule
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended thinking about abolishing the 50+1 rule.
"German soccer should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates a fait accompli," Grindel told Bild am Sonntag.
He stressed, "For the clubs that are most likely to pose a threat to Bayern and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules don't work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, there is no getting around the debate as to whether it is not necessary to make it easier for clubs that want to break into this phalanx to involve investors."
But he said he doubted whether there was a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority stakes, which are prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50+1 rule.
"It remains a legal risk to draw investment fences around the Bundesliga as a business location in a single European market," Grindel said.
The former DFB boss sees a danger that "attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will only end up weakening the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but will not lead to more excitement in the championship."
Even an equal distribution of TV money would not achieve a decisive effect, he said.
"FC Bayern makes a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
So the differences are already immense among the top three clubs alone.
The other 15 clubs have an average budget of 130 million," the 58-year-old explained.
Looking at the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there have been people who noticed this mistake and leaked it to the press instead of addressing me about it," Grindel said of accepting an expensive watch that led to his resignation in April 2019.
"That has already bothered me a lot on a human level".
He had received the gift, worth around 11,000 euros, from a Ukrainian official.
"I committed a compliance violation, and it was right to draw the consequences," Grindel said.
"I dealt with the ominous watch gift in a completely transparent and guileless manner.
After all, many people in the DFB knew about it."
He never "made a secret of the gift," the 58-year-old assured.
"You might call that naive, but in any case this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."

Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes defy corona
Although the big bash in the spa town was missing, visitors and performers enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: the Rakoczy weekend without Rakoczy-Fest.
But: even though the big party mile in the city center was missing, the crowds and program highlights like Saale burns, Rakoczy Ball or pageant, many got their money's worth at the Corona-compliant alternative program.
"I think we succeeded in spreading Rakoczy flair," says spa director Sylvie Thormann.
Guests have taken to it well, she adds.
In principle, one returns to the beginnings of the Rakoczy Festival, when also the historical alone were the focus of the festival.
Pleasant atmosphere

"I find it quite pleasant as it is," Konhäuser says.
She doesn't miss the crowds that usually accompany Rakoczy.
But she misses the usual program highlights, first and foremost Saale brennt on Friday evening, as well as the historical pageant and the closing fireworks on Sunday evening.
"That's a shame.
The weather would have been great this year," she says.

Argentina rejects creditors' counteroffer
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economy in Buenos Aires announced on Saturday.

"While 50 percent of children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors."
The debt of the second-largest economy in South America is no longer sustainable under current conditions.
That is why Argentina is demanding that its private creditors waive part of their claims of around 66 billion U.S. dollars (about 59 billion euros).
If no agreement is reached, the country will once again be threatened with national bankruptcy.
It would be the ninth default in Argentina's history.
Most recently, the lenders had demanded higher interest rates on the government bonds and changes to some of the contract clauses.
However, the Argentine government is sticking to its last offer and is not prepared to make any further concessions.
Argentina is in the midst of a severe financial and economic crisis.

Professionally arrived - privately not yet
"It's going super well" - this is the conclusion Dr. Stefanie Kramer draws after her first days at the notary's office in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything happened very quickly: In mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she would be succeeding Lutz Feller in the Eggenfelden notary's office.
Just six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the doctor of law started work, and normal day-to-day business has long been running at full speed.
"Privately, however, I still have to arrive," she explains in conversation with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
Of course, the short lead time was not enough to move the center of her life completely from Regensburg to Eggenfelden, reports the native of Dingolfingen.
Currently, she and her husband, who works as a judge at the district court in Regensburg, are looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city.
At least her husband was able to apply for parental leave at short notice in order to be able to take care of their two daughters (3½ and 1½ years old).
In order not to have to commute from Regensburg every day, she also has a place to stay with her parents in Dingolfing for the time being, explains the 39-year-old.
Having grown up in the neighboring district, she has of course long been familiar with the town of Eggenfelden.
During visits to the town with her family over the past few months, she has recently discovered that "Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town.
She was all the more pleased that she had won the race for the vacant position in the selection process.
Her native Lower Bavaria also plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career: After studying law in Passau, she completed her legal clerkship and the second state examination in Regensburg.
After several stations as a notary public, among others in Rehau and Hof in Upper Franconia, Babenhausen in Unterallgäu as well as Regensburg - during this time she also shouldered her doctorate in labor law "on the side" - she took up her first position as a notary public in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016, she took parental leave, which was followed by a move to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken on substitute services in various notarial offices.
When the position in Eggenfelden was advertised due to the approaching retirement of Lutz Feller, she saw the right time for her full professional re-entry, explains the 39-year-old.
Dr. Stefanie Kramer has completely taken over the team of her predecessor, who in the future will be taking over the notary's office as a vacation replacement - and immediately has praise for the team at the office: "It's going super well!"
The fact that she can rely on well-rehearsed processes here makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of her private center of life.
She has already contacted a local facility about kindergarten and daycare places.
And if everything goes as planned, she hopes to be able to pursue her hobby here soon - and to get to know the most beautiful jogging routes in the Rottal.

BVB plans maximum 15,000 spectators for league start
Dortmund Germany's largest soccer stadium in Dortmund will not even be 20 percent full at the start of the season if fans return.
"Due to the distance regulations, which are mandatory, we are planning on 12,000 to 15,000 spectators as things stand," Borussia Dortmund's managing director Carsten Cramer told the Tagesspiegel newspaper.
Normally, the arena in the Revierstadt holds just over 81,000 spectators for Bundesliga matches.
In last season's ghost games caused by the Corona pandemic, BVB lost around four million euros per game.
Cramer, who is responsible for marketing, digitization and internationalization at BVB, hopes that some of the 4,000 or so seats in the hospitality area can be reopened in addition to the normal spectator seats: "It is of course a blow to the bottom line if these revenues are completely lost."
In view of the ongoing Corona crisis, everyone is currently "well advised to take a stable side-length for the time being".
"When many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people are on short-time work in Germany alone, the need for entertainment is limited," Cramer explained.
Dortmund's marketing boss praised BVB's professionals for their partial salary sacrifice to help overcome the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their salary sacrifice has a different effect than if we put 100 people who work in merchandising on short-time work."

Kalbitz expulsion from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "fig leaf".
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is, in the view of the FDP, only a "fig leaf" and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the far-right in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of radicals in the AfD," FDP interior politician Benjamin Strasser told the dpa news agency in Berlin.
The Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD had confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz on Saturday in Stuttgart after several hours of hearing, which the Federal Executive Committee had decided by a majority in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD parliamentary group in the Brandenburg state parliament.
"If the AfD were really concerned with consistently removing right-wing extremists from its party, functionaries like Björn Höcke as well as his supporters would have been expelled long ago," Strasser said.
"However, there is no political will in the AfD to do this, because right-wing extremism is now part of the party."
CSU Secretary General Markus Blume expressed a similar view: "The fact that Andreas Kalbitz now remains excluded says nothing and changes nothing," he told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper.
"Rather, it speaks volumes about how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist still has in the middle of the AfD."
Blume expects the AfD to end up below five percent again in future elections.
"The AfD's days in parliaments are numbered," he said.
Kalbitz was one of the spokesmen for the officially now disbanded "wing" around Thuringia AfD state and parliamentary group leader Björn Höcke; the Office for the Protection of the Constitution classifies the strand as a "secured right-wing extremist effort."
In May, the AfD federal executive committee had thrown Kalbitz out of the party.
The reason it gave was that Kalbitz had not declared previous membership of the now-banned far-right "Heimattreue Deutsche Jugend" (HDJ) and the Republicans when he joined the party.
Kalbitz denies membership in the HDJ.
Sebastian Walter, chairman of the left-wing parliamentary group in Brandenburg's state parliament, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court does not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf has only eaten chalk.
The AfD remains an extreme right-wing party, with or without Kalbitz."
Neither the federal party is weakened with this decision, nor the right wing, he said.
"The maneuver of the Meuthen troops is transparent.
They want to escape further observation by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution and are trying to get through under the radar," Walter said.
"The AfD will not get rid of the ghosts it called.
An expulsion still changes nothing," commented Brandenburg SPD Secretary General Erik Stohn on the decision in the Kalbitz case.
"Here, the AfD state association and the parliamentary group stood by their right-wing leader until today."
The legal dispute over Kalbitz's membership in the AfD will continue.
This announced on Saturday, he would now take civil action against the decision of the Federal arbitration court.

North Sea wind farms deliver a good 21 percent more electricity
In the first six months of the year, wind farms on the German North Sea fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid.
This is a good 21 percent more than in the same period last year, the grid operator Tennet announced in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for transmitting North Sea electricity to the mainland and forwarding it through the German power grid.
Wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of Tennet's grid area, fed in another 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
In total, wind power from the North Sea and Baltic Sea thus comes to 13.73 TWh, compared to just over 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
Wind harvesting at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of total wind power in Germany; that's about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms provide higher generation capacity
In addition to wind conditions, the increased contribution of offshore wind power results from higher generation capacities because new wind farms have been connected to the grid in the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind farms in the North Sea were all running at full power at the same time, they could mathematically generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatts.
By 2030, it is expected to increase to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore grid connections by then," said Tennet Managing Director Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind farms can't reach their full capacity even offshore, but reach about 40 percent.
The record day so far this year is Jan. 2, when North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, the equivalent of three to four nuclear power plants.
This could supply almost seven million households with electricity.

Freital: Windbergfest cancelled because of Corona
The Windbergfest will not take place this year.
The city of Freital has canceled the three-day festival planned for September.
In other years, over 30,000 people had attended this city festival.

More air traffic controllers in Worms in the future
The University of Worms continues to take to the skies: "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" endows a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and will start in 2021.
The professorship will enable students to start their studies not only in the summer semester, but also in the winter semester.
This means that twice as many students can be trained as before.
At the same time, capacities at both the university and the DFS Air Navigation Services Academy will be evenly utilised.
DFS will advise the university on establishing and filling the professorship.
Represented at the university since 2019
Since the summer semester of 2019, the first students have been on the Air Traffic Management course at Worms University as part of their training to become air traffic controllers.
Nine students already started this year.
So far, the experience of DFS has been very positive, and the performance of the students is excellent.
The combination of studies and air traffic controller training is making a significant contribution to further enhancing the attractiveness of the air traffic controller profession.
"In these times, funding is not easy for us economically.
However, we firmly expect air traffic to recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to be able to continue fulfilling our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel," said Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman and CEO of DFS, at the signing of the agreement.
"For DFS, the endowed professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, interdisciplinary knowledge base in the long term.
We are therefore continuing our good cooperation with the university and at the same time underpinning our attractiveness as an employer."
This is also emphasized by Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of Worms University of Applied Sciences: "The endowed professorship forms an important bridge between science and industry.
With this professorship, we would like to build on the existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual bachelor's degree program in Air Traffic Management."
The trust placed in us by Deutsche Flugsicherung is both a motivation and an obligation for Worms University of Applied Sciences to further expand its teaching and research expertise in the future fields of air traffic.
In its commitment to the air traffic controllers of tomorrow, the university can set very special highlights and innovative focal points for its students with the first endowed professorship for a dual course of study.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary in the Ministry of Science, Further Education and Culture, emphasized: "With its focus on aviation, Worms University of Applied Sciences has a unique selling point in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the university's profile."

Heil to examine other industries after meat industry
The Corona crisis again brought to light the conditions in parts of the meat industry.
Tightening of the law is imminent.
But are they legal - and will they remain so?
Federal Labor Minister Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to review other industries after the strict regulations against abuses in the meat industry that are now planned.
"We will look at industry by industry and then take appropriate measures for each industry if necessary," Heil told the Deutsche Presse-Agentur in Berlin.
Germany's employers are already warning against restricting work contracts in general.
Following the mass corona outbreak at meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the federal cabinet plans to pass a bill by Heil this Wednesday.
Large slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to use outside personnel for slaughtering, cutting and meat processing.
In addition, the use of contract workers and temporary workers is to be banned there.
Employers' President Ingo Kramer told dpa: "Hands off a general restriction of work contracts and temporary workers if you don't want to completely strangle the economy."
Contracts for work and services are, for example, for large areas of the skilled trades, the construction industry and plant engineering compellingly the basis for their value creation at the customer.
"The misconduct of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument."
Heil assured, "My goal is not to ban work contracts everywhere in the German economy."
He added that work contracts make sense.
"If an industrial company commissions a craftsman to install a security system, that is a perfectly normal contract for work and services."
The German meat industry considers a ban on work contracts and temporary work in its sector alone to be unconstitutional.
It is inexplicable why different labor laws should apply in the future to portioning and packaging cheese than to sausage, it says in a statement on the proposed law, as reported by the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Saturday).

Heil said a relatively harsh law had already come into force for the meat industry in 2017.
However, "tricky constructions" had circumvented it.
"Now it must be fundamentally cleaned up".
The politician announced, "In the Occupational Health and Safety Act, which we want to pass in the cabinet at the end of July, there are also measures that not only affect the meat industry - for example, higher inspection quotas for occupational health and safety or clear criteria for shared accommodation."
The draft submitted to dpa includes amendments to the law on safeguarding employee rights in the meat industry and to the Occupational Safety and Health Act.
Brandenburg's Consumer Protection Minister Ursula Nonnemacher (Greens) believes more intensive controls are necessary.

But for more controls also more personnel places are necessary.

Juventus Turin champions in Italy
Turin - After a redeeming goal by Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in a row.
The team around the five-time world footballer made the 36th Scudetto in club history perfect with a 2-0 (1-0) win over Sampdoria Genoa at home on Sunday evening.
Ronaldo scored to make it 1-0 before halftime.
With 83 points, Torino, which was without former international Sami Khedira, who has been injured for a long time lately, can no longer be ousted from first place in Serie A two matchdays before the end of the season.
Inter Milan, second in the table, is seven points behind.
Juventus was harmless in the first half despite visual superiority, then Ronaldo scored with the last action after a free kick.
The 35-year-old converted a pass from Miralem Pjanic directly with a low shot from the edge of the penalty area (45.+7).
Against the now more offensive guests Ronaldo was also involved in the 2-0, after his shot Federico Bernardeschi (67th) dusted off.
This ensured the lackluster, but decisive success.

In the end, Juve owed its reassuring lead at the top of the table primarily to the weakness of its rivals.
In the eleven games before Sunday's match, Sarri's team had only managed five victories.
Whether Ronaldo will also be the top scorer is questionable.

On the A81, the police even register more races than on any other federal highway.
An attempt is being made there with a speed limit to slow down the speeders on the particularly affected section between Engen and Geisingen.
The mostly high-priced and pimped-out sports and luxury cars often have Swiss license plates, because the drivers escape to Germany to speed because of the high penalties for speeding and car racing in the neighboring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit should not be limited to a few stretches of road: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometers per hour, we would get rid of this problem on highways," says Martin Rivoir, the traffic expert for the SPD's state parliamentary group.
"The inhibition threshold for speeders would be significantly higher if you weren't still legally allowed to drive here and there at 200 kilometers per hour and more."
Rivoir thinks less of education or image campaigns: "Anyone who flouts all the rules in such a way and puts not only their own life but also the lives of other road users at risk can hardly be reached with reason.
ADAC calls for stronger police action
For the ADAC, however, this is not enough: "We assume that speeders will not be deterred by the speed limits," says Holger Bach, head of the traffic and environment department at ADAC Württemberg.
He calls for additional and also tougher controls on the affected routes.
Not infrequently, the high-speed trial of strength turns into painful and momentous seriousness: since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people have died nationwide in the races, two of them bystanders in a nighttime crash in Stuttgart's city center and one in Gerlingen.
There, two young men allegedly engaged in a car race in November.
One of the vehicles went off the road, crashed into a garden wall and came to rest on its side, killing the 18-year-old passenger.
21 other people were injured in the races over the past two years.
Stricter penalties, however, are not necessary, according to Interior Minister Thomas Strobl: "Legislative need for action to sanction illegal motor vehicle racing more severely is not seen," the Interior Ministry paper says.

The first time I was in Antarctica was almost 10 years ago, where I saw my first icebergs.
I was awestruck.
My heart was racing, I was dizzy as I tried to grasp what was in front of me.
The icebergs around me rose almost 60 meters out of the water. And I could only marvel that this was one snowflake on top of another snowflake, year after year.
Icebergs are born as the calf of a glacier or by breaking out of ice floes.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They interact in unique ways with their environment and experiences.
Some refuse to give up and cling to the bitter end, while others can't take it anymore and collapse in a fit of dramatic passion.
When you look at an iceberg, it's easy to think that they are isolated, separate and alone, much like we humans often see ourselves.
But the truth is far from that.
As an iceberg melts, I breathe in its prehistoric atmosphere.
As the iceberg melts, it releases mineral-rich drinking water that nourishes many life forms.
I approach my photographs of these icebergs as if I were taking portraits of my ancestors, knowing that they exist in these individual moments from this way, and will never exist like this again.
It is not death when they melt; it is not an end, but a continuation of their path along the life cycle.
Some of the ice in the icebergs I photograph is very young - a few thousand years old.
And some of the ice is more than 100,000 years old.
The last pictures I would like to show you are of an iceberg I photographed in Kekertsuatsiak in Greenland.

That's the average size of a Greenland iceberg.
He's sticking out of the water about 120 feet, or 40 meters.
And this video is in real time.
(Music) And just like that, the iceberg shows you another side of his personality.
Thank you.

Nuremberg: Unauthorized tuning meeting - police intervene, 700 cars and about 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and at times over 1000 people took part in a "tuning meeting" on Saturday night in the parking lot of a furniture store.
The police implemented their announcement to control such events more intensively.
A large tuning meeting occurred on Saturday night (July 25, 2020) in Nuremberg Südstadt.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the Central Franconia police, at around 10:30 p.m., Nuremberg traffic police noticed an increased volume of vehicles in the area of a large parking lot in Ingolstädter Straße.
The police then carried out a large number of vehicle checks there.
Only recently, the police had announced that they wanted to take stronger action against so-called car posers.
Illegal tuning meeting in Nuremberg: only a small number from the "scene
The officers counted a good 700 vehicles and about 1100 people at the peak, the police reported.
Of these, however, only a small part of those present could be assigned to the "car poser" and tuning scene.
Apparently, the majority of the relevant scene complied with the appeal of the police.
On the basis of the vehicles and people on site, it can be assumed that these were mainly onlookers.
In addition, the vast majority of those present complied with the applicable infection control regulations, in particular the observance of the minimum distance and the wearing of a mouth-nose protection.
The control measures carried out on site were completed at around 1:00 am.
In total, the officers found such structural changes in 10 vehicles that the operating license had expired.
Four of these vehicles had to be impounded.
No car races
Illegal car racing had not taken place.

Labor Agency figures: 900 suspected cases of abuse of short-time work
Berlin - The Federal Employment Agency (BA) says it is investigating around 900 suspected cases of misuse of short-time working benefits.
"With more than 880,000 companies reporting short-time work, that is extremely few," Daniel Terzenbach, the board member responsible for operations, told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper.
When at the beginning of the Corona crisis suddenly very many companies had applied for short-time work, the BA had to react quickly.
Normally, the examination takes up to three weeks.
"We did not have that much time in this hot phase.
We will look all the more closely at the final accounts.
There will certainly be some more to come.
We are not naive and have staying power."
Indications of abuse often come from the employees concerned or from trade unions.
In addition, the BA uses analysis software to identify patterns of abuse.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible wave of insolvencies in the fall.
"Will there be significantly more insolvencies than last year?
Estimates differ, but we are arming ourselves for the worst-case scenario and are already training our employees in the employment agencies to process applications for insolvency benefits."
The figures are still unremarkable, said Terzenbach.

Authorities have responded to a Corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist resort of St. Wolfgang with hundreds of tests.
The number of confirmed cases rose to 48, according to provincial authorities in Linz.
More than 100 results were still pending in the evening.
According to the report, many of those infected are young trainees in tourism businesses, but at least one vacation guest also tested positive.
Residents, guests and tourism employees were asked to stay in their accommodations on Saturday evening.
The curfew was set at 11 p.m.
"There are cancellations and cancellations here and there" of bookings, the head of the Wolfgangsee tourism association, Hans Wieser, told dpa.
There have also been isolated guests who have left early, he said.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist destination in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, about a third of the guests are German.
On Friday, the first infections had become public knowledge.
The head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended on Saturday the behavior of the trainees, who had celebrated in several pubs and may have been infected.
"We all liked to do that in our youth," he told radio station Ö1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The tourism board launched an information campaign to make young employees aware of the dangers of Covid-19.
Hundreds of employees, vacationers and locals were then tested starting Saturday.
Additionally, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang as of July 15 were contacted.
The outbreak brings back memories of the Austrian ski and party resort of Ischgl in Tyrol, which was a center of Corona spread throughout Europe during the early stages of the pandemic.
In total, more than 1500 people are currently infected with the virus in Austria.
The main areas of new infections are Vienna and Upper Austria.

You all know that what I'm about to say is true.
The intuition that inequality weakens social cohesion existed before the French Revolution.
What is new is that we now have evidence. We can compare societies, more equal and more unequal, and see what inequality does.
I want to show you statistics and explain why there are correlations between them.
Look at what a pathetic bunch we are.
(Laughter) Let me start with a paradox.
This shows life expectancy and gross national income - in rich countries on average.
You see that the countries on the right, Norway and the U.S., for example, are twice as rich as Israel, Greece, Portugal on the left.
And that doesn't change their life expectancy at all.
There is nothing to suggest a correlation.
But within societies, there are huge social disparities in health right across society.
Here, again, life expectancy.
Here are small areas in England and Wales - the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.
A big difference between the poor and the rest of us.
Even the people just below the top are in worse health than those at the top.
So income has a very large meaning within individual societies, and none at all between them.
The explanation for this paradox is that within societies we're dealing with relative income, social position, status - where we stand in relation to each other, and how big the gaps are between us.
And when you understand that, you immediately ask yourself: what happens when the gaps get bigger, or smaller, when income gaps go up or down?
And that's what I'm going to show you now.
Not with hypothetical data.
With data from the UN - the same data that the World Bank uses - on the extent of income inequality in rich developed market democracies.
The measure we use, because it's easy to understand and available for download, is how much richer the top 20 percent are than the bottom 20 percent of each country.
You see that in the more equal countries on the left-Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden-the top 20 percent are about 3½, 4 times as rich as the bottom 20 percent.
But on the other side - the U.K., Portugal, the U.S., Singapore - the differences are twice as large.
On that scale, we are twice as unequal as some of the other successful market democracies.
Now let me show you what that does to our societies.
We've collected data on social gradient problems, the problems that are more prevalent at the bottom of the social ladder.
Internationally comparable data on life expectancy, children's math, literacy, infant mortality and homicide rates, what proportion of the population is incarcerated, teenage pregnancy, confidence, obesity, mental illness - which in standard diagnostics includes drug and alcohol addiction - and social mobility.
We combined them into one index.
All with equal weight.
For each country, there is a kind of average value of these factors.
And here you see it in relation to the degree of inequality that I showed you, which I'll come back to again and again.
The more unequal countries do worse on all of these social problems.
That's an unusually high correlation.
But if you put the same index of health and social problems in relation to GNI per capita, to gross national income, there's nothing there anymore, no correlation.
We were worried that people would think we had selected only the problems that supported our argument and constructed that evidence, so we also published a paper in the British Medical Journal on the UNICEF Index of Child Wellbeing.
In that, 40 different components were compiled by other people.
The index includes whether children can talk to their parents, whether they have books at home, their immunization rates, whether there is bullying at school.
Everything factors in.
Here's the index relative to our inequality scores.
Children do worse in unequal societies.
It's a highly significant relationship.
And again, when you plot the index of child well-being against national per capita income, there's no correlation, not even a hint.
All the data I've shown you so far say the same thing.
The average well-being of our societies no longer depends on national income and economic growth.
Those are critical in poorer countries, but not in the rich developed world.
But the differences between us, where we stand in comparison to each other has become very important.
I'll show you individual parts of our index now.
Here, for example, is confidence.
Simply the percentage of the population that believes most people can be trusted.
The data comes from the World Values Survey.
On the more unequal side, about 15 percent of the population believe that others can be trusted.
But in more equal societies, it's up to 60 or 65 percent.
And for the degree of involvement in community life or social capital, there are similarly close correlations with inequality.
We've done all this work twice.
First with the rich, developed countries, and then in a second set of tests again with the 50 American states - asking the same question: do the more unequal states perform worse on all these scales?
Here, trust is correlated with inequality, according to a U.S. government data collection.
A very similar distribution over a similar range of trust levels.
The same thing happens here.
Our basic finding is that almost all the factors that are related to trust internationally do the same in the 50 U.S. states, in the separate test environment.
And that's not just a happy coincidence.
Here's mental illness.
WHO produced these numbers by conducting the same diagnostic interviews with randomly selected subjects to compare rates of mental illness across societies.
This is the percentage of the population that had mental illness in the previous year.
It goes from 8 percent to three times that - whole societies having rates of mental illness three times higher than others.
And again, a high correlation to inequality.
And violence here.
These red dots are American states, the blue triangles are Canadian provinces.
Notice the scale of the differences.
It goes from 15 murders per million to 150.
That's the percentage of the population that is incarcerated.
There is about a tenfold difference here on the lateral log scale.
It goes from about 40 to 400 people incarcerated.
This ratio does not arise primarily from higher crime rates.
In some places, that's a partial factor.
But the main reason is harsher court sentences.
And more unequal societies are also more likely to retain the death penalty.
Here are kids dropping out of school.
Again, pretty big disparities.
With devastating effects in terms of harnessing the talents of the population.
Here is social mobility.
Actually a measurement of mobility starting with income.
The question is: Do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons, or is there no correlation between them?
On the more unequal side, fathers' income is much more important -- in the UK, in the US.
And in the Scandinavian countries, fathers' income is much less crucial.
There's more social mobility.
We like to say -- and I know there are many Americans here in the audience -- if Americans want to live the American Dream, they should go to Denmark.
(Laughter) (Applause) I've just presented you with a few things now.
I could have shown you a lot of other problems.
All these problems are more common at the lower end of the social gradient.
But there are countless social gradient problems that are worse in more unequal countries-not just a little bit, but somewhere between 2 times and 10 times as common.
Imagine those costs, the human costs.
But I want to go back to the graph where we summarized everything to show two things.
One is that graph by graph it shows that the countries that are doing poorly, regardless of the outcome, seem to be the more unequal ones, and the ones that are doing better seem to be the Nordic countries and Japan.
So what we see is a general social dysfunction associated with inequality.
It doesn't just affect one or two things, it affects most things.
The other very important aspect on this graph you see down here, Sweden and Japan - very different countries in many ways.
The position of women, how much they adhere to the nuclear family, here they are at opposite poles of the rich, developed world.
Another very important difference is how they achieve their greater equality.
In Sweden there are huge differences in earnings which are compensated for by taxation, the general welfare state, generous social benefits, etc.
In Japan, it's completely different.
There, even before taxes, there are lower differences in earnings.
There are lower taxes.
A smaller welfare state.
And in our analysis of American states, we find the same contrast.
Some states succeed through redistribution, others do well because they have low pre-tax income inequality.
Our implication is that it doesn't matter so much how you get to greater equality, as long as you achieve it somehow.
I don't mean perfect equality, I'm talking about something that already exists in rich market democracies.
Another surprising part of the picture is that it's not just the poor who are affected by inequality.
Clearly, there is some truth in John Donne's "No man is an island."
In several studies, one can compare how people in more or less equal countries perform at each level of the social hierarchy.
This is just one example.
Infant mortality.
Some Swedes have kindly classified most of their child deaths according to the British Socioeconomic Classification Register.
This is an anachronistic classification according to the fathers' occupations, so single parents are kept separate.
But where "low social class" is noted, it means unskilled manual labor.
Then there are the skilled manual occupations in the middle, then the lower-level non-manual occupations, up to the higher-level occupations - doctors, lawyers, executives of larger companies.
You can see that Sweden is better than the UK, across the social hierarchy.
The biggest differences are at the bottom of society.
But even at the top, there seems to be a small advantage to living in a more equal society.
We show this in five different data sets looking at educational attainment and health in the U.S. and internationally.
That seems to be the case across the board - greater equality makes the most difference at the bottom, but has some benefits even at the top.
But I should say something more about what's happening.
I'm concerned with the psychosocial effects of inequality.
It has to do with feelings of superiority and inferiority, of being valued or devalued, respected or despised.
And, of course, the sense of status competition that results drives consumerism in our society.
It also leads to status insecurity.
We worry more about how we will be judged by others, whether we will be seen as attractive, smart, etc.
Socially judgmental judgments are increasing, as is anxiety about those judgments.
Interestingly, there is similar research in social psychology: some people evaluated 208 different studies in which volunteers were invited into psychology labs to measure their stress hormones and their response to stressful tasks.
What they were interested in evaluating was what types of stress most reliably raised the cortisol level, which is the central stress hormone.
And the result was: tasks that posed a threat to social appraisal - threats to self-esteem or social status where others may judge one's performance negatively.
These types of stress have a very specific effect on the physiology of stress.
We have been criticized.
Of course, there are people who don't like this and people who find it very amazing.
But I should tell you, when people criticize us for purposefully selecting our data, we never purposefully select for our purposes.
Our absolute policy is if our data source has data for one of the countries we are looking at, it goes into the analysis.
Our data source determines if it is robust data, not us.
Anything else would be bias.
What about other countries?
There are 200 studies on health relative to income and equity in peer-reviewed academic journals.
This is not limited to these countries this is a very simple demonstration.
The same countries, the same inequality scale, one problem after another.
Why don't we review other factors?
We have shown that per capita income makes no difference.
And, of course, others have used more sophisticated methods to check poverty and education, and others.
What about causality?
Correlation does not prove causality.
We've spent a lot of time on that.
In fact, people know the causal relationships very well in some of these outcomes.
The big news in our understanding of the drivers of long-term health in the rich developed world is how much chronic social stress stresses the immune system, the cardiovascular system.
Or, for example, the reason why violence is more prevalent in more unequal societies is because people are sensitive to being despised.
To deal with that we need to clarify what happens after the tax and what happens before the tax.
We need to limit income, bonus culture income at the top.
We need to hold our bosses accountable to employees as best we can.
But the take-home message is that we can improve the actual quality of human life if we fix the income disparities among us.
All of a sudden, there's leverage for the psychosocial well-being of entire societies, and that's very exciting.
Thank you.
(Applause.)

Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualified for Champions League
London (dpa) - English soccer record champions Manchester United are returning to the Champions League after a year's absence.
The Red Devils secured third place in the table on the final matchday of the Premier League with a 2-0 (0-0) win over direct rivals Leicester City.
The Foxes will now have to settle for the Europa League because Chelsea FC passed them by and also qualified for the top flight in fourth place.
In the battle against relegation, Aston Villa was able to celebrate.
Manchester United took the lead through a penalty kick by Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in injury time, Jesse Lingard (90.+8) scored the final goal.
Chelsea, FC Bayern's opponent in the Champions League round of 16, won 2-0 (2:0) against Wolverhampton Wanderers in parallel thanks to Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4).
"It means a lot to me," said coach Frank Lampard, who is also in the FA Cup final against Arsenal in his first season as Chelsea coach.
Also benefiting from Chelsea's win over Wolverhampton was Tottenham Hotspur, which edged past Wolves with a meager 1-1 (1-0) draw at Crystal Palace to start sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa won the long-distance duel with Watford FC and AFC Bournemouth, but had to tremble for a long time at West Ham United.
Jack Grealish's late lead (84th) was immediately cancelled out by Andrej Jarmolenko (85th).
The 1:1 (0:0) was enough, however, because Watford lost 2:3 (1:3) at Arsenal.
The club, which fired three coaches during the season, is relegated after five first division years.
Just like Bournemouth, which could not save itself with a 3:1 (2:1) at Everton FC.
In the end, they were one point short.
Liverpool FC, which has been the English champion since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3-1 (1-1) win at Newcastle United.
99 points are the highest the Reds have ever scored in a soccer season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team just missed the points record in English soccer.
The best mark is held by Manchester City with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After Newcastle took the lead in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) turned the game around for Liverpool on Sunday.
"It's been an extraordinary season for this wonderful club," scorer van Dijk said after the game, "that should spur us on to defend the title.
It will be difficult."
Satisfied should also be the Premier League bosses in the end.
Due to the coronavirus crisis, soccer operations in England were interrupted from March 13 to June 17.
In the meantime, there were even discussions about premature termination or playing the remaining games on neutral ground.
In the end, however, the season was played to a close without any particular incidents - albeit, as in Germany, without spectators in the stadiums.

Today I would like to show you how we will manufacture things in the future.
I believe that our buildings and machines will soon assemble, duplicate and repair themselves.
I will show you what I think are today's manufacturing methods, and then compare them to some natural systems.
In the present manufacturing industry we have skyscrapers - two and a half years [construction time], half a million to a million parts, quite complex, new and exciting technologies of steel, concrete, glass.
We have exciting machines that take us to space - five years [construction time], two and a half million parts.
On the other hand, if you look at natural systems, you find proteins that have two million types and can fold in ten microseconds, or DNA with three billion base pairs that can be copied in about an hour.
So there's all this complexity in our natural systems, but they're extremely efficient, far more efficient than anything we can make, far more complex than anything we can build.
They're much more energy efficient.
They almost never make mistakes.
And they're long-lasting because they can repair themselves.
So there's a lot of interesting things to discover about natural systems.
And if we can incorporate that into our built environment, then we have exciting potential for new ways of building.
And I think the key is self-assembly.
If we're going to use self-assembly in our physical environment, I think there are four key factors.
The first is that we need to decode all the complexity of the things we want to build - that is, our buildings and machines.
And we need to translate that into simple sequences - sort of the DNA of how our buildings work.
Then we need programmable parts that can pull up that sequence and use it to fold or reconfigure.
We need activation energy so that our parts can fold up from the program.
And we need some kind of redundancy for error correction to actually build what we want to build.
I'll show you a couple of projects that my colleagues and I are working on at MIT to make self-assembly a reality in the future.
The first two are MacroBot and DeciBot.
These projects are large-scale, reconfigurable robots - two and a half to four meter long proteins.
They are equipped with electromechanical devices, sensors.
You decode what you want to fold into a sequence of angles - so minus 120, minus 120, 0, 0, 120, minus 120 - something like that; a sequence of angles, or turns, and you send that sequence through the chain.
Each unit picks up its message - so minus 120 - it rotates accordingly, checks to see if it arrived, and passes it on to the neighboring unit.
These here are the brilliant scientists, engineers and designers who worked on this project.
And I think it makes one thing really clear: Is this really scalable?
I mean, thousands of dollars, a lot of man hours to create this two and a half meter tall robot.
Can we really scale this up? Can we really embed robotics into every part?
The next project questions that and looks at the passive nature or the passive attempt to make reconfiguration programmable.
But it goes a step further and tries to make actual computation possible.
It basically integrates the most fundamental component of computing, the digital logic gate, directly into the parts.
This is a NAND gate.
You have a tetrahedron that represents the gate that's going to do the computations, and you have two input tetrahedra.
One represents the input from the user as you make the building blocks.
The other comes from the previous component that was arranged.
And then it provides an output in three-dimensional space.
That means the user can input what they want the building blocks to do.
It does calculations based on what it did before and what the user asks it to do.
And now it starts moving in the three-dimensional space - up and down.
On the left side, input [1,1] corresponds to output 0 going down.
On the right side, input [0,0] corresponds to output 1 going up.
What this really means is that our structures now contain the blueprints of what we want to build.
So they have all the information about what has been built.
That means we can achieve a form of self-replication.
In this case, I call it self-directed replication because the structure contains the exact blueprints.
If errors appear, a part can be replaced.
All the local information is integrated to show how to fix it.
So you could have something that climbs along and reads and gives you a one-to-one output.
It's directly integrated; there are no instructions from the outside.
The last project I'm going to show is called Biased Chains, and it represents probably the most exciting example of self-assembling systems that we have right now.
It takes the ability to reconfigure and program and creates a completely passive system.
Basically, you have a chain of elements.
Each element is completely identical and they are polarized.
Each chain, or element, wants to turn to the right or to the left.
So as you put the chain together, you basically program it.
You tell each unit whether you want it to turn to the right or to the left.
When you shake the chain, it folds up into a configuration that you've programmed in - in this case a spiral, or in this case two cubes next to each other.
So basically, you can program any possible three-dimensional shape - or one-dimensional, two-dimensional - into this chain completely passively.
What does that tell us about the future?
I think it tells us that there are possibilities for self-assembly, replication and repair in our physical structures, our buildings and machines.
There are new opportunities for programming in those parts.
And from that, there will be new opportunities for computing.
We will have spatial programming.
Imagine if our buildings, bridges, machines, all our components could do computations.
That would mean parallel and distributed computing power, new design possibilities.
So there's exciting potential for that.
I think these projects that I've shown here are just a tiny step toward that future as we implement these new technologies for a new, self-creating world.
Thank you.

Arrests and violence at demonstrations against Netanyahu
Protests in Israel against head of government Netanyahu are becoming more violent.
Violent clashes have occurred during the night.
Israeli police violently cracked down on participants in a demonstration against the right-wing conservative head of government Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Sunday night.
Twelve people were arrested for participating in riots, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said.
Among other things, the police used water cannons to break up the rally.
A total of about 6,000 people had gathered near Netanyahu's official residence on Saturday evening, according to media reports.
They were protesting unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu's handling of the Corona crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew horns and called on Netanyahu to resign.
Participants in a counter-demonstration who supported Netanyahu were also arrested, the news site "ynet" reported.
People also demonstrated in many other locations in Israel, including outside the head of government's private villa in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
One man was arrested near Tel Aviv on suspicion of spraying pepper spray from a moving car at protesters on the side of the road, according to police.
Another man was arrested after a knife attack on a demonstrator in the south of the country.
The demonstrator had been lightly wounded in the neck.
There have been several demonstrations against Netanyahu in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv recently.
The rallies accompany the corruption trial against the head of government.
Recently, Netanyahu has also been criticized for his handling of the Corona crisis.
Among other things, he has been accused of hasty easing and a lack of preparation for a second Corona wave.

North Korea seals off border town after Corona suspect case
North Korea has so far considered its own measures to ward off the corona virus a "shining success."
Now, for the first time, the country is reporting a suspected case.
Because of a first official suspected corona case in the country, North Korea has completely sealed off a major city for fear of disaster.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defense measures over the past six months, "the malignant virus may have been introduced into the country," state media reported.
A state of emergency had been declared for the region around the border city of Kaesong.
The communist leadership declared the highest level of alert.
If the suspected case is confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the isolated country.
North Korea said it had not registered a single infection so far and described its defensive measures as a "shining success."
The claims were doubted abroad.
The disease symptoms were reportedly detected in a "runaway" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
The person had absconded to South Korea three years ago and had now returned across the border.
There was initially no confirmation from South Korea of the border crossing within the four-kilometer-wide military buffer zone, most of which is still mined.
South Korea's military, however, acknowledged the possibility of an illegal border crossing into North Korea as high, according to reports by the national news agency Yonhap.

Tension ahead of council meeting: City East and noise abatement up for discussion before big summer break
"In addition to environmental topics, the committee members will also vote, among other things, on the development plan for the major project City Center Development East," it says rather casually in the middle section of the municipal press release for the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, July 28, at 4:30 p.m. in the Great Hall of the CongressCentrum Pforzheim.
Above all the upgrading of the eastern city center is discussed controversially to the end.
The majorities for it are scarce, last in individual committees depending upon attendance even rejecting.
An appeal from the business community (construction, real estate, trade and IT) not to let the project, which was developed from the citizenry and then by the administration and the city council, fail now after almost ten years of preparation, was criticized by project opponent Reinhard Klein as "extra-parliamentary opposition", "clueless", "speculation", "disparagement" and "deliberate false statements".
"Everyone thinks they know better," said Klein, who has been a member of the local council for a year as the sole representative of the Bürgerliste Pforzheim.
In fact, he said, after reading the contracts, he is in this position: "I know what I'm talking about."
The exit comes the city cheaper, the technical city hall is contrary to statements of the city administration after subsidies, of whose existence Klein is convinced, for 8.5 million euros to redevelop.
The city will develop quite differently than is predicted in the city hall and by the supporters from the business community.
To shape the city by its own power and not an investor: That was his plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP/FW/UB/LED faction, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
In essence, it also provides for the renovation of the Technical City Hall, keeping the Schloßberg open, renting the ex-Thale for administrative space and a small-scale inner city redevelopment, ideally with local sponsors.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues will play a central role.
Among other things, the municipal council will vote on the noise action plan.
This contains various measures for the protection of the population of Pforzheim from health-related noise pollution caused by road traffic, including in many cases speed reductions.
In a press release, the local German Transport Club welcomes the widespread introduction of 30 km/h. However, the politically responsible people in the city are not innocent of the fact that this must come about in this way, because they have contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus noise by neglecting the regular bus service with thinned-out intervals and by little commitment to bicycle traffic, says the VCD.
Likewise the local council votes on the participation of the city of the energy and climatic protection agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
Also on the agenda is the accession to the climate protection pact of the state of Baden-Württemberg, the redefinition of parental contributions in the municipal day care centers and the application for inclusion in the Smart City funding of the federal government.

After much delay, Tim Zimmermann starts the new season
After a delay of almost half a year, Tim Zimmermann will start his premiere season in the ADAC GT Masters on July 31.
Before the league of super sports cars can start regular operations, the first test drives were now scheduled.
For Zimmermann, the main focus was on getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 better.
For a long time, the Corona crisis prevented Tim Zimmermann from tackling his first service drive in the new Lamborghini Huracan from Grasser Racing.
Under special hygienic conditions this was now possible.
The 23-year-old from Langenargen did his first laps at the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his premiere in the GT3 car.
"There are already a few things that are different from the Porsche from the previous season," says Zimmermann.
"With the ABS, for example, you have to take the corners differently.
But it was really a lot of fun."
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite being only 25 years old, the Dutchman is already experienced in GT racing and was able to help his new teammate in many ways.
"After all, I'm not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series also brings new challenges," Zimmermann says.
"Steijn and I get on brilliantly and we also made enormous progress from session to session at the Lausitzring."
That's exactly where - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also hold its first race.
Starting on July 31, the 33 supercars will race through the Lausitz.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 series newcomers, knows the track, however.
He was last a guest at the Motodrom in 2015.
"It worked out quickly and I didn't have to get used to the track very much," says Zimmermann, who competes for the Friedrichshafen-based Graf Zeppelin racing team.
"The Lausitzring has many fast passages that you have to hit perfectly to be fast."
How fast Zimmermann really is then will be revealed in two weeks.
"Of course, the teams play a little poker during the tests," he says.
"In the end, however, we are very satisfied and are looking forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring."
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a packed calendar.

British transport minister caught cold by quarantine decision
The British government's decision to quarantine holidaymakers in Spain for two weeks after their return has, according to press reports, caught the country's transport minister cold.
According to the report, Grant Shapps is currently on vacation in Spain, of all places, while his colleagues at home decided on the measure on Saturday.
Because of the Corona numbers rising again in Spain, the Cabinet in London deleted the country from the list of those countries from which entry is possible without quarantine requirements.
The new regulation applies from today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to quarantine after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But the regulation applies to those who are just on the deadline vacation, only from Saturday, August 1, and was not introduced overnight.
Spain, by the way, is considered in Austria until now as one of the "safe countries" for which no quarantine is needed in Austria.
"Numerous ministers may have known in advance that there was a possibility that a quarantine would be imposed on holidaymakers Spain," commented Labour MP Diane Abbot.
"But apparently no one bothered to let Grant Shapps know".

Do you know how many species of flowering plants there are?
A quarter of a million - that's the number of known species - a quarter of a million species of flowering plants.
And flowers are real devils.
Plants have great difficulty producing them.
They require an enormous amount of energy and raw materials.
Why do they go to all this trouble?
The answer, of course, as to so much in the world, is sex.
I know what you think of when you look at these pictures.
And the answer to why sexual reproduction is so important -- there are many other ways for plants to reproduce.
Take offshoots; they can have sex with themselves, so to speak; they can pollinate themselves.
But they actually have to spread their genes to mix with other genes so they can occupy ecological niches.
That's how evolution works.
Plants pass on this information through pollen.
Some of you may have seen a few of these pictures before.
As I always say, everyone would have to have a scanning electron microscope at home to see them.
There are as many different kinds of pollen as there are flowering plants.
And that's very useful for forensics and so on.
Most of the pollen that triggers hay fever in our country comes from plants that use the wind to spread their pollen. It's a very inefficient process, which is why so much of it ends up in our noses.
Because the plants throw out very large amounts, hoping that the male gametes that are in the pollen will hit another flower just by chance.
All grasses, so all cereal plants and most trees transport pollen by wind.
But most species use insects for their purposes. And this is the smarter way, because less pollen is needed that way.
The insects and other species can carry the pollen directly to their destination.
We are aware of the relationship between insects and plants, of course.
It's a symbiotic relationship. Whether they are flies, birds or bees, they also benefit from it, usually through the nectar.
This symbiotic relationship has led to some wonderful adaptations - the hummingbird hawk moth is one beautiful adaptation.
The plant benefits from the hummingbird dispersing pollen.
Plants have developed little landing strips for bees that otherwise can't find their way.
On many plants are markings that resemble other insects.
These are the anthers of a lily, a very clever design. When an unsuspecting insect lands on it, the pouches flip up and hit the insect on the back, where the pollen gets stuck and carried to other plants.
This is an orchid that looks like it has a mouth. The insects are thus forced to crawl out and become covered in pollen.
There are at least 20,000 species of orchids - an impressive variety.
And they have all kinds of tricks up their sleeves.
They need to attract pollinators to help them.
This orchid, famous for the research of Charles Darwin, who made a great thesis when he saw it. You see a very long nectar tube going down from the orchid.
And what insects have to do there in the middle of the flower - they have to stick their little proboscis in there and all the way down the nectar tube to get to the nectar.
And when Darwin saw that flower he said, "Something must have evolved in parallel with that."
And sure enough, here's this insect.
Normally it curls its proboscis, but in its elongated form it looks like this.
You can imagine that when nectar is so valuable and costly for the plant to produce and attracts many pollinators, it's like human sex, people start to deceive.
They say something like, "I have nectar, do you want to come and get it?"
This is a plant.
This is a plant that insects in South Africa just love. And they've developed a long proboscis to get the nectar.
And this is a copycat,
a plant that copies the original.
And here's the long proboscis fly that didn't get nectar from the copycat. Because the imitator, unlike the fly expects, has no nectar at all.
But not only did the fly not get any nectar, it also has - if you look very closely, at the head end of the proboscis you can see pollen that it would have transferred to other plants, if only a botanist hadn't come along and stuck it on blue paper.
(Laughter) Deception runs through the whole plant kingdom.
Those black dots on he flower, they look like black dots to us, but to male insects of certain species, they look like two females that are very hot.
(Laughter) And when the insect lands there, it picks up pollen, which it takes to other plants. If you look at the "every-household-should-have-one" electron microscope image, you'll see that there are certain three-dimensional patterns.
It probably not only looks good to the insect, but it feels good.
And these electron microscope images - here's one of an orchid mimicking an insect - show that different parts of the shape have different colors and seemingly different surfaces, and to an insect's perception, the textures are very, very different.
This plant has developed the imitation of a shiny metallic surface, like you see on some beetles.
And under the electron microscope, you can see that this surface is very different from the one we've looked at so far.
Sometimes the whole plant mimics an insect, even in our perception.
I think it looks like a flying animal.
It's a wonderful thing.
This one is clever. It's called obsidium.
I sometimes think of it as a sneak attack.
To certain bees, it looks like another bee that is particularly aggressive, so it flies over and hits it on the head several times to drive it away and, of course, picks up a lot of pollen in the process.
At the same time, this plant imitates another orchid, which has rich food for insects.
This one, however, has nothing for them.
So it's cheating on two levels - fabulous.
(Laughter) Here we see the cananga tree, an ingredient in many perfumes.
I smelled one on someone earlier.
The flowers really shouldn't be that colorful.
They send a fantastic spectrum of scents to all the insects.
This one doesn't smell as good.
This is a flower that smells really really nasty and this has evolved to mimic carrion.
So flies love it.
They fly in and pollinate it.
This is a helicodiceros, also known as a "dead horse."
I don't know what a dead horse smells like, but the plant probably sums it up pretty well.
It's really awful.
And blowflies can't help themselves.
They fly in all the way to the back
and lay their eggs there thinking it's carrion, not realizing there's no food for the eggs, which therefore die, but the plant benefits because the fly full of pollen flies on again and pollinates the next flower - fantastic.
This is Arum maculatum, the spotted arum.
I photographed it in Dorset last week.
It warms up to about 15° above ambient temperature - fascinating.
And if you look inside the plant, there's a kind of barrier behind the inflorescences. Flies are attracted to the heat, which creates volatile chemicals, and then are trapped at the bottom of the container.
They drink the wonderful nectar and are sticky afterwards.
Then at night they get a pollen shower and after that the bristles we saw above go limp, thereby giving way to the mosquitoes which are full of pollen - great stuff.
If you think that's great, here's one of my favorites.
This is the philodendron selloum.
If anyone is here from Brazil, you will know this plant.
It's really fascinating.
That kind of phallus there is about 30cm long.
And it does something that no other plant I know does, and that is when it flowers. There in the middle are the inflorescences - for about 2 days it has a metabolism very similar to mammals.
Instead of feeding on starch, which is the diet of plants, it takes something that is similar to brown adipose tissue and burns it so rapidly that the fat burning rate, the metabolism, is equivalent to that of a small cat.
That's twice the energy production of a hummingbird, relative to its weight - insanely impressive.
But he does something else that is unusual.
Not only does he heat up to 43 to 44 °C for about 2 days, but he maintains a constant temperature.
He can regulate his temperature and thus keep it constant.
You ask yourself, "Why does it do that?"
As you can guess, there are some bugs that love to mate at that temperature.
And they fly in and get going.
(Laughter) And the plant showers them with pollen, and they fly on and pollinate.
What a wonderful thing.
The typical pollinator for us is an insect. But in the tropics, a lot of birds and butterflies also pollinate.
And many tropical flowers are red, and we think that's because birds and butterflies have similar vision to ours, so they can see the color red very well.
If you look at the spectrum of birds and humans, we see red, green and blue so this spectrum here.
Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet and different levels of ultraviolet.
So something that goes on beyond our spectrum.
And I hear you asking, "Wouldn't it be great if we could see that too?"
Of course we can.
So what does an insect see?
Last week I photographed this sunflower in Dorset.
As you can see these are little yellow flowers, little yellow flowers all over the place.
And this is what they look like in visible light.
This is what it looks like when you take out the red.
Most bees don't see red.
And then I photographed with ultraviolet filters and exposed for a very, very long time to the particular ultraviolet frequencies and this is what came out.
And that's a fantastic target.
We don't know exactly what bees see, just like you don't know what I see when I say, "This is red."
We can't see into the minds of insects or other people.
But the contrast will be something like this. It stands out against the background.
Here's another little flower - different range of ultraviolet frequencies, different filters, similar to pollinators.
And this is what they would see.
Now if you think all yellow flowers have this characteristic - no flower came to harm for this picture; it was just attached to the tripod, not killed - but under ultraviolet light it looks like this.
And that could serve as the basis of a sunscreen, because sunscreens absorb UV light.
The substances in the plant could be helpful in that.
Finally, we have an evening primrose that Bjorn Rorslett sent me from Norway - fantastic hidden patterns.
I love the idea of hidden things.
I think there's something poetic in there. And that is that these pictures were made with UV filters, filters that are mainly used by astronomers to photograph Venus - more specifically its nebulae.
That is the main purpose of these filters.
Venus is the goddess of love and fertility, and that in turn is the story of flowers.
And flowers not only show great effort to attract pollinators, they also manage to make us plant large fields full of them and give them to each other at births and deaths, and especially at weddings, which, if you think about it, are the moment when the exchange of genetic material from one organism to another is established.
Thank you very much.

Washington - The first hurricane of this season over the Atlantic has made landfall in Texas.
Life-threatening flooding, strong winds and heavy rains now threatened parts of the U.S. state, the National Hurricane Center of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced Sunday night (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of emergency for numerous counties.
The Corona pandemic rampant in Texas complicates the work of aid workers, Abbott said further, according to U.S. media.
Evacuees urged to use caution
"Any hurricane is a tremendous challenge," Abbott said, according to the Houston Chronicle newspaper.
Referring to the hurricane in Texas, he added, "That challenge is complicated and exacerbated when you consider that it is sweeping through an area that is the most Covid-19-affected area in the state."
According to Johns Hopkins University, about 5,000 people have died so far in Texas alone as a result of the Corona pandemic.

A storm surge warning had initially been issued for the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent and was later withdrawn.
Authorities expected weakening as "Hanna" moved further inland and headed toward northeastern Mexico.
"Douglas" moves toward Hawaii
In the Pacific Ocean, Hurricane "Douglas" was headed toward Hawaii Sunday night with winds of about 150 kilometers per hour.

According to the forecast, it should be near Hawaii's largest islands on Sunday (local time) - then as a storm just below the hurricane threshold.
Over the Atlantic, NOAA expected an above-average active hurricane season this year, according to a May forecast.

Four goals disallowed: Video assistant "punishes" Sassuolo
Sassuolo's Filip Djuricic was disallowed two goals at once

"A festival of not given goals for Sassuolo.
Never before has the VAR been so harsh on a team," commented the "Corriere dello Sport".
Host Napoli had taken the lead through a goal from full-back Elseid Hisaj in the 8th minute, and Filip Djuricic initially celebrated the equalizer in the 32nd minute.
The Video Assistant Referee (VAR) took the goal back because of an offside position.
Five minutes later, Djuricic shot the ball into the net again - again the VAR intervened.
The goals of attacker Francesco Caputo (50th) and Domenico Berardi (61st) were also taken back by the referee team after the VAR pointed it out.

FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start of the hot preparation phase for the Champions League began for double winners FC Bayern with a setback.
Hansi Flick, who recovered "reasonably well" after a short vacation and a few days of training, will have to think about how to rebuild his successful defense after the first team training session after the injury of world champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who has the third most minutes of action behind captain Manuel Neuer and midfield boss Joshua Kimmich, suffered a ligament injury to his left ankle and is in danger of missing crucial top-flight duels.
In Munich's mucky weather, the right-back broke off a training match and was driven off the pitch in a golf cart.
It remains to be seen how long the unrestricted regular will have to take a break in the fight for the title.
A deployment in the round of 16 second leg against Chelsea FC on August 8 is likely to be difficult, the 24-year-old can hope for the final tournament starting on August 12 in Lisbon.
The Bavarians, however, do not want to let the mishap from training on Sunday stop them.
In his personal triple formula, Flick named the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on the road to Portugal's capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration are what his victory-hungry title collectors are expected to show in what would ideally be the 28 days between now and the final of the Champions League on August 23.
"We have mastered the compulsory tasks with the championship and cup simply outstanding.
Now it is a matter of creating the special still," said Flick.
However, before the Munich team can get to grips with the final tournament and a training camp in the Algarve beforehand, they first have to play Chelsea FC in the round of 16.
After the 3-0 in the first leg before the Corona break, the Londoners in the home arena should not become the Bayern nightmare again as in the lost "Final dahoam" 2012.
"We have to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and fill up confidence with a good game," demanded Flick.
A test to get in the mood is scheduled for Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn in his stars, who had 13 days off after the double, for a unique August.
He welcomed 31 players to Säbener Straße, including the new players around noble purchase Leroy Sané, who met all new colleagues on the pitch for the first time after his transfer from Manchester City.
"Leroy has fitted in well, as have all the newcomers," Flick reported.
But instead of talking about the new season, when Sané &amp; Co. are no longer only allowed to train with, Flick talked much rather about the current title project of the German serial champion.
After days of individual and small group training, they are now training in team strength for the Londoners, who, unlike Flick's ensemble, are in the rhythm of the game.
After that, the Munich team could face a quarterfinal against FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, with Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin possible opponents in the semifinals.
A path to the final in Lisbon "is not that easy," stressed the head coach, who from Tuesday can rely on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training.
Klose, a World Cup record scorer, and Flick know from many a joint tournament preparation what is particularly important in the 0-on-100 preparation.
Working with his current team is "a pleasure," Flick praised.

Greta Thunberg: Evil look against Donald Trump went around the world

The teenager also talked about her famous "evil eye" when she met Donald Trump.
New York City - In the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg drew attention to herself with her tireless efforts for the "Fridays For Future" movement.
Now she spoke on a popular latenight show about her plans for the future, as well as her encounter with U.S. President Donald Trump at the UN Climate Summit last year.
Latenight host Stephen Colbert welcomed the 17-year-old Thunberg to your show on Tuesday and conducted a lengthy interview with the Swede.
In it, she talked not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the world's powerful.

Things got particularly interesting toward the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was asked about a famous scene in which she gave U.S. President Trump a bitter look.
At the 2019 UN Climate Summit in New York, for which the actvist sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive look was caught on camera and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
The short clip was turned into a GIF, or animated image, which ultimately became one of the most used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the U.S. president at that moment?
In response to Stephen Colbert's relatively open question, she replied only briefly and dryly: "To be honest, I don't think that needs any further explanation.
The experienced satirist Colbert probably didn't expect this quick-witted answer and disappeared from the picture laughing for a moment.
She was remembered by many at the climate conference for her "How dare you?" speech on the principles of climate protection.
