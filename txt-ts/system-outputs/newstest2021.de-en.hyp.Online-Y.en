p. 381 Jan Christopher Horak wrote: “The film is a remarkable achievement by the director.
We're not supposed to know.
You might have known.
Please all be aware of a very simple fact for a moment: We know pretty much everything we know about the universe through light.
We can stand on Earth and look at the night sky and look at stars with our naked eyes.
The sun is burning our peripheral vision.
We see light reflecting from the moon.
and in the time that has passed since Galileo focused that rudimentary telescope on the celestial bodies, the universe known to us has traveled to us as visible light, passing through immeasurable ages of cosmic history.
With the help of all our modern telescopes, we've been able to study it all: this impressive silent film of the universe, this series of snapshots that go back to the Big Bang.
But the universe is not a silent film, because the universe is not mute.
I want to convince you that the universe has a soundtrack and that this soundtrack is played in space itself: because all can swing like a drum.
It can sound a kind of sound recording that can be heard throughout the universe, of some of the most dramatic events when they happened.
Now we'd like to add a tonal component to the wonderful visual arrangement we have from the universe.
And even if we've never heard the sounds of the universe before, we should slowly turn up the volume control for what's happening out there over the next few years.
From this ambition to capture songs from the universe, we focus our interest in black holes and the promise inherent in them. Black holes are hammering against spacetime like wooden mallets on a drum. They have a very characteristic sound that I'd like to play for you; or our idea of what this song will sound like.
One day we may see a shadow cast by a black hole against a light background, but we haven't succeeded so far.
And yet you can hear black holes even when they are invisible. The reason for this is that they play like a drum in spacetime.
We owe the idea that space sounds like a drum, Albert Einstein, to whom we owe so much.
Einstein realized that if space was empty, if the universe was empty, it would have to look like this picture, just without this helpful grid.
But if we were moving through space in free fall, even without that helpful grid, we might be able to paint it ourselves. Because we would see that we are moving through the universe along straight lines, along undistorted, straight paths.
Einstein also realized (and that's what it's all about) that when you bring energy or mass into the universe, it bends the universe. If a free-fall body came past the sun, say, it would be distorted along the natural curvature lines in space.
This is Einstein's great general theory of relativity.
Even light is bent along these paths.
And a body can be bent so much that it enters orbit around the sun, like Earth, or the moon in orbit of the Earth.
These are natural curvatures in space.
What Einstein didn't know was the following: if you were to take the sun and squeeze it into a ball of six kilometers in diameter, if you were to take something millions of times the Earth's mass and squeeze it down to six kilometers, then you would create a black hole; a body of such density that light would make the came close to it, could never escape again. It would be a black shadow in front of the universe.
But Einstein thought black holes were mathematical curiosity throughout his lifetime.
He didn't believe they really existed.
He was convinced that nature would protect us from its creation.
It was supposed to take decades before the term “black hole” was coined and people realized that black holes are astrophysical bodies. In fact, they are the lifeless state form of extremely dense stars that collapse into themselves in a horrible catastrophe at the end of their lives.
Our sun won't end up as a black hole.
It's just not big enough for that.
But we did a small thought experiment, just as Einstein liked to do. Let's imagine squeezing the sun down to six kilometers in diameter and bringing a tiny earth into its orbit, say 30 km away from that black sun.
This earth would glow by itself (because the sun would have disappeared then there would be no other light source) so we let our little earth glow by itself.
We could put the earth into a carefree orbit about 30 km from the crushed black hole.
This crushed black hole would be about the size of Manhattan.
It would pour a little more into the Hudson before it destroyed the earth.
But we're talking about that.
We're talking about something you can squeeze until it's half the size of Manhattan.
Now we're bringing the Earth up close, down to about 30 km, and see how it moves around the black hole in a perfectly flawless orbit.
There's a kind of myth that black holes devour everything in the universe, but in fact you have to get very close to them to fall into it.
But what is particularly impressive from our point of view is the fact that we can always see the Earth.
She can't hide behind the black hole.
The light that comes from Earth, some of it falls in, but some things are scattered and returns to us.
So you can't hide anything behind a black hole.
If this is the battle star Galactica and you're fighting the Cylons, you'd better not hide behind the black hole.
They can see them.
So our sun won't collapse into a black hole, its mass is not enough for this. But there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
If one of them wiped out the Milky Way, it would look like this.
We would see a shadow of the black hole against the backdrop of billions of stars in the Milky Way Galaxy and its glowing dust tracks.
If we hit that black hole, we would see all the light that would bend around it, and we could even enter into the shadows without realizing anything unusual is happening.
It would be bad if we tried to ignite and flee our engines, because we couldn't, just as the light can escape.
But even if the black hole is dark from the outside, it's not dark inside, because all the light from the galaxy could come up behind us.
And although due to a phenomenon of relativity (called time dilation), our clocks seemed to slow down in relation to galactic time, it would look like the galaxy's development had accelerated and shot at us just before we were crushed from the black hole to death.
It would be like a near death experience to see the light at the end of the tunnel. However, it would be a comprehensive death experience.
(Laughter) And you couldn't tell anyone about the light at the end of the tunnel.
Now we've never seen such a shadow of a black hole before, but you can hear black holes even if they're invisible.
Please imagine an astrophysically realistic situation. Imagine two black holes that have spent a long life together.
Perhaps it was once stars that collapsed into two black holes, each with a mass ten times the size of the sun.
We now squeeze them to a diameter of 60 km.
They can spin several hundred times per second.
At the end of their lives, they circle each other almost at the speed of light.
You can travel thousands of miles in a split second. And while they do that, they not only bend the room, but they leave a sound of space in their keel water, a real wave of space-time.
Space is contracting and expanding as it flows out of these black holes and hammering into the universe.
And they travel out into the cosmos at the speed of light.
We owe this computer simulation to a relativity working group of NASA Goddard.
It took almost 30 years for someone to solve this problem.
This was one of those groups.
Here we see two black holes orbiting each other again with the helpful, painted lines.
You may see — it's a bit blurred — but when you see the red waves that come out, they're gravitational waves.
They actually represent the sound of sounding space and will emerge from these black holes at the speed of light as they become quieter and eventually merge into a spinning, silent black hole.
If you were close enough, the sound of the contracting and expanding space would drone in your ears.
They would literally be able to hear the sound.
Of course, your head would also be pressed and stretched, which would be quite unpleasant, which is why you would also have trouble grasping what was happening.
But I'd like to tell you what sounds we would predict here.
This is from my workgroup — a slightly less glamorous computer model.
Imagine that a lighter black hole falls into a very heavy black hole.
What you hear is the sound that the light black hole is hammering onto space every time it passes close to it.
When it disenges again, it's a little too quiet.
But it hits like a mallet and literally smashes space, makes it swing like a drum.
We can predict what that will sound like.
We know that when it falls into it, it gets faster and louder.
And finally, we hear the little guy fall into the big guy.
I've never heard that loud before — it's really much more dramatic.
It sounds a bit disappointing at home.
More like thing, thing, thing.
This is another sound from my group.
No, I don't show you pictures because black holes don't leave any helpful ink marks. Space has no colorful, painted lines.
But if you were driving around in space during a space vacation and you would hear this here, you should make you get away.
(Laughter) You really should get away from that sound.
Both black holes are moving.
Both black holes are getting closer to each other.
In this case, they swing very strongly at first.
And then they merge.
This chirping is typical of the fusion of two black holes that it chirps like that at the end.
This is our idea of what we would see.
Luckily, we're at a safe distance here in Long Beach, California.
But it is likely that two black holes have merged together somewhere in the universe.
And it's just as certain that space will swing around us after it probably took millions of light years or traveled to us a million years at the speed of light.
But the sound is way too quiet than we could ever hear it.
Experiments are being carried out on Earth with great zeal, one of them is called LIGO — the aim is to detect deviations of the order of magnitude smaller than an atomic nucleus over a distance of four kilometers in the way space contracts and expands again.
It's an incredibly ambitious project and its sensitivity will be further developed in the coming years — to be able to perceive this.
There is also to be a mission for space that hopefully will start within the next ten years. She's called LISA.
LISA will be able to see huge black holes, black holes with millions or billions of times the density of the sun.
In this image of the Hubble telescope, we see two galaxies.
They look like they've solidified in a hug.
Each one probably has a huge black hole inside.
But they didn't freeze. They are merging with each other.
These two black holes collide and become one over the course of billions of years.
Our human perception is not able to capture a song of such a period of time.
But LISA could see the final stage of two huge black holes earlier in the history of the universe, the last 15 minutes before they merge.
And it's not just about black holes, but also about all the major disturbances in the universe — and the biggest of them all is the Big Bang.
When the term was coined, it was contemptuous —” Who believes in a big bang, a big bang? ”
This animation of friends of mine in Proton Studios shows an exterior view of the Big Bang, the Big Bang.
We never really want to try this; we never want to be inside the universe because you can never be outside the universe.
So imagine you're in the Big Bang.
It's everywhere, all around you, and space is waving and swinging completely uncontrollably.
14 billion years go by, but this song is still playing around us.
Galaxies are forming and generations of stars are born in these galaxies. And one of these stars, at least one, is surrounded by a habitable planet.
And here we sit and work like crazy on these experiments, do calculations and write computer code.
Imagine two black holes colliding a billion years ago.
Her song has been sounding through space since then, the whole time.
We didn't even exist then.
It's getting closer and closer — we still painted cave paintings 40,000 years ago.
If it's the big bang we're recording, it would sound like this.
It's literally the epitome of noise.
It's white noise, it's such a chaotic sound.
But it's all around us, probably at least if it hasn't been wiped out by another process in the universe.
When we record it, it will sound like music to our ears because it will be a soft echo, an echo of the moment of our creation, our visible universe.
So within the next two years, we'll be able to make the soundtrack a little louder and output the universe as a sound image.
But if we can capture those very earliest moments, it will bring us much closer to understanding the Big Bang, which in turn brings us closer to some of the most complex, hardest questions to grasp.
If we played a film of the universe backwards, we'd know there was a big bang in the past and we could even perceive the cacophony of its sound. But was our big bang the only big bang?
I think we need to ask the question: has something like this happened before?
Will it be repeated?
I think, in line with the challenge TED poses — to reignite amazement — we can ask questions, at least at this last minute, which might otherwise escape us forever.
But we have to ask ourselves: is it possible that our universe is just an offshoot of a bigger story?
Or is it possible that we're just an offshoot of a multiverse — each offshoot with its own big bang in its past — maybe some of them have drum-playing black holes, others may not — in some there might be intelligent lives, others don't — not in our past, not in our past, not in our future, but still fundamentally connected to us in some way?
So we have to ask ourselves: if there is a multiverse, do living beings exist in another fragment of this multiverse?
These are my multiverse creatures.
Are there other creatures in this multiverse that are concerned about us and their own origins?
And if they exist, I can imagine they're like us, they're calculating and writing computer codes, building instruments, trying to make out the remotest sound of their origin, and wonder who else is out there.
Thank you. Thank you.

Many people believe that driving is an activity that is only reserved for people who can see.
A blind person driving a car safely and independently has so far been considered an impossible task.
Hello, my name is Dennis Hong, and we want to give blind people freedom and independence by building a vehicle for the blind.
Therefore, before I talk about this car for blind people, let me briefly talk about another project I was working on and called the DARBA Urban Challenge.
This was about building a robotized car that can drive itself.
You press start, nobody touches anything, and it can reach their goal completely automatically.
Thus, in 2007, our team won half a million dollars by becoming third in the competition.
Around this time, the National Blind Association, or NFB, challenged the investigation committee to create a car that can be driven safely and independently by a blind person.
We decided to try because we thought, hey, how difficult it could be.
We already have an automatic vehicle.
We're putting in a blind person and it's done, right?
(Laughter) We couldn't have been wrong anymore.
What the National Blind Association (NFB) wanted was not a vehicle that moves blind people around, but a vehicle where a blind person can make active decisions and drive.
That's why we had to throw everything away and start over again.
Therefore, to test this insane idea, we developed a small buggy prototype vehicle to test its feasibility.
And in the summer of 2009, we invited dozens of young blind people from all over the country and gave them the opportunity to go for a ride.
It was an absolutely amazing experience.
But the problem with this car was that it was designed so that it could only be driven in a controlled environment, a level, traffic-free parking lot, and even highlighting the lanes with red traffic cones.
Therefore, with this success, we decided on the next big step to develop a real car that can be driven in real roads.
So how does it work?
Well, it's a pretty complicated system, but let me try to explain it, and maybe I can simplify it.
Well, we've got three steps.
We have perception, calculation, and non-visual interfaces.
Well, it's clear that the driver can not see, so the system needs to be able to perceive the environment and be able to collect information for the driver.
For that, we use an initial measurement unit.
It measures acceleration, angular acceleration, like a human ear, an inner ear.
We merge the information with a GPS unit to get approximately the position of the car.
We also use two cameras to detect the lanes of the road.
And we also use three laser distance measurements.
The lasers scan the surrounding area to detect obstacles, a car approaching us from the front or from behind, and also any obstacles entering the road, any obstacles around the vehicle.
After that, all this enormous amount of information is passed into the computer, and the computer can do two things.
First, first of all, process the information to understand what the environment is like; this is road lanes, obstacles, and that information communicates to drivers.
The system is also smart enough to calculate the safest way to operate the car.
We can also generate instructions on how to operate the vehicle's control.
But, the problem is this: how can we convey this information and instructions to a person who can't see quickly enough and fairly accurately so they can drive?
For this, we have developed different types of non-visual user interface technology.
We started out with a three-dimensional ping sound system, a vibration vest, a click wheel with voice commands, a footstrip, and even a shoe that puts pressure on the leg.
But today, we're going to talk about three of these non-visual user interface technologies.
Well, the first interface technology is called DriveGrip.
This is a pair of gloves and it has its vibrating elements on the ankle side, so they can provide instructions on how to control, direction and intensity.
Another device is called SpeedStrip.
These are a chair, actually, a massage chair.
We hollow it out and we reorganize the vibrating elements into different patterns. And we use it to provide information about speed and also to provide instructions on how to use the accelerator and brake pedal.
So, here you can see how the computer sees the environment. And since they can't see the vibration, we even equip the driver with red LEDs so they can really see what's going on.
This is the sensory data, and this data is forwarded to devices via computers.
Therefore, these two devices, DriveGrip and SpeedGrip, are very effective.
But the problem is that it's stitch instructions devices.
So this isn't real freedom, is it?
The computer tells you how to drive, turn left, turn right, speed up, stop.
We call it backseat driver problem.
That's why, let's move away from stitch instructions devices and now focus more on information devices.
AirPix is a good example of this non-visual information interface technology.
Think of it as a monitor for the blind.
Well, it's a small tray, it has lots of holes and it releases compressed air, so it can even draw pictures.
Therefore, even when they are blind, they can put their hand on it, see the lanes and obstacles on the road.
In fact, they can also change the air frequency that escapes and possibly the temperature.
Therefore, it is indeed a multidimensional user interface.
Well, here you can view the left camera, the right camera seen from the vehicle, and see how the computer interprets this and sends the information to AirPix.
For that, we're showing a simulator, a blind person who drives and uses AirPix.
This simulator was also very useful for training blind drivers and also fast testing different types of ideas for different types of non-visual user interfaces.
So, that's how it works mainly.
But this vehicle is a prototype, and it won't enter the road until it's proven to be safe, or safer than today's vehicles.
And I really believe this can happen.
But still, will society, would they accept such a radical idea?
How are we going to handle insurance?
How are we going to issue driver licenses?
Apart from technological challenges, there are many kinds of hurdles that we have to overcome until it becomes reality.
Of course, the main goal of this project is to produce a car for a blind person.
But potentially more important than this is the huge benefits of spin-off technology you can get from this project.
The sensors that are needed can be seen in the dark in fog and rain.
And along with these new types of interfaces, we can use this technology and apply it in safer cars for normal seeing people.
Or for blind people, in everyday household appliances, in training and in the office.
Imagine a teacher writing on the blackboard in a classroom, and a blind student can see and read what he wrote using these non-visual interface technologies.
It's priceless.
So, the things I showed you today are just the beginning.
Thank you so much.

Discuss the abolition of the 50+1 rule
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended that you think about the abolition of the 50+1 rule.
“German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates completed facts,” Grindel told the “Bild am Sonntag”.
He stressed: “The 50+1 rules do not work for the clubs that are most likely to become Bavaria and Dortmund dangerous anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, it is not possible to avoid the debate whether it is not necessary to facilitate investor involvement for clubs that want to break into this phalanx”.
However, he doubts whether there is a willingness to allow majority participation in the German Football League that is prohibited by the 50+1 rule in the Bundesliga.
“It remains a legal risk to pull investment fences around the Bundesliga as a business location in a European single market,” said Grindel.
The former DFB head sees the danger that “attempts to create more competitive balance in the Bundesliga end only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but do not lead to more tension in the championship”.
Even a uniform distribution of TV money will not have a decisive effect.
“FC Bayern generates sales of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund from 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
The differences are therefore immense among the top three clubs alone.
The other 15 clubs have an average budget of 130 million,” said the 58-year-old.
With a view to the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
“Unfortunately, there were people who noticed this error and pierced it to the press instead of talking to me about it,” Grindel said about accepting an expensive watch that led to his resignation in April 2019.
“This has already been very concerned with me in human terms.”
He received the gift worth around 11,000 euros from a Ukrainian official.
“I committed a compliance violation and it was right to draw the consequences from it,” said Grindel.
“I handled the ominous watch gift completely transparently and unruthlessly.
Many people in the DFB knew about it”.
He never “made a secret from the gift,” assured the 58-year-old.
“You might call it naive, at least this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption.”

Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes defy Corona
Although the big break was missing in the spa town, visitors and performers enjoyed the rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: the Rakoczy weekend without a rakoczy festival.
But: Even though the big party mile in the city center was missing, crowds and program highlights such as Saale, rakoczy ball or pageant were burning, many of them got their money's worth with the Corona-compliant alternative program.

The weather would have been a great fit this year,” she says.

Arrived professionally - not private yet
“It's going great” - Dr. Stefanie Kramer draws this conclusion after her first days at the notary's office in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very fast: in mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will succeed Lutz Feller at the Notary Office in Eggenfelden.
Just six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the lawyer with a doctorate started working, and normal day-to-day business has long been in full swing.
“However, I still have to arrive privately,” she explains in conversation with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
The short lead time was, of course, not enough to move the center of life from Regensburg to Eggenfelden completely, reports the native Dingolfingerin.
She is currently looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city with her husband, who works as a judge at the district court in Regensburg.
At least her husband was able to apply for parental leave on short notice in order to provide care for the two daughters (3½ and 1½ years old).
In order not to have to commute from Regensburg every day, she also has an overnight accommodation with her parents in Dingolfing for the time being, explains the 39-year-old.
Growing up in the neighbouring district, the city of Eggenfelden has of course long been familiar to her.
During local visits with her family in recent months, she found out again: “Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town”.
She was all the more pleased that she made the race in the vacancy selection process.
Her homeland of Lower Bavaria also plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's career: After studying law in Passau, she completed her legal clerkship period and the 2nd state examination in Regensburg.
After several positions as a notary assessor, among others, in Rehau and Hof in Upper Franconia, Babenhausen in the Unterallgäu and Regensburg - she also took her first position as a notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016, she went on parental leave, followed by the move to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken over representative services in various notarial offices.
When the position in Eggenfelden was advertised due to Lutz Feller's approaching retirement, she saw the right time for full career re-entry, explains the 39-year-old.
The team of her predecessor, who will take over vacation representation in the notarial office in the future, has completely taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer - and has a praise for the firm's team right away: “It's going great!”
The fact that she can rely on well-established processes here makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of the private place of life.
In terms of kindergarten or nativity squares, she has already contacted a local institution.
And everything works out as desired, she hopes to pursue her hobby here soon - and get to know the most beautiful jogging tracks in the Rottal.

BVB plans to launch league with a maximum of 15,000 viewers
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be 20 percent full at the start of the season in the event of a fan return.
“Due to the distance regulation, which is mandatory to comply, we are currently planning with 12,000 to 15,000 viewers,” Borussia Dortmund's managing director Carsten Cramer told “Tagesspiegel”.
Normally, the arena in the district city captures just over 81,000 spectators in Bundesliga games.
In last season's ghost games caused by the corona pandemic, BVB lost around four million euros per game.
Cramer responsible for marketing, digitization and internationalization at BVB hopes that in addition to normal spectators, some of the approximately 4000 places in the hospitality area can also be opened again: “It is of course a blow to the office if these revenues break away completely”.
In view of the ongoing corona crisis, everyone is currently “well advised to take a stable page length first”.
“If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people are on short-time working in Germany alone, then the need for entertainment is limited,” explained Cramer.
The head of marketing from Dortmund praised the BVB professionals for their salary partial waiver, which is meant to help overcome the crisis: “Of course, players know that their salary waiver has a different effect than when we put 100 people working in merchandising on short-time work.”

Kalbitz ejection from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of “fig leaf”
From the FDP's perspective, the exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is just a “fig leaf” and does not change the character of the party.
“The AfD is the parliamentary arm of right-wing extremists in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the Radical iceberg in the AfD,” said FDP interior politician Benjamin Strasser to the news agency dpa in Berlin.
The Federal Arbitration Tribunal of the AfD confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz on Saturday in Stuttgart after several hours of hearing, which was decided by the majority of the Federal Executive Board in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD Group in the Brandenburg State Parliament.
“If the AfD was really about consistently removing right-wing extremists from their party, officials like Björn Höcke and his followers would have long been excluded,” said Strasser.
“However, there is no political will in the AfD because right-wing extremism is now part of the party”.
CSU Secretary General Markus Blume said similarly: “The fact that Andreas Kalbitz now remains excluded says nothing and does not change anything,” he told the “World on Sunday”.
“Rather, it speaks volumes of how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist still has in the middle of the AfD”.
Blume expects the AfD to land below five percent again in elections in the future.
“The days of the AfD in parliaments are numbered”.
Kalbitz was one of the spokesmen of the officially dissolved “wing” around Thuringian AfD state and group chairman Björn Höcke; constitutional protection classifies stroening as “secured right-wing extremist aspiration.”
In May, the AfD Federal Executive Board kicked Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason he stated, Kalbitz did not specify earlier membership in the now banned far-right “home office German Youth” (HDJ) and the Republicans when he joined the party.
Kalbitz denies membership of HDJ.
The chairman of the left-wing parliamentary group in the Brandenburg State Parliament, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Tribunal did not change the character of the AfD: “The wolf only ate chalk.
The AfD remains a far-right party, whether with or without calbitz”.
This decision neither weakens the federal party nor does the right wing be weakened.
“The maneuver of the Meuthen troupe is transparent.
You want to avoid further observation by constitutional protection and try to get through under the radar,” said Walter.
“The AfD is not getting rid of the ghosts it called.
Ejection doesn't change anything yet,” commented Brandenburg SPD general secretary Erik Stohn about the decision in the Kalbitz case.
“Here, the AfD National Association and the faction remained their right-wing leader to this day”.
The legal dispute over Kalbitz's membership in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he would now take civil law against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Tribunal.

North Sea wind farms deliver a good 21 percent more electricity
Wind power plants on the German North Sea fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid in the first six months of the year.
This is a good 21 percent more than in the same period last year, said network operator Tennet in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for transferring North Sea electricity to the mainland and forwarding it through the German power grid.
Wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of Tennet's grid area, have fed another 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, wind power from the North and Baltic Seas comes to 13.73 TWh, compared with a good 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind flow in Germany; that's about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms provide higher generation capacities
In addition to wind conditions, the increased contribution of offshore wind energy results from higher generation capacities because new wind farms have been connected to the grid in the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea were all running at full power at the same time, they could generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity by calculation.
The transmission capacity is sufficient; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatts.
It is expected to rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea by 2030.
“In Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing 20 billion euros in expanding offshore grid connections by then,” said Tennet Managing Director Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind farms cannot exploit their capacity even at sea, but reach around 40 percent.
The record day so far this year is January 2, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, North Sea wind turbines produce around 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, which is equivalent to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could supply almost seven million households with electricity.

Freital: Windbergfest cancelled due to corona
The Windberg Festival is not taking place this year.
The city of Freital cancelled the three-day festival scheduled in September.
In other years, over 30,000 people had visited this city festival.
“We really did not make this decision easy for ourselves and - aware of how difficult it is economically for the participants - hoped until the last minute,” said Lord Mayor Uwe Rumberg (unparty).
“But ultimately, as organizers, we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people here.”
Because if tens of thousands had flowed to the festival grounds and into the marquee, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact tracking in accordance with the current corona protection regulation could not have been observed.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that there wouldn't be much left of a folk festival.
In addition, the organizational and monitoring effort would increase disproportionately many times over.
Rumberg put off to next year.
The city of Freital will then celebrate its 100th anniversary with, among other things, the Winter Mountain Festival from May 7 to 9, 2021 and Saxony Day from September 10 to 12, 2021.

Heil wants to check other industries after meat industry
The corona crisis brought conditions to light again in parts of the meat industry.
Law tightening is imminent.
But are they right - and will it stick with it?
Federal Labor Minister Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to review other industries according to the strict regulations now planned against maladministration in the meat industry.
“We will look at industry by industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry when necessary,” said Heil to the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employers are already warning against restricting work contracts in general.
After the massive corona outbreak at meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet intends to adopt a law of salvation this Wednesday.
Large slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to use external personnel during slaughter, cutting and meat processing.
For this purpose, the use of work contracts and temporary workers there is to be banned.
Employer President Ingo Kramer told dpa: “Stay away from a general restriction on work contracts and temporary workers if you don't want to completely stall the economy”.
For example, work contracts are the basis for their added value at the customer for large areas of trade, construction and plant engineering.
“The misconduct of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument.”
Heil assured: “My goal is not to ban work contracts everywhere in the German economy”.
Work contracts make sense.
“When an industrial company commissions a craftsman to install a safety system, it is a normal work contract”.
The German meat industry considers a ban on work contracts and temporary work unconstitutional in its industry alone.
It cannot be explained why, in the future, labor law should apply different from sausage when portioning and packaging cheese, as reported by the “Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung” (Saturday).
Consumer prices would therefore rise by 10 to 20 percent per kilo and product in the event of a ban.
According to the results of an audit by the NRW Occupational Health and Safety Administration, often Eastern European employees from contracting companies worked in the industry 16 hours a day.
They often didn't have a break.
Wages were retained for protective equipment or rent.
It was also found that the situation with employee accommodation was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively sharp law came into force for the meat industry as early as 2017.
However, these were bypassed by “tricky constructions”.
“Now it needs to be fundamentally cleaned up.”
The politician announced: “In the Occupational Health and Safety Act, which we intend to adopt in the cabinet at the end of July, also includes measures that not only affect the meat industry - for example, higher test rates for occupational health and safety or clear criteria for community accommodation”.
The draft presented to dpa includes amendments to the Act on the Safeguarding of Workers' Rights in the Meat Industry and the Occupational Health and Safety Act.
Brandenburg's Consumer Protection Minister Ursula Nonnemacher (Green) considers more intensive controls necessary.

However, more personnel offices are also required for more controls.

Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - Despite all threatened penalties and court rulings, drivers continue to accelerate in countless illegal races on Baden-Württemberg roads: The police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal car races last year and the first four months of this year.
There are no benchmarks for the years before, but the speeders are making judicial authorities increasingly work: Public prosecution offices between Konstanz and Mannheim conducted a total of 155 investigations for illegal races in 2018, with 252 years later, and 151 in the current year until the beginning of June.
The races were less about organized events, as evidenced by the Ministry of the Interior to a request from the Landtag SPD.
In most cases, the drivers spontaneously competed against each other or they would have escaped from the police - this is also reported as an illegal race.
German men between the ages of 18 and 60 were mainly behind the wheel.
113 fines - imprisonment 15 times
Only in comparatively few cases are the speeders caught and also asked to cash register: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines have been imposed and 15 imprisonment sentences have been issued since 2018.
But there is no evidence that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
Rather, other drivers were more sensitive than before because of the many tragic accidents and processes of past years and showed more frequently, said a department spokesperson.
Highway 8 is particularly popular with racers, motorists keep slowing down traffic there in order to make room for themselves and use the free track for a race.
Last August, a dozen drivers were caught near Kirchheim unter Teck, and three months earlier, there were even 18 drivers on the A8 at Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular “racetrack”
The police even register more races on the A81 than on any other federal highway.
A speed limit tries to slow down the speeders on the particularly affected section between Engen and Geisingen.
The mostly high-priced and upbeat sports and luxury cars often have Swiss license plates because drivers are moving to Germany for the lawn due to the high penalties for driving too fast and car racing in the neighbouring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit cannot be reduced to a few distances: “With a general speed limit of 130 kilometers per hour, we would get rid of this problem on motorways,” says Martin Rivoir, the transport expert of the SPD state parliament group.
“The inhibition threshold for speeders would be significantly higher if you were not allowed to travel legally here and there at 200 kilometers per hour or more”.
Rivoir thinks less of enlightenment or image campaigns: “Anyone who puts themselves beyond all rules in this way and not only puts their own lives at stake, but also the lives of other road users, is hardly accessible with reason”.
ADAC calls for stronger police crackdown
That's not enough for ADAC, on the other hand: “We assume that speed limits will not be deterred by speed limits,” says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and Environment at ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and tougher controls on the affected routes.
The high-speed test of strength often becomes painful and momentous serious: Since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people died in the races nationwide, two of them non-participants in a nightly crash in Stuttgart's city centre and one in Gerlingen.
Two young men are said to have delivered a car race there in November.
One of the vehicles came off the road, bounced against a garden wall and remained on its side, and the 18-year-old passenger died.
21 more people have been injured in the races of the past two years.
However, tougher penalties are not necessary, according to Interior Minister Thomas Strobl: “Legislative need for action to sanction illegal motor vehicle races harder is not seen,” says the Ministry of Interior Paper.

The first time I was in Antarctica almost 10 years ago, where I saw my first icebergs.
I was seized in awe.
My heart was racing, I felt dizzy while trying to grasp what was in front of me.
The icebergs around me protruded almost 60 meters out of the water. And I could only be amazed that this was a snowflake on another snowflake year after year.
Icebergs are born as a calf of a glacier or by breaking out of ice floes.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They are clearly interacting with their surroundings and experiences.
Some refuse to give up and cling to the bitter end, while others can't stand it anymore and collapse in a fit of dramatic passion.
When you look at an iceberg, it's easy to think they're isolated, separate and alone, just like we humans often see each other.
But the truth is far from it.
As an iceberg melts, I breathe in its prehistoric atmosphere.
As the iceberg melts, it releases mineral-rich drinking water that nourishes many forms of life.
I take pictures of these icebergs as if I were taking portraits of my ancestors, knowing that they exist this way in these individual moments and will never exist that way again.
It's not death when they melt; it's not an end, but a continuation of their path along the lifecycle.
Part of the ice in the icebergs I photograph is very young — a few thousand years old.
And some of the ice cream is more than 100,000 years old.

That's the average size of a Greenland iceberg.
It protrudes about 120 feet out of the water, or 40 metres.

Nuremberg: Unapproved Tuning Meeting - Police intervene, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and temporarily over 1000 people took part in a “tuning meeting” in the parking lot of a furniture store on Saturday night.
The police made their announcement that they would more control such events.
There was a big tuning meeting on Saturday evening (July 25, 2020) in Nuremberg Südstadt.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the Middle Franconia police, the Nuremberg traffic police found an increased vehicle volume in the area of a large parking lot on Ingolstädter Straße at around 10.30 pm.
The police then carried out a variety of vehicle checks there.
The police only recently announced that they intend to take more action against so-called autoposers.

It appears that the majority of the relevant scene was following the police appeal.
On the basis of the vehicles and people on site, it can be assumed that these were mostly onlookers.

The control measures carried out on site ended around 1:00 a.m.

Austria: mass tests after corona outbreak in tourist resort
Authorities have reacted to a corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist town of St. Wolfgang with hundreds of tests.
The number of confirmed cases rose to 48, as reported by the state authorities in Linz.
More than 100 results were still pending in the evening.
As a result, many of the infected are young interns in tourism companies, but at least one holiday guest has also been tested positive.
Residents, guests and tourism staff were asked to stay in their accommodations on Saturday evening.
The curfew was set at 11 pm.
“There are cancellations and cancellations there and there”, said the head of the tourism association Wolfgangsee, Hans Wieser, dpa.
In some cases, guests also left early.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist resort in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, around one-third of guests are German.
The first infections had become public on Friday.
The head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended the behavior of interns on Saturday, who had celebrated in several venues and could have become infected there.
“We all liked to do that in our youth,” he told radio station OE1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The tourism association launched an information campaign to raise awareness of the dangers of Covid-19 for young employees.
From Saturday, hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from July 15 were contacted.
The outbreak brings memories of the Austrian ski and party resort Ischgl in Tyrol, which was a center of corona spread throughout Europe in the early stages of the pandemic.

The intuition that inequality weakens social cohesion existed even before the French Revolution.
What's new is that we now have evidence. We can compare societies, equal and unequal ones, and see what inequality does.
I want to show you statistics and explain why there are connections between them.
Look what a poor bunch we are.
(Laughter) I'd like to start with a paradox.
This shows life expectancy and gross national income — on average in rich countries.
You can see that the countries on the right, Norway and the US, for example, are twice as rich as Israel, Greece, Portugal on the left.
And that doesn't change their life expectancy at all.
It doesn't speak for a connection.
But within societies, there are enormous social gaps in health across society.
Here, again, life expectancy.
There are small areas in England and Wales here — the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.
A big difference between the poor and the rest of us.
Even people just below the top are feeling worse in health than those at the top.
So income is very important within individual societies, and none between them.
The explanation for this paradox is that we are dealing with relative income within societies, social position, status — where we are in relation to each other, and how large the distances between us are.
And when you understand that, you immediately wonder: what happens when the differences get bigger, or smaller when income differences rise or fall?
And I'll show you that now.
Not with hypothetical data.
With data from the UN — the same one that the World Bank uses — on the extent of income differences in wealthy developed market democracies.
The measure we use because it's easy to understand and available for download is how much richer the top 20 percent is than the bottom 20 percent of each country.
You can see that in the same countries on the left — Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden — the top 20 percent is around 3½, 4 times as rich as the bottom 20 percent.
But on the other hand — Great Britain, Portugal, the US, Singapore — the differences are twice as large.
On this scale, we are twice as unequal as some of the other successful market democracies.
Now I'll show you what this does with our societies.
We have collected data on problems with social disparities, the problems that are more common at the bottom of social leaders.
Internationally comparable data on children's life expectancy, mathematics, reading and writing skills, child mortality and murder rates, what proportion of the population is detained, teenage pregnancies, trust, obesity, mental illnesses — which include drug and alcohol addiction in standard diagnostics — and social mobility.
We've summarized them in an index.
All of them with the same weight.
For each country, there is some sort of average value of these factors.
And here they see him in relation to the level of inequality I've shown you that I'll keep coming back to.
The uneven countries are doing worse on all these social problems.
This is an unusually high correlation.
But if you put the same index of health and social problems in relation to GNI per capita, gross national income, there's nothing more, no correlation.
We made sure people think we only selected the problems that support our reasoning and constructed these evidence, so we also published an essay in the British Medical Journal on the UNICEF index of child welfare in the British Medical Journal.
In it, 40 different components were put together by other people.
The index includes whether children can talk to their parents, whether they have books at home, their immunization rates, whether there is bullying in school.
Everything flows in.
Here's the index relative to our inequality values.
The children are doing worse in unequal societies.
A highly significant ratio.
And again, when you compare the index of child welfare with national per capita income, there is no correlation, not even a hint.
All the data I've shown you so far says the same thing.
The average well-being of our societies no longer depends on national income and economic growth.
They are crucial in poorer countries, but not in the rich developed world.
But the differences between us where we are compared to each other has become very important.
I'll show you some parts of our index now.
Here's trust, for example.
Just the proportion of the population that believes you can trust most people.
The data comes from the World Values Survey.
On the uneven side, about 15 percent of the population believes you can trust others.
But in the same societies, it's up to 60 or 65 percent.
And there are similarly close links to inequality for the degree of involvement in community life or social capital.
We've done all this work twice.
First with the rich, developed countries, and then again with the 50 American states in a second test field — with the same question: are the uneven states doing worse on all these scales?
This is where trust is linked to inequality, according to data collection by the US government.
A very similar distribution over a similar range of trust levels.
The same thing happens here.
Our basic result is that almost all factors associated with trust internationally do the same in the 50 US states in a separate testing environment.
And that's not just a happy coincidence.
There's mental illness here.
WHO created these figures by conducting the same diagnostic interviews with randomly selected test subjects to compare the rates of mental illness in societies.
This is the percentage of the population that had been mentally ill last year.
It ranges from 8 percent to three times that — entire societies that have three times as high rates of mental illness as others.
And again, a high correlation to inequality.
And here's violence.
These red dots are American states, the blue triangles are Canadian provinces.
Note the scale of differences.
It goes from 15 murders per million to 150.
That's the proportion of the population that's in custody.
There is about a tenfold difference here on the lateral log scale.
It goes from about 40 to 400 people imprisoned.
This ratio is not primarily caused by higher crime rates.
In some places, that's a subfactor.
But the main reason is tougher court rulings.
And uneven societies are also more likely to hold on to the death penalty.
There are kids here who are dropping out of school.
Again, pretty big differences.
With devastating effects on the benefit of people's talent.
This is social mobility.
It's actually a measurement of mobility based on income.
The question is: Do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers poor sons, or is there no connection between them?
On the uneven side, fathers' income is much more important — in the UK, in the USA.
And in Scandinavian countries, fathers' income is much less important.
There's more social mobility.
We like to say — and I know that many Americans are in the audience here — if Americans want to live the American dream, they should go to Denmark.
(Laughter) (Applause) I've just introduced you a few things now.
I could have shown you a lot of other problems.
All these problems are more common at the bottom of the social gradient.
But there are countless problems with social differences that are worse in uneven countries — not just a bit, but somewhere between twice and 10 times as common.
Imagine these costs, human costs.
But I'd like to get back to the graph again where we put everything together to show two things.
On the one hand, graph by graph shows that the countries that do badly, regardless of the result, are apparently the more uneven ones, and those that do better appear to be the Nordic countries and Japan.
So what we see is a general social dysfunction associated with inequality.
That's not just one or two things, but most of them.
You can see the other very important aspect of this graph down here, Sweden and Japan — very different countries in many ways.
The position of women, how much they hold on to the core family, lies here in opposite Poles of the rich, developed world.
Another very important difference is how they achieve greater equality.
In Sweden, there are huge differences in earnings that are offset by taxation, the general welfare state, generous social benefits, etc.
It's completely different in Japan.
There are smaller differences in earnings there even before the tax.
There are lower taxes.
A smaller welfare state.
And in our analysis of American states, we find the same contrast.
Some states are successful through redistribution, others are doing well because they have low income differences before tax.
Our conclusion is that it's not as important as to how you achieve greater equality as long as you somehow achieve it.
I mean not perfect equality, I'm talking about something that already exists in rich market democracies.
Another surprising part of the picture is that not only the poor are affected by inequality.
Apparently there's some truth in John Donne's “No one is an island.”
In several studies, you can compare how people in more or less the same countries perform at each level of the social hierarchy.
This is just one example.
child mortality.
Some Swedes kindly classified a large part of their child death according to the British register for socioeconomic classification.
This is an anachronistic classification according to the professions of fathers, so single parents are managed separately.
But where “low social class” is noted, it means unskilled handicraft activities.
Then there are the skilled craft professions in the middle, then the subordinate non-artisanal, up to the higher established professions — doctors, lawyers, executives of larger companies.
You can see that Sweden is better than Britain, across the entire social hierarchy.
The biggest differences are down in society.
But even at the top, living in a more equal society seems to have a small advantage.
We show this on five different data sets that deal with educational outcomes and health in the US and internationally.
This seems to be the case in general — greater equality is the most important at the bottom, but has some advantages even at the top.
But I should say something more about what's happening there.
I'm concerned with the psychosocial effects of inequality.
This has to do with feelings of superiority and inferiority, the feeling of being valued or devalued, respected or despised.
And of course, the sense of status competition that results from this drives consumer thinking in our society.
It also leads to status uncertainty.
We are more concerned about how others judge us, whether we are considered attractive, smart, etc.
The socially assessing judgments are increasing and the fear of these judgments.
Interestingly, there is similar research in social psychology: some people have evaluated 208 different studies where volunteers were invited to psychological laboratories to measure their stress hormones and their response to stressful tasks.
What she was interested in evaluating was what types of stress most reliably raised the cortisol level, that of the central stress hormone.
And the result was: tasks that posed a threat to social assessment — threats to self-confidence or social status, where others can negatively assess their own performance.
These types of stress have a very specific effect on the physiology of stress.
We've been criticized.
Of course there are people who don't like this and people who find it very amazing.
But I should tell you that if you criticize us for a targeted selection of our data, we never select specifically for our purposes.
Our absolute principle is that if our data source has data for one of the countries we're looking at, it goes into analysis.
Our data source determines whether it's reliable data, not us.
Anything else would be bias.
What about other countries?
There are 200 studies on health relative to income and equality in academic peer review journals.
This is not limited to these countries that is a very simple demonstration.
The same countries, the same inequality scale, one problem after another.
Why don't we check other factors?
We've shown that per capita income doesn't make any difference.
And, of course, others have also tested poverty and education and others using more sophisticated methods.
What about causality?
A correlation does not yet prove causality.
We've spent a lot of time on that.
In fact, people know the causal references very well in some of these results.
The big news in our understanding of the driving forces for long-term health in the rich developed world is how much chronic social stress affects the immune system, the cardiovascular system.
Or, for example, the reason why violence is more common in uneven societies is because people are sensitive to being despised.
To cope with this, we need to clarify what happens after the tax and what happens before the tax.
We need to limit income, bonus culture income at the top.
We need to blame our bosses to employees as best we can.
But the message to take away is that we can improve the actual quality of human life if we fix the income gap between us.
Suddenly, there is a lever for the psychosocial well-being of entire societies, and that's very exciting.
Thank you.

Premier League: Man United and Chelsea Qualified for Champions League
London (dpa) - English football record champion Manchester United returns to the Champions League after a year of absence.
The Red Devils secured third place on the final matchday of the Premier League with a 2-0 (0:0) success against direct competitor Leicester City.
The foxes now have to settle for the Europa League because Chelsea FC was still passing by and also qualified in fourth for the premier class.
Aston Villa was allowed to cheer in the fight against the descent.
Manchester United took the lead by a penalty kick from Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in the aftermath, Jesse Lingard (90.+8) hit the final score.
Chelsea, FC Bayern opponent in the Champions League of 16 finals, won the Wolverhampton Wanderers in parallel with 2-0 (2:0) thanks to Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4).
“That means a lot to me,” said coach Frank Lampard, who is also in the final of the FA Cup against Arsenal in his first season as Chelsea Coach.
Chelsea's victory against Wolverhampton also benefited from Tottenham Hotspur, which passed the Wolves with a lean 1:1 (1:0) at Crystal Palace and starts sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa decided the remote duel with FC Watford and AFC Bournemouth for himself, but had to shake for a long time at West Ham United for class retention.
Jack Grealish's late leadership (84th) immediately recalled Andrej Jarmolenko (85th).
But that was enough because Watford lost at Arsenal at 2:3 (1:3).
The club, which took three coaches in the season, is disembarked after five first league years.
Just like Bournemouth, who couldn't save itself with a 3:1 (2:1) at FC Everton.
In the end, a point was missing.
FC Liverpool, which has been established as English champion since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3-1 (1:1) win at Newcastle United.
99 points are the highest score the Reds ever scored in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team barely missed the score record in English football.
Manchester City holds its record with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After the first minute Newcastle guided tour, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) shot the game for Liverpool on Sunday.
“It was an extraordinary season for this wonderful club,” goalscorer Van Dijk said after the game, “it should inspire us to defend the title.
It's going to be hard”.
Premier League bosses should also be satisfied in the end.
Due to the coronavirus crisis, football operations in England were interrupted from March 13 to June 17.

I want to show you today how we will make things in the future.
I believe that our buildings and machines will soon assemble, reproduce and repair themselves.
I'll show you what I think is today's production methods and then compare them to some natural systems.
In the current manufacturing industry, we have skyscrapers — two and a half years [construction time], half to a million parts, quite complex, new and exciting technologies from steel, concrete, glass.
We have exciting machines that take us into space — five years [construction time], two and a half million parts.
If you look at natural systems on the other hand, you can find proteins that have two million types and can fold in ten microseconds, or DNA with three billion base pairs that can be copied in about an hour.
So there's all this complexity in our natural systems, but they're extremely efficient, much more efficient than anything we can make, far more complex than anything we can build.
They're much more energy efficient.
They almost never make mistakes.
And they are durable as they can repair themselves.
So there's a lot of interesting things to discover with natural systems.
And if we manage to incorporate that into our built environment, we have exciting potential for new construction methods.
And I think the key is self-assembly.
If we want to use self-assembly in our physical environment, I think there are four key factors.
The first is that we have to decipher the whole complexity of the things we want to build — that is, our buildings and machines.
And we need to translate that into simple sequences — basically the DNA of how our buildings work.
Then we need programmable parts that can use this sequence and use it to fold or reconfigure.
We need activation energy so our parts can flip up from the program.
And we need some kind of redundancy for error correction so that what we want to build is really created.
I'll show you some projects that my colleagues and I are working on at MIT so that self-assembly can be realized in the future.
The first two are MacroBot and DeciBot.
These projects are large-scale, reconfigurable robots — two and a half to four metres long proteins.
They are equipped with electromechanical devices, sensors.
You decode what you want to fold up into a sequence of angles — minus 120, minus 120, 0, 0, 120, minus 120 — something like that; a sequence of angles, or turns, and you send that sequence through the chain.
Each unit picks up its message — minus 120 — it rotates accordingly, checks if it has arrived, and forwards it to the adjacent unit.
These are the brilliant scientists, engineers and designers who worked on this project.
And I think it really makes one thing clear: is this really scalable?
I mean, thousands of dollars, many hours of work to create this two-and-a-half meter high robot.
Can we really scale that up? Can we really embed robotics in every part?
The next project questions this and looks at the passive nature or the passive attempt to make reconfiguration programmable.
But it goes one step further and tries to make actual calculations possible.
It basically integrates the most fundamental component of IT, the digital logic gate, directly into the parts.
This is a NAND gate.
You have a tetrahedron that represents the gate that will perform the calculations, and you have two input tetrahedron.
One is the user's input while you create the building blocks.
The other is from the previous component that was arranged.
And then it delivers an output in three-dimensional space.
This means that the user can enter what the parts should do.
It performs calculations based on what it did before and what the user requires it to do.
And now it starts moving in three-dimensional space — up and down.
On the left side, the input [1.1] corresponds to output 0 that goes down.
On the right, the input [0.0] corresponds to output 1 that goes up.
What that really means is that our structures now include the plans of what we want to build.
They therefore have all the information about what has been built.
This means we can achieve some form of self-replication.
In this case, I call it self-directed replication because the structure contains the exact blueprints.
If errors occur, you can exchange a part.
All the local information is integrated to show how to fix it.
So you could have something that climbs and reads along and delivers one to one output.
It's directly integrated; there are no outside instructions.
The last project I'm going to show is called biased chains, and it's probably the most exciting example of self-assembly systems we have right now.
It takes up the ability to reconfigure and program and creates a completely passive system.
You basically have a chain of elements.
Each element is completely identical and they are polarized.
Every chain, or element, wants to turn right or left.
So while you're putting the chain together, you're basically programming it.
Each unit is told whether it should turn right or left.
When you shake the chain, it folds together to form a configuration you programmed in — in this case a spiral or in this case two cubes next to each other.
So you can basically program any three-dimensional shape — or one-dimensional, two-dimensional — into this chain completely passively.
What does that tell us about the future?
I think it tells us that there are possibilities of self-assembly, replication, and repair in our physical structures, buildings, and machines.
There are new ways to program in these parts.
And this creates new possibilities for IT.
We'll have spatial programming.
Imagine that our buildings, bridges, machines, all of our components could perform calculations.
This would mean parallel and distributed computing power, new design possibilities.
So there is an exciting potential for this.
I think these projects I've shown here are only a tiny step towards this future when we implement these new technologies for a new self-creating world.
Thank you.

Arrests and violence during demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against Netanyahu's head of government are getting more and more intense.
Violent clashes occurred during the night.
The Israeli police violently took action against participants in a demonstration against right-wing conservative head of government Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday night in Jerusalem.
Police spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld said twelve people were arrested for participating in riots.
The police used water launchers, among other things, to resolve the rally.
According to media reports, a total of around 6000 people gathered near Netanyahu's office on Saturday evening.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu's handling of the corona crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew in horns and called Netanyahu to resign.
Participants of a counter-demonstration who supported Netanyahu were also arrested, the news site “ynet” reported.
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the head of government's private villa in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
According to police, a man was arrested near Tel Aviv because it is suspected of having sprayed pepper spray from a moving car onto roadside demonstrators.
Another man was arrested after a knife attack on a demonstrator in the south of the country.
The protester had been slightly injured on his neck.
There have been several demonstrations against Netanyahu in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv recently.
The rallies accompany the corruption process against the head of government.
Netanyahu was also recently criticized for handling the corona crisis.

North Korea closes border city after corona suspected
North Korea has so far seen its own measures to defend against the coronavirus as a “brilliant success”.
The country is now reporting on a suspicion for the first time.
Because of a first official corona suspicion in the country, North Korea completely sealed off a big city out of fear of disaster.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defenses in the past six months, “the malicious virus could have been introduced into the country,” state media reported.
The state of emergency was imposed for the region around the border city of Kaesong.
The communist leadership called the highest alert level.
If the suspected case is confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the isolated country.
North Korea had not registered a single infection so far and described its defenses as “shining success.”
The information was doubted abroad.
The symptoms of the disease were reportedly found in an “outlier” who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
The person dropped off to South Korea three years ago and has now returned across the border.
For the time being, there was no confirmation of border crossing within the four kilometre wide and largely mined military buffer zone from South Korea.
However, South Korea's military admitted the possibility of illegal border crossing to North Korea as high, according to reports by national news agency Yonhap.
There were investigations on some people.
North Korea, according to its own statements, called an urgent meeting of the Workers' Party's Politburo on Saturday, chaired by ruler Kim Jong Un on suspicion.
“The dangerous situation in Kaesong could cause a deadly and destructive disaster.”
As a preventive measure, Kim ordered “completely blocking Kaesong and isolating each district and region from others,” it said.
The data subject and all people in Kaesong who had had contact with her have been quarantined.
The party's central military commission should therefore investigate the “outlier” and the conduct of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose severe punishment.
It is estimated that around 300,000 people live in Kaesong.

Excitement before Council meeting: City East and noise protection are still up for discussion before a big summer break
“In addition to environmental issues, committee members will also vote on the development plan for the major project Downtown Development East, among other things,” it is more casually stated in the middle section of the city press release on the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, July 28, at 4.30 pm in the Grand Hall of the Congress Centre Pforzheim.
However, the appreciation of the eastern city in particular is controversial until the end.
The majorities for this are scarce, and most recently even negative in individual committees depending on their presence.
An appeal from business (construction, real estate, trade and IT) that was developed from citizenship and then by administration and municipal council to fail now after almost ten years of preparation, criticized project opponent Reinhard Klein as an “extra-parliamentary opposition,” “unsuspecting,” “speculation,””” denigration” and “deliberate false statements.”
“Everyone feels that they know better,” says Klein, who has been the only representative of the citizens list Pforzheim for a year now.
In fact, after reading the treaties, he is in this position: “I know what I'm talking about”.
The city is cheaper to exit, and contrary to statements of the city administration, the Technical Town Hall is after grants whose existence Klein is convinced to rehabilitate for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop very differently than what is predicted in the town hall and by its proponents from the economy.
Shaping the city through its own strength rather than an investor: This is his plan B. One day after small, the FDP/FW/UB/LED faction, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It also essentially envisages the renovation of the Technical City Hall, the openness of the Schlossberg, renting the ex-thale for administrative areas and a more small-scale city redesign ideally with local carriers.
Environmental issues play a central role
Environmental issues in particular will also play a central role.
The municipal council will, among other things, vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the Pforzheim population from health noise pollution caused by road traffic, including many times speed reductions.
In a press release, the local transport club Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30, however, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of the fact that this has to happen because they are only due to neglect regular bus service with thinned out bars and little commitment to cycling contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus noise, according to the VCD.
The municipal council also votes on the participation of the city of the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
The agenda also includes accession to the Baden-Württemberg Climate Protection Pact, the reassessment of parental contributions in city day care facilities and the application for inclusion in federal smart city support.

Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with a lot of delay
With almost half a year delay, Tim Zimmermann starts his premiere season at the ADAC GT Masters on July 31.
Before the league of super sports cars can start regular operations, the first test drives were now on the way.
For Zimmermann, it was primarily about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 closer.
The corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from starting his first business trip in Grasser Racing's new Lamborghini Huracan.
This was now possible under special hygiene conditions.
23-year-old Langenargener made his first laps at the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his premiere in the GT3 car.
“There are a few things that are different from the pre-season Porsche,” says Zimmermann.
“With ABS, for example, you have to take turns differently.
But it was really a lot of fun”.
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite his only 25 years, the Dutchman is already experienced in GT sports and has been able to help his new team-mate in many things.
“I'm not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series also brings new challenges,” says Zimmermann.
“Steijn and I get along with each other dazzling and we also made tremendous progress at the Lausitzring from session to session”.
The GT Masters will also be holding its first race right there - at the Lausitzring.
From July 31, the 33 super sports cars will race through Lusatia.
However, Zimmermann, who is one of 15 newcomers to series production, knows the track.
He was the last guest in the Motodrom in 2015.
“It worked fast and I had to get used to the track little,” says Zimmermann, who is starting for the Friedrichshafen racing community Graf Zeppelin.
“The Lausitzring has many quick passages that you have to hit optimally in order to be fast”.
How fast Zimmermann really is then turns out in two weeks.
“The teams play poker a little while testing, of course,” he says.
“In the end, we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring”.
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a tightly crowded calendar.
Seven races are pending until the beginning of November.
Current status is that no viewers will be admitted - but there is a prominent guest.

British Transport Minister cold caught by quarantine decision
According to press reports, the UK government's decision to quarantine Spain holidaymakers for two weeks after they returned has caught the country's transport minister cold.
Therefore, Grant Shapps is currently on vacation in Spain, of all places, while his colleagues at home decided the measure on Saturday.
Due to the rising corona numbers in Spain, the London cabinet removed the country from the list of countries from which it is possible to enter without quarantine requirements.
The new regulation will apply from today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to quarantine after he returns.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures on returnees.
But the regulation applies to those who are just on the leave deadline, only from Saturday, August 1, and was not introduced overnight.
By the way, Spain is still considered one of the “safe countries” in Austria that does not require quarantine in Austria.
“Many ministers may have known in advance that there is a possibility that a quarantine will be imposed on holidaymakers Spain,” commented Labour MP Diane Abbot.

Do you know how many types of flowering plants exist?
A quarter of a million — that's the number of known species — a quarter of a million types of flowering plants.
And blossoms are real devil guys.
Plants have a great deal of trouble producing them.
They need an enormous amount of energy and raw materials.
Why are they making this trouble?
The answer is, of course, like so many things in the world: sex.
I know what you think of when you look at these pictures.
And the answer to why sexual reproduction is so important — there are many other ways for plants to multiply.
Let's take offshoots; they can have sex with themselves, so to speak; they can pollinate themselves.
But they actually need to spread their genes to mix them with other genes so they can occupy ecological niches.
That's how evolution works.
Plants share this information about pollen.
Some of you may have seen some of these pictures before.
As I always say, everyone should have a scanning electron microscope at home to see it.
There are as many different types of pollen as there are flowering plants.
And this is very useful for forensics and so on.
Most pollen that triggers hay fever in us comes from plants that use the wind to spread their pollen. This is a very inefficient process, which is why so much of it ends up in our noses.
Because the plants eject very large amounts, hoping that the male sex cells that are in the pollen will only hit another flower by chance.
All grasses, all cereals and most trees, transport pollen through the wind.
However, most species use insects for their purposes. And that's the smarter way, as it requires less pollen.
The insects and other species can bring the pollen directly to their destination.
We are naturally aware of the relationship between insects and plants.
It's a symbiotic relationship. Whether flies, birds or bees, they also benefit from it, usually through nectar.
This symbiosis has led to some wonderful adjustments - the hummingbird warmer is a beautiful fit.
The plant benefits from the hummingbird spreading pollen.
Plants have developed small runways for bees that would otherwise not find their way.
On many plants there are marks that resemble other insects.
These are the dust bags of a lily, a very clever construction. When an unsuspecting insect lands on it, the bags fold up and hit the insect's back, where the pollen gets stuck and taken to other plants.
It's an orchid that looks like it has a mouth. The insects are forced to crawl out and become covered by pollen.
There are at least 20,000 orchid species - an impressive variety.
And they have all sorts of tricks in stock.
They need to attract pollinators to help them.
This orchid, known by Charles Darwin's research, who made a great thesis when she looked at it. You see a very long nectar tube coming down from the orchid.
And what insects need to do there in the middle of the flower - they have to put their little proboscis in there and down the whole nectar tube to get to the nectar.
And when Darwin saw this flower, he said, “Something must have evolved in parallel with it.”
And indeed, here's this insect.
Usually it rolls up the proboscis, but in its stretched shape it looks like this.
You can imagine that if nectar is so valuable and elaborate for the plant to produce and attracts many pollinators, then it's like human sex, people start to deceive.
They say, “I have nectar, do you want to come and get it for you?”
This is a plant.
This is a plant that insects just love in South Africa. And they've developed a long proboscis to get the nectar.
And that's a copycat
a plant that copies the original.
And here's the long trunk fly that didn't get nectar from the imitator. Because the imitator, unlike the fly expects, does not have nectar at all.
But not only did the fly not get nectar, it also has - if you look very closely, at the head of the proboscis, you'll see pollen that would have transferred it to more plants, if just a botanist hadn't passed by and glued it to blue paper.
(Laughter) Deception runs through the whole plant kingdom.
These black dots on him flower, they look like black dots to us, but for male insects of certain species they look like two females that are very hot.
(Laughter) And when the insect lands there, it picks up pollen, which it brings to more plants. If you look at the “everyone household should have one” electron microscope image, you can see that there are certain three-dimensional patterns.
It not only looks good to the insect, but also feels good.
And these electron microscope images - here one of an orchid imitating an insect - show that different parts of the shape have different colors and seemingly different surfaces, and for the perception of an insect, the textures are very, very different.
This plant has developed the imitation of a shiny metallic surface, as seen on some beetles.
And under the electron microscope, you can see that this surface is completely different from the one we've looked at so far.
Sometimes the whole plant mimics an insect, even in our perception.
I think it looks like a flying animal.
It's a wonderful thing.
This one is clever. It's called obsidium.
I think of them as insidious sometimes.
For certain bees, it looks like another, particularly aggressive bee, so she flies back and pits her head several times to drive it away and naturally picks up a lot of pollen in the process.
At the same time, this plant mimics another orchid, which provides a rich supply of food for insects.
But this one doesn't have anything for them.
So she's cheating on two levels - fabulous.
(Laughter) Here we see the cananga tree, an ingredient of many perfumes.
I smelled one on someone earlier.
The flowers really don't have to be so colorful.
They send a fantastic range of scents to all insects.
This one doesn't smell so good.
It's a flower that smells really awful and it's evolved to imitate carrion.
That's why flies love them.
They fly in and pollinate them.
This is a helicodiceros, also known as a “dead horse.”
I don't know what a dead horse smells like, but the plant probably hits it quite well.
It's really awful.
And throwing flies can't restrain themselves.
They fly in all the way back
and lay their eggs there they think it's carrion without realizing that there is no food for the eggs that are dying, but the plant benefits from it as the fly continues to fly full of pollen and pollinates the next flower - fantastic.
This is Arum Maculatum, the spotted arum stick.
I photographed him in Dorset last week.
It heats up to about 15° above ambient temperature - fascinating.
And when you look into the plant, there's a kind of barrier behind the inflorescences. Flies are attracted to the heat that creates volatile chemicals and are then trapped at the bottom of the container.
They drink the wonderful nectar and then they're sticky.
They get a pollen shower at night and then the bristles we've seen above drooping out, cleaving the way for mosquitoes that are full of pollen - great thing.
If you think that's great, now comes one of my favorites.
That's the philodendron sellum.
If anyone from Brazil is here, you'll know the plant.
It's really fascinating.
This type of phallus there is about 30cm long.
And he does something that no other plant I know does when it blooms. There in the middle are the inflorescences - for about 2 days it has a metabolism very similar to that of mammals.
Instead of feeding on starch, which is the food of plants, it takes something similar to brown adipose tissue and burns it so quickly that the fat burn rate, metabolism, is equivalent to that of a small cat.
This is twice the energy production of a hummingbird, relative to weight - insanely impressive.
But he's doing something else that's unusual.
It not only heats up to 43 to 44 °C for about 2 days, but also maintains a constant temperature.
It can regulate its temperature and thus keep it constant.
They ask themselves, “Why is he doing this?”
As you can guess, there are some bugs that love to mate at this temperature.
And they fly in and go.
(Laughter) And the plant showers them with pollen, and they fly on and pollinate.
What a wonderful thing.
The typical pollinator for us is an insect. But in the tropics, many birds and butterflies also pollinate.
And many tropical flowers are red and we think that's because birds and butterflies look similar to us and therefore see the color red very well.
If you look at the spectrum of birds and humans, we see red, green, and blue this spectrum here.
Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet, and different levels of ultraviolet.
So something that goes on beyond our spectrum.
And I hear you ask, “Wouldn't it be great if we can see that too?”
Of course we can.
So what does an insect see?
Last week I photographed this sunrose in Dorset.
As you can see, these are small yellow flowers, small yellow flowers everywhere.
And that's what they look like in visible light.
That's what it looks like when you take the red out.
Most bees don't see red.
And then I used ultraviolet filters to shoot and expose the special ultraviolet frequencies for a very, very long time and that came out.
And that's a fantastic target.
We don't know exactly what bees see, just like you don't know what I'm seeing when I say “this is red.”
We can't look into the thoughts of insects or other people.
But the contrast will be something like this. It stands out against the background.
Here's another small flower - different range of ultraviolet frequencies, other filters similar to pollinators.
And that's what they'd see.
If you think now all yellow flowers have this property - no flower was damaged for this image; it was only attached to the tripod, not killed - but it looks like this under ultraviolet light.
And that could serve as the basis of a sunscreen because sunscreens absorb UV light.
The substances in the plant could be helpful in this.
Finally, we have an evening primrose that Bjorn Rorslett sent me from Norway - fantastic hidden patterns.
I love the idea of hidden things.
I think there's something poetic in it. This is that these images were taken with UV filters, filters that are mainly used by astronomers to photograph Venus - more precisely their fog.
That's the primary purpose of these filters.
Venus is the goddess of love and fertility, and that is the story of blossoms.
And flowers not only make great efforts to attract pollinators, they also manage to plant large fields full of them and give them to each other at births and deaths, and especially at weddings, which, when you think about it, is the moment when the exchange of genetic material from a organism is set to another.
Thank you so much.

Hurricane “Hanna” reaches Texas: help made difficult due to corona
Washington - The first hurricane of this year's season over the Atlantic has hit land in Texas.
Life-threatening floods, strong winds and heavy rainfall now threatened parts of the US state, as the National Hurricane Center told US climate agency NOAA on night through Sunday (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of emergency for many districts.
The rampant corona pandemic in Texas is making the work of the helpers more difficult, said Abbott, according to US media.
evacuates called for caution
“Every hurricane is a huge challenge,” said Abbott according to the newspaper “Houston Chronicle”.
Looking at the Texas hurricane, he added: “This challenge is complicated and gets worse considering it sweeping through an area that is the state's most affected area by Covid-19.”
According to Johns Hopkins University, around 5000 people have so far died in Texas alone as a result of the corona pandemic.
Abbott called on people who had to leave their homes to be careful.

Storm warning withdrawn

The tropical storm had previously been upgraded to the lowest level one hurricane.
For the stretch of coast from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm flood warning was first issued and later withdrawn.
Authorities expected a slowdown, while “Hanna” moved further inland and headed for northeastern Mexico.
“Douglas” is moving towards Hawaii
In the Pacific, hurricane “Douglas” headed towards Hawaii at wind speeds of around 150 kilometers per hour during the night on Sunday.
However, the hurricane center expected it to weaken further.
It is forecast to be near Hawaii's largest islands on Sunday (local time) - then just below the hurricane threshold as a storm.
According to a forecast from May, NOAA expected an above-average hurricane season over the Atlantic this year.
From June to the end of November, up to ten hurricanes can be expected, of which up to six very strong hurricanes could become very strong, the authority said.
On average, there are six hurricanes per year over the Atlantic Ocean, three of which develop into storms of great strength.
Given available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and Caribbean, the probability of a normal season was only 30 percent, and that of a below-average even only ten percent, was said at that time.
US President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that his government was closely watching the storms and was in contact with the affected states.

FC Bayern Munich: Pavard hurt
Munich (dpa) - The start of the hot preparation phase for the Champions League began with a setback for double winner FC Bayern.
After his first team training, Hansi Flick, who recovered “reasonably well” after a short vacation and a few days of training, has to consider how he can rebuild his successful defenses after the injury of world champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who has the third most operating minutes behind Captain Manuel Neuer and midfield chief Joshua Kimmich, suffered a ligament injury on the left foot root and threatens to be missing in decisive premier class duels.
In Munich's dirty weather, the right-back broke off a training game and was driven off the course with a golf kart.
How long the unrestricted regular player has to pause in the battle for the title is open.
A bet in the round of 16 against FC Chelsea on August 8 may be difficult, and the 24-year-old can hope for the final tournament in Lisbon, which will begin August 12 in Lisbon.
The Bavarians do not want to be stopped by the mishap from Sunday's training.
In his personal triple-formula, Flick cited the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on the way to Portugal's capital.
His victorious title collectors are expected to show quality, intensity and concentration in the ideally following 28 days until the premier class final game on August 23.
“We simply mastered the compulsory tasks with championship and trophy excellently.
Now it's time to create something special,” said Flick.
However, until Munich people can deal with the final tournament and a training camp in the Algarve in concrete terms, however, the sixth final obligation against FC Chelsea is due for the first time.
After 3-0 in the first leg before the corona break, Londoners in the home arena should not again become Bavaria's nightmare like in the lost “final dahoam” in 2012.
“We need to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and build trust with a good game,” said Flick.
A test for tuning up is due on Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn his stars, who had 13 days vacation after the double, to a one-off August.
He welcomed 31 players at Säbener Straße, including the new players in noble purchasing Leroy Sané, who first met all new colleagues on the court after moving from Manchester City.
“Leroy did a good job like all new ones,” Flick said.
But instead of talking about the new season, when Sané & Co. is no longer just allowed to train, Flick much preferred to talk about the German series champion's current title project.
After days of individual and small group training, team strength is now being trained for Londoners who are in the rhythm of play in contrast to the Flick ensemble.
After that, Munich people could face a quarter-final against FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, while Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are potential opponents in the semifinals.
Getting to the finals in Lisbon “is not so easy,” emphasized the head coach, who can rely on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training from Tuesday on.
World Cup record goalscorer Klose and Flick know about many joint tournament preparation, which is particularly important in the 0-to-100 tuning.
Working with his current team is “a pleasure,” Flick praised.
The “focus on winning” is an impressive feature of his team.

Greta Thunberg: Bad eye against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg talked about her encounter with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest of Stephen Colbert's well-known latenight show via video switch and revealed in an interview what she had in mind when she met Donald Trump.
Climate-kivist Greta Thunberg was a guest in a popular US latenight show via video switch.
She talked about her fight against the world's powerful, among other things.
The teenager also spoke about her famous “evil eye” when she encountered Donald Trump.
New York City - Over the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has attracted attention with her tireless commitment to the “Fridays For Future” movement.
She now talked about her plans in the future in a well-known latenight show and her encounter with US President Donald Trump at the UN climate summit last year.
Latenight presenter Stephen Colbert welcomed 17-year-old Thunberg to your show on Tuesday and conducted a longer interview with the Swedish woman.
She not only talked about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the world's powerful.
“There are a few things that surprised me,” she said.
“How far people go to steer the focus away from the climate crisis,” she shook.
“Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats just because a group of children is taking to the streets,” she experienced.
Heads of state and leaders who ridicule or even try to silence them on social media find her “funny” because they show her the reactions “because they have no other answer to that.”
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was addressed to a well-known scene in which she threw US President Trump a bitter evil eye behind.
At the 2019 UN climate summit in New York, for which the activist sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive view was captured by cameras and has since been seen by countless people online.
The short clip resulted in a GIF, an animated image that ultimately became one of the most used images for Trump opponents.
But what was the 17-year-old thinking about the US president right now?
