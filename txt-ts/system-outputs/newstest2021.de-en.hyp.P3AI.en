We should not know.
You could have known.
Please make everyone aware for a moment of a very simple fact: Pretty much everything we know about the universe we know through light.
We can stand on Earth and look into the night sky and contemplate stars with our naked eyes.
The sun burns our peripheral vision.
We see light reflected from the moon.
And in the time that has passed since Galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope at the heavenly bodies, the universe known to us has traveled to us as visible light, passing through immeasurable ages of cosmic history.
With the help of all our modern telescopes, we have been able to study all of this: This impressive silent film of the universe, this series of snapshots dating back to the Big Bang.
But the universe is not a silent movie, because the universe is not silent.
I would like to convince you that the universe has a soundtrack and that this soundtrack is played in space itself: Because space can vibrate like a drum.
It can sound a kind of sound recording that can be heard throughout the universe; of some of the most dramatic events when they occurred.
Now we would like to add a sonic component to the wonderful visual arrangement we have of the universe.
And even if we have never heard the sounds of the universe before, over the next few years we should slowly turn up the volume knob for what's happening out there.
Out of this ambition to capture songs of the universe, we focus our attention on black holes and their inherent promise. Black holes hammer against space-time like wooden mallets on a drum.
One day we might see a shadow cast by a black hole against a bright background, but until now we haven't succeeded.
And yet you can hear black holes, even if they are invisible, because they play on space-time like a drum.
We owe the idea that the universe sounds like a drum to Albert Einstein, to whom we owe so much.
Einstein realized that if space were empty, if the universe were empty, it would have to look like this picture, just without this helpful grid.
But if we were to move through space in free fall, even without this helpful grid, we might be able to paint it ourselves, because we would realize that we are moving along straight lines, along undistorted, straight paths through the universe.
Einstein also realized (and that's what it's all about) that when you bring energy or mass into the universe, it bends the universe; if a free-fall body, say, passed the Sun, it would be distorted along the natural curvature lines in space.
This is Einstein's great theory of general relativity.
Even light is diffracted along these paths.
And a body can be bent so strongly that it enters into an orbit around the Sun, like the Earth, or like the Moon in Earth's orbit.
These are natural curvatures in space.
What Einstein did not know was that if you took the sun and squeezed it into a ball six kilometers in diameter, if you took something millions of times the mass of the earth and squeezed it into six kilometers, you would create a black hole; a body of such density that light coming too close to it could never escape; it would be a black shadow in front of the universe.
But Einstein considered black holes to be a mathematical curiosity throughout his life.
He didn't believe they really existed.
He was convinced that nature would protect us from its emergence.
It would take decades for the term predictable black hole to be coined and for people to understand that black holes are astrophysical bodies; in fact, they are the lifeless state of extremely dense stars that collapse in a horrific catastrophe at the end of their lives.
Our Sun, however, will not end up as a black hole.
It's just not big enough for that.
But we did a little thought experiment, as Einstein liked to do, imagine compressing the Sun to six kilometers in diameter and putting a tiny Earth into orbit, say, 30 kilometers away from this black Sun.
This earth would shine by itself, (because since the sun would then have disappeared, there would be no other light source) so we let our little earth shine by itself.
We could put the Earth into a carefree orbit about 30 km away from the crushed black hole.
This crushed black hole would be about the size of Manhattan.
It would pour into the Hudson a little before destroying the Earth.
But we're talking about that.
We're talking about something that you can squeeze together until it's half the size of Manhattan.
Now we bring the Earth very close, up to about 30 km, and see how it moves in a completely flawless orbit around the black hole.
There is a kind of myth that black holes devour everything in the universe, but in fact you have to get very close to them to fall into them.
But what is particularly impressive from our point of view is the fact that we can always see the Earth.
It cannot hide behind the black hole.
The light that comes from the earth, some of it falls in, but some is scattered and returns to us.
So you can't hide anything behind a black hole.
If this is the Battlestar Galactica and you are fighting against the Cylons, then you better not hide behind the Black Hole.
They can see them.
So our Sun will not collapse into a black hole, its mass is not enough, but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
If one of them extinguished the Milky Way, it would look like this.
We would see a shadow of the black hole against the backdrop of billions of stars in the Milky Way galaxy and their glowing dust orbits.
If we were to fall upon this black hole, we would see all the light that would be bent around it, and we could even step into the shadows without realizing that something unusual is happening.
It would be bad if we tried to ignite our engines and escape, because we couldn't, just as little as the light can escape.
But even if the black hole is dark from the outside, it is not dark inside, because all the light of the galaxy could fall behind us.
And although, due to a phenomenon of relativity (so-called time dilation), our clocks seemed to go slower relative to galactic time, it would seem that the evolution of the galaxy had accelerated and shot towards us just before we were crushed to death by the black hole.
It would be like a near-death experience to see the light at the end of the tunnel, but it would be a comprehensive death experience.
(Laughter) And you couldn't tell anyone about the light at the end of the tunnel.
Now we have never seen such a shadow of a black hole, but black holes can be heard, even though they are invisible.
Imagine an astrophysically realistic situation: Imagine two black holes that have lived a long life together.
Perhaps it was once stars that collapsed into two black holes, each with a mass ten times that of the Sun.
We are now squeezing them together to a diameter of 60 km.
They can rotate several hundred times per second.
At the end of their lives, they orbit each other almost at the speed of light.
They can travel thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second, and while doing so, they not only bend space, but they leave in their wake a sound of space, a real wave of space-time.
Space contracts and expands as it pours out of these black holes and hammers into the universe.
And they travel out into the cosmos at the speed of light.
We owe this computer simulation to a relativity working group of NASA Goddard.
It took almost 30 years for someone to solve this problem.
This was one of those groups.
Here we see two black holes orbiting each other, again with the helpful painted lines.
Maybe you can see it is a bit indistinct but when you see the red waves that emerge, these are gravitational waves.
They actually represent the sound of sounding space and will exit these black holes at the speed of light as they become quieter and quieter and eventually merge into a spinning, silent black hole.
If you were close enough, the sound of contracting and expanding space would resound in your ears.
You would literally hear the sound.
Of course, your head would also be pressed and stretched, which would be quite unpleasant, which is why you would have difficulty understanding what is happening.
But I would like to tell you what sounds we are predicting here.
This is a slightly less glamorous computer model from my working group.
Imagine a lighter black hole falling into a very heavy black hole.
What you hear is the sound with which the light black hole hammers into space, every time it passes close by.
When it moves away again, it's a little too quiet.
But it strikes like a mallet and literally smashes the universe, makes it swing like a drum.
We can predict what that will sound like.
We know that when it falls, it becomes faster and louder.
And finally, we hear the little guy falling into the big guy.
I've never heard this so loudly and it's really much more dramatic.
At home, it sounds a bit disappointing.
More like ding, ding, ding.
This is another sound from my group.
No, I don't show you any pictures, because black holes don't leave any helpful ink marks.
But if you were floating around in space during a space vacation and you would hear this here, then you should make sure you get away.
(Laughter) You really should get away from that noise.
Both black holes are moving.
Both black holes come closer to each other.
In this case, they vibrate very strongly at first.
And then they merge.
This chirping is typical for the merging of two black holes, so that it chirps at the end.
This is our conception of what we would see.
Luckily we are here in Long Beach, California at a safe distance.
But it is highly likely that two black holes have just merged somewhere in the universe.
And it is just as certain that space swings around us after it has probably taken millions of light years, or a million years to travel to us at the speed of light.
But the sound is much too quiet than we could ever hear.
On Earth, experiments are carried out with great zeal, one of which is called LIGO, which aims to detect deviations in the way space contracts and expands again, deviations in the order of magnitude smaller than an atomic nucleus over a distance of four kilometers.
It is an incredibly ambitious project and its sensitivity will be further developed in the coming years in order to be able to perceive this here.
There will also be a mission for space, which I hope will be launched within the next ten years, called LISA.
Lisa will be able to see huge black holes, black holes with millions or billions of times the density of the Sun.
On this image of the Hubble Telescope we see two galaxies.
They look like they're frozen in a hug.
Each probably contains a huge black hole in its interior.
But they have not solidified. They merge together.
These two black holes collide and become one over billions of years.
Our human perception is not able to grasp a song of such duration.
But LISA could see the final stages of two giant black holes, at an earlier stage in the history of the universe, the last 15 minutes before they merge.
And it's not just about black holes, it's also about all the big perturbations in the universe and the biggest of them all is the Big Bang.
When the term was coined, it was contemptuously meant to mean a big bang. Who believes in a big bang?
This animation of friends of mine at Proton Studios shows an outside view of the Big Bang.
We never really want to try; we never want to be inside the universe, because you can never be outside the universe.
So imagine you're in the Big Bang.
It is everywhere, all around you and space is swirling and vibrating completely uncontrollably.
14 billion years go by, but this song still rings around us.
Galaxies form and generations of stars are born in these galaxies, and around one of these stars, at least one, a habitable planet orbits.
And here we sit and work like crazy on these experiments, doing calculations and writing computer code.
Imagine two black holes colliding a billion years ago.
Their song has been sounding through space ever since, all the time.
We didn't even exist at that time.
It is getting closer and closer and closer 40,000 years ago we still painted cave paintings.
If it's the Big Bang we're recording, it would sound like that.
It is literally the epitome of noise.
It's white noise, it's such a chaotic noise.
But it is all around us, probably at least if it has not been extinguished by some other process in the universe.
When we record it, it will sound like music to our ears, because it will be a quiet echo, a reverberation of the moment of our creation, of our visible universe.
Within the next two years, we will be able to make the soundtrack a little louder and present the universe as a sound image.
But if we can grasp those earliest moments, it will bring us much closer to an understanding of the Big Bang, which in turn brings us closer to some of the most complex, elusive questions.
If we played a movie of the universe backwards, we would know that there was a big bang in the past and we could even perceive the cacophony of its sound.But was our big bang the only big bang?
I think we have to ask the question: Has something like this ever happened?
Will it be repeated?
I think, in the sense of the challenge that TED poses to reignite wonder, we can ask questions, at least at this last minute, that might otherwise elude us forever.
But we must ask ourselves: Is it possible that our universe is just an offshoot of a larger story?
Or is it possible that we are just an offshoot of a multiverse and each offshoot has its own Big Bang in its past, perhaps some of them have drum-playing black holes, others may not be aware in some there may be intelligent life, others may not be aware not in our past, not in our future, but in some way fundamentally connected with us?
So we have to ask ourselves: If there is a multiverse, do beings exist in another fragment of that multiverse?
These are my creatures of the Multiverse.
Are there other beings in this multiverse who are concerned about us and about their own origins?
And if they exist, I can imagine that they are like us, that they compute and write computer codes, build instruments, try to make out the remotest sound of their origin and wonder who is still out there.
Thank you. Thank you.

Mamming: Mass Corona Infection: 174 Harvesters Infected
After a mass corona infection on a large vegetable farm in Mamming, Lower Bavaria, almost 500 people are under quarantine and are no longer allowed to leave the company.
A security service supervises the curfew.
A total of 174 harvesters were tested positive for the corona pathogen SARS-CoV-2 during the screening, as the district office of Dingolfing-Landau announced on Saturday evening.
"Unfortunately, in order to prevent further spread, we have to take this step to protect the population," explained District Administrator Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees had already been infected in the company - this was the reason for the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm that grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and beetroot - the cucumbers, however, only for jars.
Mamming is a rural community with a good 3300 inhabitants not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to keep calm: "According to our information, it is a closed circle of people".
On the farm, infected workers were separated from uninfected workers, the site is now surrounded by a fence.

Many people believe that driving is an activity reserved only for people who can see.
A blind person driving a car safely and independently has so far been considered an impossible task.
Hello, my name is Dennis Hong, and we want to give blind people freedom and independence by building a vehicle for the blind.
Therefore, before I talk about this car for the blind, let me briefly talk about another project that I worked on and was called the Darba Urban Challenge.
This was about building a robotized car that can drive itself.
You press Start, nobody touches anything, and it can reach its destination completely automatically.
In 2007, our team won half a million dollars by finishing third in the competition.
Around this time, the National Association of the Blind, or NFB, challenged the Investigation Committee to make a car that could be driven safely and independently by a blind person.
We decided to try, because we thought, hey, how difficult that can be.
We already have an automatic vehicle.
We're putting a blind person in and it's done, isn't it?
(Laughter) We couldn't have been wrong.
What the National Federation of the Blind (NFB) wanted was not a vehicle that drives blind people around, but a vehicle where a blind person can make active decisions and drive.
So we had to throw everything away and start all over again.
Therefore, to test this insane idea, we developed a small buggy prototype vehicle to test its feasibility.
And in the summer of 2009, we invited dozens of young blind people from all over the country and gave them the opportunity to take a spin.
It was an absolutely great experience.
But the problem with this car was that it was designed so that it could only be driven in a controlled environment, a level, traffic-free parking lot, and that even the lanes were highlighted with red cones.
Therefore, with this success, we decided to take the next big step to develop a true car that can be driven on real roads.
So how does it work? | GotQuestions.org
Well, it's a pretty complicated system, but let me try to explain it, and maybe I can simplify it.
Well, we have three steps.
We have perception, calculation and non-visual interfaces.
Well, it is clear that the driver cannot see, so the system must be able to perceive the environment and collect information for the driver.
For this, we use an initial measurement unit.
It measures the acceleration, the angular acceleration, like a human ear, an inner ear.
We merge the information with a GPS unit to get approximately the position of the car.
We also use two cameras to observe the lanes of the road.
And we also use three laser distance measurements.
The lasers scan the environment to detect obstacles, a car approaching us from the front or from the back, and also any obstacles that get onto the road, any obstacles around the vehicle.
After that, all this enormous amount of information is passed on to the computer, and the computer can do two things.
First, first of all, process the information to understand what the environment is like; these are lanes on the road, the obstacles, and convey this information to the driver.
The system is also smart enough to calculate the safest way to operate the car.
We can also generate instructions on how to control the vehicle.
But, the problem is this: How can we convey this information and these instructions to a person who cannot see quickly enough and fairly accurately so that they can drive?
For this, we have developed different types of non-visual user interface technology.
We started with a three-dimensional ping sound system, a vibration vest, a click wheel with voice commands, a foot strip, and even a shoe that puts pressure on the leg.
But today, we are going to talk about three of these non-visual user interface technologies.
Well, the first interface technology is called DriveGrip.
This is a pair of gloves, and it has its vibrating elements on the ankle side, so they can give instructions on how to control, direction and intensity.
Another device is called SpeedStrip.
These are a chair, strictly speaking, it is a massage chair.
We hollow it out, and we reorganize the vibrating elements into different patterns, and we press them to convey information about the speed, and also to convey instructions about how to use the accelerator and brake pedal.
So, here you can see how the computer sees the environment, and since you can't see the vibration, we even equip the driver with red LEDs so he can really see what's going on.
This is the sensory data, and this data is forwarded to the devices via computer.
Therefore, these two devices, DriveGrip and SpeedGrip, are very effective.
But the problem is that there are stitch instructions devices.
Therefore, this is not a real freedom, is it?
The computer tells you how to drive, turn left, turn right, accelerate, stop.
We call it rear seat driver problem.
Therefore, let's move away from the Stitch Instructions devices, and now focus more on the information devices.
A good example of this non-visual information interface technology is AirPix.
Consider it a monitor for the blind.
Well, it is a small tablet, it has many holes and it releases compressed air, therefore it can even draw pictures.
Therefore, even if they are blind, they can put their hand on it, see the lanes and obstacles on the road.
In fact, they can also change the air frequency that escapes, and possibly the temperature.
Therefore, it is in fact a multidimensional user interface.
Well, here you can look at the left camera, the right camera seen from the vehicle, and see how the computer interprets this and sends the information to the AirPix.
For this, we show a simulator, a blind person driving and using the AirPix.
This simulator was also very useful to train the blind drivers and also fast in testing different kinds of ideas for different types of non-visual user interfaces.
Therefore, this is how it mainly works.
But this vehicle is a prototype, and it will not enter the road until it is proven to be safe, or safer than today's vehicles.
And I really believe that this can happen.
But still, will society, would they accept such a radical idea?
How will we regulate the insurance?
How will we issue driving licences?
Apart from the technological challenges, there are many types of hurdles that we have to overcome before it becomes a reality.
Of course, the main objective of this project is to produce a car for a blind person.
But potentially more important than this is the huge benefit of the spin-off technology that can be derived from this project.
The sensors that are needed can see in the dark during fog and rain.
And along with these new types of interfaces, we can use this technology and apply it in safer cars for normal-sighted people.
Or for blind people, in everyday appliances in the home, in training and in the office.
Imagine a teacher writing on the blackboard in a classroom, and a blind student can see and read what he has written using these non-visual interface technologies.
This is priceless.
Therefore, the things I have shown you today are just the beginning.
Thank you very much.

Discussing the abolition of the 50 + 1 rule
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended that consideration be given to abolishing the 50 + 1 rule.
"German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates a fait accompli," Grindel told Bild am Sonntag.
He stressed: "For the clubs that are most likely to become dangerous in Bavaria and Dortmund, the 50 + 1 rules do not work anyway: See Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, there is no getting around the debate as to whether it is not advisable to facilitate the involvement of investors in associations that want to break into this phalanx ".
However, he has doubts whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority participation, which is prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50 + 1 rule.
"It remains a legal risk to build investment fences around the Bundesliga as a business location in a single European market," said Grindel.
The former DFB boss sees the danger that "the attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will ultimately only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but will not lead to more tension in the championship."

Looking back at the past, Grindel feels betrayed.

"That has already occupied me a lot in human terms."
He had received the gift worth around 11,000 euros from a Ukrainian official.
"I committed a compliance violation, and it was right to draw the consequences," Grindel said.
"I handled the ominous watch gift completely transparently and without suspicion.
Many people in the DFB knew about it. "
He had never "made a secret of the present," the 58-year-old assured.
"This may be called naive, but this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."

Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes defy Corona
Although the big party was missing in the spa town, visitors and performers enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: The Rakoczy weekend without Rakoczy festival.
But: Even if the big party mile in the city center was missing, the crowds and program highlights such as Saale burn, Rakoczy ball or pageant, many came at the Corona compliant alternative program at their expense.
"I think we have succeeded in spreading Rakoczy flair," says spa director Sylvie Thormann.

"I also find it quite pleasant," says Konhaeuser.
She does not miss the crowds that otherwise belong to Rakoczy.

Argentina rejects counteroffer from creditors

Arrived professionally - not yet privately
"Things are going very well" - this is the conclusion of Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first days in the notary's office in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very quickly: In mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she would succeed Lutz Feller at the Eggenfeld notary's office.
Just six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the doctor of law started work, and normal day-to-day business has long been running at full speed.
"Privately, however, I still have to arrive," she explains in conversation with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
Of course, the short lead time was not enough to completely relocate the center of life from Regensburg to Eggenfelden, reports the native of Dingolfing.
She is currently looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city with her husband, who works as a judge at the Regional Court in Regensburg.
At least her husband could still apply for parental leave at short notice in order to be able to guarantee the care of the two daughters (3 extended and 1 extended years old).
In order not to have to commute every day from Regensburg, she also has an overnight stay with her parents in Dingolfing for the time being, explains the 39-year-old.
Having grown up in the neighbouring district, she has of course long been familiar with the city of Eggenfelden.
During visits with her family over the past few months, she once again stated: "Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town".
She was all the more pleased that she had won the selection process for the vacancy.
Her homeland of Lower Bavaria also plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career: After studying law in Passau, she completed her legal clerkship and the 2nd state examination in Regensburg.
After several positions as a notary assessor, including in Rehau and Hof in Upper Franconia, Babenhausen in Lower Allgaeu and Regensburg - during this time she also "incidentally" shouldered the doctorate in employment law - she took up her first position as a notary in Rotthalmuenster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016 she went on parental leave and finally moved to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken over representation services in various notarial offices.
When the position in Eggenfelden was advertised due to the approaching retirement of Lutz Feller, she saw the right time for the full return to work, explains the 39-year-old.
The team of her predecessor, who will take over the holiday representation in the notarial office in the future, has taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer completely - and immediately has a praise for the team of the law firm ready: "It is going super well!"
The fact that she can rely on well-rehearsed processes here makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of the private center of life.
In terms of kindergarten and nursery places, she has already contacted a local institution.
And if everything works out as desired, she hopes to be able to pursue her hobby here soon - and to get to know the most beautiful jogging routes in the Rottal.

BVB plans to start the league with maximum 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be filled to 20 percent at the start of the season in the event of a fan return.
"Due to the distance regulation, which must be complied with, we are currently planning with 12,000 to 15,000 spectators," Borussia Dortmund's Managing Director Carsten Cramer told the Tagesspiegel.
Normally, the arena in the district city holds a little more than 81,000 spectators at Bundesliga matches.
In the ghost games caused by the corona pandemic last season, BVB lost about four million euros per game.
Cramer, who is responsible for marketing, digitalization and internationalization at BVB, hopes that in addition to the normal spectator seats, some of the approximately 4000 seats in the hospitality sector can be opened again: "It is of course a blow to the office if these revenues completely break down".
In view of the ongoing corona crisis, everyone is currently "well advised to take a stable sideline".
"If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people in Germany alone are in short-time work, then the need for entertainment is limited," Cramer explained.
The Dortmund marketing manager praised the BVB professionals for their partial salary waiver, which should help to overcome the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their salary waiver has a different effect than if we put 100 people who work in merchandising on short-time work".

Kalbitz expulsion from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "fig leaf"
The expulsion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is in the view of the FDP only a "fig leaf" and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the far right in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD, "said FDP interior politician Benjamin Strasser to the dpa news agency in Berlin.
The Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD had confirmed on Saturday in Stuttgart after several hours of hearing the expulsion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Executive Board had decided by a majority in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD parliamentary group in the Brandenburg state parliament.
"If the AfD really wanted to consistently remove right-wing extremists from their party, functionaries like Bjorn Hoecke and his supporters would have been excluded long ago," Strasser said.
"However, there is no political will to do so in the AfD, because right-wing extremism is now part of the party."
CSU General Secretary Markus Blume expressed a similar opinion: "The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded says nothing and does not change anything," he told "Welt am Sonntag".
"Rather, it speaks volumes how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist in the middle of the AfD still has."
Blume assumes that the AfD will again land below five percent in elections in the future.
"The days of the AfD in the parliaments are numbered".
Kalbitz was one of the spokesmen of the now officially dissolved "wing" around the Thuringian AfD state and parliamentary group chairman Bjorn Hoehe; the Office for the Protection of the Constitution classifies the coronation as a "secured right-wing extremist effort".
In May, the AfD federal executive had kicked Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason, he stated that Kalbitz had not stated an earlier membership in the now banned right-wing extremist "Heimattreue Deutsche Jugend" (HDJ) and the Republicans when he joined the party.
Kalbitz denies membership in the HDJ.
Sebastian Walter, chairman of the Left faction in the Brandenburg state parliament, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court did not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf has only eaten chalk.
The AfD remains a far-right party, with or without Kalbitz. "
Neither the federal party nor the right wing would be weakened by this decision.
"The manoeuvre of the mutineers is transparent.
They want to avoid further observation by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution and try to get under the radar, "said Walter.
"The AfD can't get rid of the ghosts it called.
An expulsion does not change anything, "commented Brandenburg SPD General Secretary Erik Stohn on the decision in the Kalbitz case.
"Here, the AfD regional association and the parliamentary group remained their right-wing leader to this day".
The legal dispute over Kalbitz's membership in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he would now take civil action against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court.

North Sea wind farms deliver a good 21 percent more electricity.
The wind power plants on the German North Sea fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid in the first six months of the year.
This is a good 21 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, said network operator Tennet in Bayreuth.
TenneT is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea electricity to the mainland and the transmission through the German electricity grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of Tennet's grid area, have fed in a further 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, wind power from the North Sea and the Baltic Sea will therefore reach 13.73 TWh, compared with a good 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind power in Germany; this is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms ensure higher generation capacities
In addition to wind conditions, the increased contribution of offshore wind energy results from higher generation capacities because new wind farms have been connected to the grid in the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea were all running at full power at the same time, they would be able to generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatts.
It is planned to increase to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea by 2030.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore grid connections by then," said TenneT Managing Director Tim Meyerjuergens.
In reality, even at sea, wind farms cannot exhaust their capacity, but reach about 40 percent.
The record day so far this year is 2 January, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could supply almost seven million households with electricity.

Freital: Windbergfest cancelled due to Corona
The Windbergfest does not take place this year.
The city of Freital has cancelled the three-day festival planned for September.
In other years, more than 30,000 people had attended this city festival.
"We really did not make this decision easy for ourselves and - aware of how difficult it is economically for those involved - hoped until the last minute," explained Lord Mayor Uwe Rumberg (non-partisan).

More air traffic controllers in Worms in future
The University of Applied Sciences in Worms is taking to the skies: DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung is endowing a professorship for Air Traffic Management.
A corresponding contract between the university and DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and will start in 2021.
With the professorship, it is possible to start studying not only in the summer, but also in the winter semester.
This means that twice as many students can be trained as before.
At the same time, capacity utilisation at both the university and the DFS Air Traffic Control Academy will be uniform.
DFS will advise the university on setting up and filling the professorship.
Represented at the university since 2019
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students as part of their training as air traffic controllers at the University of Applied Sciences Worms have been in the Air Traffic Management degree program.

"For DFS, the endowed professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, interdisciplinary knowledge base in the long term.
We are therefore continuing our good cooperation with the university and at the same time underpinning our attractiveness as an employer. "
This is also underlined by Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of Worms University of Applied Sciences: "The endowed professorship forms an important bridge between science and industry.
With it, we would like to build on our existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual bachelor's degree programme in Air Traffic Management. "
For the University of Applied Sciences Worms, the trust placed in it by the German air navigation service provider is both a motivation and an obligation to further expand its teaching and research expertise in the future fields of air traffic.
In its commitment to the air traffic controllers of tomorrow, the university can set very special highlights and innovative priorities for its students with the first endowed professorship for a dual course of study.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary at the Ministry of Science, Continuing Education and Culture, emphasises: "With its focus on air transport, Worms University of Applied Sciences has a unique selling point in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university. "

Heil wants to examine other industries after meat industry
The Corona crisis brought the conditions in parts of the meat industry to light again.
Legislative tightening is imminent.
But are they legitimate - and will they remain so?

Employer President Ingo Kramer told the dpa: "Stay away from a general restriction of contracts for work and temporary employment, if you do not want to strangle the economy completely".
Contracts for work and services, for example, are the basis for creating added value for customers in a wide range of trades, the construction industry and plant engineering.

Heil assured: "My goal is not to ban contracts for work and services everywhere in the German economy."

The politician announced: "In the Occupational Safety and Health Act, which we want to adopt in the cabinet at the end of July, there are also measures that do not only affect the meat industry - for example, higher inspection rates for occupational safety and health or clear criteria for community accommodation".
The draft presented to the dpa includes amendments to the Act on the Protection of Employee Rights in the Meat Industry and the Occupational Safety and Health Act.

Juventus Turin champions in Italy
Turin - After a redeeming goal by Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in a row.
The team around the five-time world footballer made the 36th Scudetto in club history perfect with a 2-0 (1-0) on Sunday evening in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo scored 1-0 before halftime.
With 83 points, Turin, which competed without the last long-injured former international Sami Khedira, is no longer to be ousted from first place two matchdays before the end of the season of Serie A.
The runner-up Inter Milan is seven points behind.
Juventus was harmless despite optical superiority in the first half, then Ronaldo hit after a free kick variant with the last action.
The 35-year-old exploited a footage of Miralem Pjanic directly from the penalty area border with a flat shot (45 + 7).
Against the now more offensive guests Ronaldo was also involved in the 2-0, after his shot Federico Bernardeschi (67.) dusted off.

The reassuring lead at the top of the standings in the end was mainly due to the weakness of the competitors.
In the eleven games before the game on Sunday, the Sarri-team had only managed five victories.
Whether Ronaldo will also be the top scorer is questionable.

Baden-Wuerttemberg: Over 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - Despite all the threatened penalties and court judgments, motorists continue to accelerate in countless illegal races on the roads of Baden-Wuerttemberg: Last year and in the first four months of this year, the police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
There are no comparable figures for the years before, but the speeders are increasingly doing the judicial authorities work: A total of 155 investigations into illegal races were conducted at the public prosecutors' offices between Constance and Mannheim in 2018, one year later there were already 252 and 151 in the current year until the beginning of June.
The races were less about organized events, as can be seen from the response of the Ministry of the Interior to a request of the Landtag SPD.
In most cases, the drivers had spontaneously competed against each other or they had fled from the police - this is also reported as an illegal race.
The drivers were mainly German men between the ages of 18 and 60.
113 fines - imprisonment fifteen times
Only in comparatively few cases are the speeders caught and also asked to pay: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines have been imposed since 2018 and 15 imprisonment sentences have been imposed.
However, there is no evidence that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
Rather, other motorists reacted more sensitively than before because of the numerous tragic accidents and processes of recent years and reported more frequently, said a ministry spokesman.
Especially popular with speeders is the Autobahn 8, where drivers repeatedly slow down the traffic to make room for themselves and use the free track for a race.
Last August, a dozen drivers were caught near Kirchheim unter Teck, three months earlier there were even 18 drivers on the A8 near Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular "racetrack"
On the A81, the police register even more races than on any other federal highway.
With a speed limit there is an attempt to slow down the speeders on the particularly affected section between Engen and Geisingen.
The mostly high-priced and pimped up sports and luxury cars often have Swiss license plates, because the drivers turn to Germany because of the high penalties for driving too fast and car racing in the neighboring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit must not be reduced to a few routes: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometers per hour, we would get rid of this problem on motorways," says Martin Rivoir, the transport expert of the SPD parliamentary group.
"The inhibition threshold for speeders would be significantly higher if you were not allowed to travel legally here and there at 200 kilometers per hour or more."
Rivoir thinks less of education or image campaigns: "Those who flout all the rules in such a way and risk not only their own lives, but also the lives of other road users, can hardly be reached with reason".
ADAC calls for stronger police action
However, this is not enough for the ADAC: "We assume that speeders will not be deterred by the speed limits," says Holger Bach, Head of the Transport and Environment Department at the ADAC Wuerttemberg.
It calls for additional and tougher controls on the routes concerned.
Not infrequently, the high-speed test of strength turns into painful and momentous seriousness: Since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people have died in the races nationwide, two of them uninvolved in a nightly crash in Stuttgart's city center and one in Gerlingen.
Two young men are said to have competed in a car race there in November.
One of the vehicles came off the road, crashed into a garden wall and remained on the side, the 18-year-old passenger died.
21 other people were injured in the races of the past two years.
According to Interior Minister Thomas Strobl, however, tougher penalties are not necessary: "There is no need for legislative action to impose tougher sanctions on illegal motor vehicle races," says the Interior Ministry's paper.

Ackermann sprints to victory on final stage at Sibiu Tour
Professional cyclist Pascal Ackermann has won his second day on the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour.
The 26-year-old Palatinate rider from the Bora-hansgrohe team prevailed in the mass sprint on the 109-kilometre-long section with start and finish in Sibiu, having already won a stage on Saturday.
It was the third and fourth season for Ackermann.
In the overall classification, his Austrian teammate Gregor Muehlberger prevailed.
The 26-year-old had confidently won the mountain time trial in the morning and thus took the lead in the classification.
Only 104 riders were left for the final stage in the evening.
No fewer than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit in the mountain time trial.

Nuremberg: Unauthorized tuning meeting - police intervenes, 700 vehicles and about 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and at times over 1000 people took part in a "tuning meeting" on Saturday night in the parking lot of a furniture store.
The police carried out their announcement to intensify their control of such events.
A large tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (25 July 2020) in Nuremberg's southern city.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the police of Middle Franconia, an increased volume of vehicles in the area of a large car park in Ingolstadt Street was detected by the Nuremberg traffic police at around 10.30 pm.
As a result, the police carried out a large number of vehicle inspections there.
Only recently, the police had announced that they wanted to step up their action against so-called autoposers.
Illegal tuning meeting in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the "scene"
The officers were among the top 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, according to the police.
However, only a small part of those present can be attributed to the "autoposer" and tuning scene.
Apparently, the majority of the relevant scene complied with the appeal of the police.
On the basis of the vehicles and people on site, it can be assumed that these were mainly onlookers.
In addition, the majority of those present adhered to the applicable infection protection regulations, in particular the observance of the minimum distance and the wearing of a mouth-nose protection.
The control measures carried out on site were completed at around 1: 00 a.m.
In total, the officials found such structural changes in 10 vehicles that the operating license had expired.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No car racing required

Figures from the Employment Agency: 900 suspected cases of abuse in short-time work
Berlin - The Federal Employment Agency (BA) is investigating around 900 suspected cases of abuse of short-time work allowance.
"This is extremely low for more than 880,000 companies that have reported short-time work," Daniel Terzenbach, the board member responsible for operations, told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
When, at the beginning of the Corona crisis, a large number of companies suddenly applied for short-time work, the BA had to react quickly.

We are not naive and have perseverance. "
Indications of abuse often come from the affected employees or trade unions.
In addition, the BA uses analysis software to identify patterns of abuse.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible wave of insolvency in the autumn.
"Will there be significantly more insolvencies than in the previous year?
The assessments differ, but we are preparing ourselves in the event of a case and are already training our employees in the employment agencies to process applications for insolvency benefits. "
The figures are still inconspicuous, said Terzenbach.

Austria: Mass tests after corona outbreak in tourist resort
Authorities have responded to a corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist resort of St. Wolfgang with hundreds of tests.
The number of confirmed cases rose to 48, as the state authorities in Linz announced.
More than 100 results were still pending in the evening.
According to this, many of the infected are young interns in tourism companies, but at least one holiday guest was tested positive.
Residents, guests and tourism staff were asked to stay in their accommodation on Saturday night.
The curfew was fixed at 11pm.
"There are cancellations and cancellations of bookings here and there," said the head of the Wolfgangsee Tourism Association, Hans Wieser, to the dpa.
Some of the guests also left early.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist resort in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, about a third of the guests are Germans.

The Tourism Board launched an information campaign to raise awareness among young employees of the dangers of COVID-19.
From Saturday onwards, hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from 15 July were contacted.

The intuition that inequality weakens social cohesion existed even before the French Revolution.
What is new is that we now have evidence; we can compare societies, more equal and unequal, and see what causes inequality.
I would like to show you statistics and explain why they are related.
Look what a miserable bunch we are.
(Laughter) I would like to start with a paradox.
This shows life expectancy and gross national income on average in rich countries.
You can see that the countries on the right, Norway and the USA, for example, are twice as rich as Israel, Greece and Portugal on the left.
And that does not change their life expectancy at all.
There is nothing to suggest a connection.
But within societies, there are huge social disparities in health across society.
Here, once again, life expectancy.
Here are small areas in England and Wales populated by the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.
A big difference between the poor and the rest of us.
Even the people just below the top are in worse health than those at the top.
So income is very important within individual societies, and not between them at all.
The explanation for this paradox is that within societies we are dealing with a relative income, the social position, the status of where we stand in relation to each other, and how large the gaps between us are.
And when you understand this, you immediately ask yourself: What happens when the differences become larger, or smaller, when income differences rise or fall?
And I'll show you that now.
Not with hypothetical data.
Using data from the UN, the World Bank estimates the extent of income disparities in rich developed market democracies.
The measure we use, because it is easy to understand and available for download, is how much richer the top 20 percent are than the bottom 20 percent of each country.
You can see that in the more equal countries on the left, Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden, the top 20 percent increase by 3 percent, 4 times as much as the bottom 20 percent.
But on the other hand, the United Kingdom, Portugal, the United States and Singapore differ twice as much.
On this scale, we are twice as unequal as some of the successful market democracies.
Now I'll show you what this is doing with our societies.
We have collected data on problems with social disparities, the problems that are more common at the bottom of the social ladder.
Internationally comparable data on life expectancy, math, reading and writing skills of children, infant mortality and murder rates, the proportion of the population imprisoned, teenage pregnancies, confidence, obesity, mental illnesses that include drug and alcohol addiction in standard diagnostics and social mobility.
We have summarized them in an index.
All with the same weight.
For each country there is a kind of average value of these factors.
And here they see it in relation to the degree of inequality that I have shown you, to which I will return again and again.
The more unequal countries are doing worse in all these social problems.
This is an unusually high correlation.
But if you put the same index of health and social problems in relation to GNI per capita, to gross national income, there is nothing more, no correlation.
We worried that people would think that we had only chosen the problems that support our argument and constructed this evidence, so we published an article in the British Medical Journal on the UNICEF Index of Child Welfare.
In it 40 different components were put together by other people.
The index includes whether children can talk to their parents, whether they have books at home, their immunization rates, whether there is bullying at school.
Everything flows in with it.
Here is the index in relation to our inequality values.
Children perform worse in unequal societies.
A highly significant ratio.
Again, if you compare the index of child welfare with national per capita income, there is no correlation, not even a hint.
All the data I've shown you so far says the same thing.
The average well-being of our societies no longer depends on national income and economic growth.
These are crucial in poorer countries, but not in the rich developed world.
But the differences between us where we stand in comparison to each other has become very important.
I will now show you individual parts of our index.
Here, for example, is trust.
Simply the proportion of the population that believes that most people can be trusted.
The data comes from the World Values Survey.
On the more unequal side, about 15 percent of the population believe that others can be trusted.
But in more equal societies, this figure is up to 60 or 65 percent.
And for the degree of integration into community life or social capital, there are similarly close links to inequality.
We've done all this work twice.
First with the rich, developed countries, and then in a second test field again with the 50 American states with the same question: Do the more unequal states perform worse on all these scales?
According to data collected by the US government, trust is correlated with inequality.
A very similar distribution over a similar range of confidence levels.
The same thing is happening here.
Our fundamental result is that almost all factors that are internationally related to trust do the same in the 50 US states, in a separate test environment.
And this is not just a happy coincidence.
Here are mental illnesses.
Who compiled these figures by conducting the same diagnostic interviews with randomly selected subjects to compare the rates of mental illness in societies.
This is the percentage of the population that was mentally ill last year.
It ranges from 8 percent to three times that of entire societies, which have three times the rates of mental illness as others.
And again a high correlation to inequality.
And here violence.
These red dots are American states, the blue triangles are Canadian provinces.
Note the scale of differences.
It ranges from fifteen murders per million to 150.
That is the proportion of the population that is in detention.
Here there is about a tenfold difference on the lateral log scale.
It consists of approximately 40 to 400 imprisoned people.
This relationship is not primarily due to higher crime rates.
In some places, this is a sub-factor.
But the main reason is tougher court judgments.
And more unequal societies are also more likely to cling to the death penalty.
Here are children dropping out of school.
Again, quite big differences.
With devastating effects on the use of the talents of the population.
Here is social mobility.
Actually, a measure of mobility based on income.
The question is: Do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons, or is there no connection between them?
On the more unequal side, fathers' incomes are much more important -- in the UK, in the US.
And in the Scandinavian countries, fathers' incomes are much less decisive.
There is more social mobility.
We like to say continuous and I know that many Americans here in the audience are continuous if Americans want to live the American Dream, they should go to Denmark.
(Laughter) (Applause) I have just introduced you to a few things.
I could have shown you a lot of other problems.
All these problems are more common at the lower end of the social gradient.
But there are countless problems with social inequalities, which are worse in more unequal countries, not only a bit, but somewhere between 2 and 10 times as common.
Imagine these costs, the human cost.
But I would like to come back to the graph, where we have summarized everything to show two things.
On the one hand, graph by graph, the countries that perform poorly, regardless of the outcome, appear to be the more unequal, and those that do better appear to be the Nordic countries and Japan.
So what we see is a general social dysfunction that goes hand in hand with inequality.
This concerns not just one or two things, but most.
The other very important aspect of this graph is that Sweden and Japan have very different countries in many respects.
The position of women, how much they cling to the nuclear family, here they are at opposite poles of the rich, developed world.
Another very important difference is how they achieve their greater equality.
In Sweden there are huge differences in earnings which are compensated by taxation, the general welfare state, generous social benefits, etc.
In Japan, it is completely different.
There are smaller differences in earnings even before tax.
There are lower taxes.
A smaller welfare state.
And in our analysis of the American states we find the same contradiction.
Some countries are successful through redistribution, while others are doing well because they have small pre-tax income differentials.
Our conclusion is that it doesn't matter how you achieve greater equality as long as you somehow achieve it.
I do not mean perfect equality, I am talking about something that already exists in rich market democracies.
Another surprising part of the picture is that inequality does not only affect the poor.
Apparently there is some truth in John Donne's "Nobody is an island."
In several studies, one can compare how people in more or less the same countries perform at each level of the social hierarchy.
This is just one example.
Infant mortality rate.
Some Swedes have kindly classified much of their infant deaths according to the British Register of Socio-Economic Classification.
This is an anachronistic classification according to the professions of the fathers, so single parents are kept separately.
But where "low social class" is noted, this means unskilled manual work.
Then there are the skilled trades in the middle, then the subordinate non-skilled trades, up to the more highly settled professions of doctors, lawyers, executives of larger companies.
You can see that Sweden is better than Britain, across the entire social hierarchy.
The biggest differences are down in society.
But even at the top, living in a more equal society seems to bring a small advantage.
We show this in five different datasets that deal with educational success and health in the US and internationally.
That seems to be generally the case, greater equality matters the most at the bottom, but even at the top has some advantages.
But I should say something about what is happening.
I am interested in the psychosocial effects of inequality.
This has to do with feelings of superiority and inferiority, the feeling of being valued or devalued, respected or despised.
And, of course, the sense of status competition that results drives consumerism in our society.
It also leads to status uncertainty.
We are more concerned about how we are judged by others, whether we are considered attractive, smart, etc.
Social judgments are on the rise, and fear of these judgments is on the rise.
Interestingly, there is similar research in social psychology: Some people have evaluated 208 different studies in which volunteers were invited to psychological laboratories to measure their stress hormones and their response to stressful tasks.
What interested them in the evaluation was which types of stress most reliably raised the cortisol level, that of the central stress hormone.
And the result was: Tasks that posed a threat to social assessment entailed threats to self-esteem or social status, where others could judge their own performance negatively.
These types of stress have a very specific effect on the physiology of stress.
We have been criticised.
Of course, there are people who don't like this and people who find it very amazing.
I should tell you, however, that when we are criticised for selectively selecting our data, we never make selective choices for our own purposes.
Our absolute principle is: If our data source has data for one of the countries we are looking at, it will be included in the analysis.
Our data source determines whether it is reliable data, not us.
Anything else would be prejudice.
What about other countries?
There are 200 studies on health in relation to income and equality in academic peer-reviewed journals.
This is not limited to these countries, it is a very simple demonstration.
The same countries, the same scale of inequality, one problem after another.
Why don't we check other factors?
We have shown that per capita income makes no difference.
And, of course, others have also used more sophisticated methods to check poverty and education, and more.
What about causality?
A correlation does not yet prove causality.
We've spent a lot of time doing that.
In fact, people know the causal relationships very well in some of these results.
The big news in our understanding of the drivers of long-term health in the rich developed world is how much chronic social stress strains the immune system, the cardiovascular system.
Or, for example, the reason why violence is more prevalent in more unequal societies is because people are sensitive to being despised.
To cope with this, we need to clarify what happens after the tax and what happens before the tax.
We must limit the income, the bonus culture income at the top.
We must hold our bosses accountable to the employees as best we can.
But the takeaway message is that we can improve the real quality of human life by closing the income gap between us.
All of a sudden, there is a lever for the psychosocial well-being of entire societies, and that is very exciting.
Thank you very much.

Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualified for Champions League
London (dpa) - English football record champions Manchester United return to the Champions League after a year's absence.
The Red Devils finished third in the Premier League with a 2-0 win over Leicester City.
The Foxes now have to be content with the Europa League, because Chelsea FC passed by and also qualified for the premier league in fourth place.
In the fight against relegation, Aston Villa was allowed to cheer.
Manchester United took the lead with a penalty kick from Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in injury time, Jesse Lingard (90th + 8) scored the final score.
Chelsea, in the Champions League round of 16 opponent of FC Bayern, won thanks to Mason Mount (45th + 1) and Olivier Giroud (45th + 4) in parallel with 2-0 (2-0) against Wolverhampton Wanderers.
"That means a lot to me," said coach Frank Lampard, who is also in the FA Cup final against Arsenal in his first season as Chelsea coach.
Chelsea's victory over Wolverhampton also benefited Tottenham Hotspur, who passed the Wolves 1-1 (1-0) at Crystal Palace and started sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa won the long-distance duel with Watford and AFC Bournemouth, but had to tremble at West Ham United for a long time for the class preservation.
The late lead of Jack Grealish (84.) immediately compensated Andrej Yarmolenko (85.).
However, the 1: 1 (0: 0) was sufficient because Watford lost against Arsenal with 2: 3 (1: 3).
The club, which had three coaches in the season, was relegated after five years in the first division.
Just like Bournemouth, who could not save themselves by a 3-1 (2-1) at Everton FC.
In the end, one point was missing.
Liverpool, who have been English champions since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3-1 (1-1) victory at Newcastle United.
99 points is the highest score the Reds have ever scored in a football season.
Coach Juergen Klopp and his team narrowly missed the point record in English football.

I would like to show you today how we will manufacture things in the future.
I believe that our buildings and machines will soon assemble, replicate and repair themselves.
I will show you what I think of today's production methods and then compare them with some natural systems.
In the current manufacturing industry, we have skyscrapers extended two and a half years [construction period], half a million to a million parts, quite complex, new and exciting technologies of steel, concrete, glass.
We have exciting machines that will take us into space for five years [construction period], two and a half million parts.
On the other hand, if you look at natural systems, you can find proteins that have two million types and can fold in ten microseconds, or DNA with three billion base pairs that can be copied in about an hour.
So there is all this complexity in our natural systems, but they are extremely efficient, much more efficient than anything we can make, far more complex than anything we can build.
They are much more energy efficient.
They almost never make mistakes.
And they are durable because they can repair themselves.
So there are many interesting things to discover with natural systems.
And if we manage to incorporate this into our built environment, then we have an exciting potential for new construction methods.
And I believe that the key is self-assembly.
If we want to use self-assembly in our physical environment, I think there are four key factors.
The first is that we need to decipher all the complexity of the things we want to build, meaning our buildings and machines.
And we have to translate that into simple sequences to sort of translate the DNA of how our buildings work.
Then we need programmable parts that can use this sequence to fold or reconfigure.
We need activation energy so that our parts can fold up from the program.
And we need a kind of redundancy for error correction, so that what we want to build really comes into being.
I will show you some projects that my colleagues and I are working on at MIT, so that self-assembly can be realized in the future.
The first two are MacroBot and DeciBot.
These projects are large-scale, reconfigurable robots ranging from two and a half to four meters long proteins.
They are equipped with electromechanical devices, sensors.
One decodes what one wants to fold into a sequence of angles, meaning minus 120, minus 120, 0, 0, 120, minus 120 concatenates something like this; a sequence of angles, or rotations, and one sends this sequence through the chain.
Each unit picks up its message on request so minus 120 seconds it rotates accordingly, checks whether it has arrived, and forwards it to the neighboring unit.
These are the brilliant scientists, engineers and designers who have worked on this project.
And I think it makes one thing really clear: Is this really scalable?
I mean thousands of dollars, many hours of work to create this two and a half meter high robot.
Can we really scale it up? Can we really embed robotics in every part?
The next project questions this and looks at the passive nature or the passive attempt to make reconfiguration programmable.
But it goes a step further and tries to make actual calculations possible.
It basically integrates the most fundamental component of computing, the digital logic gate, directly into the parts.
This is a NAND gate.
You have a tetrahedron, which is the gate that will do the calculations, and you have two input tetrahedrons.
One is the input of the user while creating the blocks.
The other comes from the previous component that was arranged.
And then it delivers an output in three-dimensional space.
This means that the user can enter what the components should do.
It performs calculations based on what it has done before and what the user requires of it.
And now it begins to move up and down in three-dimensional space.
On the left-hand side, the input [1,1] corresponds to the output 0 that goes down.
On the right-hand side, the input [0,0] corresponds to the output 1, which goes up.
What this really means is that our structures now contain the plans of what we want to build.
So you have all the information about what has been built.
This means that we can achieve some form of self-replication.
In this case, I call it self-directed replication, because the structure contains the exact blueprints.
If errors occur, you can replace a part.
All the local information is integrated to show how to fix it.
So you could have something that climbs and reads along and delivers an output of one to one.
It is directly integrated; there are no instructions from the outside.
The last project I'm going to show is called Biased Chains, and it's probably the most exciting example of self-assembling systems we have at the moment.
It takes up the ability to reconfigure and program and creates a completely passive system.
Basically, you have a chain of elements.
Each element is completely identical and they are polarized.
Every chain, or element, wants to turn right or left.
So while you're putting the chain together, you're basically programming it.
Each unit is told whether to rotate to the right or left.
When you shake the chain, it folds into a configuration that you have programmed into it, in this case a spiral or in this case two cubes lying next to each other.
Basically, you can program any three-dimensional shape or one-dimensional, two-dimensional shapes completely passively into this chain.
What does this tell us about the future?
I think it tells us that there are possibilities of self-assembly, replication and repair in our physical structures, our buildings and machines.
There are new possibilities for programming in these parts.
And this opens up new possibilities for IT.
We will have spatial programming.
Imagine if our buildings, bridges, machines, all our components could perform calculations.
This would mean parallel and distributed computing power, new design possibilities.
So there is an exciting potential for this.
I think that these projects that I have shown here are only a tiny step towards this future, if we implement these new technologies for a new, self-creating world.
Thank you very much.

Arrests and violence at demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against Netanyahu's head of government are becoming increasingly fierce.
During the night there were violent clashes.
On the night of Sunday in Jerusalem, the Israeli police took violent action against participants in a demonstration against right-wing conservative Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Twelve people were arrested for participating in riots, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said.
Among other things, the police used water cannons to disperse the rally.
According to media reports, a total of around 6,000 people had gathered near Netanyahu's office on Saturday evening.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu's handling of the Corona crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew horns and called on Netanyahu to resign.
Participants in a counter-demonstration supporting Netanyahu were also detained, the news site "ynet" reported.
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the head of government's private villa in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
According to police, a man was arrested near Tel Aviv on suspicion of having sprayed pepper spray on demonstrators on the roadside from a moving car.
Another man was arrested after a stabbing attack on a demonstrator in the south of the country.
The demonstrator was slightly injured in the neck.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv there have recently been several demonstrations against Netanyahu.
The rallies accompany the corruption process against the head of government.
Recently, Netanyahu has also been criticized for his handling of the Corona crisis.
Among other things, he is accused of premature easing and a lack of preparation for a second corona wave.

North Korea seals off border town after Corona-suspected case
North Korea has so far seen its own measures to combat the coronavirus as a "shining success".
Now the country is reporting on a suspected case for the first time.
Because of a first official corona suspicion in the country, North Korea has completely sealed off a large city for fear of a catastrophe.
Despite the most stringent epidemiological defenses in the past six months, "the malignant virus may have been introduced into the country," the state media reported.
A state of emergency has been declared for the region around the border town of Kaesong.
The Communist leadership declared the highest level of alarm.
If confirmed, it would be the first official case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the isolated country.
North Korea claims not to have registered a single infection and described its defenses as a "shining success."
The information was questioned abroad.
The disease symptoms were reportedly found in an "outlier" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
The person fled to South Korea three years ago and has now returned across the border.
For the border crossing within the four kilometers wide and mostly still mined military buffer zone, there was initially no confirmation from South Korea.
However, according to reports by the national news agency Yonhap, South Korea's military admitted the possibility of an illegal border crossing to North Korea as high.
There have been investigations into some of them.
North Korea called an emergency meeting of the Labor Party Politburo, chaired by Kim Jong Un, on Saturday on suspicion.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive catastrophe".
Kim had already ordered on Friday as a preventive measure "to completely block Kaesong and isolate each district and the region from others," it continued.
The person concerned, as well as all people in Kaesong who had had contact with her, had been placed under quarantine.
The central military commission of the party should investigate the "breakaway case" as well as the behavior of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose severe punishment.
It is estimated that there are approximately 300,000 people living in Kaesong.

Tension ahead of Council meeting: City-east and noise abatement still to be discussed before summer break
"In addition to environmental issues, the committee members will also vote on the development plan for the major project inner-city development east," it says rather casually in the middle part of the city press release for the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, July 28, at 4.30 pm in the main hall of the CongressCentrum Pforzheim.
Above all, however, the upgrading of the eastern city is controversially discussed until the end.
The majorities in favour of it are scarce, most recently even rejecting it in individual committees, depending on their attendance.
Reinhard Klein criticized an appeal from the economy (construction, real estate, trade and IT) not to let the project developed by the citizenry and then by the administration and the local council now fail after almost ten years of preparation as "extra-parliamentary opposition", "unsuspecting", "speculation", "denigration" and "deliberate false statements".
"Everyone thinks they know better," says Klein, who has been the only representative of the Pforzheim Citizens' List on the municipal council for a year.
In fact, after reading the Treaties, he was in this position: "I know what I am talking about".
The exit would be cheaper for the city, the Technical City Hall is contrary to statements of the city administration after subsidies, of the existence of which Klein is convinced to rehabilitate for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop in a completely different way than predicted in the town hall and by supporters from the economy.
One day after Klein, the FDP / FW / UB / LED faction, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
Essentially, it also provides for the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, the keeping open of the Schlossberg, the leasing of the former valley for administrative space and a more small-scale inner city redevelopment, ideally with local sponsors.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues will play a central role.
Among other things, the municipal council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the population of Pforzheim from health noise pollution caused by road traffic, including many speed reductions.
In a press release, the local transport club Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of the fact that this must happen, because they have only contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus noise by neglecting regular bus traffic with thinned out cycles and by little commitment to cycling, according to the VCD.
The municipal council also votes on the participation of the city of the Energy and Climate Protection Agency Pforzheim / Enzkreis.
In addition, the agenda includes accession to the Baden-Wuerttemberg Climate Protection Pact, the reassessment of parental contributions in the municipal daycare facilities and the application for admission to the federal government's Smart City funding.

Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with a lot of delay
Tim Zimmermann will start his debut season in the ADAC GT Masters on 31 July with a delay of almost half a year.
Before the league of super sports cars can start regular operation, the first test runs have now been scheduled.
For Zimmermann, it was all about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 better.
For a long time, the Corona crisis prevented Tim Zimmermann from tackling his first official race in the new Lamborghini Huracan of Grasser Racing.
This was now possible under special hygiene conditions.
The 23-year-old from Langenargen completed his first laps at the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his debut in the GT3 car.
"There are already a few things that are different from the Porsche from the previous season," says Zimmermann.
"With ABS, for example, you have to go into corners differently.
But it was really great fun. "
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite his only 25 years of experience in GT racing, the Dutchman has been able to help his new teammate in many things.
"I'm not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series brings with it new challenges," says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I get along brilliantly and we have also made enormous progress from session to session at the Lausitzring."
Right there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also hold its first race.
From 31 July, the 33 supercars will race through Lusatia.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 newcomers to the series, knows the track.
In 2015 he was most recently guest at the Motodrom.
"It worked quickly and I didn't have to get used to the track much," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafen racing community Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has many fast passages that you have to hit optimally to be fast".
How fast Zimmermann really is then turns out in two weeks.
"Of course, the teams play poker a little during the tests," he says.
"In the end, however, we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring".
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a crowded calendar.
Seven races are scheduled until the beginning of November.
The current state is that no spectators will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August, former Formula One driver Niko Huelkenberg will take over the GT steering wheel.

British Transport Minister cold-caught by quarantine decision
The British government's decision to quarantine holidaymakers in Spain for two weeks after their return has, according to press reports, caught the country's transport minister off guard.
According to this, Grant Shapps is currently on holiday in Spain, of all places, while his colleagues at home decided on the measure on Saturday.
Due to the increase in corona numbers in Spain, the cabinet in London removed the country from the list of countries from which entry without quarantine conditions is possible.
The new regulation will apply from today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to be quarantined after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures on returnees.
But for those who are only on holiday on the cut-off date, the scheme will only apply from Saturday, 1 August, and was not introduced overnight.
Spain, by the way, is one of the "safe countries" in Austria for which no quarantine is required.
"Many ministers may have known in advance that there is a possibility that a quarantine will be imposed on holidaymakers in Spain", commented Labour MEP Diane Abbot.
"But apparently no one bothered to tell Grant Shapps."

Do you know how many species of flowering plants there are?
A quarter of a million cultivars that is the number of known cultivars a quarter of a million species of flowering plants.
And blossoms are real devils.
Plants have great difficulty in producing them.
They require an enormous amount of energy and raw materials.
Why are they bothering?
The answer to this, of course, as to so many things in the world: Sex.
I know what you're thinking when you look at these pictures.
And the answer to why sexual reproduction is so important -- there are many other ways for plants to reproduce.
Take offshoots; they can have sex with themselves, so to speak; they can pollinate themselves.
But they actually have to spread their genes in order to mix them with other genes so that they can occupy ecological niches.
This is how evolution works.
Plants pass on this information via pollen.
Some of you may have seen some of these pictures before.
As I always say, everyone would have to have a scanning electron microscope at home to see them.
There are as many different types of pollen as there are flowering plants.
And this is very useful for forensics and so on.
Most of the pollen that causes hay fever in our country comes from plants that use the wind to spread their pollen, which is a very inefficient process, which is why so much of it ends up in our noses.
Because the plants throw out very large quantities, in the hope that the male sex cells that are in the pollen will meet another flower only by chance.
All grasses, all cereals and most trees transport pollen through the wind.
Most species, however, use insects for their purposes, and this is the smarter way, as less pollen is needed.
The insects and other species can bring the pollen directly to its destination.
We are, of course, aware of the relationship between insects and plants.
Whether flies, birds or bees, they also benefit from it, usually through the nectar.
This symbiosis has led to some wonderful adaptations - the hummingbird moth is a beautiful adaptation.
The plant benefits from the fact that the hummingbird spreads the pollen further.
Plants have developed small runways for bees that would otherwise not find their way.
On many plants are markings that resemble other insects.
These are the anthers of a lily, a very clever construction. When an unsuspecting insect lands on it, the bags flip up and hit the insect on the back, where the pollen gets stuck and is taken to other plants. If the insect does not know what to do, the pollen is taken to another plant.
This is an orchid that looks like it has a mouth, forcing the insects to crawl out and become covered with pollen.
There are at least 20,000 orchid species - an impressive variety.
And they have all sorts of tricks in store.
They need to attract pollinators to help them.
This orchid, known from the research of Charles Darwin, who made a great thesis at its sight, you see a very long nectar tube coming down from the orchid.
And what insects have to do there in the middle of the flower - they have to put their little sucking proboscis there and down the whole nectar tube to get the nectar.
And when Darwin saw this flower, he said, "Something must have developed in parallel."
And indeed, here is this insect.
Usually it rolls up the trunk, but in its stretched form it looks like this.
You can imagine that if nectar is so valuable and costly for the plant to produce and attracts many pollinators, then it is like human sex that people begin to be deceived.
They say, "I have nectar, will you come and fetch it for yourself?"
This is one plant.
This is a plant that insects in South Africa simply love, and they have developed a long proboscis to get at the nectar.
And this is an imitator,
A plant that copies the original.
And here is the fly with a long proboscis that has not received nectar from the imitator, because the imitator, contrary to what the fly expects, has no nectar at all.
Not only did the fly not get nectar, it also had - if you look very closely, at the head of the proboscis you can see pollen that it would have transferred to other plants, if only a botanist had not passed by and glued it on blue paper.
(Laughter) Deception runs through the whole plant kingdom.
These black dots on the flower, they look to us like black dots, but for male insects of certain species they look like two females, which are very hot.
(Laughter) And when the insect lands there, it picks up pollen, which takes it to further plants.If you look at the "Everyone should have one" electron microscope image, you see that there are certain three-dimensional patterns.
It probably not only looks good for the insect, but also feels good.
And these electron microscope images - here one of an orchid imitating an insect - show that different parts of the shape have different colors and seemingly different surfaces, and for the perception of an insect, the textures are very, very different.
This plant has developed the imitation of a shiny metallic surface, as can be seen on some bugs.
And under the electron microscope, you can see that this surface is completely different from the one we have looked at so far.
Sometimes the whole plant imitates an insect, even in our perception.
I think that looks like a flying animal.
It's a wonderful thing.
This one is clever. It's called Obsidium.
I sometimes see them as insidious.
For certain bees, it looks like another, particularly aggressive bee, so it flies there and hits it several times on the head to drive it away and, of course, absorbs a lot of pollen.
At the same time, this plant imitates another orchid, which has a rich food supply for insects.
This one, however, has nothing for them.
So she cheats on two levels - fabulous.
(Laughter) Here we see the cananga tree, an ingredient of many perfumes.
I smelled someone before.
The flowers should not be so colorful.
They send a fantastic spectrum of scents to all insects.
This one doesn't smell so good.
This is a flower that smells really horrible and that has evolved to mimic carrion.
Therefore, flies love them.
They fly in and pollinate them.
This is a Helicodiceros, also known as a "dead horse".
I don't know how a dead horse smells, but the plant probably hits it quite well.
It is really horrible.
And blowflies can't hold back.
They fly straight to the very back
And lay their eggs there, they think it is carrion, without realizing that there is no food for the eggs that die because of it, but the plant benefits from it, as the fly full of pollen flies on again and pollinates the next flower - fantastic.
This is Arum maculatum, the spotted arum.
I photographed him last week in Dorset.
It heats up to about 15 degrees Celsius above ambient temperature - fascinating.
Flies are attracted by the heat that creates volatile chemicals, and are then trapped in the bottom of the container.
They drink the wonderful nectar and are sticky afterwards.
At night they get a pollen shower and then the bristles we have seen above slacken and give way to the mosquitoes, which are full of pollen - great thing.
If you think that's great, now comes one of my favorites.
This is the Philodendron Selloum.
If someone from Brazil is here, you will know the plant.
It is really fascinating.
This species Phallus there is about 30cm long.
And it does something that no other plant I know does when it blooms. There in the middle are the inflorescences - for about 2 days it has a metabolism very similar to that of mammals.
Instead of feeding on starch, which is the food of plants, it takes something similar to brown adipose tissue and burns it so quickly that the fat burning rate, metabolism, corresponds to that of a small cat.
This is twice the energy production of a hummingbird, in relation to its weight - incredibly impressive.
But he does something else that is unusual.
It not only heats up to 43-44 C for approximately two days, but also maintains a constant temperature.
It can regulate its temperature and thus keep it constant.
They ask themselves, "Why is he doing this?"
As you can imagine, there are some bugs that love to mate at this temperature.
And they fly inside and get started.
(Laughter) And the plant showers them with pollen, and they fly on and pollinate.
What a wonderful thing.
The typical pollinator for us is an insect, but in the tropics many birds and butterflies also pollinate.
And many tropical flowers are red and we believe this is because birds and butterflies look similar to us and therefore can see the color red very well.
If you look at the spectrum of birds and humans, we see red, green and blue so this spectrum here.
Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet, and different levels of ultraviolet.
So something that goes beyond our spectrum.
And I hear you asking, "Wouldn't it be great if we could see that?"
Of course, we can.
So what does an insect see?
Last week I photographed this sunflower in Dorset.
As you can see, these are small yellow flowers, small yellow flowers everywhere.
And that's what they look like in visible light.
That's what it looks like when you remove the red.
Most bees don't see red.
And then I photographed with ultraviolet filters and exposed the special ultraviolet frequencies for a very, very long time and that came out.
And that's a fantastic target.
We don't know exactly what bees are seeing, just like you don't know what I'm seeing when I say "This is red."
We cannot look into the thoughts of insects or other people.
But the contrast will be something like this. It stands out against the background.
Here is another small bloom - different bandwidth of ultraviolet frequencies, different filters that are similar to pollinators.
And that's what they would see.
If you now think all yellow flowers have this property - no flower was damaged for this picture; it was only attached to the tripod, not killed - but under ultraviolet light it looks like this.
And this could serve as the basis of a sunscreen, because sunscreens absorb UV light.
The substances in the plant could be helpful.
Finally, we have an evening primrose that Bjorn Rorslett sent me from Norway - fantastic hidden patterns.
I love the idea of hidden things.
I think there is something poetic about it, namely that these images were taken with UV filters, filters that are mainly used by astronomers to photograph Venus - more precisely, her nebulae.
That is the main purpose of these filters.
Venus is the goddess of love and fertility, and that in turn is the story of flowers.
And flowers not only show great efforts to attract pollinators, they also manage that we plant large fields full of them and give them to each other at births and deaths, and especially at weddings, which, if you think about it, are the moment when the exchange of genetic material from one organism to another is fixed.
Thank you very much.

Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green passed away
His life was like a rollercoaster ride: After a rapid ascent with Fleetwood Mac, it went steeply downhill and then slowly up again.
Now blues rock guitarist Peter Green has died at the age of 73.
Brilliant guitarist, drug junkie, cult fan: The co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.

Drummer Fleetwood and guitarist Green had founded the now legendary band in 1967 in London, and his dreamy instrumental hit "Albatross" is still unforgotten today.
The musician's life ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") resembled a roller coaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated their greatest successes but then without him.
Among other things, there was a dispute because Green wanted to donate all the profits of the group to charity.

The song "Albatross", composed by Green, gave the group their first number one hit in the winter of 1968 / 69 and catapulted them to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed its downsides: Green could not cope with the media hype, his experiments with the drug LSD became more and more extreme.
He later commented on life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that has happened to me in life is drugs - the best thing was to land a number one hit".
Towards the end of the decade, Green surprisingly achieved a respectable success in 1979 with an album inspired by religious themes.
Fleetwood Mac, meanwhile, swam without him in a new formation on a wave of success.
Their 1977 album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
