p. 381 Jan Christopher Horak wrote: " The film is a remarkable achievement of the director.
We're not supposed to know.
You could have known.
Please all be aware of a very simple fact for a moment: pretty much everything we know about the universe we know through light.
We can stand on Earth and look into the night sky and look at stars with our bare eyes.
The sun burns our peripheral vision.
We see light reflected from the moon.
and in the time that has passed since Galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope at the celestial bodies, the universe known to us has traveled to us as visible light, traversing immeasurable ages of cosmic history.
With the help of all our modern telescopes, we've been able to study it all: this impressive silent movie of the universe, this series of snapshots dating back to the Big Bang.
But the universe is not a silent movie, for the universe is not silent.
I would like to convince you that the universe has a soundtrack and that this soundtrack is played in outer space itself: Because space can vibrate like a drum.
It can sound a kind of sound recording that can be heard throughout the universe; of some of the most dramatic events when they occurred.
Now we'd like to add a sonic component to the wonderful visual arrangement we have from the universe.
And even if we've never heard the sounds of the universe before, we should slowly turn up the volume control for what's happening out there over the next few years.
Out of this ambition to capture songs of the universe, we focus our interest on black holes and their inherent promise. Black holes hammer against space-time like wooden mallets on a drum. They have a very characteristic sound that I would like to play to you; or our idea of what this song will sound like.
One day we may see a shadow cast by a black hole against a bright background, but so far we haven't succeeded.
And yet you can hear black holes, even when they're invisible, because they play like a drum in space-time.
We owe the idea that the universe sounds like a drum to Albert Einstein, to whom we owe so much.
Einstein realized that if space were empty, if the universe were empty, it would have to look like this picture, just without this helpful grid.
But if we moved through space in free fall, even without this helpful grid, then maybe we could paint it ourselves, because we would realize that we are moving along straight lines, along undistorted, straight paths through the universe.
Einstein also recognized (and that's what it's all about) that when you bring energy or mass into the universe, it bends the universe. If a free-falling body, say, came past the Sun, it would be distorted along the natural curvature lines in space.
This is Einstein's great General Theory of Relativity.
Even light is bent along these paths.
And a body can be bent so strongly that it gets into an orbit around the sun, just like the earth, or like the moon in the earth's orbit.
These are natural curvatures in space.
What Einstein didn't know was this: if you took the sun and compressed it into a ball six kilometers in diameter, if you took something with millions of times the mass of the earth and compressed it to six kilometers, you would create a black hole; a body of such density that light that passed too close to it could never escape. It would be a black shadow in front of the universe.
But Einstein considered black holes a mathematical curiosity all his life.
He didn't believe they really existed.
He was convinced that nature would protect us from its formation.
It would take decades for the term " black hole " to be coined and people to understand that black holes are astrophysical bodies. In fact, they are the lifeless state of extremely dense stars that collapse in a horrific catastrophe at the end of their lives.
Our sun, however, will not end up as a black hole.
It's just not big enough for that.
But we did a little thought experiment, as Einstein liked to do. Imagine squeezing the Sun to six kilometers in diameter and bringing a tiny Earth into orbit, say, 30 kilometers away from this black Sun.
This earth would shine by itself, (for since the sun would then have disappeared if there were no other light source) so we let our little earth shine by itself.
We could put the Earth into a carefree orbit about 30 km away from the crushed black hole.
This crushed black hole would be about the size of Manhattan.
It would pour a little more into the Hudson before it destroyed the Earth.
But we're talking about that.
We're talking about something that can be squeezed together until it's half the size of Manhattan.
Now we bring the Earth very close, up to about 30 km, and see how it moves in a completely flawless orbit around the black hole.
There's a kind of myth that black holes devour everything in the universe, but in fact you have to get very close to them to fall in.
But what is particularly impressive from our point of view is the fact that we can always see the Earth.
She can't hide behind the black hole.
The light that comes from the earth, some of it falls in, but some is scattered and returns to us.
So you can't hide anything behind a black hole.
If this is the Battlestar Galactica and you're fighting the Cylons, better not hide behind the Black Hole.
They can see them.
So our Sun will not collapse into a black hole, its mass is not enough, but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
If one of them wiped out the Milky Way, it would look like that.
We would see a shadow of the black hole set against the backdrop of billions of stars from the Milky Way galaxy and their glowing dust orbits.
If we were to fall toward this black hole, we would see all the light bent around it, and we could even step into the shadow without noticing anything unusual happening.
It would be bad if we tried to ignite our engines and escape, because we couldn't, just as the light can't escape.
But even if the black hole is dark from the outside, it is not dark inside, because all the light from the galaxy could fall behind us.
And although due to a phenomenon of the theory of relativity (the so-called time dilation), our clocks seemed to go slower in relation to galactic time, it would look as if the development of the galaxy had accelerated and shot at us just before we were crushed to death by the black hole.
It would be like a near-death experience to see the light at the end of the tunnel, but it would be a comprehensive death experience.
(Laughter) And you couldn't tell anyone about the light at the end of the tunnel.
Now we've never seen such a shadow of a black hole, but black holes can be heard even if they're invisible.
Imagine an astrophysically realistic situation. Imagine two black holes that have lived a long life together.
Maybe it was once stars that collapsed into two black holes, each with a mass ten times that of the Sun.
We are now squeezing them together to a diameter of 60 km.
They can spin several hundred times per second.
At the end of their lives, they circle each other almost at the speed of light.
They can travel thousands of miles in a split second. And as they do, they not only bend space, but leave in their wake a sound of space, a real wave of space-time.
Space contracts and expands as it flows out of these black holes and hammers onto the universe.
And they travel out into the cosmos at the speed of light.
We owe this computer simulation to a relativity working group at NASA Goddard.
It took almost 30 years for someone to solve this problem.
This was one of those groups.
Here we see two black holes circling each other, again with the helpful painted lines.
Maybe you can see - it's a bit indistinct - but when you see the red waves coming out, these are gravitational waves.
They actually represent the sound of sounding outer space and will emerge from these black holes at the speed of light as they become quieter and quieter and eventually merge into a spinning, silent black hole.
If you were close enough, the sound of contracting and expanding outer space would roar in your ears.
You could literally hear the sound.
Of course, your head would also be pressed and stretched, which would be quite unpleasant, which is why you would also have trouble understanding what is happening.
But I would like to show you what sounds we would predict here.
This is from my workgroup - a somewhat less glamorous computer model.
Imagine a lighter black hole falling into a very heavy black hole.
What you hear is the sound with which the light black hole hammers onto space, every time it passes close by.
When it moves away again, it's a bit too quiet.
But it hits like a mallet and literally shatters the universe, making it swing like a drum.
We can predict how that will sound.
We know that when it falls in, it gets faster and louder.
And finally, we hear the little guy fall into the big guy.
I've never heard it so loud - it's really a lot more dramatic.
At home it sounds a bit disappointing.
Mehr so wie ding, ding, ding.
This is another noise from my group.
No, I'm not going to show you any pictures, because black holes don't leave helpful ink marks. Space has no colorful, painted lines.
But if you were floating around in space during a space vacation and you would hear this here, then you should make sure you get away.
(Laughter) You should really get away from that noise.
Both black holes are moving.
Both black holes are getting closer.
In this case, they vibrate very strongly at first.
And then they merge.
This chirping is typical for the merging of two black holes, so that it chirps at the end.
This is our idea of what we would see.
Luckily we're at a safe distance here in Long Beach, California.
But it is highly likely that two black holes have just merged somewhere in the universe.
And it is just as certain that space is vibrating around us after it has presumably taken millions of light-years, or a million years to travel to us at the speed of light.
But the sound is way too quiet for us to ever hear.
Experiments are being carried out on Earth with great zeal, one of which is called LIGO - the aim is to detect deviations in the way space contracts and expands again, deviations in the order of magnitude smaller than an atomic nucleus over a distance of four kilometres.
It is an incredibly ambitious project and its sensitivity will be further developed over the next few years - in order to be able to perceive this here.
There will also be a mission for outer space, which will hopefully be launched within the next ten years. It is called LISA.
LISA will be able to see huge black holes, black holes with millions or billions of times the Sun's density.
In this image from the Hubble telescope, we see two galaxies.
They look like they're frozen in an embrace.
Each probably contains a huge black hole inside.
But they are not frozen. They merge.
These two black holes collide and become one over billions of years.
Our human faculty of perception is unable to grasp a song of such length of time.
But LISA could see the final stages of two giant black holes, at an earlier stage in the history of the universe, the last 15 minutes before they merge.
And it's not just about black holes, it's also about all the big disruptions in the universe - and the biggest of them all is the Big Bang.
When the term was coined, it was contemptuously meant - " Who believes in a big bang, a big bang? "
This animation from friends of mine at Proton Studios shows an outside view of the Big Bang.
We never really want to try; we never want to be inside the universe because you can never be outside the universe.
So imagine you're in the big bang.
It's everywhere, all around you, and space wobbles and swings totally uncontrollably.
14 billion years go by, but this song still rings out around us.
Galaxies form and generations of stars are born in those galaxies, and around one of those stars, at least one, orbits a habitable planet.
And here we sit and work like crazy on these experiments, do calculations and write computer code.
Imagine two black holes colliding a billion years ago.
Their song has been sounding through space ever since, all the time.
We didn't even exist back then.
It's getting closer and closer - 40,000 years ago we still painted cave paintings.
Should it be the big bang we're recording, it would sound like that.
It's literally the epitome of noise.
It's white noise, it's such a chaotic noise.
But it's all around us, probably at least if it wasn't wiped out by another process in the universe.
When we record it, it will sound like music to our ears because it will be a quiet echo, an echo of the moment of our creation, our visible universe.
So within the next two years, we will be able to make the soundtrack a little louder and display the universe as a sound image.
But if we can grasp those very earliest moments, it will bring us much closer to an understanding of the Big Bang, which in turn will bring us closer to some of the most complex, most elusive questions.
If we played a movie of the universe backwards, we would know there was a big bang in the past, and we could even sense the cacophony of its sound. But was our big bang the only big bang?
I think we have to ask the question: Has something like this ever happened before?
Will it repeat itself?
I think, in the spirit of the challenge TED poses - to rekindle amazement - we can ask questions, at least at this last minute, that might otherwise elude us forever.
But we have to ask ourselves: Is it possible that our universe is just an offshoot of a bigger story?
Or is it possible that we are just an offshoot of a multiverse - each offshoot with its own Big Bang in its past - maybe some of them have drum-playing black holes, others maybe not - in some there may be intelligent life, in others not - not in our past, not in our future, but in some way fundamentally connected to us?
So we have to ask ourselves: if there is a multiverse, do living beings exist in another fragment of this multiverse?
These are my creatures of the Multiverse.
Are there other beings in this multiverse who are concerned about us and their own origins?
And if they do exist, I can imagine them being like us, doing arithmetic and writing computer codes, building instruments, trying to make out the remotest sound of their origins, and wondering who else is out there.
Thank you. Thank you.

Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvest workers infected
After a corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in Mamming, Lower Bavaria, almost 500 people are under quarantine and are no longer allowed to leave the farm.
A security service monitors the ban on going out.
A total of 174 harvest workers were tested positive for the corona pathogen Sars-CoV-2 during the screening, as the Dingolfing-Landau district office announced on Saturday evening.
" In order to avoid further expansion, we unfortunately have to take this step to protect the population, " explained District Administrator Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees in the company had already been infected - this was the reason for the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm that grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and beetroot - but the cucumbers are only for jars.
Mamming is a rural community with a good 3300 inhabitants not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.

On the farm, infected employees were separated from non-infected employees, and the site is now surrounded by a fence.

The SPD takes a similar view: " After the corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof slaughterhouse in mid-May, we have already called for a special control programme for farms with harvest workers, " said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
" In particular, the hygiene conditions at the workplace and the living conditions must be strictly controlled from our point of view.

Many people believe that driving is an activity reserved only for people who can see.
A blind person driving a car safely and independently has so far been considered an impossible task.
Hi, my name is Dennis Hong, and we want to give blind people freedom and independence by building a vehicle for the blind.
So, before I talk about this car for the blind, let me briefly talk about another project I've been working on called the DARBA Urban Challenge.
This was about building a robotized car that can drive itself.
You press Start, no one touches anything, and it can reach its destination completely automatically.
So, in 2007, our team won half a million dollars by becoming third in the competition.
Around this time, the National Association of the Blind, or NFB, challenged the investigation committee to manufacture a car that could be safely and independently driven by a blind person.
We decided to give it a try because we thought, hey, how difficult that can be.
We already have an automatic vehicle.
We put a blind person in and it's done, isn't it?
(Laughter) We couldn't have been wrong.
What the National Association for the Blind (NFB) wanted was not a vehicle that drives blind people around, but a vehicle where a blind person can make active decisions and drive.
So we had to throw everything away and start all over again.
Therefore, to test this crazy idea, we developed a small buggy prototype vehicle to test its feasibility.
And in the summer of 2009, we invited dozens of young blind people from all over the country and gave them the opportunity to take a spin.
It was an absolutely amazing experience.
But the problem with this car was that it was designed so that it could only be driven in a controlled environment, a level, traffic-free parking lot, and that even the lanes were highlighted with red cones.
Therefore, with this success, we decided to take the next big step, to develop a true car that can be driven in real roads.
So how does it work?
Well, it's a pretty complicated system, but let me try to explain it, and maybe I can simplify it.
Well, we have three steps.
We have perception, computation, and non-visual interfaces.
Well, it is clear that the driver cannot see, so the system must be able to perceive the environment and gather information for the driver.
For this, we use an initial measurement unit.
It measures the acceleration, the angular acceleration, like a human ear, an inner ear.
We merge the information with a GPS unit to get approximately the position of the car.
We also use two cameras to detect the lanes of the road.
And we also use three laser distance measurements.
The lasers scan the environment to detect obstacles, a car approaching us from the front or back, and also any obstacles entering the road, any obstacles around the vehicle.
After that, all this enormous amount of information is passed into the computer, and the computer can do two things.
First, first of all, process the information to understand what the environment is like; these are lanes on the road, the obstacles, and convey that information to the driver.
The system is also smart enough to calculate the safest way to operate the car.
We can also generate instructions on how to operate the controls of the vehicle.
But, the problem is this: how can we convey this information and these instructions to a person who can't see quickly enough and fairly accurately so that they can drive?
For this, we have developed different types of non-visual user interface technology.
We started with a three-dimensional ping sound system, a vibrating vest, a click wheel with voice commands, a foot stripe, and even a shoe that puts pressure on the leg.
But today, we're going to talk about three of these non-visual user interface technologies.
Well, the first interface technology is called DriveGrip.
This one is a pair of gloves, and it has its vibrating elements on the ankle side, so they can give instructions on how to steer, direction and intensity.
Another device is called SpeedStrip.
These are a chair, strictly speaking, it is a massage chair.
We hollow it out, and we reorganize the vibrating elements into different patterns. And we press them to convey information about speed, and also to give instructions on how to use the accelerator and brake pedal.
So, here they can see how the computer sees the environment, and since they can't see the vibration, we even equip the driver with red LEDs so they can really see what's going on.
These are the sensory data, and this data is forwarded to the devices via a computer.
Therefore, these two devices, DriveGrip and SpeedGrip, are very effective.
But the problem is that there are stitch instructions devices.
So this isn't a real freedom, is it?
The computer tells you how to drive, turn left, turn right, accelerate, stop.
We call it back seat driver problem.
So, let's move away from the stitch instruction devices, and now focus more on the information devices.
A good example of this non-visual information interface technology is AirPix.
Think of it as a monitor for the blind.
Well, it's a small tray, it has lots of holes and it releases compressed air, so it can even draw pictures.
Therefore, even if they are blind, they can put their hand on it, see the lanes and the obstacles on the road.
In fact, they can also change the air frequency that escapes, and possibly the temperature.
Therefore, it is in fact a multidimensional user interface.
Well, here you can look at the left camera, the right camera seen from the vehicle, and see how the computer interprets this and sends the information to the AirPix.
For that, let's show a simulator, a blind person driving and using the AirPix.
This simulator was also very useful for training the blind riders and also quick at testing different sorts of ideas for different types of non-visual user interfaces.
So, that's how it mainly works.
But this vehicle is a prototype, and it will not enter the road until it is proven to be safe, or safer than today's vehicles.
And I really believe this can happen.
But still, will society, would they accept such a radical idea?
How will we handle the insurance?
How will we issue driving licenses?
Aside from the technological challenges, there are many types of hurdles we need to overcome before it becomes a reality.
Of course, the main objective of this project is to produce a car for a blind person.
But potentially more important than this is the tremendous value of the spin-off technology that can be drawn from this project.
The sensors that are needed can see in the dark in fog and rain.
And along with this new type of interface, we can use this technology and apply it in safer cars for normal-seeing people.
Or for blind people, in everyday appliances in the home, in training and in the office.
Imagine a teacher writing on the blackboard in a classroom, and a blind student can see and read what he has written using these non-visual interface technologies.
That is priceless.
So, the things I've shown you today are just the beginning.
Thank you very much.

Discuss the abolition of the 50 + 1 rule
Former DFB president Reinhard Grindel has recommended thinking about abolishing the 50 + 1 rule.
" German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates fait accompli, " Grindel told " Bild am Sonntag. "
He stressed: " For the clubs that are most likely to endanger Bayern and Dortmund, the 50 + 1 rules don't work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, one cannot avoid the debate as to whether it is not appropriate to make it easier for associations that want to break into this phalanx to involve investors. "
However, he has doubts as to whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority shareholdings, which are prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50 + 1 rule.
" It remains a legal risk to draw investment fences around the Bundesliga as a business location in a European internal market, " said Grindel.
The former DFB boss sees the danger that " the attempts to create a more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will ultimately only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs on a European level, but will not lead to more tension in the championship. "

He had received the gift worth around 11,000 euros from a Ukrainian official.
" I committed a compliance violation, and it was right to draw the consequences from that, " said Grindel.
" I handled the ominous watch gift in a completely transparent and unsuspecting way.
Many in the DFB knew about it. "
He had never " made a secret of the gift, " assured the 58-year-old.
" That may be called naive; at any rate, this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption. "

Although the big party in the spa town was missing, visitors and performers enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative programme.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organisers: the Rakoczy weekend without the Rakoczy festival.

Argentina rejects creditors' counter-offer

" That would not only be irresponsible, but also unfair, " it said in a statement.
" While 50 percent of children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors. "
The debts of the second-largest economy in South America are no longer sustainable under current conditions.
That is why Argentina is demanding that its private creditors waive part of their claims of around 66 billion US dollars (around 59 billion euros).
If no agreement is reached, the country is again threatened with state bankruptcy.
It would be the ninth default in Argentina's history.
Most recently, lenders had called for higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to some contractual clauses.
However, the Argentine government is sticking to its latest offer and is not prepared to make any further concessions.
Argentina is in the midst of a severe financial and economic crisis.
The inflation rate was recently more than 50 percent.
For the current year, experts expect economic power to decline by around ten percent.
At the end of May, Argentina had not settled interest claims amounting to 503 million US dollars and had thereby slipped into a limited default.

Professionally arrived - privately not yet
" It's going super well " - this is the conclusion drawn by Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first days at the notary's office in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very quickly: In mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will succeed Lutz Feller in the notarial office in Eggenfelden.
Already six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the doctor of law took up the work, the normal day-to-day business has long been running at full speed.
" Privately, however, I still have to arrive, " she explains in conversation with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
The short lead time was of course not enough to completely relocate the centre of life from Regensburg to Eggenfelden, reports the native Dingolfinger.
She and her husband, who works as a judge at the regional court in Regensburg, are currently looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city.
At least her husband was still able to apply for parental leave at short notice in order to be able to guarantee the care of the two daughters (3 ½ and 1 ½ years old).
In order not to have to commute from Regensburg every day, she also has overnight accommodation with her parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-old.
Raised in the neighbouring district, the town of Eggenfelden has of course been known to her for a long time.
During on-site visits with her family in recent months, she found out again: " Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town. "
She was all the more pleased that she had won the race in the selection process for the vacant position.
Her native Lower Bavaria also plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career: After studying law in Passau, she completed her legal traineeship and the 2nd state examination in Regensburg.
After several positions as a notary assessor, including in Rehau and Hof in Upper Franconia, Babenhausen in the Unterallgäu and Regensburg - during this time she also shouldered her doctorate in employment law " on the side " - she took up her first position as a notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016, she took parental leave, which was finally followed by the move to Regensburg.
Since then she has taken over representation services in various notarial offices.
When the position in Eggenfelden was advertised due to the approaching retirement of Lutz Feller, she saw the right time for full professional re-entry, explains the 39-year-old.
The team of her predecessor, who will take over the holiday representation in the notarial office in the future, has completely taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer - and has immediate praise for the team of the law firm: " It's going super well! "
The fact that she can rely on well-rehearsed processes here makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of her private centre of life.
In matters of nursery and nursery places, she has already made contact with a local institution.

BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be filled to 20 percent at the start of the season in the event of a fan return.
" Due to the distance regulation, which must be complied with, we are currently planning with 12,000 to 15,000 spectators, " said Borussia Dortmund's managing director Carsten Cramer to the " Tagesspiegel. "
Normally, the arena in the Revierstadt holds slightly more than 81,000 spectators at Bundesliga matches.
In the ghost games of last season caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BVB had lost around four million euros per game.
Cramer, who is responsible for marketing, digitalization and internationalization at BVB, hopes that in addition to the normal spectator seats, some of the approximately 4000 seats in the hospitality area can also be opened again: " It is of course a blow to the office if these revenues completely break away.

Kalbitz expulsion from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of " Feigenblatt "
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is from the point of view of the FDP only a " fig leaf " and does not change the character of the party.
" The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the extreme right in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD, " FDP politician Benjamin Strasser told the dpa news agency in Berlin.
On Saturday in Stuttgart, after several hours of hearings, the Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Executive Board had decided by a majority in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD parliamentary group in the Brandenburg State Parliament.
" If the AfD really wanted to consistently remove right-wing extremists from their party, functionaries like Björn Höcke and his supporters would have been expelled long ago, " said Strasser.
" However, there is no political will for this in the AfD, because right-wing extremism is now part of the party. "
CSU General Secretary Markus Blume expressed a similar view: " The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded says nothing and does not change anything, " he told " Welt am Sonntag. "
" Rather, it speaks volumes how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist in the midst of the AfD still has. "
Blume assumes that the AfD will again land below five percent in future elections.
" The days of the AfD in the parliaments are numbered. "
Kalbitz was one of the spokesmen of the now officially dissolved " wing " around the Thuringian AfD state and parliamentary party chairman Björn Höcke; the Office for the Protection of the Constitution classifies the vote as " a sure right-wing extremist aspiration. "
In May, the AfD federal executive threw Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason, he stated that when he joined the party, Kalbitz had not stated an earlier membership in the now banned right-wing extremist " Heimattreue Deutsche Jugend " (HDJ) and among the Republicans.
Kalbitz denies membership in the HDJ.
The chairman of the left-wing parliamentary group in the Brandenburg State Parliament, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court did not change the character of the AfD: " The wolf has only eaten chalk.
The AfD remains a far-right party, whether with or without Kalbitz. "
This decision would neither weaken the federal party nor the right wing.
" The manoeuvre of the Meuthen troops is transparent.
One wants to avoid further observation by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution and tries to get through under the radar, " said Walter.
" The AfD is not getting rid of the ghosts it called.
An expulsion does not change anything, " commented the Brandenburg SPD General Secretary Erik Stohn on the decision in the Kalbitz case.
" Here, the AfD regional association and the parliamentary group held on to their right-wing leader to this day. "
The legal dispute over Kalbitz's membership in the AfD will continue.
The latter announced on Saturday that he would now take civil action against the decision of the Federal Court of Arbitration.

North Sea wind farms deliver a good 21 per cent more electricity
The wind power plants on the German North Sea fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid in the first six months of the year.
That is a good 21 per cent more than in the same period last year, said network operator Tennet in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of North Sea electricity to the mainland and forwarding it through the German electricity grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of Tennet's grid area, have fed in a further 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, wind power from the North and Baltic Seas thus comes to 13.73 TWh, compared to a good 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of total wind power in Germany; that is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms ensure higher generation capacities
In addition to the wind conditions, the increased contribution of offshore wind energy results from higher generation capacities because new wind farms have been connected to the grid in the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea were all running at full power at the same time, they could mathematically generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatts.
It is expected to rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea by 2030.
" In Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore grid connections by then, " said Tennet Managing Director Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, even at sea, wind farms cannot fully exploit their capacity, but reach around 40 per cent.
The previous record day this year is January 2, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce around 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could supply almost seven million households with electricity.

More air traffic controllers in Worms in the future
Worms University of Applied Sciences continues to take to the skies: " DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung " endows a professorship for " Air Traffic Management. "
A corresponding contract between the university and DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and will start in 2021.
With the professorship, it is possible to start studies not only in the summer semester, but also in the winter semester.
This means that twice as many students can be trained as before.
At the same time, capacities at both the university and the DFS Academy of Air Navigation Services are being used to their full capacity.
DFS will advise the university on setting up and filling the professorship.
Represented at the university since 2019
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students have been in the Air Traffic Management degree programme as part of their training as air traffic controllers at Worms University of Applied Sciences.
Nine students have already started this year.
So far, the experiences of DFS have been very positive, and the achievements of the students are outstanding.
The combination of studies and pilot training contributes significantly to further increasing the attractiveness of the pilot profession.
" In these times, funding is not easy for us economically.
However, we firmly expect air traffic to recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to continue fulfilling our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel, " said Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman and CEO of DFS, at the signing of the contract.
" For DFS, the endowed professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, interdisciplinary knowledge base in the long term.
We are therefore continuing the good cooperation with the university and at the same time underpinning our attractiveness as an employer. "
This is also underlined by Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of Worms University of Applied Sciences: " The endowed professorship forms an important bridge between science and industry.
With it, we would like to build on the existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual bachelor's degree programme in Air Traffic Management. "
The trust of German air traffic control is both a motivation and an obligation for Worms University of Applied Sciences to further expand its teaching and research expertise in the future-oriented fields of air traffic.
Working for the air traffic controllers of tomorrow, the university can set very special highlights and innovative priorities for its students with the first endowed professorship for a dual course of study.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary in the Ministry of Science, Continuing Education and Culture, emphasises: " Worms University of Applied Sciences has a unique selling point in Rhineland-Palatinate with its focus on air transport.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the university's profile. "

Heil wants to test other industries after meat industry
The COVID-19 crisis brought conditions in parts of the meat industry back to light.
Stricter laws are imminent.
But are they right - and will it stay that way?
Federal Minister of Labour Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to review other sectors after the now planned strict regulations against abuses in the meat industry.
" We will look at industry by industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary, " said Heil to the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employers are already warning against restricting work contracts in general.
After the massive corona outbreak at the meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet wants to pass a law of salvation this Wednesday.
Large-scale slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to employ third-party personnel for slaughter, cutting and meat processing.
To this end, the use of contract workers and temporary workers is to be banned there.
Employer president Ingo Kramer told dpa: " Stay away from a general restriction on work contracts and temporary employment if you don't want to completely choke off the economy. "
Contracts for work and services are, for example, the imperative basis for creating added value for customers in wide areas of the trades, the construction industry and plant construction.
" The failings of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument. "
Heil assured: " My goal is not to ban contracts for work and services everywhere in the German economy. "
Contracts for work and services make sense.

Salary was withheld for protective equipment or rent.
It was also noted that the housing situation for workers was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively harsh law had already entered into force for the meat industry in 2017.
However, these were circumvented by " tricky constructions. "
" Now we have to clean up fundamentally. "
The politician announced: " The Occupational Safety and Health Act, which we want to pass in the cabinet at the end of July, also includes measures that not only affect the meat industry - for example, higher testing rates for occupational safety and health or clear criteria for communal accommodation. "
The draft presented to dpa includes amendments to the Act on the Protection of Workers' Rights in the Meat Industry and the Occupational Safety and Health Act.

Juventus Turin champions in Italy
Turin - After a redemptive goal from Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in a row.
The team around the five-time world football player made the overall 36th Scudetto of the club's history perfect with a 2: 0 (1: 0) on Sunday evening in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo scored 1: 0 before half-time.
With 83 points, Turin, which competed without the last long-injured ex-national player Sami Khedira, can no longer be displaced from first place two matchdays before the end of the Serie A season.
The runner-up Inter Mailand is seven points behind.
Juventus was harmless despite optical superiority in the first half, then Ronaldo scored after a free-kick variant with the last action.
The 35-year-old scored a pass from Miralem Pjanic from the penalty area border directly with a flat shot (45th + 7).
Against the now more offensive guests, Ronaldo was also involved in the 2: 0, after his shot, Federico Bernardeschi (67th) dusted off.
This secured the lackluster but decisive success.

Because of the defeat, the Turin team had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
Juve's reassuring lead at the top of the standings in the end was mainly due to the weakness of his competitors.
Because in the eleven games before the game on Sunday, the Sarri team had only managed five victories.
Whether Ronaldo will also be the top scorer is questionable.

Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - Despite all threatened penalties and court rulings, motorists continue to step on the gas in countless illegal races on the roads of Baden-Württemberg: Last year and the first four months of this year, the police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
There are no comparative values for the years before, but the racers are increasingly making work for the judicial authorities: At the public prosecutor's offices between Konstanz and Mannheim, a total of 155 investigations into illegal races were conducted in 2018, a year later there were already 252 and in the current year by the beginning of June already 151.
The races were less about organized events, as can be seen from the response of the Ministry of the Interior to an inquiry by the Landtag-SPD.
In most cases, the drivers competed against each other spontaneously or they had fled from the police - this is also reported as an illegal race.
At the wheel were mainly German men between the ages of 18 and 60.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases are the racers caught and also asked to pay: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines have been imposed and 15 prison sentences pronounced since 2018.
However, there are no indications that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
Rather, because of the numerous tragic accidents and trials of previous years, other drivers reacted more sensitively than before and reported more frequently, said a ministry spokesman.
Autobahn 8 is particularly popular with racers. Again and again, drivers brake the traffic there to make room for themselves and use the free track for a race.
Last August, a dozen drivers were caught near Kirchheim unter Teck, three months earlier there were even 18 drivers on the A8 near Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular " racetrack "
On the A81, the police even registered more races than on any other federal highway.
With a speed limit, an attempt is being made there to slow down the racers on the particularly affected section between Engen and Geisingen.
The mostly high-priced and pimped-up sports and luxury cars often have Swiss license plates, because the drivers move to the lawn in Germany because of the high penalties for driving too fast and car racing in the neighboring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit must not be reduced to a few routes: " With a general speed limit of 130 kilometers per hour, we would get rid of this problem on motorways, " says Martin Rivoir, the traffic expert of the SPD parliamentary group.
" The inhibition threshold for racers would be significantly higher if one were not allowed to travel legally here and there at 200 kilometres per hour and more. "
Rivoir thinks less of education or image campaigns: " Anyone who ignores all rules in such a way and puts at risk not only their own lives, but also the lives of other road users, is hardly reachable with reason. "
ADAC calls for stronger police crackdown
For the ADAC, on the other hand, this is not enough: " We assume that racers will not be deterred by the speed limits, " says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and Environment at ADAC Württemberg.
He calls for additional and also tougher controls on the affected routes.
Not infrequently, the high-speed trial of strength turns into painful and momentous seriousness: Since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people across the country have died in the races, two of them bystanders in a nightly crash in downtown Stuttgart and one in Gerlingen.
Two young men are said to have delivered a car race there in November.
One of the vehicles came off the road, crashed into a garden wall and remained lying on the side, the 18-year-old co-driver died.
21 more people were injured in the races of the past two years.
However, in the opinion of Minister of the Interior Thomas Strobl, stricter penalties are not necessary: " Legislative action to sanction illegal motor vehicle races more severely is not seen, " says the paper of the Ministry of the Interior.

The first time I was almost 10 years ago in Antarctica, where I saw my first icebergs.
I was seized with awe.
My heart was racing, dizzy as I tried to grasp what was before me.
The icebergs around me protruded almost 60 metres out of the water. And I could only marvel that this was a snowflake on another snowflake, year after year.
Icebergs are born as the calf of a glacier or by breaking out of ice floes.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They clearly interact with their surroundings and their experiences.
Some refuse to give up and cling to the bitter end, while others can no longer stand it and collapse in a fit of dramatic passion.
When you look at an iceberg, it's easy to think that they are isolated, separate and alone, just as we humans often see ourselves.
But the truth is far from that.
As an iceberg melts, I inhale its prehistoric atmosphere.
As the iceberg melts, it releases mineral-rich drinking water that feeds many life forms.
In my photographs of these icebergs, I proceed as if I were taking portraits of my ancestors, aware that in these individual moments they exist in this way, and will never exist like that again.
It is not death when they melt; it is not an end, but a continuation of their path along the life cycle.
Part of the ice in the icebergs I photograph is very young - a few thousand years old.
And part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old.
The last pictures I would like to show you show an iceberg that I photographed in Kekertsuatsiak in Greenland.

This is the average size of a Greenland iceberg.
It protrudes about 120 feet out of the water, or 40 meters.
And this video is in real-time.
(Music) And just like that, the iceberg shows you another side of its personality.
Thank you.

Nuremberg: Unauthorized tuning meeting - Police intervene, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and at times over 1000 people took part in a " tuning meeting " on Saturday night in the parking lot of a furniture store.
The police implemented their announcement to increase control over such events.
There was a big tuning meeting on Saturday evening (July 25, 2020) in the southern part of Nuremberg.

In addition, the vast majority of those present adhered to the applicable infection protection regulations, in particular compliance with the minimum distance and wearing a mouth-nose protection.
The control measures carried out on site were completed around 1: 00 am.
In total, the officials determined such structural changes to 10 vehicles that the operating permit had expired.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.

Austria: Mass tests after corona outbreak in tourist resort
Authorities have responded to a corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist resort of St. Wolfgang with hundreds of tests.
The number of confirmed cases rose to 48, according to the state authorities in Linz.
More than 100 results were still outstanding in the evening.
Accordingly, many of those infected are young interns in tourism businesses, but at least one holiday guest also tested positive.
Residents, guests and tourism staff were asked to stay in their accommodations on Saturday night.
The curfew was set at 23 o'clock.
" There are cancellations and cancellations there and there " of bookings, said the head of the Wolfgangsee tourism association, Hans Wieser, to the dpa.
Sporadic guests also left early.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist resort in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, around a third of the guests are Germans.
On Friday, the first infections became public knowledge.
The head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended on Saturday the behavior of the interns, who had celebrated in several restaurants and could have been infected there.
" We all liked doing that in our youth, " he told the radio station Ö1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The tourism board launched an information campaign to raise awareness among young employees of the dangers of COVID-19.
Starting on Saturday, hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from July 15 were contacted.
The outbreak evokes memories of the Austrian ski and party resort of Ischgl in Tyrol, which was a center of the spread of COVID-19 throughout Europe in the early stages of the pandemic.
In total, more than 1500 people in Austria are currently infected with the virus.
The focus of new infections is on Vienna and Upper Austria.

They all know that what I'm about to say is true.
The intuition that inequality weakens social cohesion existed even before the French Revolution.
What's new is that we now have evidence. We can compare societies, more equal and more unequal, and see what inequality does.
I would like to show you statistics and explain why there are connections between them.
Look, what a poor bunch we are.
(Laughter) I'd like to start with a paradox.
This shows life expectancy and gross national income - on average in rich countries.
You see that the countries on the right, Norway and the USA, for example, are twice as rich as Israel, Greece, Portugal on the left.
And that doesn't change their life expectancy at all.
There is nothing to suggest a connection.
But within societies there are enormous social disparities in health across society.
Here, again, is life expectancy.
Here are small areas in England and Wales - the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.
A big difference between the poor and the rest of us.
Even the people just below the top are in worse health than those at the very top.
So income has a very big meaning within individual societies, and none at all between them.
The explanation for this paradox is that within societies we are dealing with relative income, social position, status - where we stand in relation to each other, and how big the gaps between us are.
And when you understand this, you immediately ask yourself: What happens when the differences get bigger, or smaller, when income disparities rise or fall?
And that's what I'll show you now.
Not with hypothetical data.
Using data from the UN - the same as the World Bank uses - on the extent of income disparities in rich developed market democracies.
The measure we use because it's easy to understand and available for download is how much richer the top 20 percent are than the bottom 20 percent of any country.
You see that in the same countries on the left - Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden - the top 20 per cent are around 3 ½, 4 times as rich as the bottom 20 per cent.
But on the other hand - Britain, Portugal, the US, Singapore - the differences are twice as big.
On this scale, we are twice as unequal as some of the other successful market democracies.
Now I'll show you what that does to our societies.
We've collected data on social divide issues, the issues that are more common at the bottom of the social ladder.
Internationally comparable data on life expectancy, children's math, reading and writing skills, infant mortality and murder rates, what proportion of the population is imprisoned, teenage pregnancies, trust, obesity, mental illness - which includes drug and alcohol addiction in standard diagnostics - and social mobility.
We have summarized them in an index.
All with the same weight.
For each country, there is a kind of average of these factors.
And here you see it in relation to the degree of inequality that I have shown you, to which I will always return.
The more unequal countries do worse on all these social problems.
This is an unusually high correlation.
But if you put the same index of health and social problems in relation to GNI per capita, to gross national income, there's nothing left, no correlation.
We've worried that people think we've chosen only the issues that support our reasoning and constructed that evidence, so we've also published an essay in the British Medical Journal on the UNICEF Index of Child Welfare.
In it, 40 different ingredients were put together by other people.
The index includes whether children can talk to their parents, whether they have books at home, their immunization rates, whether there is bullying at school.
Everything flows in.
Here's the index relative to our inequality scores.
Children perform worse in unequal societies.
A highly significant ratio.
And again, when comparing the child welfare index to national per capita income, there is no correlation, not even a hint.
All the data I've shown you so far say the same thing.
The average well-being of our societies no longer depends on national incomes and economic growth.
They are crucial in poorer countries, but not in the rich developed world.
But the differences between us, where we stand in comparison to each other has become very important.
I will now show you individual parts of our index.
Here, for example, is trust.
Simply the proportion of the population that thinks you can trust most people.
The data comes from the World Values Survey.
On the more unequal side, about 15 percent of the population believe that others can be trusted.
But in the same societies, the figure is as high as 60 or 65 percent.
And for the degree of integration into communal life or social capital, there are similarly close references to inequality.
We've done all this work twice.
First with the rich, developed countries, and then in a second test field again with the 50 American states - with the same question: do the more unequal states perform worse on all these scales?
Here, according to a data collection by the US government, trust is correlated with inequality.
A very similar distribution across a similar range of confidence levels.
The same thing is happening here.
Our fundamental finding is that almost all factors that are internationally related to trust do the same in the 50 US states, in a separate testing environment.
And that's not just a happy coincidence.
Here are mental illnesses.
WHO compiled these figures by conducting the same diagnostic interviews with randomly selected subjects to compare rates of mental illness in societies.
This is the percentage of the population who were mentally ill last year.
It ranges from 8 percent to three times that - entire societies that have three times as high rates of mental illness as others.
And again, a high correlation to inequality.
And here violence.
These red dots are American states, the blue triangles are Canadian provinces.
Note the scale of differences.
It ranges from 15 murders per million to 150.
That is the proportion of the population that is in prison.
Here there is about a tenfold difference on the lateral log scale.
It ranges from about 40 to 400 imprisoned people.
This ratio is not primarily due to higher crime rates.
In some places, this is a sub-factor.
But the main reason is tougher court rulings.
And more unequal societies are also more likely to cling to the death penalty.
Here are children dropping out of school.
Again, pretty big differences.
With devastating effects in terms of using the talents of the population.
Here is social mobility.
Actually a measurement of mobility based on income.
The question is: Do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons, or is there no connection between them?
On the more unequal side, fathers' income is much more important -- in the UK, in the US.
And in the Scandinavian countries, fathers' income is far less crucial.
There is more social mobility.
We like to say - and I know many Americans are here in the audience - if Americans want to live the American Dream, they should go to Denmark.
(Laughter) (Applause) I've just introduced you to a few things.
I could have shown you a lot of other problems.
All of these problems are more common at the bottom of the social gradient.
But there are countless problems with social disparities that are worse in more unequal countries - not just a bit, but somewhere between 2 times and 10 times as common.
Imagine these costs, the human costs.
But I would like to come back to the graph again, in which we have summarized everything to show two things.
For one thing, graph by graph, it shows that the countries that do poorly, regardless of the outcome, are apparently the more unequal, and those that do better seem to be the Nordic countries and Japan.
So what we're seeing is a general social dysfunction that goes hand in hand with inequality.
This affects not just one or two things, but most.
The other very important aspect of this graph can be seen down here, Sweden and Japan - in many ways very different countries.
The position of women, how much they cling to the nuclear family, here they lie at opposite poles of the rich, developed world.
Another very important difference is how they achieve their greater equality.
In Sweden there are huge differences in earnings offset by taxation, the general welfare state, generous social benefits, etc.
It's completely different in Japan.
There are already smaller differences in earnings before the tax.
There are lower taxes.
A smaller welfare state.
And in our analysis of the American states, we find the same contrast.
Some states are successful through redistribution, others are doing well because they have small income differences before taxes.
Our conclusion is that it doesn't matter how you achieve greater equality, as long as you somehow achieve it.
I don't mean perfect equality, I'm talking about something that already exists in rich market democracies.
Another surprising part of the picture is that it is not only the poor who are affected by inequality.
Apparently there is some truth in John Donne's " No one is an island. "
In several studies, one can compare how people in more or less the same countries perform at every level of the social hierarchy.
This is just one example.
Infant mortality.
Some Swedes have kindly classified much of their infant deaths according to the British Register of Socio-Economic Classification.
This is an anachronistic classification according to the professions of the fathers, so single parents are listed separately.
But where " low social class " is noted, that means unskilled manual labor.
Then there are the skilled craft professions in the middle, then the subordinate non-craft professions, right up to the higher professions - doctors, lawyers, executives of larger companies.
You can see that Sweden is better than Britain, across the entire social hierarchy.
The biggest differences are down in society.
But even at the top, living in a more equal society seems to bring a small advantage.
We show this in five different datasets that deal with educational success and health in the US and internationally.
That generally seems to be the case - greater equality matters most at the bottom, but has some advantages even at the top.
But I should say something about what is happening.
I am interested in the psychosocial effects of inequality.
This has to do with feelings of superiority and inferiority, the feeling of being valued or devalued, respected or despised.
And, of course, the resulting feeling of status competition is driving consumerism in our society.
It also leads to status uncertainty.
We are more concerned about how we are judged by others, whether we are seen as attractive, smart, etc.
The socially judgmental judgments are increasing, and the fear of those judgments.
Interestingly, there is similar research in social psychology: some people evaluated 208 different studies in which volunteers were invited to psychological labs to measure their stress hormones and their response to stressful tasks.
What interested them in the evaluation was which types of stress most reliably raised the cortisol level, that of the central stress hormone.
And the result was: Tasks that posed a threat to social assessment - threats to self-confidence or social status where others can judge one's own performance negatively.
These types of stress have a very specific effect on the physiology of stress.
We have been criticized.
Of course, there are people who don't get this done and people who find it very amazing.
But I should tell you, if we are criticized for a targeted selection of our data, we never select specifically for our purposes.
Our absolute tenet is: if our data source has data for one of the countries we're looking at, it goes into analysis.
Our data source determines whether it is reliable data, not us.
Anything else would be bias.
What about other countries?
There are 200 studies on health relative to income and equality in academic peer-reviewed journals.
This is not limited to these countries, this is a very simple demonstration.
The same countries, the same inequality scale, one problem after another.
Why don't we check other factors?
We have shown that per capita income makes no difference.
And, of course, with more sophisticated methods, others have also reviewed poverty and education, and more.
What about causality?
A correlation does not yet prove causality.
We've spent a lot of time doing that.
In fact, people know the causal relationships very well in some of these results.
The big news in our understanding of the driving forces behind long-term health in the rich developed world is how much chronic social stress strains the immune system, the cardiovascular system.
Or, for example, the reason why violence is more prevalent in more unequal societies is because people are sensitive to being despised.
To cope with this, we need to clarify what happens after the tax and what happens before the tax.
We have to limit the income, the bonus culture income at the top.
We must hold our bosses accountable to employees as best we can.
But the message to take away is that by addressing the income gap between us, we can improve the actual quality of human life.
Suddenly there is a lever for the psychosocial well-being of entire societies, and that is very exciting.
Thank you.

Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualified for Champions League
London (dpa) - The English football record champions Manchester United are returning to the Champions League after a year of absence.
The Red Devils secured third place in the league on the last day of the Premier League thanks to a 2: 0 (0: 0) success against their direct rival Leicester City.
The Foxes must now be content with the Europa League, because FC Chelsea still passed by and also qualified for the premier class in fourth place.
In the fight against the descent, Aston Villa was allowed to cheer.
Manchester United took the lead with a penalty kick from Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in injury time, Jesse Lingard (90th + 8) scored to the final score.
Chelsea, FC Bayern's opponent in the Champions League round of 16, won thanks to Mason Mount (45th + 1) and Olivier Giroud (45th + 4) in parallel with 2: 0 (2: 0) against the Wolverhampton Wanderers.
" That means a lot to me, " said coach Frank Lampard, who in his first season as Chelsea coach is also in the FA Cup final against Arsenal.
Tottenham Hotspur also profited from Chelsea's win against Wolverhampton, who still passed the Wolves with a meagre 1: 1 (1: 0) at Crystal Palace and started sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa decided the long-distance duel with Watford FC and Bournemouth AFC for itself, but had to tremble for a long time for the league title at West Ham United.
The late lead of Jack Grealish (84th) was immediately compensated by Andrej Yarmolenko (85th).

The club, which lost three coaches in the season, is relegated after five first-league years.
Just like Bournemouth, which could no longer save itself through a 3: 1 (2: 1) at FC Everton.
In the end, one point was missing.
FC Liverpool, who have been confirmed as English champions since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3: 1 (1: 1) victory at Newcastle United.
99 points are the highest score the Reds have ever scored in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team narrowly missed the points record in English football.
Manchester City holds the record with 100 points in the 2017 / 18 season.
After the Newcastle lead in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) turned Sunday's game for Liverpool.
" It was an extraordinary season for this wonderful club, " said goalscorer van Dijk after the game, " that should spur us on to defend the title.
It will be difficult. "
The Premier League bosses should also be satisfied in the end.
Because of the coronavirus crisis, football operations in England were interrupted from 13 March to 17 June.
In the meantime, it was even discussed about a premature termination or a holding of the remaining games on neutral ground.
Eventually, however, the season could be played to the end without any special occurrences - however, as in Germany, without spectators in the stadiums.

I would like to show you today how we will manufacture things in the future.
I believe that our buildings and machines will soon assemble, duplicate and repair themselves.
I will show you what I consider to be today's production methods, and then compare them to some natural systems.
In the current manufacturing industry, we have skyscrapers - two and a half years [construction time], a half to a million parts, quite complex, new and exciting technologies made of steel, concrete, glass.
We have exciting machines taking us into space - five years [of construction], two and a half million parts.
On the other hand, if you look at natural systems, you'll find proteins that have two million types and can fold in ten microseconds, or DNA with three billion base pairs that can be copied in about an hour.
So there's all this complexity in our natural systems, but they're extremely efficient, much more efficient than anything we can make, far more complex than anything we can build.
They are much more energy efficient.
They almost never make mistakes.
And they are durable because they can repair themselves.
So there are a lot of interesting things to discover about natural systems.
And if we manage to incorporate that into our built environment, then we have an exciting potential for new ways of building.
And I believe that the key is self-assembly.
If we want to use self-assembly in our physical environment, I think there are four key factors.
The first is that we need to decipher all the complexity of the things we want to build - our buildings and machines.
And we have to translate that into simple sequences - the DNA of how our buildings work, so to speak.
Then we need programmable parts that can use this sequence and use it to fold or reconfigure.
We need activation energy so that our parts from the program can fold up.
And we need a kind of redundancy for error correction to really create what we want to build.
I'll show you some projects that my colleagues and I at MIT are working on so that self-assembly can be realized in the future.
The first two are MacroBot and DeciBot.
These projects are large-scale, reconfigurable robots - two and a half to four-meter-long proteins.
They are equipped with electromechanical devices, sensors.
You decode what you want to fold into a sequence of angles - minus 120, minus 120, 0, 0, 120, minus 120 - something like that; a sequence of angles, or rotations, and you send that sequence through the chain.
Each unit picks up its message - that is, minus 120 - it rotates accordingly, checks whether it has arrived, and forwards it to the adjacent unit.
These are the brilliant scientists, engineers and designers who worked on this project.
And I think it makes one thing really clear: Is this really scalable?
I mean, thousands of dollars, many hours of work to create this two and a half meter tall robot.
Can we really scale that up? Can we really embed robotics in every part?
The next project questions this and looks at the passive nature or the passive attempt to make reconfiguration programmable.
But it goes a step further and tries to make actual calculations possible.
It basically integrates the most fundamental component of computing, the digital logic gate, directly into the parts.
This is a NAND gate.
You have a tetrahedron, which is the gate that will do the calculations, and you have two input tetrahedrons.
One represents the input of the user while making the blocks.
The other comes from the previous component that was arranged.
And then it delivers an output in three-dimensional space.
This means that the user can enter what the components should do.
It performs calculations based on what it has done before and what the user requires of it.
And now it begins to move in three-dimensional space - up and down.
On the left, the input [1,1] corresponds to the output 0 that goes down.
On the right, the input [0,0] corresponds to the output 1 that goes up.
What that really means is that our structures now contain the plans of what we want to build.
So you have all the information about what has been built.
This means we can achieve some form of self-replication.
In this case, I call it self-directed replication because the structure contains the exact blueprints.
If errors occur, a part can be replaced.
All the local information is built in to show how to fix it.
So you could have something that climbs and reads along and delivers an output of one to one.
It is directly integrated; there are no outside instructions.
The last project I'm going to show is called Biased Chains, and it's arguably the most exciting example of self-mounting systems we have at the moment.
It takes up the ability for reconfiguration and programming and creates a completely passive system.
Basically, you have a chain of elements.
Each element is completely identical and they are polarized.
Every chain, or element, wants to turn right or left.
So while you're putting the chain together, you're basically programming it.
Each unit is told whether it should turn to the right or to the left.
When you shake the chain, it folds together into a configuration you've programmed in - in this case a spiral or, in this case, two adjacent cubes.
One can therefore basically program every possible three-dimensional form - or one-dimensional, two-dimensional - completely passively into this chain.
What does that tell us about the future?
I think it tells us that there are ways of self-assembly, replication and repair in our physical structures, our buildings and machines.
There are new ways of programming in these parts.
And this creates new opportunities for IT.
We will have spatial programming.
Imagine our buildings, bridges, machines, all our components could do calculations.
That would mean parallel and distributed computing power, new design possibilities.
So there is an exciting potential for that.
I think these projects I've shown here are just a tiny step toward that future as we implement these new technologies for a new, self-creating world.
Thank you.

Arrests and violence at demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against Prime Minister Netanyahu are becoming ever fiercer.
During the night there have been violent clashes.
The Israeli police took violent action in Jerusalem on Sunday night against participants in a demonstration against the right-wing conservative Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu.
Twelve people were arrested for participating in riots, said police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld.
Among other things, the police used water cannons to disperse the rally.
According to media reports, a total of around 6,000 people had gathered near Netanyahu's official residence on Saturday evening.
They protested unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu's handling of the COVID-19 crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew horns, and called on Netanyahu to resign.
Participants in a counter-demonstration who supported Netanyahu have also been arrested, reported the news site " ynet. "
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the head of government's private villa in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
According to the police, a man was arrested near Tel Aviv because he is suspected of having sprayed pepper spray from a moving car on demonstrators on the roadside.
Another man was arrested after a stabbing attack on a demonstrator in the south of the country.
The demonstrator was slightly injured in the neck.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv there have recently been several demonstrations against Netanyahu.
The rallies accompany the corruption trial against the head of government.
Recently, Netanyahu has also been criticized for his handling of the COVID-19 crisis.
He is accused, among other things, of hasty easing and a lack of preparation for a second wave of COVID-19.

North Korea seals off border town after suspected corona case
So far, North Korea has seen its own measures to ward off the coronavirus as a " shining success. "
The country is now reporting a suspected case for the first time.
Because of a first official suspected case of corona in the country, North Korea has completely sealed off a large city for fear of a catastrophe.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defenses in the past six months, " the malignant virus may have been introduced into the country, " state media reported.
The state of emergency has been declared for the region around the border town of Kaesong.
The Communist leadership proclaimed the highest level of alarm.
Should the suspected case be confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the isolated country.
According to its own statements, North Korea had not yet registered a single infection and described its defensive measures as a " shining success. "
The information was doubted abroad.
The disease symptoms were reportedly found in an " outlier " who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
The person fled to South Korea three years ago and has now returned across the border.
For the border crossing within the four-kilometre-wide and for the most part still mined military buffer zone, there was initially no confirmation from South Korea.
However, according to reports by the national news agency Yonhap, South Korea's military acknowledged the possibility of an illegal border crossing to North Korea as high.
Investigations were underway on some people.
According to its own statements, North Korea convened an emergency meeting of the Workers' Party Politburo chaired by leader Kim Jong Un on Saturday because of the suspected case.
The " dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive disaster. "
Kim had already ordered on Friday as a preventive measure to " completely block Kaesong and isolate every district and the region from others, " it continued.
The affected person, as well as all people in Kaesong who had been in contact with her, were put under quarantine.
The party's central military commission should therefore investigate the " runaway case " as well as the conduct of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose severe punishment.
According to estimates, around 300,000 people live in Kaesong.

Tension before Council meeting: City East and noise protection are still up for discussion before big summer break
" In addition to environmental topics, the committee members will also vote on the development plan for the large-scale project Innenstadtentwicklung-Ost, " it says rather casually in the middle section of the city's press release on the next city council meeting on Tuesday, July 28, at 4.30 pm in the Great Hall of the CongressCentrum Pforzheim.
Above all, the upgrading of the eastern city is controversially discussed right up to the end.
The majorities for this are scarce, most recently even negative in individual committees depending on attendance.
An appeal from industry (construction, real estate, trade and IT) not to let the project developed out of the citizens and then by the administration and the municipal council fail after almost ten years of preparation, criticized project opponent Reinhard Klein as an " extra-parliamentary opposition, " " clueless, " " speculation, " " defamation " and " deliberate false statements. "
" Everyone thinks they know better, " says Klein, who has been a member of the municipal council for a year as the only representative of the citizens' list in Pforzheim.
In fact, after reading the treaties, he was in this position: " I know what I'm talking about. "
The exit is said to be cheaper for the city, and contrary to statements by the city administration, the Technical Town Hall is looking for grants, the existence of which Klein is convinced will cost 8.5 million euros to renovate.
The city will develop quite differently from what is predicted in the town hall and on the part of business advocates.
Shaping the city through its own strength and not an investor: This is his plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP / FW / UB / LED parliamentary group, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
Essentially, it also envisages the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, keeping the Schloßberg open, renting the Ex-Thales for administrative areas and a smaller-scale inner-city redesign, ideally with local sponsors.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues in particular will play a central role.
Among other things, the local council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the population of Pforzheim from health-related noise pollution caused by road traffic, many of which include speed reductions.
In a press release, the local Verkehrsclub Deutschland welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, those politically responsible in the city are not innocent of the fact that this must happen, because they have only contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus noise through the neglect of regular bus services with thinned-out cycles and through little commitment to bicycle traffic, according to the VCD.
The municipal council also votes on the city's participation in the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim / Enzkreis.
The agenda also includes accession to the Climate Protection Pact of the state of Baden-Württemberg, the redetermination of parental contributions in municipal day-care centres and the application for inclusion in the federal government's smart city funding.

Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with a lot of delay
With a delay of almost half a year, Tim Zimmermann will start his debut season in the ADAC GT Masters on 31 July.
Before the league of super sports cars can start regular operation, the first test drives were now on the agenda.
For Zimmermann, it was all about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 better.
The corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from tackling his first business trip in Grasser Racing's new Lamborghini Huracan.
Under special hygienic conditions, this was now possible.
The 23-year-old from Langenargen completed his first laps at the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his debut in the GT3 car.
" There are already a few things that are different from the Porsche from the previous season, " says Zimmermann.
" With the ABS, for example, you have to go into the corners differently.
But it was really a lot of fun. "
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite being only 25 years old, the Dutchman is already experienced in GT racing and was able to help his new team-mate in many ways.
" I'm not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series also brings new challenges, " says Zimmermann.
" Steijn and I understand each other brilliantly and we have also made enormous progress from session to session at the Lausitzring. "
Exactly there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also be holding its first race.
From July 31, the 33 super sports cars will race through Lausitz.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 serial newcomers, knows the track though.
In 2015 he was most recently a guest at the Motodrom.
" It worked quickly and I didn't have much to get used to the track, " says Zimmermann, who is starting for the Graf Zeppelin racing team from Friedrichshafen.
" The Lausitzring has many fast passages that you have to hit optimally to be fast. "
How fast Zimmermann really is will be revealed in two weeks' time.
" The teams naturally play poker a little during the tests, " he says.
" Ultimately, however, we are very satisfied and are looking forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring. "
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a tightly packed calendar.
Seven races are scheduled until the beginning of November.
The current situation is that no spectators will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.

British transport minister caught off guard by quarantine decision
The decision of the British government to put Spain vacationers under quarantine for two weeks after their return has, according to press reports, caught the country's transport minister off guard.
Accordingly, Grant Shapps is currently on holiday in Spain of all places, while his colleagues at home decided on the measure on Saturday.
Due to rising corona numbers in Spain, the cabinet in London removed the country from the list of countries from which entry is possible without quarantine requirements.
The new regulation applies from today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to be quarantined after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But the rule applies to those who are just on holiday on the cut-off date, only from Saturday, August 1, and was not introduced overnight.
Incidentally, Spain is still regarded in Austria as one of the " safe countries " for which no quarantine in Austria is required.
" Many ministers may have known in advance that there is a possibility that a quarantine will be imposed on holiday-makers in Spain, " commented Labour MP Diane Abbot.
" But apparently no one bothered to let Grant Shapp know. "

Do you know how many kinds of flowering plants there are?
A quarter of a million - that is the number of known species - a quarter of a million species of flowering plants.
And flowers are real Teufelskerle.
Plants struggle to produce them.
They require an enormous amount of energy and raw materials.
Why are they making this effort?
The answer is, of course, like so much in the world: sex.
I know what you're thinking of when you look at these pictures.
And the answer to why sexual reproduction is so important -- there are many other ways for plants to reproduce.
Let's take offshoots; they can have sex with themselves, so to speak; they can pollinate themselves.
But they actually have to spread their genes to mix them with other genes so that they can occupy ecological niches.
This is how evolution works.
Plants pass on this information via pollen.
Some of you may have seen a few of these pictures before.
As I always say, everyone would have to have a scanning electron microscope at home to see them.
There are as many different types of pollen as there are flowering plants.
And that's very useful for forensics and so on.
Most of the pollen that triggers hay fever in our country comes from plants that use the wind to spread their pollen. This is a very inefficient process, which is why so much of it ends up in our noses.
Because the plants hurl out very large quantities, in the hope that the male sex cells found in the pollen will only accidentally hit another flower.
All grasses, i.e. all cereal plants and most trees, transport pollen through the wind.
But most species use insects for their purposes. And that's the smarter way, as it requires less pollen.
The insects and other species can bring the pollen directly to its destination.
We are, of course, aware of the relationship between insects and plants.
This is a symbiotic relationship. Whether flies, birds or bees, they also benefit from it, usually through the nectar.
This symbiosis has led to some wonderful adaptations - the hummingbird hawkmoth is a beautiful adaptation.
The plant benefits from the fact that the hummingbird spreads the pollen further.
Plants have developed small runways for bees that would otherwise not find their way.
On many plants are markings that resemble other insects.
These are the dust bags of a lily, a very clever construction. When an unsuspecting insect lands on it, the bags fold up and hit the insect's back, where the pollen gets stuck and taken to other plants.
This is an orchid that looks like it has a mouth, forcing the insects to crawl out and become covered with pollen.
There are at least 20,000 orchid species - an impressive variety.
And they have all sorts of tricks up their sleeve.
They need to attract pollinators to help them.
This orchid, known from the investigations of Charles Darwin, who put forward a great thesis at the sight of it. You see a very long nectar tube going down from the orchid.
And what insects have to do there in the middle of the flower - they have to put their little proboscis in there and put the whole nectar tube down to get to the nectar.
And when Darwin saw this flower, he said, " Something must have developed in parallel. "
And indeed, here is this insect.
Usually it rolls up the proboscis, but in its stretched shape it looks like this.
You can imagine that if nectar is so valuable and laborious for the plant to produce and attracts many pollinators, then it's like human sex that people start deceiving.
They say, " I have nectar, do you want to come and get it for yourself? "
This is a plant.
This is a plant that insects in South Africa simply love, and they have developed a long proboscis to get the nectar.
And this is an imitator,
a plant that copies the original.
And here is the fly with a long trunk that has not received any nectar from the imitator. Because the imitator, contrary to what the fly expected, has no nectar at all.
But the fly has not only received no nectar, it also has - if you look very closely, at the head end of the trunk you can see pollen that it would have transferred to other plants if only a botanist had not come by and glued it to blue paper.
(Laughter) Deception runs through the whole plant kingdom.
These black dots on the flower, they look to us like black dots, but to male insects of certain species, they look like two females that are very hot.
(Laughter) And when the insect lands there, it picks up pollen that takes it to more plants. If you look at the " everyone-household-should-have-one " electron microscope image, you'll see that there are certain three-dimensional patterns.
It probably not only looks good for the insect, but also feels good.
And these electron microscope images - here one of an orchid imitating an insect - show that different parts of the shape have different colors and seemingly different surfaces, and for the perception of an insect, the textures are very, very different.
This plant has developed the imitation of a shiny metallic surface, as seen on some beetles.
And under the electron microscope, you can see that this surface is very different from the one we have looked at so far.
Sometimes the whole plant imitates an insect, even in our perception.
I think it looks like a flying animal.
It's a wonderful thing.
This one is clever. It's called Obsidium.
I sometimes see it as malice.
For certain bees, it looks like another, particularly aggressive bee, so it flies there and hits its head several times to drive it away and naturally absorbs a lot of pollen.
At the same time, this plant mimics another orchid that provides a rich food supply for insects.
But this one has nothing for her.
So she cheats on two levels - fabulous.
(Laughter) Here we see the cananga tree, an ingredient in many perfumes.
I smelled one thing on someone earlier.
The flowers don't really have to be that colourful.
They send a fantastic spectrum of scents to all insects.
This one doesn't smell so good.
This is a flower that really smells very hideous and that has evolved to mimic carrion.
Therefore, flies love them.
They fly in and pollinate them.
This is a Helicodiceros, also known as a " dead horse. "
I don't know what a dead horse smells like, but the plant probably hits it quite well.
It's really terrible.
And blowflies can't hold back.
They fly in all the way back
and lay their eggs there, they think it's carrion, without realizing that there is no food for the eggs that die because of it, but the plant benefits as the fly full of pollen flies on again and pollinates the next flower - fantastic.
This is Arum maculatum, the spotted Aronstab.
I photographed him last week in Dorset.
It heats up to about 15 ° above ambient temperature - fascinating.
And when you look inside the plant, there's a kind of barrier behind the inflorescences. Flies are attracted by the heat that creates volatile chemicals, and are then trapped at the bottom of the container.
They drink the wonderful nectar and are sticky afterwards.
At night they get a pollen shower and then the bristles we saw above fall asleep, clearing the way for the mosquitoes that are full of pollen - a great thing.
If you think that's great, now comes one of my favorites.
This is the Philodendron Selloum.
If someone from Brazil is here, you will know the plant.
It's really fascinating.
This species of phallus there is about 30cm long.
And it does something that no other plant I know does when it blooms. There in the middle are the inflorescences - for about 2 days it has a metabolism very similar to that of mammals.
Instead of feeding on starch, which is the food of plants, it takes something similar to brown adipose tissue and burns it so quickly that the fat burning rate, the metabolism, is equivalent to that of a small cat.
That's twice the energy production of a hummingbird, relative to its weight - insanely impressive.
But he does something else that is unusual.
It not only heats up to 43 to 44 ° C for about 2 days, but also maintains a constant temperature.
It can regulate its temperature and thus keep it constant.
They ask themselves, " Why is he doing this? "
As you can imagine, there are some bugs that love to mate at this temperature.
And they fly in and start playing.
(Laughter) And the plant showers them with pollen, and they fly on pollinating.
What a wonderful thing.
The typical pollinator for us is an insect. But in the tropics, many birds and butterflies also pollinate.
And many tropical flowers are red and we believe this is because birds and butterflies look similar to us and therefore can see the colour red very well.
If you look at the spectrum of birds and people, we see red, green and blue so this spectrum here.
Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet, and different levels of ultraviolet.
So something that goes beyond our spectrum.
And I hear you ask, " Wouldn't it be great if we could see that too? "
Of course, we can.
So what does an insect see?
Last week I photographed this sunflower in Dorset.
As you can see, these are small yellow flowers, small yellow flowers everywhere.
And that's what they look like in visible light.
That's what it looks like when you take out the red.
Most bees don't see red.
And then I photographed with ultraviolet filters and exposed the special ultraviolet frequencies for a very, very long time and that came out.
And that's a fantastic target.
We don't know exactly what bees see, just like you don't know what I see when I say " That's red. "
We cannot look into the thoughts of insects or other people.
But the contrast will be something like that. It stands out against the background.
Here's another small flower - different bandwidth of ultraviolet frequencies, other filters similar to pollinators.
And that's what they would see.
If you now think all yellow flowers have this property - no flower was harmed for this picture; it was only attached to the tripod, not killed - but under ultraviolet light it looks like that.
And that could serve as the basis for a sunscreen, because sunscreens absorb UV light.
The substances in the plant could be helpful.
In conclusion, we have an evening primrose that Bjorn Rorslett sent me from Norway - fantastic hidden patterns.
I love the idea of hidden things.
I think there is something poetic about it. Namely, that these images were taken with UV filters, filters that are mainly used by astronomers to photograph Venus - more precisely, its nebulae.
That is the main purpose of these filters.
Venus is the goddess of love and fertility, and that, in turn, is the story of blossoms.
And flowers not only show great efforts to attract pollinators, they also manage to make us plant large fields full of them and give them to each other at births and deaths, and especially at weddings, which, when you think about it, are the moment when the exchange of genetic material from one organism to another is determined.
Thank you very much.

Greta Thunberg: Evil look against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg war in der <unk> Latenacht-Show von Stephen Colbert per Videoschalte zu Gast und <unk> im Interview, was sie bei <unk> mit Donald Trump im <unk> hat.
Klimaatkivistin Greta Thunberg war per Videoschalte zu Gast in <unk> US-Latenacht-Show.
Among other things, she talked about her fight against the powerful of the world.
The teenager also spoke about her famous " evil eye " during her encounter with Donald Trump.
New York City - In the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has drawn attention to herself with her tireless commitment to the " Fridays For Future " movement.
Now she spoke in a well-known late-night show about her plans for the future as well as her meeting with US President Donald Trump at the UN climate summit last year.
Latenight presenter Stephen Colbert greeted the 17-year-old Thunberg on Tuesday in your show and conducted a longer interview with the Swede.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the world's powerful.
" There are some things that surprised me, " she said.
" How far people are going to steer the focus away from the climate crisis, " she said.
" Everything from organised hate campaigns to threats just because a group of children are taking to the streets, " she said.
Heads of state and leading politicians who scoff at her on social media or even try to silence her find her " funny " because the reactions show her " because they have no other answer. "
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview, when Greta Thunberg was asked about a well-known scene in which she cast a bitterly evil look after US President Trump.
At the UN Climate Summit 2019 in New York, for which the activist sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive gaze was captured by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
The short clip resulted in a GIF, an animated image that ultimately became one of the most commonly used images for Trump opponents.

Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green died
His life was like a rollercoaster ride: After a rapid ascent with Fleetwood Mac, it went steeply downhill and then slowly uphill again.
Now the blues rock guitarist Peter Green has died at the age of 73.
Ingenious guitarist, drug junkie, cult fan: The co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.

Top musicians like Peter Frampton praised Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional reaction of a " monumental loss " for all past and present members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
The drummer Fleetwood and the guitarist Green had founded the now long-legendary band in London in 1967, his dreamy instrumental hit " Albatross " remains unforgotten to this day.
The musician's life (" The End Of The Game, " " In The Skies ") resembled a rollercoaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated their greatest successes but then without him.
There is said to have been a dispute, among other things, because Green wanted to donate all of the group's profits to charity.
He began to perform in wide robes and with a large crucifix.
Psychological problems are also said to have played a role.
Already three years after the foundation Green left the band in 1970.
A social decline followed.
The blues rock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographers reported.
For a long time, Green was treated in psychiatry.
During much of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the scene.

A little later he was engaged as a replacement for his idol Eric Clapton at the Bluesbreakers.
In the midst of the blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 together with his Bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song " Albatross, " composed by Green, brought the group their first number one hit in the winter of 1968 / 69 and catapulted them to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed its downsides: Green could not cope with the media hype, his experiments with the drug LSD became more and more extreme.
He later commented on life between music and addiction in an interview: " The worst thing that happened to me in life are the drugs - the best thing was to land a number 1 hit. "
Towards the end of the decade, Green surprisingly achieved a respectable success in 1979 with an album inspired by religious themes.
Fleetwood Mac meanwhile swam without him in a new formation on a wave of success.
Their 1977 album " Rumours " sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Despite various small solo successes, Green did not make a major comeback until he went new to the start in 1996 with a group of musician friends.
