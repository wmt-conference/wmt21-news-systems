Jan Christopher Horak wrote: "The film is a remarkable achievement of the director.
We are not supposed to know.
You could have known.
Please make everyone aware for a moment of a very simple fact: pretty much everything we know about the universe, we know through light.
We can stand on earth and look into the night sky and look at stars with our naked eyes.
The sun burns our peripheral vision.
We see light reflected by the moon.
and in the time that has passed since Galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope at the celestial bodies, the universe known to us has travelled to us as visible light, traversing immeasurable ages of cosmic history.
With the help of all our modern telescopes, we have been able to study all this: this impressive silent film of the universe, this series of snapshots that go back to the Big Bang.
But the universe is not a silent movie, because the universe is not silent.
I want to convince you that the universe has a soundtrack and that this soundtrack is played in space itself: because space can swing like a drum.
It can sound a kind of sound recording that can be heard throughout the universe; of some of the most dramatic events when they occurred.
Now we would like to add a sonic component to the wonderful visual arrangement we have of the universe.
And even if we have never heard the sounds of the universe before, we should slowly turn up the volume control for what is happening out there in the next few years.
Out of this ambition to capture songs of the universe, we focus our interest on black holes and their inherent promise. Black holes hammer against space-time like wooden sticks on a drum. You have a very characteristic sound that I would like to play to you; or our idea of how this song will sound.
One day we may see a shadow cast by a black hole against a bright background, but so far we have not succeeded.
And yet you can hear black holes, even if they are invisible. The reason for this is that they play on space-time like on a drum.
We owe the idea that space sounds like a drum to Albert Einstein, to whom we owe so much.
Einstein realized that if space were empty, if the universe were empty, it would have to look like this picture, just without this helpful grid.
But if we moved through space in free fall, even without this helpful grid, then perhaps we could paint it ourselves. For we would realize that we are moving along straight lines, along undistorted, straight paths through the universe.
Einstein also realized (and this is exactly what it is about) that when you bring energy or mass into the universe, it curves the universe. If a body in free fall, say, passed the sun, it would be distorted, along the natural curvature lines in space.
This is Einstein's great general theory of relativity.
Even light is bent along these paths.
And a body can be bent so strongly that it gets into an orbit around the sun, like the earth, or like the moon in the earth's orbit.
These are natural curvatures in space.
What Einstein did not know was this: if you took the sun and squeezed it into a ball six kilometres in diameter, if you took something with millions of times the mass of the earth and squeezed it into six kilometres, you would create a black hole; a body of such density that light passing too close could never escape. It would be a black shadow in front of the universe.
But Einstein considered black holes a mathematical curiosity throughout his life.
He did not believe that they really existed.
He was convinced that nature would protect us from its creation.
It would take decades before the term "black hole" was coined and people understood that black holes are astrophysical bodies. In fact, they are the lifeless state of extremely dense stars that collapse in a terrible catastrophe at the end of their lives.
Our sun, on the other hand, will not end up as a black hole.
It is simply not big enough for that.
But we did a little thought experiment, as Einstein liked to do. Imagine squeezing the sun to six kilometres in diameter and putting a tiny earth in its orbit, say 30 kilometres away from this black sun.
This earth would shine by itself (because since the sun would then have disappeared, there would be no other source of light) so we let our little earth shine by itself.
We could put the Earth in a carefree orbit about 30 km away from the crushed black hole.
This crushed black hole would be about the size of Manhattan.
It would pour a little into the Hudson before it destroyed the earth.
But that's what we're talking about.
We're talking about something you can squeeze until it's half the size of Manhattan.
Now we bring the earth very close, up to about 30 km, and see how it moves on a completely flawless orbit around the black hole.
There is a kind of myth that black holes devour everything in the universe, but in fact you have to get very close to them to fall into it.
But what is particularly impressive from our point of view is the fact that we can always see the earth.
She cannot hide behind the black hole.
The light that comes from the earth, some of it falls into it, but some is scattered and returns to us.
So you can't hide anything behind a black hole.
If this is the battle star Galactica and you are fighting against the Cylons, then you better not hide behind the black hole.
They can see it.
So our sun will not collapse into a black hole, its mass is not enough for this. But there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
If one of them wiped out the Milky Way, it would look like this.
We would see a shadow of the black hole against the backdrop of billions of stars of the Milky Way galaxy and its glowing dust tracks.
Should we fall towards this black hole, we would see all the light that would be bent around it, and we could even enter the shadows without realizing that something unusual is happening.
It would be bad if we tried to ignite our engines and escape, because we could not, any more than the light can escape.
But even if the black hole is dark from the outside, it is not dark inside, because all the light of the galaxy could come in behind us.
And although due to a phenomenon of relativity (the so-called time dilation) our clocks seemed to go slower in relation to galactic time, it would look as if the evolution of the galaxy had accelerated and was coming towards us just before we were crushed to death by the black hole.
It would be like a near-death experience when you see the light at the end of the tunnel. However, it would be a comprehensive death experience.
(Laughter) And you couldn't tell anyone about the light at the end of the tunnel.
Now we have never seen such a shadow of a black hole, but black holes can be heard, even if they are invisible.
Please imagine an astrophysically realistic situation. Imagine two black holes that have spent a long life together.
Perhaps it was once stars that collapsed into two black holes, each with a mass ten times that of the sun.
We are now squeezing them together to a diameter of 60 km.
They can rotate several hundred times per second.
At the end of their lives, they orbit each other almost at the speed of light.
You can travel thousands of kilometres in a split second. And while they do that, they not only bend the room, but they leave in their wake a sound of space, a real wave of space-time.
Space contracts and expands as it pours out of these black holes and hammers into the universe.
And they travel out into the cosmos at the speed of light.
We owe this computer simulation to a relativity working group of NASA Goddard.
It took almost 30 years for someone to solve this problem.
This was one of those groups.
Here we see two black holes circling each other, again with the helpful, painted lines.
Perhaps you can see – it's a bit indistinct – but when you see the red waves coming out, these are gravitational waves.
They actually represent the sound of sounding space and will emerge from these black holes at the speed of light as they become ever quieter and eventually merge into a spinning, silent black hole.
If you were close enough, the sound of contracting and expanding space would boom in your ears.
They would literally be able to hear the sound.
Of course, your head would also be pressed and stretched, which would be quite unpleasant, which is why you would also have trouble understanding what is happening.
But I would like to show you what sounds we would predict here.
This is from my working group – a slightly less glamorous computer model.
Imagine a lighter black hole falling into a very heavy black hole.
What you hear is the sound of the light black hole hammering into space every time it passes close by.
When it moves away again, it is a little too quiet.
But it hits like a flail and literally smashes the universe, making it swing like a drum.
We can predict what that will sound like.
We know that when it falls in, it gets faster and louder.
And finally we hear how the little guy falls into the big guy.
I've never heard it so loud – it's really much more dramatic.
At home it sounds rather disappointing.
More like ding, ding, ding.
This is another noise from my group.
No, I don't show you any pictures, because black holes don't leave any helpful traces of ink. Space has no colorful, painted lines.
But if you were floating around in space during a space holiday and you would hear this here, then you should make sure you get away.
(Laughter) You should really get away from this noise.
Both black holes are moving.
Both black holes are getting closer to each other.
In this case, they swing very strongly at first.
And then they merge.
This chirping is typical for the merging of two black holes, so that it chirps at the end.
This is our idea of what we would see.
Fortunately, we are at a safe distance here in Long Beach, California.
But it is highly likely that two black holes have merged somewhere in the universe.
And it is just as certain that space is swinging around us, having probably taken millions of light years, or travelled to us at the speed of light for a million years.
But the sound is far too quiet for us to ever hear.
Experiments are being carried out on Earth with great zeal, one of which is called LIGO – the deviations are to be detected in the way space contracts and expands again, deviations of the order of magnitude smaller than an atomic nucleus over a distance of four kilometres.
It is an incredibly ambitious project and its sensitivity will be further developed in the coming years – in order to be able to perceive this here.
There is also to be a mission for space, which will hopefully start within the next ten years. It is called LISA.
LISA will be able to see huge black holes, black holes with millions or billions of times the density of the sun.
In this image of the Hubble telescope, we see two galaxies.
They look as if they are frozen in a hug.
Each probably contains a huge black hole in its interior.
But they are not frozen. They merge with each other.
These two black holes collide and become one over the course of billions of years.
Our human ability to perceive is not capable of capturing a song of such duration.
But LISA could see the final stage of two giant black holes, at an earlier point in the history of the universe, the last 15 minutes before they merge.
And it's not just about black holes, it's also about all the big disturbances in the universe – and the biggest of all is the Big Bang.
When the term was coined, it was meant contemptuously – "Who believes in a big bang, a big bang?"
This animation by friends of mine at Proton Studios shows an exterior view of the Big Bang.
We never really want to try; we never want to be inside the universe, because you can never be outside the universe.
So imagine you are in the Big Bang.
It is everywhere, everywhere around you, and space is wobbling and swinging completely uncontrollably.
14 billion years pass, but this song still resounds around us.
Galaxies form and generations of stars are born in these galaxies. And around one of these stars, at least one, orbits a habitable planet.
And here we sit and work like crazy on these experiments, doing calculations and writing computer code.
Imagine that two black holes collided a billion years ago.
Their song has been sounding through space ever since, all the time.
We didn't even exist then.
It's getting closer and closer – 40,000 years ago we were still painting cave paintings.
If it was the big bang we were recording, it would sound like that.
It is literally the epitome of noise.
It's white noise, it's such a chaotic noise.
But it is all around us, probably anyway, if it has not been wiped out by some other process in the universe.
When we record it, it will sound like music to our ears, because it will be a quiet echo, an echo of the moment of our creation, of our visible universe.
Within the next two years we will be able to make the soundtrack a little louder and present the universe as a sound image.
But if we can grasp those earliest moments, it will bring us much closer to an understanding of the Big Bang, which in turn brings us closer to some of the most complex, hardest-to-grasp questions.
If we played a film of the universe backwards, we would know that there has been a big bang in the past and we could even perceive the cacophony of its sound. But was our Big Bang the only Big Bang?
I think we have to ask the question: has this happened before?
Will it be repeated?
I think that in the sense of the challenge that TED presents – to rekindle the amazement – we can ask questions, at least in this last minute, that might otherwise elude us forever.
But we have to ask ourselves: Is it possible that our universe is just an offshoot of a larger story?
Or is it possible that we are just an offshoot of a multiverse – each offshoot with its own big bang in its past – maybe some of them have drumming black holes, some may not – in some there may be intelligent life, in others not – not in our past, not in our future, but in some way fundamentally connected with us?
So we have to ask ourselves: If there is a multiverse, do living beings exist in another fragment of this multiverse?
These are my creatures of the multiverse.
Are there other beings in this multiverse who are thinking about us and their own origins?
And if they exist, I can imagine that they are like us, that they are calculating and writing computer codes, building instruments, trying to make out the most distant sound of their origin and wondering who is still out there.
Thank you. Thank you.

Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvesters infected
After a mass coronavirus infection on a large vegetable farm in Mamming, Lower Bavaria, almost 500 people are under quarantine and are no longer allowed to leave the farm.
A security service monitors the ban on going out.
A total of 174 harvest workers were tested positive for the Sars-CoV-2 coronavirus during the series investigation, as the Dingolfing-Landau district office announced on Saturday evening.
"In order to avoid further expansion, we unfortunately have to take this step to protect the population," explained District Administrator Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees had already become infected in the company - this was the reason for the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm, which grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and beetroot - but the cucumbers only for inlay glasses.
Mamming is a rural community with about 3300 inhabitants not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to keep calm: "According to our information, this is a closed circle of people."
On the farm, infected people were separated from non-infected employees, and the site is now surrounded by a barrier fence.

Many people believe that driving is an activity reserved only for people who can see.
A blind person driving a car safely and independently has until now been considered an impossible task.
Hello, my name is Dennis Hong, and we want to give blind people freedom and independence by building a vehicle for the blind.
Therefore, before I talk about this car for the blind, let me talk briefly about another project I worked on called the DARBA Urban Challenge.
This was about building a robotized car that can drive itself.
You press start, nobody touches anything, and it can reach its destination completely automatically.
In 2007, our team won half a million dollars by finishing third in the competition.
Around this time, the National Association of the Blind, or NFB, challenged the Investigation Committee to produce a car that could be driven safely and independently by a blind person.
We decided to try, because we thought, hey, how difficult it can be.
We already have an automatic vehicle.
We put a blind person in and it's done, isn't it?
(Laughter) We couldn't have been wrong.
What the National Association of the Blind (NFB) wanted was not a vehicle that drives blind people around, but a vehicle where a blind person can make active decisions and drive.
So we had to throw everything away and start again.
Therefore, to test this madness idea, we developed a small buggy prototype vehicle to test its feasibility.
And in the summer of 2009, we invited dozens of young blind people from all over the country and gave them the opportunity to take a spin.
It was an absolutely great experience.
But the problem with this car was that it was designed so that it could only be driven in a controlled environment, a level, traffic-free parking lot, and that even the lanes were highlighted with red guide cones.
Therefore, with this success, we decided to take the next big step, to develop a true car that can be driven in real roads.
So how does it work?
Well, it's a pretty complicated system, but let me try to explain it, and maybe I can simplify it.
Well, we have three steps.
We have perception, calculation and non-visual interfaces.
Well, it is clear that the driver cannot see, so the system must be able to perceive the environment and collect information for the driver.
For this, we use an initial measuring unit.
It measures the acceleration, the angular acceleration, like a human ear, an inner ear.
We merge the information with a GPS unit to get approximately the position of the car.
We also use two cameras to see the lanes of the road.
And we also use three laser distance measurements.
The lasers scan the surroundings to detect obstacles, a car approaching us from the front or from behind, and also any obstacles entering the road, any obstacles around the vehicle.
After that, all this enormous amount of information is forwarded to the computer, and the computer can do two things.
First, first of all, process the information to understand what the environment is like; these are lanes on the road, the obstacles, and convey this information to the driver.
The system is also smart enough to calculate the safest way to operate the car.
We can also generate instructions on how to control the vehicle.
But, the problem is this: how can we convey this information and these instructions to a person who cannot see quickly enough and fairly accurately so that they can drive?
For this, we have developed different types of non-visual user interface technology.
We started with a three-dimensional ping sound system, a vibration vest, a click wheel with voice commands, a footstrip, and even a shoe that puts pressure on the leg.
But today, we will talk about three of these non-visual user interface technologies.
Well, the first interface technology is called DriveGrip.
This is a pair of gloves, and it has its vibrating elements on the ankle side, so they can give instructions on how to control, direction and intensity.
Another device is called SpeedStrip.
These are a chair, strictly speaking, it is a massage chair.
We hollow it out, and we reorganize the vibrating elements into different patterns. And we use it to convey information about the speed, and also to convey instructions about how to use the accelerator and brake pedal.
Therefore, here you can see how the computer sees the environment. And since they cannot see the vibration, we even equip the driver with red LEDs so that he can really see what is going on.
This is the sensory data, and this data is forwarded to the devices via computer.
Therefore, these two devices, DriveGrip and SpeedGrip, are very effective.
But the problem is that they are stitch instruction devices.
Therefore, this is not a real freedom, is it?
The computer tells you how to drive , turn left, turn right, accelerate, stop.
We call it backseat driver problem.
Therefore, let's move away from the stitch instruction devices, and now focus more on the information devices.
A good example of this non-visual information interface technology is AirPix.
Think of it as a monitor for the blind.
Well, it is a small tray, it has many holes and it releases compressed air, so it can even draw pictures.
Therefore, even if they are blind, they can put their hand on it, see the lanes and the obstacles on the road.
In fact, they can also change the air frequency that escapes, and possibly the temperature.
Therefore, it is indeed a multidimensional user interface.
Well, here you can look at the left camera, the right camera seen from the vehicle, and see how the computer interprets this and sends the information to the AirPix.
For this, we show a simulator, a blind person who drives and uses the AirPix.
This simulator was also very useful for training the blind drivers and also quickly testing different types of ideas for different types of non-visual user interfaces.
Therefore, this is how it works mainly.
But this vehicle is a prototype, and it will not enter the road until it is proven that it is safe, or safer than today's vehicles.
And I really believe that this can happen.
But still, will society, would they accept such a radical idea?
How will we regulate insurance?
How will we issue driving licences?
Apart from the technological challenges, there are many types of hurdles that we have to overcome until it becomes a reality.
Of course, the main goal of this project is to make a car for a blind person.
But potentially more important than this is the tremendous benefit of spin-off technology that can be derived from this project.
The sensors that are needed can see in the dark in fog and rain.
And along with these new type of interfaces, we can use this technology and apply it in safer cars for normal-sighted people.
Or for blind people, in everyday appliances in the household, in training and in the office.
Imagine a teacher writing in a classroom on the blackboard, and a blind student can see and read what he has written using these non-visual interface technologies.
This is priceless.
Therefore, the things I have shown you today are just the beginning.
Thank you very much.

Discussing the abolition of the 50+1 rule
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended thinking about abolishing the 50+1 rule.
"German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates a fait accompli," Grindel told Bild am Sonntag.
He stressed: "For the clubs that are most likely to become dangerous for Bayern and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules do not work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, there is no getting around the debate as to whether it is not necessary to make it easier for associations that want to break into this phalanx to involve investors."
However, he has doubts whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority participation, which is prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50+1 rule.
"It remains a legal risk to draw investment fences around the business location Bundesliga in a European single market," said Grindel.
The former DFB boss sees the danger that "attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but will not lead to more excitement in the championship."
Even an equal distribution of TV money will not have a decisive effect.
"FC Bayern has a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund 500 million and RB Leipzig 300 million.
The differences are therefore already immense among the first three clubs alone.
The other 15 clubs have an average budget of 130 million," explained the 58-year-old.
Looking at the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there have been people who have noticed this mistake and pierced the press instead of talking to me about it," Grindel said of the acceptance of an expensive watch that led to his resignation in April 2019.
"That has already occupied me very much in human terms."
He had received the gift, worth around 11,000 euros, from a Ukrainian official.
"I committed a compliance violation, and it was right to draw the consequences from it," Grindel said.
"I handled the ominous watch gift completely transparently and unsuspectingly.
Many in the DFB knew about it."
He never "made a secret of the gift," assured the 58-year-old.
"This may be called naive, at least this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."

Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes defy Corona
Although the big snack was missing in the spa town, visitors and performers enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: the Rakoczy weekend without the Rakoczy festival.
But even if the big party mile in the city center was missing, the crowds and program highlights such as Saale burning, Rakoczy ball or parade, many got their money's worth with the corona-compliant alternative program.
"I think we have succeeded in spreading Rakoczy flair," says spa director Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have accepted it well.
In principle, one returns to the beginnings of the Rakoczy festival, when only the historical ones were in the focus of the festival.

"That's a pity.
The weather would have been great this year," she says.

Argentina rejects counter-offer from creditors
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economy in Buenos Aires announced on Saturday.

The debts of the second largest economy in South America are no longer sustainable under current conditions.

Professionally arrived - privately not yet
"It's going super well" - this is the conclusion Dr. Stefanie Kramer draws after her first days in the notary's office in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very quickly: In mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will succeed Lutz Feller at the Eggenfelden notary's office.
Already six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the lawyer, who holds a doctorate, started work, and normal day-to-day business has long been in full swing.
"However, I still have to arrive privately," she explains in conversation with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
Of course, the short lead time was not enough to completely relocate the center of life from Regensburg to Eggenfelden, reports the native Dingolfingerin.
She is currently looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city with her husband, who works as a judge at the regional court in Regensburg.
At least her husband was able to apply for parental leave at short notice to ensure the care of the two daughters (31⁄2 and 11⁄2 years old).
In order not to have to commute every day from Regensburg, she also has an overnight accommodation with her parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-old.
Having grown up in the neighbouring district, the town of Eggenfelden has of course long been known to her.
During visits on site with her family in recent months, she once again stated: "Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town."
She was all the more pleased that she had made the race in the selection process for the vacancy.
Her homeland of Lower Bavaria also plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career: After studying law in Passau, she completed her legal traineeship and the second state examination in Regensburg.
After several positions as a notary assessor, among others in Rehau and Hof in Upper Franconia, Babenhausen in the Lower Allgäu and Regensburg - during this time she also shouldered her doctorate in employment law - she took up her first position as a notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016, she went on parental leave, followed by the move to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken over representation services in various notarial offices.
When the position in Eggenfelden was advertised due to Lutz Feller's approaching retirement, she saw the right time for her full professional return, explains the 39-year-old.
The team of her predecessor, who will take over the vacation representation in the notarial office in the future, has completely taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer - and immediately has a praise for the team of the law firm ready: "It's going super well!"
The fact that she can rely on well-established processes here makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of the private centre of life.
She has already contacted a local institution regarding kindergarten and nursery places.
And if everything works out as desired, she hopes to be able to pursue her hobby here soon - and get to know the most beautiful jogging trails in the Rottal.

BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be filled to 20 percent at the start of the season in the event of a fan return.
"Due to the distance regulation, which must be observed, we are currently planning with 12,000 to 15,000 spectators," Borussia Dortmund's managing director Carsten Cramer told the "Tagesspiegel".
Normally, the arena in the district city holds just over 81,000 spectators at Bundesliga matches.
In the ghost games caused by the corona pandemic last season, BVB lost around four million euros per game.
Cramer, who is responsible for marketing, digitalisation and internationalisation at the BVB, hopes that, in addition to the normal spectator seats, some of the approximately 4,000 seats in the hospitality sector can also be opened up again: "It is, of course, a blow to the bank if these revenues completely disappear."
In view of the ongoing coronavirus crisis, everyone is currently "well advised to take a stable side first".
"If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people in Germany alone are in short-time work, then the need for entertainment is limited," explained Cramer.
The Dortmund marketing boss praised the BVB professionals for their partial salary waiver, which is intended to help overcome the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their salary waiver has a different effect than if we put 100 people who work in merchandising on short-time work."

Kalbitz ejection from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "fig leaf"
The expulsion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is in the view of the FDP only a "fig leaf" and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the far-right in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD," FDP domestic politician Benjamin Strasser told the dpa news agency in Berlin.
The Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD had confirmed on Saturday in Stuttgart, after several hours of hearing, the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Executive Board had decided by a majority in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD parliamentary group in the Brandenburg state parliament.
"If the AfD really wanted to consistently remove right-wing extremists from their party, officials like Björn Höcke and his supporters would have been excluded long ago," Strasser said.
"However, there is no political will for this in the AfD, because right-wing extremism is now part of the party."
CSU General Secretary Markus Blume said similarly: "The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded says nothing and does not change anything," he told "Welt am Sonntag".
"It speaks volumes how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist still has in the middle of the AfD."
Blume assumes that the AfD will end up below five percent in future elections.
"The days of the AfD in the parliaments are numbered".
Kalbitz was one of the spokesmen of the officially dissolved "wing" around the Thuringian AfD state and parliamentary group chairman Björn Höcke; the Office for the Protection of the Constitution classifies the strip as a "secured right-wing extremist effort".
In May, the AfD federal executive had kicked Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason, he stated that Kalbitz had not stated an earlier membership in the now banned right-wing extremist "Heimattreue Deutsche Jugend" (HDJ) and among the Republicans when he joined the party.
Kalbitz denies membership in the HDJ.
The chairman of the left-wing faction in the Brandenburg state parliament, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court did not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf only ate chalk.
The AfD remains a far-right party, with or without Kalbitz."
Neither the federal party nor the right wing will be weakened by this decision.
"The manoeuvre of the Meuthen troops is transparent.
They want to avoid further observation by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution and try to get through under the radar," said Walter.
"The AfD will not get rid of the spirits it called.
A throw-out does not change anything," commented the Brandenburg SPD general secretary Erik Stohn on the decision in the Kalbitz case.
"Here, the AfD regional association and the parliamentary group held to their right-wing leader until today."
The legal dispute over Kalbitz's membership in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he would now take civil action against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court.

North Sea wind farms deliver a good 21 percent more electricity
The wind power plants on the German North Sea fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid in the first six months of the year.
This is a good 21 percent more than in the same period last year, said network operator Tennet in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of North Sea electricity to the mainland and the transmission through the German electricity grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of Tennet's grid area, have fed in another 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, wind power from the North Sea and Baltic Sea comes to 13.73 TWh, compared to a good 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of total wind power in Germany, which is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms ensure higher generation capacity
In addition to the wind conditions, the increased contribution of offshore wind energy results from higher generation capacities, because new wind farms have been connected to the grid in the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea were all running at full power at the same time, they could generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatts.
It is expected to rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea by 2030.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore grid connections by then," said Tennet Managing Director Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind farms cannot exhaust their capacity even at sea, but reach around 40 percent.
The previous record day this year is January 2, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could supply almost seven million households with electricity.

Freital: Windbergfest cancelled due to corona
The Windbergfest will not take place this year.
The city of Freital has cancelled the three-day festival planned for September.
In other years, more than 30,000 people had attended this city festival.
"We really did not make this decision easy for ourselves and - aware of how difficult it is economically for the participants - hoped until the last minute," explained Lord Mayor Uwe Rumberg (non-partisan).
"But ultimately, as the organizer, we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people."
If tens of thousands had flocked to the festival grounds and into the marquee, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact tracing could not have been complied with in accordance with the current coronavirus protection regulation.
Or the restrictions would have been so severe that not much would have remained of a folk festival.
In addition, the organisational and monitoring effort would increase disproportionately.
Rumberg put off for next year.
Then the city of Freital will celebrate its 100th anniversary with the Winterbergfest from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the Day of the Saxons from 10 to 12 September 2021.

More air traffic controllers in Worms in the future
Worms University continues to take to the skies: "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" endows a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and will start in 2021.
The professorship enables students to start their studies not only in the summer semester, but also in the winter semester.
This means that twice as many students can be trained as before.
At the same time, capacities at both the university and the DFS air traffic control academy are being utilised evenly.
DFS will advise the university on the establishment and appointment of the professorship.
Represented at the university since 2019
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students have been in the Air Traffic Management course as part of their training as air traffic controllers at Worms University of Applied Sciences.
Nine students have already started this year.
So far, the experience of DFS has been very positive, and the students' achievements are excellent.
The combination of study and pilot training makes a significant contribution to further increasing the attractiveness of the pilot profession.
"In these times, funding is not easy for us economically.
However, we firmly expect air traffic to recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to continue fulfilling our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel," says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, CEO of DFS, at the signing of the contract.
"For DFS, the endowed professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, interdisciplinary knowledge base in the long term.
We are therefore continuing our good cooperation with the university and at the same time underlining our attractiveness as an employer."
This is also underlined by Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of the Worms University of Applied Sciences: "The endowed professorship forms an important bridge between science and industry.
With it, we would like to build on the existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual bachelor's degree programme in Air Traffic Management."
The trust of German air traffic control is both a motivation and an obligation for Worms University of Applied Sciences to further expand its teaching and research competence in the future fields of aviation.
Working for the air traffic controllers of tomorrow, the university can set very special highlights and innovative focal points for its students with the first endowed professorship for a dual course of study.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary at the Ministry of Science, Continuing Education and Culture, emphasises: "With its focus on air transport, Worms University of Applied Sciences has a unique selling point in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the university's profile."

Heil wants to test other industries after meat industry
The coronavirus crisis brought conditions in parts of the meat industry to light again.
Legislative tightening is imminent.
But are they right - and will it continue?
According to the now planned strict regulations against abuses in the meat industry, Federal Minister of Labour Hubertus Heil (SPD) also wants to examine other sectors.
"We will look at industry by industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary," Heil told the German Press Agency in Berlin.

Large slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to use external personnel for slaughter, cutting and meat processing.
For this purpose, the use of contract workers and temporary workers is to be prohibited there.
Employer president Ingo Kramer told the dpa: "Finger away from a general restriction of work contracts and temporary employment, if one does not want to completely strangle the economy".
Work contracts, for example, are mandatory for large areas of the trade, the construction industry and plant construction as the basis for their added value at the customer.
"The failures of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument."
Heil assured: "My goal is not to ban work contracts everywhere in the German economy."
Work contracts make sense.

The German meat industry considers a ban on work contracts and temporary work to be unconstitutional in its industry alone.

Heil said that a relatively sharp law had already come into force for the meat industry in 2017.
However, these were bypassed by "tricky constructions".
"Now we have to clean up fundamentally."
The politician announced: "The Occupational Safety and Health Act, which we want to adopt in the cabinet at the end of July, also includes measures that do not only affect the meat industry - for example, higher inspection rates for occupational safety and health or clear criteria for shared accommodation."
The draft presented by dpa includes amendments to the Act on the Protection of Workers' Rights in the Meat Industry and the Occupational Safety and Health Act.

Juventus Turin champions in Italy
Turin - After a redeeming goal from Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in a row.
The team around the five-time world footballer made the 36th Scudetto in the club's history perfect with a 2:0 (1:0) on Sunday evening in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo scored 1-0 before half-time.
With 83 points, Turin, which competed without the recently injured former international Sami Khedira, can no longer be displaced from first place two days before the end of the Serie A season.
Second-placed Inter Milan is seven points behind.
Juventus were harmless despite optical superiority in the first half, then Ronaldo scored after a free-kick variant with the last action.
The 35-year-old used a shot from Miralem Pjanic directly from the penalty area with a flat shot (45.+7).
Against the now more offensive guests Ronaldo was also involved in the 2:0, after his shot Federico Bernardeschi (67th) dusted off.

Whether Ronaldo will also be the top scorer is questionable.

Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - Despite all the threatened penalties and court rulings, drivers continue to throttle in countless illegal races on the streets of Baden-Württemberg: Last year and the first four months of this year, the police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
There are no comparable figures for the previous years, but the speeders are increasingly making the judicial authorities work: In 2018, a total of 155 investigations were conducted at the public prosecutor's offices between Konstanz and Mannheim for illegal races, one year later there were already 252 and 151 in the current year until the beginning of June.
The races were less about organised events, as can be seen from the response of the Ministry of the Interior to a request from the state parliament SPD.
In most cases, the drivers spontaneously competed against each other or they took flight from the police - this is also reported as an illegal race.
At the wheel were mainly German men between the ages of 18 and 60.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases are the racers caught and also asked to pay: According to the Interior Ministry, a total of 113 fines have been imposed since 2018 and 15 prison sentences have been issued.
However, there is no evidence that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
Rather, other drivers reacted more sensitively than before because of the numerous tragic accidents and processes of past years and reported more frequently, said a ministry spokesman.
The motorway 8 is particularly popular with speeders, where drivers repeatedly slow down traffic in order to make room for themselves and use the free track for a race.
Last August, a dozen riders were caught near Kirchheim unter Teck, three months earlier there were even 18 riders on the A8 near Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular "race track"
The police even register more races on the A81 than on any other motorway.
With a speed limit, there is an attempt to slow down the speeders on the particularly affected section between Engen and Geisingen.
The mostly high-priced and pimped-up sports and luxury cars often have Swiss license plates, because the drivers switch to the lawn in Germany because of the high penalties for driving too fast and racing in the neighboring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit must not be reduced to a few routes: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometres per hour, we would get rid of this problem on motorways," says Martin Rivoir, the transport expert of the SPD parliamentary group.
"The inhibition threshold for racers would be significantly higher if you were not allowed to travel legally here and there with 200 kilometers per hour and more."
Rivoir thinks less of enlightenment or image campaigns: "Those who defy all rules in this way and risk not only their own lives, but also the lives of other road users, can hardly be reached with reason."
ADAC calls for stronger police crackdown
However, this is not enough for the ADAC: "We assume that speeders will not be deterred by the speed limits," says Holger Bach, head of the transport and environment department at ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and also tougher controls on the affected routes.
Since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people have died in the races nationwide, two of them uninvolved in a night-time crash in Stuttgart's city centre and one in Gerlingen.
Two young men are said to have competed in a car race there in November.
One of the vehicles came off the road, crashed into a garden wall and remained on the side, the 18-year-old passenger died.
21 more people were injured in the races of the past two years.
In the opinion of Interior Minister Thomas Strobl, however, tougher penalties are not necessary: "Legislative action to sanction illegal motor vehicle races more severely is not seen," says the paper of the Interior Ministry.

Nuremberg: Unauthorised tuning meeting - police intervene, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and at times over 1000 people took part in a "tuning meeting" in the parking lot of a furniture store on Saturday night.
The police implemented their announcement to increase control of such events.
A big tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (25 July 2020) in Nuremberg's Südstadt district.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the Mittelfranken police, the Nuremberg traffic police found an increased number of vehicles in the area of a large parking lot on Ingolstädter Straße at around 10.30 p.m.
The police then carried out a large number of vehicle checks.
Only recently, the police had announced that they wanted to take increased action against so-called autoposers.
Illegal tuning meeting in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the "scene"
According to the police, the officers numbered around 700 vehicles and about 1100 people at the top.
However, only a small part of those present can be attributed to the "autoposer" and tuning scene.
Apparently, most of the relevant scene complied with the police's appeal.
Based on the vehicles and people on site, it can be assumed that these were mainly onlookers.
In addition, the majority of those present complied with the applicable infection protection regulations, in particular the observance of the minimum distance and the wearing of a mouth-nose protection.
The control measures carried out on site were completed around 1:00 a.m.
In total, the officials found such structural changes in 10 vehicles that the operating license had expired.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.

Employment Agency figures: 900 suspected cases of short-time work abuse
Berlin - According to its own statement, the Federal Employment Agency (BA) is investigating around 900 suspected cases of abuse of short-time workers' allowances.
"This is extremely low for more than 880,000 companies that have reported short-time work," Daniel Terzenbach, the Executive Board member responsible for operations, told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
When many companies suddenly applied for short-time work at the beginning of the corona crisis, the BA had to react quickly.
The exam usually takes up to three weeks.
"We didn't have that much time in this hot phase.

We are not naive and have a long breath."
Evidence of abuse often comes from the affected employees or trade unions.
In addition, the BA uses analysis software to identify abuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible wave of insolvency in the autumn.
"Will there be significantly more insolvencies than in the previous year?
The assessments differ, but we are preparing ourselves for the case and are already training our employees in the employment agencies to process applications for insolvency money."
The figures are still inconspicuous, said Terzenbach.

Austria: Mass testing after coronavirus outbreak in tourist resort
Authorities have responded to a coronavirus outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist resort of St. Wolfgang with hundreds of tests.
The number of confirmed cases rose to 48, according to the state authorities in Linz.
More than 100 results were still pending in the evening.
According to this, many of the infected are young interns in tourism companies, but at least one holiday guest has also tested positive.
Residents, guests and tourism staff were asked to stay in their accommodation on Saturday evening.
The curfew was set at 11 p.m.
"There are cancellations and cancellations there and there" of bookings, said the head of the tourism association Wolfgangsee, Hans Wieser, the dpa.
Some guests also left early.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist resort in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, around a third of the guests are Germans.
On Friday, the first infections had become public knowledge.
The head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended on Saturday the behaviour of the interns, who had celebrated in several restaurants and could have become infected there.
"We all enjoyed doing that in our youth," he told radio station Ö1.

The tourism association launched an information campaign to raise awareness among young employees about the dangers of COVID-19.
From Saturday, hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from 15 July were contacted.
The outbreak brings back memories of the Austrian ski and party resort of Ischgl in Tyrol, which was a centre of coronavirus spread throughout Europe in the early stages of the pandemic.

They all know that what I am about to say is true.
The intuition that inequality weakens social cohesion existed even before the French Revolution.
What is new is that we now have evidence. We can compare societies, more equal and more unequal, and see what causes inequality.
I would like to show you statistics and explain why there are connections between them.
Look what a poor bunch we are.
(Laughter) I want to start with a paradox.
This shows life expectancy and gross national income – on average in rich countries.
You can see that the countries on the right, Norway and the USA, for example, are twice as rich as Israel, Greece and Portugal on the left.
And that doesn't change their life expectancy.
It does not speak for a connection.
But within societies, there are enormous social disparities in health across society.
Here, once again, life expectancy.
Here are small areas in England and Wales – the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.
A big difference between the poor and the rest of us.
Even people just below the top are worse off in terms of health than those at the top.
So income has a very great importance within individual societies, and none at all between them.
The explanation for this paradox is that within societies we are dealing with a relative income, the social position, the status – where we are in relation to each other, and how large the distances between us are.
And when you understand this, you immediately ask yourself: What happens when the differences become larger, or smaller, when income differences increase or decrease?
And I'll show you that now.
Not with hypothetical data.
With data from the UN – the same that the World Bank uses – on the extent of income disparities in rich developed market democracies.
The measure we use because it is easy to understand and available for download is how much richer the top 20 percent are than the bottom 20 percent of each country.
You can see that in the same countries on the left – Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden – the top 20 percent are around 31⁄2, 4 times as rich as the bottom 20 percent.
But on the other hand – the UK, Portugal, the US, Singapore – the differences are twice as great.
On this scale, we are twice as unequal as some of the other successful market democracies.
Now I'll show you what that does to our societies.
We have collected data on problems with social disparities, the problems that are more prevalent at the bottom of the social ladder.
Internationally comparable data on life expectancy, children's math, reading and writing skills, child mortality and murder rates, what proportion of the population is imprisoned, teenage pregnancies, trust, obesity, mental illnesses – which include drug and alcohol addiction in standard diagnostics – and social mobility.
We have summarized them in an index.
All with the same weight.
For each country there is a kind of average value of these factors.
And here they see it in relation to the degree of inequality that I have shown you, to which I will come back again and again.
The more unequal countries are doing worse in all these social problems.
This is an unusually high correlation.
But if you put the same index of health and social problems in relation to GNI per capita, to gross national income, there is nothing left, no correlation.
We have been concerned that people think we have only chosen the problems that support our reasoning and constructed these evidences, so we have also published an essay in the British Medical Journal on the UNICEF Index of Child Welfare.
In it, 40 different components were put together by other people.
The index includes whether children can talk to their parents, whether they have books at home, their immunization rates, whether there is bullying at school.
Everything flows in.
Here is the index relative to our inequality scores.
Children perform worse in unequal societies.
A highly significant ratio.
Again, when you compare the child welfare index with the national per capita income, there is no correlation, not even a hint.
All the data I have shown you so far say the same.
The average well-being of our societies no longer depends on national income and economic growth.
They are crucial in poorer countries, but not in the rich developed world.
But the differences between us, where we stand in comparison to each other has become very important.
I will now show you individual parts of our index.
Here, for example, is trust.
Simply the proportion of the population who believe that most people can be trusted.
The data comes from the World Values Survey.
On the more unequal side, about 15 percent of the population believe that others can be trusted.
But in the same societies it is up to 60 or 65 percent.
And for the degree of integration into communal life or social capital, there are similarly close references to inequality.
We did all this work twice.
First with the rich, developed countries, and then in a second test field again with the 50 American states – with the same question: do the more unequal states perform worse on all these scales?
Here, according to a data collection by the US government, trust is related to inequality.
A very similar distribution over a similar range of degrees of trust.
The same thing is happening here.
Our basic result is that almost all factors related to trust internationally do the same in the 50 US states, in a separate test environment.
And this is not just a happy coincidence.
Here are mental illnesses.
WHO produced these figures by conducting the same diagnostic interviews with randomly selected test subjects in order to compare the rates of mental illness in societies.
This is the percentage of the population who were mentally ill last year.
It ranges from 8 percent to three times that – entire societies that have three times as high rates of mental illness as others.
And again a high correlation to inequality.
And here violence.
These red dots are American states, the blue triangles are Canadian provinces.
Note the scale of differences.
It ranges from 15 murders per million to 150.
This is the proportion of the population in prison.
Here there is about a tenfold difference on the lateral log scale.
It ranges from about 40 to 400 people detained.
This ratio is not primarily due to higher crime rates.
In some places, this is a partial factor.
But the main reason is harsher court rulings.
And more unequal societies are also more likely to adhere to the death penalty.
Here are children dropping out of school.
Again quite big differences.
With devastating consequences for the benefit of the population's talents.
Here is social mobility.
Actually, a measurement of mobility based on income.
The question is: Do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons, or is there no connection between them?
On the more unequal side, fathers' income is much more important -- in the UK, in the US.
And in the Scandinavian countries, the income of fathers is much less decisive.
There is more social mobility.
We like to say – and I know that many Americans are here in the audience – that if Americans want to live the American dream, they should go to Denmark.
(Laughter) (Applause) I have only presented a few things to you now.
I could have shown you a lot of other problems.
All these problems are more common at the lower end of the social gradient.
But there are countless problems with social disparities that are worse in more unequal countries – not just a little, but somewhere between 2 times and 10 times as common.
Imagine these costs, the human costs.
But I would like to come back to the graph in which we have summarized everything to show two things.
On the one hand, graph after graph shows that the countries that perform poorly, regardless of the outcome, are apparently the more unequal, and those that are better off seem to be the Nordic countries and Japan.
So what we are seeing is a general social dysfunction that goes hand in hand with inequality.
This affects not just one or two things, but most of them.
The other very important aspect of this graph is seen here below, Sweden and Japan – in many ways very different countries.
The position of women, how much they hold on to the nuclear family, here they are at opposite poles of the rich, developed world.
Another very important difference is how they achieve their greater equality.
In Sweden, there are huge differences in earnings that are offset by taxation, the general welfare state, generous social benefits, etc.
This is completely different in Japan.
There are smaller differences in earnings even before the tax.
There are lower taxes.
A smaller welfare state.
And in our analysis of the American states we find the same contrast.
Some states are successful through redistribution, others are doing well because they have small income differences before tax.
Our conclusion is that it does not matter how you achieve greater equality as long as you somehow achieve it.
I do not mean perfect equality, I am talking about something that already exists in rich market democracies.
Another surprising part of the picture is that it is not only the poor who are affected by inequality.
Apparently there is some truth in John Donne's "No one is an island."
In several studies, one can compare how people in more or less the same countries perform at every level of the social hierarchy.
This is just one example.
Child mortality.
Some Swedes have kindly classified a large part of their child deaths according to the British Register of Socio-Economic Classification.
This is an anachronistic classification according to the professions of the fathers, so single parents are managed separately.
But where "low social class" is noted, this means unskilled craft activities.
Then there are the skilled craft occupations in the middle, then the subordinate non-craft occupations, up to the higher occupations – doctors, lawyers, executives of larger companies.
You can see that Sweden is better than the UK, across the whole social hierarchy.
The biggest differences are down in society.
But even at the top, it seems to bring a small advantage to live in a more equal society.
We show this with five different data sets dealing with educational success and health in the USA and internationally.
This seems to be the case in general – greater equality matters most at the lower end, but has some advantages even at the top.
But I should say something about what is happening.
I am concerned with the psychosocial effects of inequality.
This has to do with feelings of superiority and inferiority, the feeling of being valued or devalued, respected or despised.
And, of course, the sense of status competition that results from this drives consumerism in our society.
It also leads to status uncertainty.
We are more concerned about how we are judged by others, whether we are seen as attractive, smart, etc.
The social judgments are increasing, and the fear of these judgments.
Interestingly, there is similar research in social psychology: some people have evaluated 208 different studies in which volunteers were invited to psychological labs to measure their stress hormones and their response to stressful tasks.
What interested her in the evaluation was which types of stress most reliably raised the cortisol level, that of the central stress hormone.
And the result was: tasks that threatened social assessment – threats to self-confidence or social status, in which others can judge their own performance negatively.
These types of stress have a very specific effect on the physiology of stress.
We have been criticised.
Of course there are people who don't like this and people who find it very amazing.
However, I should tell you that when we are criticised for a targeted selection of our data, we never specifically select for our purposes.
Our absolute principle is: if our data source has data for one of the countries we are looking at, they come into the analysis.
Our data source determines whether it is reliable data, not us.
Anything else would be bias.
What about other countries?
There are 200 studies on health in relation to income and equality in academic peer-reviewed journals.
This is not limited to these countries, this is a very simple demonstration.
The same countries, the same inequality scale, one problem after another.
Why don't we check other factors?
We have shown that per capita income makes no difference.
And, of course, others have used more sophisticated methods to check poverty and education, and others.
What about causality?
A correlation does not yet prove causality.
We spent a lot of time with that.
In fact, people know the causal references very well in some of these results.
The big news in our understanding of the driving forces for long-term health in the rich developed world is how much chronic social stress strains the immune system, the cardiovascular system.
Or, for example, the reason why violence is more prevalent in more unequal societies is because people are sensitive to being despised.
To deal with this, we need to clarify what happens after the tax and what happens before the tax.
We need to limit the income, the bonus culture income at the top.
We have to hold our bosses accountable to the employees as best we can.
But the message to take away is that we can improve the actual quality of human life by eliminating the income gap between us.
Suddenly there is a lever for the psychosocial well-being of entire societies, and that is very exciting.
Thank you.

Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualified for Champions League
London (dpa) - English football record champions Manchester United return to the Champions League after a one-year absence.
The Red Devils secured third place in the table on the final day of the Premier League by beating direct rivals Leicester City 2-0 (0-0).
The Foxes now have to settle for the Europa League, because Chelsea FC still passed and qualified for the premier class in fourth place.
Aston Villa was allowed to cheer in the fight against relegation.
Manchester United took the lead with a penalty kick from Bruno Fernandes (71 minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in injury time, Jesse Lingard (90.+8) reached the final score.
Chelsea, opponents of FC Bayern in the Champions League eighth final, won 2-0 (2-0) against Wolverhampton Wanderers thanks to Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4).
"That means a lot to me," said coach Frank Lampard, who is also in the FA Cup final against Arsenal in his first season as Chelsea coach.
Chelsea's victory against Wolverhampton also benefited Tottenham Hotspur, who went past the Wolves with a meagre 1-1 (1-0) at Crystal Palace to start sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa won the long-distance duel with Watford and AFC Bournemouth, but had to tremble at West Ham United for a long time.
The late lead of Jack Grealish (84th) immediately compensated Andrej Jarmolenko (85th).
But the 1:1 (0:0) was enough, because Watford lost 2:3 (1:3) at Arsenal.
The club, which had three coaches in the season, is relegated after five first division years.
Just like Bournemouth, who could not save themselves by a 3:1 (2:1) at Everton.
In the end, one point was missing.
Liverpool, who have been English champions since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3-1 (1-1) win at Newcastle United.
99 points is the highest score the Reds have ever scored in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team narrowly missed the points record in English football.
Manchester City holds the record with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After the Newcastle lead in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) turned the game on Sunday for Liverpool.

I would like to show you today how we will produce things in the future.
I believe that our buildings and machines will soon assemble, multiply and repair themselves.
I will show you what I think of today's production methods and then compare them with some natural systems.
In the current manufacturing industry, we have skyscrapers – two and a half years [construction time], half to a million parts, quite complex, new and exciting technologies made of steel, concrete, glass.
We have exciting machines that take us into space – five years [construction time], two and a half million parts.
On the other hand, if you look at natural systems, you will find proteins that have two million types and can fold in ten microseconds, or DNA with three billion base pairs that can be copied in about an hour.
So there is all this complexity in our natural systems, but they are extremely efficient, much more efficient than anything we can produce, far more complex than anything we can build.
They are much more energy efficient.
They almost never make mistakes.
And they are durable because they can repair themselves.
So there are many interesting things to discover in natural systems.
And if we manage to incorporate this into our built environment, then we have an exciting potential for new construction methods.
And I believe that the key is self-assembly.
If we want to use self-assembly in our physical environment, I think there are four key factors.
The first is that we have to decipher all the complexity of the things we want to build – our buildings and machines.
And we have to translate that into simple sequences – the DNA of how our buildings work.
Then we need programmable parts that can use this sequence for folding or reconfiguring.
We need activation energy so that our parts can fold up from the program.
And we need a kind of redundancy for error correction, so that what we want to build is really created.
I will show you some projects that my colleagues and I are working on at MIT so that self-assembly can be realized in the future.
The first two are MacroBot and DeciBot.
These projects are large-scale, reconfigurable robots – two and a half to four metres long proteins.
They are equipped with electromechanical devices, sensors.
You decode what you want to fold into a sequence of angles – minus 120, minus 120, 0, 0, 120, minus 120 – something like that; a sequence of angles, or turns, and you send that sequence through the chain.
Each unit picks up its message – i.e. minus 120 – it rotates accordingly, checks whether it has arrived, and forwards it to the neighbouring unit.
These are the brilliant scientists, engineers and designers who worked on this project.
And I think it makes one thing really clear: Is this really scalable?
I mean, thousands of dollars, many hours of work to create this two and a half meter high robot.
Can we really scale it up? Can we really embed robotics in every part?
The next project questions this and considers the passive nature or the passive attempt to make reconfiguration programmable.
But it goes a step further and tries to make actual calculations possible.
It basically integrates the most fundamental component of IT, the digital logic gate, directly into the parts.
This is a NAND gate.
You have a tetrahedron, which is the gate that will do the calculations, and you have two input tetrahedrons.
One is the input of the user while creating the blocks.
The other comes from the previous component that was arranged.
And then it delivers an output in three-dimensional space.
This means that the user can enter what the components should do.
It performs calculations based on what it has done before and what the user requires of it.
And now it begins to move in three-dimensional space – up and down.
On the left side, the input [1,1] corresponds to the output 0 that goes down.
On the right side, the input [0,0] corresponds to the output 1, which goes up.
What this really means is that our structures now contain the plans of what we want to build.
So they have all the information about what has been built.
This means we can achieve some form of self-replication.
In this case, I call it self-directed replication, because the structure contains the exact blueprints.
If errors occur, you can replace a part.
All the local information is integrated to show how to fix it.
So you could have something that climbs along and reads and delivers an output from one to one.
It is directly integrated; there are no external instructions.
The last project I'm going to show is called Biased Chains, and it's probably the most exciting example of self-assembling systems we have at the moment.
It takes up the ability to reconfigure and program and creates a completely passive system.
Basically, you have a chain of elements.
Each element is completely identical and they are polarized.
Each chain, or each element, wants to turn to the right or to the left.
So while you're putting the chain together, you're basically programming it.
Each unit is told whether to turn to the right or to the left.
When you shake the chain, it folds into a configuration that you have programmed – in this case a spiral or in this case two adjacent cubes.
Basically, any three-dimensional form – or one-dimensional, two-dimensional – can be programmed completely passively into this chain.
What does this tell us about the future?
I think it tells us that there are possibilities of self-assembly, replication and repair in our physical structures, our buildings and machines.
There are new possibilities for programming in these parts.
And this opens up new possibilities for IT.
We will have spatial programming.
Imagine that our buildings, bridges, machines, all our components could perform calculations.
This would mean parallel and distributed computing power, new design possibilities.
So there is an exciting potential for this.
I think that these projects that I have shown here are only a tiny step towards this future if we implement these new technologies for a new, self-creating world.
Thank you.

Arrests and violence at demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against Prime Minister Netanyahu are becoming increasingly violent.
During the night there were violent clashes.
On the night of Sunday, the Israeli police violently cracked down on participants in a demonstration against the right-wing conservative Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem.
Twelve people were arrested for participating in riots, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said.
Among other things, the police used water cannons to break up the rally.
According to media reports, around 6,000 people had gathered near Netanyahu's official residence on Saturday evening.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu's handling of the corona crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew horns and called on Netanyahu to resign.
Participants in a counter-demonstration supporting Netanyahu were also detained, the news website "ynet" reported.
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the head of government's private villa in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
According to police, a man was arrested near Tel Aviv on suspicion of spraying pepper spray from a moving car onto demonstrators on the side of the road.
Another man was arrested after a stabbing attack on a protester in the south of the country.
The demonstrator was slightly injured in the neck.
There have recently been several demonstrations against Netanyahu in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
The rallies accompany the corruption trial against the head of government.
Most recently, Netanyahu has also been criticized for his handling of the coronavirus crisis.
Among other things, he is accused of hasty relaxations and a lack of preparation for a second wave of coronavirus.

North Korea seals off border town after suspected coronavirus case
North Korea has so far seen a "shining success" in its own measures to ward off the coronavirus.
The country is now reporting a suspected case for the first time.
Due to a first official suspected coronavirus case in the country, North Korea has completely sealed off a major city for fear of disaster.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defenses in the past six months, "the malignant virus may have been introduced into the country," the state media reported.
A state of emergency has been declared for the region around the border town of Kaesong.
The Communist leadership declared the highest level of alert.
If the suspected case is confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the isolated country.
North Korea has not registered a single infection and described its defensive measures as a "shining success".
The information was doubted abroad.
The disease symptoms were reportedly detected in an "outlier" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
The person left for South Korea three years ago and has now returned across the border.
There was initially no confirmation from South Korea for crossing the border within the four-kilometre-wide and largely still mined military buffer zone.
However, according to reports by the national news agency Yonhap, South Korea's military acknowledged the possibility of an illegal border crossing into North Korea as high.
Investigations were carried out on a number of people.
According to its own statements, North Korea called an emergency meeting of the Politburo of the Workers' Party, chaired by leader Kim Jong Un, on Saturday because of the suspected case.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive catastrophe."
Kim had already ordered on Friday as a preventive measure to "completely block Kaesong and isolate every district and the region from others," it continued.
The person concerned and all the people in Kaesong who had been in contact with him were quarantined.
The central military commission of the party should therefore investigate the "outlier case" as well as the behaviour of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose severe punishment.
It is estimated that about 300,000 people live in Kaesong.

Excitement ahead of Council meeting: City East and noise protection are still under discussion before a big summer break
"In addition to environmental issues, the committee members will also vote, among other things, on the development plan for the large-scale project Innenstadtentwicklung-Ost," it says rather casually in the middle section of the city press release for the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, 28 July, at 4.30 p.m. in the Great Hall of the CongressCentrum Pforzheim.
Above all, the upgrading of the eastern city is discussed controversially until the end.
The majorities in favour are narrow, most recently even negative in individual committees depending on attendance.
After almost ten years of preparation, project opponent Reinhard Klein criticised an appeal from business (construction, real estate, trade and IT) not to let the project, which was developed out of the citizenry and then by the administration and municipal council, fail now as "extra-parliamentary opposition", "clueless", "speculation", "vilification" and "deliberate false statements".
"Everyone thinks they know better," says Klein, who has been a member of the municipal council for a year as the only representative of the Pforzheim citizens' list.
In fact, after reading the contracts, he was in this position: "I know what I'm talking about."
The exit is cheaper for the city, the technical town hall is contrary to statements of the city administration after grants, of whose existence Klein is convinced to renovate for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop completely differently than predicted in the town hall and on the part of the advocates from the economy.
One day after Klein, the FDP/FW/UB/LED faction, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It essentially also provides for the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, the opening of the Schloßberg, the renting of the ex-Thales for administrative areas and a more small-scale city centre redesign, ideally with local carriers.
Environmental issues play a central role
Environmental issues will also play a central role.
Among other things, the local council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the population of Pforzheim from noise pollution caused by road traffic, including many speed reductions.
In a press release, the local transport club Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of the fact that this must happen, because they have only contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus noise by neglecting the regular bus traffic with thinned cycles and by little commitment to cycling.
The municipal council also votes on the participation of the city of the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
In addition, the agenda includes accession to the climate protection pact of the state of Baden-Württemberg, the redefinition of parental contributions in the city's childcare facilities and the application for admission to the federal government's Smart City funding.

Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with a lot of delay
Tim Zimmermann will start his premiere season in the ADAC GT Masters on 31 July with a delay of almost half a year.
Before the league of super sports cars can start regular operation, the first test drives were scheduled.
For Zimmermann, it was all about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 better.
The corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from embarking on his first business trip in Grasser Racing's new Lamborghini Huracan.
This was now possible under special hygiene conditions.
The 23-year-old Langenargener made his first laps at the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his premiere in the GT3 car.
"There are already a few things that are different from the Porsche from the previous season," says Zimmermann.
"With the ABS, for example, you have to go into the corners differently.
But it was really a lot of fun."
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite being only 25 years old, the Dutchman is already experienced in GT racing and has been able to help his new team-mate in many things.
"I'm not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series also brings new challenges," says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I understand each other brilliantly and we have also made enormous progress from session to session at the Lausitzring."
Right there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also hold its first race.
From 31 July, the 33 super sports cars will race through Lusatia.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 serial newcomers, knows the track.
In 2015, he was a guest at the Motodrom.
"It worked quickly and I didn't have to get used to the track," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafen racing community Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has many fast passages that you have to hit optimally to be fast."
It turns out in two weeks how fast Zimmermann really is.
"Of course, the teams play a little poker during the tests," he says.
"Finally, however, we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring."
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a tightly packed calendar.
Seven races are scheduled until the beginning of November.
The current state is that no spectators will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.

British Transport Minister caught cold by quarantine decision
The British government's decision to quarantine Spanish holidaymakers for two weeks after their return has caught the country's transport minister cold, according to press reports.
Grant Shapps is currently on holiday in Spain, of all places, while his colleagues at home decided on the measure on Saturday.
Due to the rising coronavirus numbers in Spain, the cabinet in London removed the country from the list of countries from which entry is possible without quarantine requirements.
The new regulation will apply from today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to quarantine after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures on returnees.
However, the scheme does not apply to those who are currently on holiday until Saturday, 1 August, and has not been introduced overnight.
Incidentally, Spain is still considered one of the "safe countries" in Austria for which no quarantine is required.
"Many ministers may have known in advance that there is a possibility of a quarantine being imposed on holidaymakers in Spain," commented Labour MP Diane Abbot.
"But apparently nobody bothered to tell Grant Shapps."

Do you know how many species of flowering plants there are?
A quarter of a million – that is the number of known species – a quarter of a million species of flowering plants.
And flowers are real devils.
Plants have great difficulty producing them.
They require an enormous amount of energy and raw materials.
Why are they making this effort?
The answer to this, of course, as to so much in the world: sex.
I know what you are thinking when you look at these pictures.
And the answer to why sexual reproduction is so important -- there are many other ways for plants to reproduce.
Take offshoots; they can have sex with themselves, so to speak; they can pollinate themselves.
But they actually have to spread their genes to mix them with other genes so that they can occupy ecological niches.
This is how evolution works.
Plants pass on this information about pollen.
Some of you may have seen some of these images before.
As I always say, everyone would have to have a scanning electron microscope at home to see them.
There are as many different types of pollen as there are flowering plants.
And this is very useful for forensics and so on.
Most of the pollen that causes hay fever comes from plants that use the wind to spread their pollen. This is a very inefficient process, which is why so much of it ends up in our noses.
Because the plants throw out very large quantities, in the hope that the male sex cells, which are in the pollen, meet another flower only by chance.
All grasses, i.e. all cereal plants and most trees transport pollen through the wind.
However, most species use insects for their purposes. And this is the smarter way, because less pollen is needed.
The insects and other species can bring the pollen directly to its destination.
We are, of course, aware of the relationship between insects and plants.
This is a symbiotic relationship. Whether flies, birds or bees, they also benefit from it, usually through the nectar.
This symbiosis has led to some wonderful adjustments - the hummingbird warmer is a beautiful adjustment.
The plant benefits from the fact that the hummingbird spreads the pollen.
Plants have developed small runways for bees that would otherwise not find their way.
On many plants are markings that resemble other insects.
These are the dust bags of a lily, a very clever construction. When an unsuspecting insect lands on her, the bags fold up and hit the insect on the back, where the pollen gets stuck and taken to other plants.
This is an orchid that looks like it has a mouth. The insects are forced to crawl out and are covered by pollen.
There are at least 20,000 species of orchids - an impressive variety.
And they have all kinds of tricks in store.
They need to attract pollinators to help them.
This orchid, known from the investigations of Charles Darwin, who made a great thesis at its sight. You see a very long nectar tube coming down from the orchid.
And what insects have to do there in the middle of the flower - they have to put their little suction cup in there and down the whole nectar tube to get to the nectar.
And when Darwin saw this flower, he said, "Something must have developed in parallel."
And indeed, here is this insect.
Usually it rolls up the trunk, but in its stretched form it looks like this.
You can imagine that if nectar is so valuable and elaborate for the plant to produce and attracts many pollinators, then it is like human sex that people begin to deceive.
They say, "I have nectar, do you want to come and get it?"
This is a plant.
This is a plant that insects in South Africa simply love. And they have developed a long suction cup to get to the nectar.
And this is an imitator,
a plant that copies the original.
And here is the fly with a long trunk that has not received any nectar from the imitator. Because the imitator, unlike the fly expects, has no nectar at all.
But not only did the fly not get any nectar, it also has - if you look closely, at the head of the trunk you see pollen that would have transferred it to other plants, if only a botanist had not come by and glued it on blue paper.
(Laughter) Deception runs through the whole plant kingdom.
These black dots on he flower, they look to us like black dots, but for male insects of certain species they look like two females that are very hot.
(Laughter) And when the insect lands there, it picks up pollen, which brings it to further plants. If you look at the "every-household-should-have-one" electron microscope image, you will see that there are certain three-dimensional patterns.
It probably not only looks good for the insect, but also feels good.
And these electron microscope images - here one of an orchid imitating an insect - show that different parts of the shape have different colors and seemingly different surfaces, and for the perception of an insect, the textures are very, very different.
This plant has developed the imitation of a shiny metallic surface, as seen on some bugs.
And under the electron microscope you can see that this surface is completely different from the one we have been looking at so far.
Sometimes the whole plant imitates an insect, even in our perception.
I think it looks like a flying animal.
It's a wonderful thing.
This one is clever. It is called Obsidium.
I sometimes regard them as insidious.
For certain bees, it looks like another, particularly aggressive bee, so it flies and hits it several times on the head to drive it away and of course absorbs a lot of pollen.
At the same time, this plant imitates another orchid, which has a rich supply of food for insects.
But this one has nothing for her.
So she cheats on two levels - fabulous.
(Laughter) Here we see the cananga tree, an ingredient of many perfumes.
I smelled one on someone earlier.
The flowers actually don't have to be so colorful.
They send a fantastic spectrum of fragrances to all insects.
This one doesn't smell so good.
This is a flower that really smells very hideous and that has evolved to imitate carrion.
Therefore, flies love them.
They fly in and pollinate them.
This is a Helicodiceros, also known as a "dead horse".
I don't know what a dead horse smells like, but the plant probably hits it quite well.
It's really terrible.
And blowflies cannot hold back.
They fly in all the way to the back
and lay their eggs there, they think it is carrion, without realizing that there is no food for the eggs, which therefore die, but the plant benefits from it, as the fly full of pollen flies on again and pollinates the next flower - fantastic.
This is Arum maculatum, the Spotted Aron Staff.
I photographed him in Dorset last week.
It heats up to about 15° above ambient temperature - fascinating.
And if you look into the plant, there is a kind of barrier behind the inflorescences. Flies are attracted to the heat that creates volatile chemicals and are then trapped at the bottom of the container.
They drink the wonderful nectar and are sticky afterwards.
At night they get a pollen shower and then the bristles, which we have seen above, slacken and give way to the mosquitoes, which are full of pollen - great thing.
If you think this is great, now comes one of my favorites.
This is the Philodendron Selloum.
If someone from Brazil is here, you will know the plant.
It is really fascinating.
This type of phallus there is about 30cm long.
And he does something that no other plant I know does, when he blooms. There in the middle are the inflorescences - for about 2 days it has a metabolism very similar to that of mammals.
Instead of feeding on starch, which is the food of plants, it takes something similar to brown adipose tissue and burns it so quickly that the fat burning rate, the metabolism, corresponds to that of a small cat.
This is twice the energy production of a hummingbird, in relation to its weight - incredibly impressive.
But he is still doing something that is unusual.
It not only heats up to 43 to 44 °C for about 2 days, but also maintains a constant temperature.
It can regulate its temperature and thus keep it constant.
They ask themselves, "Why is he doing this?"
As you can imagine, there are some bugs that love to mate at this temperature.
And they fly in and get going.
(Laughter) And the plant covers them with pollen, and they fly on and pollinate.
What a wonderful thing.
The typical pollinator for us is an insect. But in the tropics, many birds and butterflies also pollinate.
And many tropical flowers are red and we believe this is because birds and butterflies look similar to us and therefore can see the color red very well.
If you look at the spectrum of birds and people, we see red, green and blue so this spectrum here.
Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet and different levels of ultraviolet.
So something that goes beyond our spectrum.
And I hear you ask, "Wouldn't it be great if we could see that too?"
Of course we can.
So what does an insect see?
Last week I photographed this sunflower in Dorset.
As you can see, these are small yellow flowers, small yellow flowers everywhere.
And this is how they look in visible light.
This is what it looks like when you take it out in red.
Most bees do not see red.
And then I photographed with ultraviolet filters and exposed the special ultraviolet frequencies for a very, very long time and that came out of it.
And this is a fantastic target.
We don't know exactly what bees see, just like you don't know what I see when I say "This is red".
We cannot look into the thoughts of insects or other people.
But the contrast will be something like that. It stands out against the background.
Here is another small flower - different range of ultraviolet frequencies, other filters similar to pollinators.
And that's what they would see.
If you think now all yellow flowers have this property - no flower was damaged for this picture; it was only attached to the tripod, not killed - but under ultraviolet light it looks like this.
And this could serve as the basis of a sunscreen, because sunscreens absorb UV light.
The substances in the plant could be helpful.
Finally, we have a evening primrose that Bjorn Rorslett sent me from Norway - fantastic hidden patterns.
I love the idea of hidden things.
I think there is something poetic in it. Namely, that these images were taken with UV filters, filters that are mainly used by astronomers to photograph Venus - more precisely its nebulae.
This is the main purpose of these filters.
Venus is the goddess of love and fertility, and that in turn is the story of the flowers.
And flowers not only show great efforts to attract pollinators, they also make it possible for us to plant large fields full of them and give them to each other at births and deaths, and especially at weddings, which, if you think about it, are the moment when the exchange of genetic material is determined from one organism to another.
Thank you.

Greta Thunberg: Evil look against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest on Stephen Colbert's well-known late night show and revealed in an interview what she had in mind when she met Donald Trump.
Climate activist Greta Thunberg was a guest on a popular US latenight show via video.
Among other things, she talked about her struggle against the powerful of the world.
The teenager also talked about her famous "evil eye" when she met Donald Trump.
New York City - Over the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has attracted attention with her tireless commitment to the "Fridays For Future" movement.
Now she spoke on a well-known late-night show about her plans for the future and her meeting with US President Donald Trump at the UN climate summit last year.
Latenight host Stephen Colbert welcomed 17-year-old Thunberg to your show on Tuesday and conducted a lengthy interview with the Swede.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the world's powerful.
"There are some things that surprised me," she said.
"How far people go to steer the focus away from the climate crisis," she said.

It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was approached about a well-known scene in which she cast a bitter look after US President Trump.
At the 2019 UN climate summit in New York, for which the actor sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive gaze was caught by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
The short clip resulted in a GIF, i.e. an animated image, which ultimately became one of the most frequently used images for Trump opponents.

To Stephen Colbert's relatively open question, she answered only briefly and dryly: "To be honest, I don't think that needs any further explanation."
The experienced satirist Colbert had probably not expected the quick-witted answer and briefly disappeared from the picture, laughing.
With her "How dare you?" speech on the principles of climate protection, she was remembered by many at the climate conference.
