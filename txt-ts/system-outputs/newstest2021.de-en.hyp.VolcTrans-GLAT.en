P. 381 Jan Christopher Horak wrote: “The film is a remarkable achievement by the director.
We're not supposed to know.
You should have known.
Please all be aware of a very simple fact for a moment: pretty much everything we know about the universe we know through light.
We can stand on earth and look at the night sky and look at stars with our naked eyes.
The sun burns our peripheral vision.
We see light reflecting off the moon.
and in the time that has passed since Galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope at the heavenly bodies, the known universe has traveled to us as visible light and has passed through immeasurable ages of cosmic history.
With the help of all our modern telescopes, we have been able to study it all: this impressive silent film of the universe, this series of snapshots that go back to the Big Bang.
But the universe is not a silent film because the universe is not silent.
I would like to convince you that the universe has a soundtrack and that this soundtrack is played in space itself: Because space can vibrate like a drum.
It can sound a kind of sound recording that can be heard throughout the universe; of some of the most dramatic events when they happened.
Now we would like to add a sonic component to the wonderful visual arrangement we have of the universe.
And even if we've never heard the sounds of the universe before, over the next few years we should slowly turn up the volume control for what's going on out there.
Out of this ambition to capture songs from the universe, we turn our interest to black holes and their inherent promise. Black holes hammer against space-time like wooden mallets on a drum. They have a very characteristic sound that I would like to play for you; or our idea of what this song will sound like.
One day we might see a shadow cast by a black hole against a light background, but we haven't managed to do that until now.
And yet you can hear black holes, even if they are invisible. The reason for this is that they play on spacetime like a drum.
We owe the idea that space sounds like a drum to Albert Einstein, to whom we owe so much.
Einstein realized that if space were empty, if the universe were empty, it would have to look like this picture, just without this helpful grid.
But if we were moving through space in free fall, even without this helpful grid, then maybe we could paint it ourselves. Because we would recognize that we are moving along straight lines, along undistorted, straight paths through the universe.
Einstein also realized (and that's what it's all about) that when you bring energy or mass into the universe, it bends the universe. If a body in free fall came, shall we say, past the sun, it would be distorted along the natural lines of curvature in space.
This is Einstein's great general theory of relativity.
Even light is diffracted along these paths.
And a body can flex so much that it goes into orbit around the sun, like the earth, or like the moon in orbit.
These are natural curvatures in space.
What Einstein didn't know was that if you took the sun and compressed it into a ball six kilometers in diameter, if you took something a million times the mass of the earth and compressed it six kilometers, you'd create a black hole; a body so dense that light passing too close could never escape. It would be a black shadow in front of the universe.
But Einstein thought black holes were a mathematical curiosity all his life.
He didn't believe that they really existed.
He was convinced that nature would protect us from its creation.
It would be decades before the term "black hole" was coined and people understood that black holes are astrophysical bodies. In fact, they are the lifeless state of extremely dense stars that collapse in a horrific catastrophe at the end of their life.
Our sun, on the other hand, will not end up as a black hole.
It's just not big enough for that.
But we did a little thought experiment, just like Einstein liked to do. Let us imagine that we compress the sun to six kilometers in diameter and put a tiny earth into orbit, say 30 kilometers away from this black sun.
This earth would shine by itself, (because since the sun would then have disappeared, there would be no other light source) so we let our little earth shine by itself.
We could put the earth in a carefree orbit about 30 km away from the crushed black hole.
That squashed black hole would be about the size of Manhattan.
It would spill a little more into the Hudson before it destroyed the earth.
But that's roughly what we're talking about.
We're talking about something that can be squeezed together until it's half the size of Manhattan.
Now we bring the earth very close, up to about 30 km, and see how it moves in a perfectly perfect orbit around the black hole.
There's kind of a myth that black holes devour everything in the universe, but in fact, you have to get very close to them to fall in.
But what is particularly impressive from our point of view is the fact that we can always see the earth.
She cannot hide behind the black hole.
The light that comes from the earth some of it falls in, but some is scattered and comes back to us.
So you can't hide anything behind a black hole.
If this is the battlestar Galactica and you are fighting the Cylons, then you better not hide behind the black hole.
You can see them.
So our sun will not collapse into a black hole, its mass is insufficient for this. But there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
If either of these wiped out the Milky Way, it would look like this.
We would see a shadow of the black hole against the backdrop of billions of stars in the Milky Way Galaxy and their glowing dust lanes.
Should we fall towards this black hole, we would see all the light bending around it, and we could even step into the shadows without realizing anything unusual was happening.
It would be bad if we tried to fire our engines and flee, because we couldn't, any more than the light can escape.
But even if the black hole is dark on the outside, it is not dark inside, because all the light in the galaxy could fall behind us.
And although, due to a phenomenon of the theory of relativity (the so-called time dilation), our clocks seemed to go slower in relation to galactic time, it would appear as if the evolution of the galaxy had accelerated and shot at us just before we left black Hole would be crushed to death.
It would be like a near-death experience seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. However, it would be a comprehensive death experience.
(Laughter) And you couldn't tell anyone about the light at the end of the tunnel.
We have never seen such a shadow of a black hole before, but black holes can be heard even if they are invisible.
Please imagine an astrophysically realistic situation. Imagine two black holes that have lived a long life together.
Maybe once there were stars that collapsed into two black holes, each with a mass ten times that of the sun.
We are now squeezing them together to a diameter of 60 km.
They can spin hundreds of times per second.
At the end of their life, they orbit each other almost at the speed of light.
You can cover thousands of kilometers in a split second. And as they do that, not only do they bend space, but they leave a sound of space in their wake, a real wave of spacetime.
Space is contracting and expanding as it pours out of these black holes and pounds the universe.
And they travel out into the cosmos at the speed of light.
We owe this computer simulation to a relativity working group at NASA Goddard.
It took almost 30 years for anyone to solve this problem.
This was one of those groups.
Here we see two black holes orbiting each other, again with the helpful painted lines.
Maybe you can see - it's a bit fuzzy - but when you see the red waves coming out, they are gravitational waves.
They actually represent the sound of resounding space and will emerge from these black holes at the speed of light as they become quieter and quieter and eventually merge into a spinning, silent black hole.
If you were close enough, the sound of space contracting and expanding would be booming in your ears.
You would literally be able to hear the sound.
Of course, your head would also be pressed and stretched, which would be quite uncomfortable, which is why you would have trouble understanding what was happening.
But I would like to show you what sounds we would forecast here.
This is from my workgroup - a slightly less glamorous computer model.
Imagine that a lighter black hole falls into a very heavy black hole.
What you hear is the sound of the light black hole pounding on space every time it gets close.
When it moves away again, it's a little too quiet.
But it hits like a mallet and literally smashes the universe, making it vibrate like a drum.
We can predict what that will sound like.
We know: if it falls in, it gets faster and louder.
And finally we hear the little guy fall into the big guy.
I've never heard it so loud - it's actually a lot more dramatic.
It sounds a bit disappointing at home.
More like thing, thing, thing.
This is another sound from my group.
No, I won't show you any pictures because black holes do not leave helpful ink marks. Space has no colored, painted lines.
But if you were floating in space on a space vacation and you were to hear this, then get away with it.
(Laughter) You really should get away from that sound.
Both black holes are moving.
Both black holes are getting closer to each other.
In this case, they vibrate very strongly at first.
And then they merge.
This chirp is typical of the merging of two black holes that it ends up chirping.
This is our idea of what we would see.
Fortunately, we're at a safe distance here in Long Beach, California.
But it is very likely that two black holes have merged somewhere in the universe.
And it is just as certain that space vibrates around us, having probably taken millions of light years, or traveled a million years to us at the speed of light.
But the sound is far too soft for us to ever hear.
Experiments are being carried out with great enthusiasm on Earth, one of which is called LIGO - the aim is to detect deviations in the manner in which space contracts and expands again, deviations on the order of magnitude smaller than an atomic nucleus over a distance of four kilometers.
It is an incredibly ambitious project and its sensitivity will be developed even further in the next few years - in order to be able to perceive this here.
There is also said to be a mission for space that will hopefully start within the next ten years. Her name is Lisa.
LISA will be able to see huge black holes, black holes that are billions or billions of times the density of the sun.
In this picture from the Hubble Telescope, we see two galaxies.
They look like they're frozen in an embrace.
Each one probably has a huge black hole inside.
But they are not frozen. They merge with each other.
These two black holes collide and become one over billions of years.
Our human perception is incapable of grasping a song of such length of time.
But LISA could see the final stages of two giant black holes, earlier in the history of the universe, the last 15 minutes before they merge.
And it's not just about black holes, it's about all the major disruptions in the universe - and the biggest of them all is the Big Bang.
When the term was coined, it was meant contemptuously - "Who believes in a big bang?"
This animation made by friends of mine at Proton Studios shows an exterior view of the Big Bang.
We never really want to try; we never want to be inside the universe because one can never be outside the universe.
So imagine that you are in the Big Bang.
It's everywhere, all around you, and space wobbles and vibrates completely out of control.
14 billion years go by, but this song still rings around us.
Galaxies form and generations of stars are born in these galaxies. And around one of these stars, at least one, a habitable planet orbits.
And here we sit and work like crazy on these experiments, doing calculations and writing computer code.
Imagine that a billion years ago two black holes collided.
Her song has been sounding through space ever since, all the time.
We didn't even exist then.
It's getting closer and closer - 40,000 years ago we painted cave pictures.
If it's the Big Bang we're recording, that's how it would sound.
It is literally the epitome of noise.
It's white noise, it's such a chaotic sound.
But it is all around us, at least likely if it was not wiped out by some other process in the universe.
When we record it, it will sound like music to our ears because it will be a faint echo, an echo of the moment of our creation, of our visible universe.
So within the next two years we will be able to turn up the soundtrack a little louder and output the universe as a sound image.
But if we can capture those very earliest moments, it will bring us much closer to an understanding of the Big Bang, which in turn brings us closer to some of the most complex, elusive questions.
If we played a movie of the universe backwards, we would know that there was a big bang in the past and we could even hear the cacophony of its sound. But was our big bang the only big bang?
I think we need to ask the question: has something like this happened before?
Will it repeat itself?
In the sense of the challenge that TED presents - to rekindle amazement - I think we can ask questions, at least at this last minute, that might otherwise elude us forever.
But we have to ask ourselves: is it possible that our universe is just an offshoot of a larger story?
Or is it possible that we are just an offshoot of a multiverse - each offshoot with its own big bang in its past - maybe some of them have drum-playing black holes, others maybe not - some may have intelligent life, some don't - not in our past, not in our future, but fundamentally connected to us in some way?
So we have to ask ourselves: If there is a multiverse, do living things exist in another fragment of that multiverse?
These are my multiverse creatures.
Are there other living beings in this multiverse who worry about us and their own origins?
And if they exist, I can imagine that they are like us, that they do arithmetic and write computer codes, build instruments, try to make out the farthest noise of their origins and wonder who else is out there.
Thanks. Thanks.

After a Corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in Mamming, Lower Bavaria, almost 500 people are under quarantine and are no longer allowed to leave the farm.
A security service monitors the ban on going out.

Many people believe that driving a car is an activity reserved only for people who can see.
A blind person who drives a car safely and independently has heretofore been considered an impossible task.
Hello, my name is Dennis Hong and we want to give blind people freedom and independence by building a vehicle for the blind.
So before I talk about this car for the blind, let me briefly talk about another project I've worked on called the DARBA Urban Challenge.
This was about building a robotized car that can drive itself.
You press start, nobody touches anything, and it can reach its goal completely automatically.
In 2007 our team won half a million dollars by finishing third in the competition.
Around this time, the National Association of the Blind, or NFB, urged the Investigation Committee to create a car that a blind person could drive safely and independently.
We decided to give it a try because we thought, hey how difficult it can be.
We already have an automatic vehicle.
We put a blind person in and it's done, right?
(Laughter) We couldn't have been wrong anymore.
What the National Association of the Blind (NFB) wanted was not a vehicle that drives blind people around, but a vehicle where a blind person can make active decisions and drive.
So we had to throw everything away and start over.
So, to test this crazy idea, we developed a small buggy prototype vehicle to test its feasibility.
And in the summer of 2009, we invited dozens of young blind people from all over the country and gave them the opportunity to go for a spin.
It was an absolutely great experience.
But the problem with these cars was that it was designed so that it could only be driven in a controlled environment, a level, traffic-free parking lot, and that even the lanes were highlighted with red traffic cones.
Therefore, with this success, we decided to take the next big step, to develop a real car that can be driven on real roads.
So how does it work?
Well, it's a pretty complicated system, but let me try to explain and maybe I can simplify it.
Well we have three steps.
We have perception, computation and non-visual interfaces.
Well, it is clear that the driver cannot see, so the system must be able to perceive the environment and collect information for the driver.
For this, we use an initial unit of measurement.
It measures the acceleration, the angular acceleration, like a human ear, an inner ear.
We merge the information with a GPS unit to get the approximate position of the car.
We also use two cameras to see the lanes of the road.
And we also use three laser distance measurements.
The lasers scan the environment to detect obstacles, a car coming from the front or back, and any obstacles that get onto the road, any obstacles around the vehicle.
Then all this enormous amount of information is fed into the computer, and the computer can do two things.
First, first of all, process the information to understand what the environment is like; these are lanes on the road, the obstacles, and this information is conveyed to the driver.
The system is also smart enough to calculate the safest way to operate the car.
We can also generate instructions on how to operate the controls of the vehicle.
But the problem is this: how can we get this information and instructions to a person who cannot see fast enough and fairly accurately so that they can drive?
To do this, we have developed several types of non-visual user interface technology.
We started with a three-dimensional ping sound system, a vibrating vest, a click wheel with voice commands, a foot strap, and even a shoe that puts pressure on the leg.
But today, we're going to talk about three of these non-visual user interface technologies.
Well, the first interface technology is called DriveGrip.
This is a pair of gloves, and it has its vibrating elements on the ankle side, so they can give instructions on how to steer, direction and intensity.
Another device is called a SpeedStrip.
This is a chair, in fact, it is a massage chair.
We hollow it out and we reorganize the vibrating elements into different patterns. And we press them to give information about the speed, and also to give instructions on how to use the accelerator and brake pedals.
Therefore, here you can see how the computer sees the environment. And since they can't see the vibration, we even equip the driver with red LEDs so that they can really see what's going on.
These are the sensory data and these data are passed on to the devices via computers.
Therefore, these two devices, DriveGrip and SpeedGrip, are very effective.
But the problem is, they are stitch instruction devices.
So this isn't a real freedom, is it?
The computer tells you how to drive, turn left, turn right, accelerate, stop.
We call it the backseat driver problem.
So let's move away from the stitch instruction devices and concentrate more on the information devices.
A good example of this non-visual information interface technology is AirPix.
Think of it as a monitor for the blind.
Well it's a small tablet, it has a lot of holes and it releases compressed air so it can even draw pictures.
Therefore, even if you are blind, you can put your hand on it and see the lanes and the obstacles on the road.
In fact, they can also change the frequency of air that escapes and possibly the temperature.
Therefore, it is indeed a multidimensional user interface.
Well, here you can look at the left camera, the right camera from the vehicle, and see how the computer interprets this and sends the information to the AirPix.
For this, we show a simulator, a blind person who drives and uses the AirPix.
This simulator was also very useful for training blind drivers and also very useful in testing different kinds of ideas for different types of non-visual user interfaces.
Hence, this is mainly how it works.
But this vehicle is a prototype, and it won't go on the road until proven to be safe, or safer than today's vehicles.
And I really believe that this can happen.
But still, will society, would they accept such a radical idea?
How are we going to arrange insurance?
How will we issue driver's licenses?
Aside from the technological challenges, there are many types of hurdles that we must overcome before it becomes a reality.
Of course, the main goal of this project is to make a car for a blind person.
But potentially more important than this is the tremendous use of spin-off technology that can be derived from these projects.
The sensors that are needed can see in the dark in fog and rain.
And along with this new type of interface, we can use this technology and apply it in safer cars for normal sighted people.
Or for blind people, in everyday devices in the household, in training and in the office.
Imagine a teacher writing on the blackboard in a classroom and a blind student being able to see and read what he has written using these non-visual interface technologies.
That’s priceless.
So, the things I showed you today are just the beginning.
Many thanks.

Discuss abolition of the 50 + 1 rule
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended that we consider the abolition of the 50 + 1 rule.
"German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates a fait accompli", Grindel told the "Bild am Sonntag."
He stressed: "For the clubs that are most likely to be dangerous to Bavaria and Dortmund, the 50 + 1 rules do not work anyway: See Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, one cannot avoid the debate as to whether it is not necessary to make it easier for associations that want to break into this phalanx to involve investors. "
However, he has doubts as to whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority shareholdings, which are prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50 + 1 rule.
"It remains a legal risk to pull investment fences around the Bundesliga as a business location in a European internal market", said Grindel.
The former DFB boss sees the danger that "the attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will ultimately only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but will not lead to more excitement in the championship."

Looking at the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there have been people who have noticed this mistake and pierced the press instead of addressing me about it", said Grindel about the acceptance of an expensive watch that led to his resignation in April 2019.
"That has preoccupied me humanly."
He had received the gift worth around 11,000 euros from a Ukrainian official.
"I committed a compliance violation, and it was right to draw the conclusions from it", said Grindel.
I handled the ominous watch gift completely transparently and unsuspectingly.
Many people in the DFB knew about it.
He never "made a secret of the gift", assured the 58-year-old.
"This may be called naive, but this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."

Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes defy Corona
Although the big show in the spa town was missing, visitors and performers enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: The Rakoczy weekend without Rakoczy festival.
But even if the big party mile in the city center was missing, the crowds and program highlights such as Saale burns, Rakoczy ball or parade, many got their money's worth with the Corona-compliant alternative program.
"I think we have succeeded in spreading the Rakoczy flair", says spa director Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have accepted it well.
In principle, one returns to the beginnings of the Rakoczy festival, when the historical ones alone were the focus of the festival.

The couple have made themselves comfortable at the Luitpold Casino, watching the historical ones stroll and listening to the Cuban live music at the casino restaurant.

Arrived professionally - not yet in private
"It's going super well" - this is the conclusion drawn by Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first days at the notary's office in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very quickly: In mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will succeed Lutz Feller at the Eggenfelden notary office.
Six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the lawyer with a doctorate in law started work, and normal day-to-day business has long been in full swing.
"However, I still have to arrive", she explains in conversation with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
Of course, the short lead time was not enough to relocate the centre of life from Regensburg completely to Eggenfelden, reports the native Dingolfinger.
Currently, she and her husband, who works as a judge at the district court in Regensburg, are looking for a suitable apartment or a house in the city.
At least her husband was able to apply for parental leave at short notice in order to ensure the care of the two daughters (3 1⁄2 and 1 1⁄2 years old).
In order not to have to commute every day from Regensburg, she also has an overnight stay with her parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-old.
Growing up in the neighbouring district, the city of Eggenfelden has of course been known to her for a long time.
During visits on site with her family in recent months, she noticed again: "Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town."
She was all the more pleased that she made the race in the selection process for the vacancy.
Her native Lower Bavaria also plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career: After studying law in Passau, she completed her legal traineeship and the 2nd state examination in Regensburg.
After several positions as a notary assessor, among others in Rehau and Hof in Upper Franconia, Babenhausen in the Lower Allgäu and Regensburg - during this time she also "incidentally" shouldered her doctorate in employment law - she took up her first position as a notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016 she went on parental leave, followed by the move to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken over representative services in various notary offices.
When the position in Eggenfelden was advertised due to the approaching retirement of Lutz Feller, she saw the right time for full career re-entry, explains the 39-year-old.
The team of her predecessor, who will take over the holiday representation at the notary's office in the future, has completely taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer - and immediately has praise for the firm's team: "It's going super well!"
The fact that she can rely on well-rehearsed processes makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of the private centre of life.
When it comes to kindergarten and nursery places, she has already contacted a local institution.
And if everything works out as desired, she hopes to be able to pursue her hobby here soon - and get to know the most beautiful jogging tracks in the Rottal valley.

Kalbitz ejection from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "Feigenblatt"
From the point of view of the FDP, the expulsion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is only a "fig leaf" and does not change the character of the party.
The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the right-wing extremists in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD", the FDP domestic politician Benjamin Strasser told the news agency dpa in Berlin.
On Saturday in Stuttgart, after several hours of hearing, the Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz, which was decided by a majority of the federal executive board in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD parliamentary group in the Brandenburg state parliament.
"If the AfD were really interested in consistently removing right-wing extremists from their party, officials such as Björn Höcke and his supporters would have been expelled long ago", said Strasser.
"However, there is no political will for this in the AfD, because right-wing extremism now belongs to the party."
CSU General Secretary Markus Blume commented similarly: "The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded does not say anything and does not change anything", he told the "Welt am Sonntag."
"Rather, it speaks volumes about how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist still has in the middle of the AfD."
Blume assumes that the AfD will again end up below five percent in elections in the future.
"The days of the AfD in the parliaments are numbered."
Kalbitz was one of the spokesmen of the officially dissolved "wing" around the Thuringian AfD state and parliamentary group chairman Björn Höcke; the Protection of the Constitution classifies the coronation as "assured right-wing extremist aspiration."
In May, the AfD federal executive had thrown Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason he stated that Kalbitz did not specify an earlier membership in the now banned far-right "Heimattreuen Deutsche Jugend" (HDJ) and the Republicans when he joined the party.
Kalbitz denies membership in the HDJ.
The chairman of the left parliamentary group in the Brandenburg state parliament, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court did not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf has only eaten chalk.
The AfD remains a far-right party, whether with or without Kalbitz.
Neither the federal party nor the right wing will be weakened with this decision.
The manoeuvre of the Meuthen troupe is transparent.
They want to avoid further observation by the Protection of the Constitution and try to get through under the radar", said Walter.
The AfD will not get rid of the ghosts it called.
An expulsion does not change anything, "commented the Brandenburg SPD general secretary Erik Stohn on the decision in the Kalbitz case.
"Here the AfD state association and the faction held to their right-wing leader to this day."
The legal dispute over Kalbitz's membership in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he would now take civil action against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court.

North Sea wind farms supply a good 21 percent more electricity
The wind power plants on the German North Sea fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid in the first six months of the year.
This is a good 21 percent more than in the same period last year, said the network operator Tennet in Bayreuth.
TenneT is responsible for transmitting North Sea electricity to the mainland and transmitting it through the German electricity grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which do not belong to Tennet's grid area, have fed in a further 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, wind power from the North Sea and Baltic Sea comes to 13.73 TWh, compared to a good 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind power in Germany, which is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms ensure higher generation capacities
In addition to wind conditions, the increased contribution of offshore wind energy results from higher generation capacities, because new wind farms have been connected to the grid over the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea were all running at full power at the same time, they could generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatts.
It is expected to rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea by 2030.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore grid connections", said Tennet Managing Director Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, even at sea, wind farms cannot exploit their capacity, but reach about 40 percent.
The record day so far this year is January 2, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could supply nearly seven million households with electricity.

More air traffic controllers in Worms in the future
The University of Applied Sciences in Worms goes further into the air: The "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" donates a professorship for "Air Traffic Management."
A corresponding contract between the university and DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and will start in 2021.
The professorship makes it possible to start studies not only in the summer semester but also in the winter semester.
This means that twice as many students can be trained as before.
At the same time, capacities at both the university and the DFS Air Traffic Control Academy will be utilized evenly.
DFS will advise the university on setting up and filling the professorship.
Represented at the university since 2019
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students have been in the Air Traffic Management program as part of their training as an air traffic controller at Worms University of Applied Sciences.
Nine students have already started this year.
So far, DFS's experience has been very positive and the students' achievements are excellent.
The combination of studies and pilot training contributes significantly to further increasing the attractiveness of the pilot profession.
In these times, promotion is not easy for us economically.
However, we firmly expect air traffic to recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to continue to fulfil our statutory mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel", says Professor Klaus-Dieter SCHEURLE, Chairman of DFS at the signing of the contract.
For DFS, the endowed professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, interdisciplinary knowledge base in the long term.
We therefore continue our good cooperation with the university and at the same time underpin our attractiveness as an employer. "
This is also underlined by Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of Worms University of Applied Sciences: "The endowed professorship forms an important bridge between science and industry.
With it, we would like to build on the existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual bachelor's degree program in Air Traffic Management. "
The trust of German air traffic control is both a motivation and an obligation for Worms University of Applied Sciences to further expand its teaching and research expertise in the future fields of aviation.
Working for the air traffic controllers of tomorrow, the university can set very special highlights and innovative priorities for its students with the first endowed professorship for a dual course of study.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary at the Ministry of Science, Continuing Education and Culture, emphasizes: "With its focus on aviation, Worms University of Applied Sciences has a unique selling point in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university.

Heil wants to test other industries after the meat industry
The Corona crisis brought the conditions in parts of the meat industry to light again.
Tightening of the law is imminent.
But are they right - and will it stick to it?
Federal Labour Minister Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to review other industries in accordance with the now planned strict regulations against grievances in the meat industry.
"We will look at the industry by industry and then take suitable measures for the respective industry if necessary", Heil told the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employers are already warning against restricting work contracts in general.
Following the mass Corona outbreak at the meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet wants to pass a law of salvation this Wednesday.
Large slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to deploy external personnel for slaughter, disassembly and meat processing.
To this end, the use of work contracts and temporary workers there is to be prohibited.
Employer president Ingo Kramer told the dpa: "Hands off a general restriction of work contracts and employee assignment, if you do not want to completely strangle the economy."
Work contracts, for example, are the basis for their added value to the customer for large areas of crafts, construction and plant engineering.
"The failures of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument."
Heil assured: "My goal is not to ban works contracts everywhere in the German economy."
Work contracts make sense.
"If an industrial company commissions a craftsman to install a safety system, this is a normal work contract."
The German meat industry considers a ban on works contracts and temporary work in its industry alone to be unconstitutional.
It cannot be explained why different labour law should apply to portioning and packaging cheese in the future than to sausages, according to a statement on the bill, as reported by the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Saturday).

They often had no break.
Wages were retained for protective equipment or rent.
It was also noted that the situation with the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively sharp law for the meat industry had already come into force in 2017.
However, these have been circumvented by "tricky constructions."
"Now it has to be fundamentally cleaned up."
The politician announced: "In the Occupational Health and Safety Act, which we want to adopt in the cabinet at the end of July, there are also measures that do not only affect the meat industry - for example, higher test rates for occupational health and safety or clear criteria for community accommodation."
The draft presented to dpa includes amendments to the law on safeguarding workers' rights in the meat industry and the Occupational Health and Safety Act.
Brandenburg's Consumer Protection Minister Ursula Nonnemacher (Green Party) believes that more intensive controls are necessary.

Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - Despite all threatened penalties and court rulings, motorists continue to accelerate in countless illegal races on the roads of Baden-Württemberg: Last year and the first four months of this year, the police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
There are no comparative figures for the years before, but the racers are increasingly doing work for the judicial authorities: In 2018, the public prosecutor's offices between Konstanz and Mannheim conducted a total of 155 investigations for illegal races, a year later there were already 252 and in the current year until the beginning of June already 151.
The races were less about organized events, according to the response of the Ministry of the Interior to an inquiry from the state parliament SPD.
In most cases, the drivers spontaneously competed against each other or they escaped from the police - this is also reported as an illegal race.
At the wheel were mainly German men between the ages of 18 and 60.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases are the racers caught and asked to pay: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines have been imposed and 15 prison sentences have been issued since 2018.
However, there is no evidence that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
Rather, other drivers reacted more sensitively than before because of the numerous tragic accidents and trials of past years and reported more frequently, said a ministry spokesman.
The motorway 8 is particularly popular with racers. Again and again, drivers slow down the traffic there in order to gain space and use the free track for a race.
Last August a dozen drivers were caught near Kirchheim unter Teck, three months earlier there were even 18 drivers on the A8 near Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular "race track"
On the A81, the police register even more races than on any other federal motorway.
With a speed limit, an attempt is made to slow down the racers on the particularly affected section between Engen and Geisingen.
The mostly high-priced and pimped-up sports and luxury cars often have Swiss license plates because the drivers switch to the grass in Germany because of the high penalties for driving too fast and car racing in the neighbouring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit must not be reduced to a few distances: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometres per hour, we would tackle this problem on motorways", says Martin Rivoir, the transport expert of the SPD parliamentary group.
"The inhibition threshold for racers would be significantly higher if you were not allowed to travel legally here and there with 200 kilometres per hour and more."
Rivoir thinks less of enlightenment or image campaigns: "Anyone who overrides all rules in such a way and puts not only their own lives but also the lives of other road users at risk, is hardly achievable with reason."
ADAC calls for stronger police crackdown
On the other hand, this is not enough for the ADAC: "We assume that speeders will not be deterred by the speed limits", says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and Environment at ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and tougher controls on the affected routes.
Not infrequently, the high-speed test of strength turns into painful and consequential seriousness: Since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people across the country have died in the races, two of them uninvolved in a nightly crash in downtown Stuttgart and one in Gerlingen.
Two young men are said to have engaged in a car race there in November.
One of the vehicles came off the road, crashed into a garden wall and remained lying on its side, the 18-year-old passenger died.
21 other people were injured in the races of the past two years.
According to Interior Minister Thomas Strobl, however, tougher penalties are not necessary: "The need for legislative action to sanction illegal motor vehicle races harder is not seen", says the paper of the Ministry of the Interior.

I went to Antarctica for the first time almost 10 years ago, where I saw my first icebergs.
Awe seized me.
My heart was racing, I was dizzy while trying to grasp what was in front of me.
The icebergs around me protruded almost 60 meters from the water. And I could only be amazed that one snowflake was on top of another snowflake, year after year.
Icebergs are born as the calf of a glacier or by breaking out of ice floes.
Every iceberg has its own individual personality.
They interact in clear ways with their surroundings and their experiences.
Some refuse to give up and cling to the bitter end, while others can no longer bear it and collapse in a fit of dramatic passion.
When you look at an iceberg, it's easy to think that they are isolated, separate and alone, just as we humans often see each other.
But the truth is far from it.
As an iceberg melts, I breathe in its ancient atmosphere.
As the iceberg melts, it releases mineral-rich drinking water that nourishes many life forms.
I take pictures of these icebergs as if I were taking portraits of my ancestors, knowing that they exist this way in these individual moments and will never exist again.
It is not death when they melt; it is not an end, but a continuation of its path along the life cycle.
Some of the ice in the icebergs that I photograph is very young - several thousand years old.
And part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old.
The last pictures I would like to show you show an iceberg that I photographed in Kekertsuatsiak in Greenland.
Very rarely do you actually witness an iceberg rolling.
So here it is.
You will see a small boat on the left.
That's about five meters long.
Please pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and where it is on the waterline.
You can see here he's starting to roll and the boat has moved to the other side, the man is standing there.
That's the average size of a Greenland iceberg.
It protrudes about 120 feet from the water, or 40 meters.
And this video is in real time.
(Music) And just like that, the iceberg shows you another side of its personality.
Thanks.

Nuremberg: Unauthorized tuning meeting - Police intervene 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and temporarily over 1000 people participated Saturday night in a "tuning meeting" in the parking lot of a furniture store.
The police implemented their announcement to increasingly control such events.
A big tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (July 25, 2020) in Nuremberg's southern city.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the police of Middle Franconia, the Nuremberg traffic police detected an increased volume of vehicles in the area of a large parking lot in Ingolstädter Straße at around 10.30 p.m.
As a result, the police carried out a large number of vehicle checks there.
Only recently the police announced that they wanted to step up action against so-called autoposers.
Illegal tuning meeting in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the "scene"
The officers counted at the top about 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, according to the police.
However, only a small proportion of those present can be assigned to the "autoposer" and tuning scene.
Apparently, the majority of the relevant scene complied with the police's appeal.
Based on the vehicles and persons on site, it can be assumed that these were mainly onlookers.
In addition, the vast majority of those present adhered to the applicable infection protection regulations, in particular compliance with the minimum distance and wearing mouth and nose protection.
The on-site inspection measures were completed at around 1: 00 a.m.
In total, the officials noticed such structural changes in 10 vehicles that the operating license had expired.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.

Figures from the Employment Agency: 900 suspected cases of abuse during short-time work

The assessments differ, but we prepare ourselves in case and are already training our employees in the employment agencies to process applications for insolvency money. "

You all know what I'm about to say is true.
The intuition that inequality weakens social cohesion existed before the French Revolution.
What's new is that we now have evidence. We can compare societies, equals and unequal ones, and see what inequality does.
I want to show you statistics and explain why they are related.
Look what a poor bunch we are.
(Laughter) I want to start with a paradox.
This shows life expectancy and Gross National Income - on average in rich countries.
You can see that the countries on the right, Norway and the USA, for example, are twice as rich as Israel, Greece, Portugal on the left.
And that doesn't change anything about their life expectancy.
There is nothing to suggest a connection.
But within societies there are enormous social gaps in health across society.
Here, again, life expectancy.
Here are small areas of England and Wales - the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.
A big difference between the poor and the rest of us.
Even the people just below the top are in worse health than those at the top.
So income is very important within individual societies, and none at all between them.
The explanation for this paradox is that within societies we are dealing with relative income, social position, status - where we stand in relation to one another and how big the gaps are between us.
And when you understand that, you immediately ask yourself: What happens when the differences increase or decrease when income differences increase or decrease?
And I'll show you that now.
Not with hypothetical data.
With data from the UN - the same used by the World Bank - on the extent of income inequalities in rich developed market democracies.
The measure we use because it's easy to understand and downloadable is how much richer the top 20 percent is than the bottom 20 percent of each country.
You can see that in the same countries on the left - Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden - the top 20 percent are around 3½, 4 times as rich as the bottom 20 percent.
But on the other hand - UK, Portugal, US, Singapore - the differences are twice as big.
We are twice as unequal on this scale as some of the other successful market democracies.
Now I'm going to show you what that does to our societies.
We collected data on problems with social gradients, the problems that are more common at the bottom of the social ladder.
Internationally comparable data on life expectancy, children's math, reading and writing skills, child mortality and murder rates, what proportion of the population is imprisoned, teenage pregnancies, confidence, obesity, mental illness - which include drug and alcohol addiction in the standard diagnosis - and social mobility.
We have summarized them in an index.
All of the same weight.
For every country there is some kind of average of these factors.
And here you see it in relation to the level of inequality I have shown you, which I will come back to over and over again.
The more unequal countries score worse on all of these social problems.
That is an unusually high correlation.
But if you put the same index of health and social problems in relation to GNI per capita, to gross national income, there is nothing left, no correlation.
We worried people would think we'd just picked the issues that back our reasoning and constructed that evidence, so we published an article in the British Medical Journal on the UNICEF Child Well-Being Index.
Other people put together 40 different components in it.
The index includes whether children can talk to their parents, whether they have books at home, their immunization rates, whether there is bullying at school.
Everything flows into it.
Here is the index relative to our inequality scores.
Children do worse in unequal societies.
A highly significant relationship.
Again, when you compare the child welfare index to national per capita income, there is no correlation, not even a hint.
All of the data I've shown you so far says the same thing.
The average well-being of our societies no longer depends on national income and economic growth.
These are crucial in poorer countries, but not in the rich developed world.
But the differences between us, where we stand in comparison to each other, has become very important.
I will now show you individual parts of our index.
For example, here is trust.
Simply the proportion of the population who believe most people can be trusted.
The data comes from the World Values Survey.
On the more unequal side, around 15 percent of the population believe that others can be trusted.
But in more equal societies it is up to 60 or 65 percent.
And for the degree of integration into communal life or social capital, there are similarly close references to inequality.
We did all this work twice.
First with the rich, developed countries, and then in a second test field again with the 50 American states - with the same question: do the more unequal states perform worse on all these scales?
Here trust is related to inequality, according to a data collection by the US government.
A very similar distribution over a similar range of confidence levels.
The same thing happens here.
Our basic result is that almost all factors that are internationally related to trust do the same in the 50 US states in a separate test environment.
And that's not just a happy coincidence.
Here are mental illnesses.
WHO produced these numbers by conducting the same diagnostic interviews with randomly selected test subjects in order to be able to compare the rates of mental illness in the societies.
This is the percentage of the population who were mentally ill last year.
It ranges from 8 percent to three times that - entire societies that have rates of mental illness three times higher than others.
And again a high correlation to inequality.
And here violence.
These red dots are American states and the blue triangles are Canadian provinces.
Note the scale of differences.
It goes from 15 murders per million to 150.
That is the proportion of the population that is in custody.
There is about a tenfold difference on the side log scale.
It goes from about 40 to 400 imprisoned people.
This ratio is not primarily due to higher crime rates.
In some places this is a partial factor.
But the main reason is tougher court rulings.
And societies that are more unequal are also more likely to adhere to the death penalty.
There are kids here who drop out of school.
Pretty big differences again.
With devastating effects on the use of talent in the population.
Here is social mobility.
Actually a measurement of mobility based on income.
The question is: Do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons, or is there no connection between them?
On the more unequal side, fathers' income is far more important - in the UK, in the US.
And in the Scandinavian countries, fathers' income is much less important.
There is more social mobility.
We like to say - and I know there are a lot of Americans in the audience here - if Americans want to live the American Dream, they should go to Denmark.
(Laughter) (Applause) I've just introduced a few things to you now.
I could have shown you a lot of other problems.
All of these problems are more common at the lower end of the social gradient.
But there are countless social gap issues that are worse in more unequal countries - not just a little, but anywhere between 2 and 10 times as common.
Imagine that cost, the human cost.
But I want to come back to the graph where we've put everything together to show two things.
On the one hand, graph by graph, it can be seen that the countries that do poorly, regardless of the result, are apparently the less equal, and those that do better seem to be the Nordic countries and Japan.
So what we are seeing is a general social dysfunction that comes with inequality.
It affects not just one or two things, it affects most of them.
The other very important aspect of this graph is down here, Sweden and Japan - very different countries in many ways.
The position of women, how much they cling to the nuclear family, here they are at opposite poles of the rich, developed world.
Another very important difference is how they achieve their greater equality.
In Sweden there are huge wage disparities that are offset by taxation, the general welfare state, generous social benefits, etc.
In Japan it is completely different.
There are smaller differences in earnings even before tax.
There are lower taxes.
A smaller welfare state.
And in our analysis of the American states we find the same contrast.
Some states are successful through redistribution, others are doing well because they have small income differentials before tax.
Our implication is that how you get to greater equality doesn't matter as long as you somehow get there.
I don't mean perfect equality, I'm talking about something that already exists in rich market democracies.
Another, surprising part of the picture is that inequality isn't just affecting the poor.
Apparently there is some truth in John Donne's "Nobody is an island."
Several studies can be used to compare how people in more or less the same countries perform at every level of the social hierarchy.
This is just one example.
Infant mortality.
Some Swedes have kindly classified much of their child deaths according to the UK's socio-economic classification registry.
This is an anachronistic classification according to the occupations of the fathers, so single parents are listed separately.
But where "low social class" is noted, it means unskilled manual activities.
Then there are the skilled manual trades in the middle, then the subordinate non-manual trades up to the higher-level professions - doctors, lawyers, executives of larger companies.
You can see that Sweden is better than the UK across the social hierarchy.
The biggest differences are down in society.
But even at the top, there seems to be a small advantage in living in a more equal society.
We show this in five different data sets that deal with parenting success and health in the US and internationally.
That seems to be the case across the board - greater equality counts most at the bottom, but has some advantages even at the top.
But I should say something about what's going on.
I'm interested in the psychosocial effects of inequality.
This has to do with feelings of superiority and inferiority, the feeling of being valued or devalued, respected or despised.
And of course the feeling of status competition that results from it drives consumerism in our society.
It also leads to status uncertainty.
We are more concerned about how others judge us, whether we are seen as attractive, smart, etc.
The socially judgmental judgments increase, and the fear of these judgments.
Interestingly, there is similar research in social psychology: some people have reviewed 208 different studies inviting volunteers to psychological laboratories to measure their stress hormones and their response to stressful tasks.
What interested her in the evaluation was which types of stress were most reliable in raising the level of cortisol, the central stress hormone.
And the result was: Tasks that threatened social assessment - threats to self-confidence or social status, where others can judge their own performance negatively.
These types of stress have a very specific effect on the physiology of stress.
We have been criticized.
Of course there are people who don't like this and people who find it very amazing.
But I should tell you that if we are criticized for carefully selecting our data, we never select specifically for our purposes.
Our absolute principle is: if our data source has data for any of the countries we are looking at, it comes into the analysis.
Our data source determines whether it is reliable data, not us.
Anything else would be bias.
What about other countries?
There are 200 studies of health versus income and equity in peer-reviewed academic journals.
It's not limited to these countries, it's a very simple demonstration.
The same countries, the same scale of inequality, one problem at a time.
Why don't we check other factors?
We have shown that per capita income makes no difference.
And of course others have also checked poverty and education with more sophisticated methods and others.
What about causality?
A correlation does not yet prove causality.
We spent a lot of time doing this.
In fact, people are very familiar with the causal relationships in some of these results.
The big news in our understanding of the drivers of long-term health in the rich developed world is how very chronic social stress is on the immune system, the cardiovascular system.
Or, for example, the reason why violence is more prevalent in more unequal societies is because people are sensitive to being despised.
In order to cope with this, we need to clarify what happens after the tax and what happens before the tax.
We have to limit the income, the bonus culture income at the top.
We must hold our bosses accountable to employees as best we can.
But the takeaway message is that we can improve the real quality of human life by closing the income inequalities between us.
Suddenly there is a lever for the psychosocial well-being of entire societies, and that is very exciting.
Thanks.

Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualify for Champions League
London (dpa) - English football record champion Manchester United returns to the Champions League after a year's absence.
The Red Devils secured third place in the table on the last day of the Premier League with a 2-0 (0-0) win over direct rivals Leicester City.
The Foxes now have to settle for the Europa League, because Chelsea FC still passed by and also qualified for the premier class in fourth place.
In the fight against relegation, Aston Villa was able to cheer.
Manchester United took the lead with a penalty kick from Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in injury time, Jesse Lingard (90 + 8) scored the final score.
Chelsea, opponents of FC Bayern in the Champions League round of 16, won 2-0 (2-0) against Wolverhampton Wanderers thanks to Mason Mount (45 + 1) and Olivier Giroud (45 + 4).
"That means a lot to me", said coach Frank Lampard, who is also in the final of the FA Cup against Arsenal in his first season as Chelsea coach.
Chelsea's win over Wolverhampton also benefited Tottenham Hotspur, who passed the Wolves with a meagre 1-1 (1-0) at Crystal Palace and started in sixth place in the Europa League.
Aston Villa won the long-distance duel with Watford FC and AFC Bournemouth, but had to tremble for class retention at West Ham United for a long time.
The late lead of Jack Grealish (84th) immediately compensated Andrej Jarmolenko (85th).
The 1: 1 (0: 0) was enough because Watford lost 2: 3 (1: 3) at Arsenal.
The club, which scored three coaches during the season, is relegated after five first league years.
Just like Bournemouth, who couldn't save himself by a 3-1 (2-1) at Everton.
In the end, one point was missing.
Liverpool FC, who have been English champions since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3-1 (1-1) victory at Newcastle United.
99 points is the highest score the Reds have ever achieved in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team narrowly missed the points record in English football.
Manchester City holds the record with 100 points in the 2017 / 18 season.
After the Newcastle lead in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) shot the match for Liverpool on Sunday.
"It was an extraordinary season for this wonderful club", said goalscorer van Dijk after the game, which should encourage us to defend the title.
It's going to be hard.
The Premier League bosses should also be satisfied in the end.

I want to show you today how we will make things in the future.
I believe our buildings and machines will soon self-assemble, replicate, and repair themselves.
I will show you what I think are today's production methods and then compare them to some natural systems.
In the current manufacturing industry, we have skyscrapers - two and a half years [construction time], half a million to a million pieces, quite complex, new and exciting technology in steel, concrete, glass.
We have exciting machines that will take us into space - five years [construction time], two and a half million parts.
On the other hand, if you look at natural systems, you find proteins that are two million types and can fold in ten microseconds, or DNA with three billion base pairs that can be copied in about an hour.
So there's all this complexity in our natural systems, but they're extremely efficient, much more efficient than anything we can make, far more complex than anything we can build.
They are much more energy efficient.
You almost never make mistakes.
And they are durable because they can repair themselves.
So there are many interesting things to discover in natural systems.
And if we manage to incorporate that into our built environment, then we have exciting potential for new construction methods.
And I believe the key is self-assembly.
If we want to use self-assembly in our physical environment, there are, in my opinion, four central factors.
The first is that we have to decipher the full complexity of the things we want to build - our buildings and machines.
And we have to translate that into simple sequences - the DNA of how our buildings work, so to speak.
Then we need programmable parts that can pull this sequence and use it for folding or reconfiguring.
We need activation energy so that our parts from the program can fold up.
And we need a kind of redundancy to correct errors, so that what we want to build really comes into being.
I will show you some projects that my colleagues and I are working on at MIT so that self-assembly can be carried out in the future.
The first two are MacroBot and DeciBot.
These projects are large-scale, reconfigurable robots - two and a half to four meters long proteins.
They are equipped with electromechanical devices, sensors.
You decode what you want to fold into a sequence of angles - that is, minus 120, minus 120, 0, 0, 120, minus 120 - something like that; a sequence of angles, or rotations, and you send that sequence down the chain.
Each unit picks up its message - i.e. minus 120 - it rotates accordingly, checks whether it has arrived and forwards it to the neighboring unit.
These are the brilliant scientists, engineers, and designers who worked on this project.
And I think it makes one thing really clear: is this really scalable?
I mean, thousands of dollars, many hours of work, to create this two and a half meter tall robot.
Can we really scale that up? Can we really embed robotics in every part?
The next project questions this and looks at the passive nature or the passive attempt to make reconfiguration programmable.
But it goes a step further and tries to make actual calculations possible.
It basically integrates the most fundamental part of computing, the digital logic gate, right into the parts.
This is a NAND gate.
You have a tetrahedron, which is the gate that will do the calculations, and you have two input tetrahedra.
One is the input from the user while building the building blocks.
The other comes from the previous component that was placed.
And then it delivers an output in three-dimensional space.
This means that the user can enter what the components should do.
It does calculations based on what it has done before and what the user is asking of it.
And now it begins to move in three-dimensional space - up and down.
On the left the input [1,1] corresponds to the output 0 going down.
On the right, the input [0,0] corresponds to the output 1 going high.
What this really means is that our structures now contain the blueprints of what we want to build.
So you have all the information about what has been built.
That means we can achieve some form of self-replication.
In this case, I call it self-directed replication because the structure contains the exact blueprints.
If errors occur, a part can be exchanged.
All of the local information is built in to show how to fix it.
So you could have something that climbs and reads and delivers one-to-one output.
It's built right in; there are no outside instructions.
The last project I'll show is called Biased Chains, and it's arguably the most exciting example of self-assembling systems we have right now.
It takes up the ability to reconfigure and program and creates a completely passive system.
Basically, you have a chain of elements.
Each element is completely identical and they are polarized.
Every chain, or every element, wants to turn to the right or to the left.
So while you're putting the chain together, you're basically programming it.
Each unit is told whether to turn to the right or to the left.
When you shake the chain, it folds into a configuration that you have programmed in - in this case a spiral, or in this case two adjacent cubes.
So basically any possible three-dimensional shape - or one-dimensional, two-dimensional - can be programmed completely passively into this chain.
What does that tell us about the future?
I think it tells us that there are opportunities for self-assembly, replication and repair in our physical structures, buildings and machines.
There are new ways to program in these parts.
And this creates new possibilities for IT.
We will have spatial programming.
Imagine if our buildings, bridges, machines, all of our components could perform calculations.
That would mean parallel and distributed computing power, new design possibilities.
So there is exciting potential for it.
I think these projects that I've shown here are just a tiny step towards that future if we implement these new technologies for a new, self-creating world.
Thanks.

Arrests and violence during demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against Prime Minister Netanyahu are becoming increasingly intense.
During the night there were violent clashes.
On Sunday night in Jerusalem, the Israeli police took violent action against participants in a demonstration against the right-wing conservative Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Twelve people were arrested for participating in riots, said police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld.
Among other things, the police used water cannons to break up the rally.
According to media reports, a total of around 6,000 people gathered near Netanyahu's official residence on Saturday evening.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu's handling of the Corona crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew horns, and called on Netanyahu to resign.
Participants in a counter-demonstration were also arrested, who supported Netanyahu, reported the news site "Ynet."
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the head of government's private villa in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
According to police reports, a man was arrested near Tel Aviv because he was suspected of spraying pepper spray from a moving car on demonstrators on the side of the road.
Another man was arrested after a stabbing attack on a demonstrator in the south of the country.
The demonstrator was slightly injured in the neck.
There have recently been several demonstrations against Netanyahu in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
The rallies accompany the corruption trial against the head of government.
Most recently, Netanyahu was also criticized for his handling of the Corona crisis.
Among other things, he is accused of hasty relaxation and a lack of preparation for a second Corona wave.

North Korea seals off border town after Corona suspected case
North Korea has so far seen its own measures to ward off the coronavirus as a "brilliant success."
Now the country is reporting a suspected case for the first time.
Because of a first official Corona suspected case in the country, North Korea has completely sealed off a big city for fear of a disaster.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defense measures in the past six months, "the malignant virus may have been introduced into the country", the state media reported.
A state of emergency has been imposed for the region around the border town of Kaesong.
The communist leadership declared the highest alert level.
If the suspected case is confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the isolated country.
North Korea has not yet registered a single infection and described its defensive measures as a "shining success."
The information was doubted abroad.
The symptoms of the disease were reportedly detected in an "outlier" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
The person left for South Korea three years ago and has now returned across the border.
There was initially no confirmation from South Korea for the border crossing within the four-kilometre-wide and largely mined military buffer zone.
However, according to reports from the national news agency Yonhap, South Korea's military acknowledged the possibility of crossing the border illegally into North Korea as high.
There were investigations into some people.
North Korea said it called an emergency meeting of the Workers' Party's Politburo, chaired by ruler Kim Jong Un, on Saturday because of the suspected case.
The dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive catastrophe. "
Kim had already ordered on Friday as a preventive measure to "completely block Kaesong and isolate each district and region from others."
The person concerned and all the people in Kaesong who had been in contact with her were quarantined.
The central military commission of the party should therefore investigate the "outlier case" as well as the behaviour of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose harsh punishment.
It is estimated that about 300,000 people live in Kaesong.

Tension ahead of Council meeting: City-East and noise protection are up for discussion before a big summer break
"In addition to environmental issues, the committee members will also vote on the development plan for the large-scale project inner city development East", it says rather casually in the middle section of the municipal press release for the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, July 28, at 4.30 p.m. in the Great Hall of the CongressCentrum Pforzheim.

"Everyone thinks they know better", says Klein, who has been a member of the municipal council for a year as the only representative of the Pforzheim citizen list.
In fact, after reading the contracts, he is in this position: "I know what I'm talking about."
The exit will be cheaper for the city, contrary to statements of the city administration, the Technical Town Hall is to be renovated after grants, the existence of which Klein is convinced, for 8.5 million euros.

In a press release, the local transport club Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of the fact that this must happen, because by neglecting the regular bus traffic with thinned cycles and by little commitment to cycling, they have only contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus the noise, according to the VCD.
The municipal council also votes on the participation of the city of the Energy and Climate Protection Agency Pforzheim / Enzkreis.
Also on the agenda is the accession to the climate protection pact of the state of Baden-Württemberg, the redefinition of parental contributions in the municipal daycare centres and the application for inclusion in the federal government's smart city funding.

Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with a lot of delay
With a delay of almost half a year, Tim Zimmermann will start his premiere season in the ADAC GT Masters on July 31.
Before the league of super sports cars can start regular operations, the first test drives were scheduled.
For Zimmermann it was all about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 better.
The Corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from embarking on his first business trip in the new Lamborghini Huracan from Grasser Racing.
This was now possible under special hygiene conditions.
The 23-year-old Langenargener made his first laps at the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his premiere in the GT3 car.
"There are already a few things that are different from the Porsche from the pre-season", says Zimmermann.
With the ABS, for example, you have to go into the corners differently.
But it was really a lot of fun.
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite his only 25 years, the Dutchman is already experienced in GT sport and was able to help his new team-mate in many things.
"I'm not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series also brings new challenges", says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I understand each other brilliantly and we have made enormous progress from session to session at the Lausitzring."
Right there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also host its first race.
From July 31, the 33 super sports cars will race through Lusatia.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 newcomers to the series, knows the track.
In 2015 he was a guest at the Motodrom.
"It worked quickly and I didn't have to get used to the track", says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafen racing community Graf Zeppelin.
The Lausitzring has many fast passages that you have to hit optimally in order to be fast.
How fast Zimmermann really is, it turns out in two weeks.
"Of course, the teams play poker a little bit during the tests", he says.
In the end, however, we are very satisfied and are looking forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring.
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a densely packed calendar.
Seven races are scheduled until the beginning of November.
The current state of affairs is that no spectators will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.

British Transport Minister caught cold by quarantine decision
The British government's decision to quarantine Spanish holidaymakers for two weeks after their return has caught the country's transport minister cold, according to press reports.
Accordingly, Grant Shapps is currently on vacation in Spain of all places, while his colleagues at home decided on the measure on Saturday.
Due to the rising Corona numbers in Spain, the cabinet in London removed the country from the list of countries from which entry without quarantine requirements is possible.
The new regulation will apply from today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to be quarantined after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But the regulation applies to those who are just on vacation on the deadline, only from Saturday, August 1, and was not introduced overnight.
Incidentally, Spain is still regarded in Austria as one of the "safe countries" for which no quarantine is required in Austria.
"Many ministers may have known in advance that there is a possibility that a quarantine will be imposed on holidaymakers in Spain", commented Labour MP Diane Abbot.
"But apparently nobody bothered to tell Grant Shapps."

Do you know how many types of flowering plants there are?
A quarter of a million - this is the number of known species - a quarter of a million species of flowering plants.
And blossoms are real devils.
Plants struggle to produce them.
You need an enormous amount of energy and raw materials.
Why do you bother?
The answer to that, of course, as to so much in the world, is sex.
I know what you think about when you look at these pictures.
And the answer to why sexual reproduction is so important - there are many other ways for plants to reproduce.
Let's take offshoots; they can have sex with themselves, so to speak; they can pollinate themselves.
But they actually have to spread their genes to mix them with other genes so that they can occupy ecological niches.
This is how evolution works.
Plants pass this information on through pollen.
Some of you may have seen a few of these images before.
As I always say, everyone should have a scanning electron microscope at home to see them.
There are as many different types of pollen as there are flowering plants.
And that's very useful for forensics and so on.
Most of the pollen that causes hay fever in us comes from plants that use the wind to spread their pollen. It's a very inefficient process, which is why so much of it ends up in our noses.
Because the plants throw out very large amounts in the hope that the male sex cells that are in the pollen just by chance hit another flower.
All grasses, i.e. all cereal plants and most trees, transport pollen through the wind.
Most species use insects for their own purposes. And that's the smarter way because it uses less pollen.
The insects and other species can bring the pollen directly to their destination.
We are of course aware of the relationship between insects and plants.
It's a symbiotic relationship. Whether flies, birds or bees, they also benefit from it, usually through the nectar.
This symbiosis has resulted in some wonderful adaptations - the hummingbird warmer is a beautiful adaptation.
The plant benefits from the hummingbird spreading the pollen.
Plants have developed small runways for bees that otherwise would not find their way.
Many plants have markings that resemble other insects.
These are the anthers of a lily, a very clever construction. When an unsuspecting insect lands on it, the pouches fold up and hit the insect on the back, where the pollen gets caught and is brought to other plants.
This is an orchid that looks like it has a mouth. The insects are forced to crawl out and are covered in pollen.
There are at least 20,000 species of orchids - an impressive variety.
And they have all sorts of tricks up their sleeves.
They need to attract pollinators to help them.
This orchid, known from the research of Charles Darwin, who, when looking at it, made a great thesis. You will see a very long tube of nectar going down from the orchid.
And what insects have to do there in the middle of the flower - they have to put their little proboscis in there and down the whole nectar tube to get the nectar.
And when Darwin saw this flower he said, "Something must have developed in parallel with it."
And sure enough, here is this insect.
It usually rolls up its trunk, but in its stretched shape it looks like this.
You can imagine that when nectar is so valuable and costly for the plant to produce, and attracts large numbers of pollinators, then like human sex, people begin to deceive.
They say something like: "I have nectar, do you want to come and get it?"
This is a plant.
It's a plant that insects in South Africa simply love. And they have developed a long proboscis to get to the nectar.
And that's a copycat
a plant that copies the original.
And here is the fly with a long trunk that didn't get any nectar from the copycat. Because, contrary to what the fly expects, the imitator has no nectar at all.
Not only did the fly not get any nectar, it also has - if you look very carefully, you will see pollen at the head of its trunk, which it would have transferred to other plants if only a botanist had not come by and stuck it on blue paper.
(Laughter) Illusion runs through the whole plant kingdom.
Those black spots on the flower, they look like black spots to us, but to male insects of certain species they look like two females who are very hot.
(Laughter) And when the insect lands there, it picks up pollen, which it takes to other plants. If you look at the "Every Household Should Have One" electron microscope picture, you can see that there are certain three-dimensional patterns.
Not only does it look good to the insect, it also feels good.
And these electron microscope images - here one of an orchid imitating an insect - show that different parts of the shape have different colors and seemingly different surfaces, and for the perception of an insect the textures are very, very different.
This plant has developed the imitation of a shiny metallic surface, as can be seen on some beetles.
And under the electron microscope you can see that this surface is completely different from the one we have looked at so far.
Sometimes the whole plant imitates an insect, even in our perception.
I think it looks like a flying animal.
It is a wonderful thing.
This one is clever. It's called Obsidium.
I sometimes see them as insidious.
For certain bees it looks like another, particularly aggressive bee, so it flies there and hits its head several times to drive it away and of course takes in a lot of pollen.
At the same time, this plant imitates another orchid that has a rich food supply for insects.
But this one has nothing for you.
So she cheats on two levels - fabulous.
(Laughter) Here we see the cananga tree, an ingredient in many perfumes.
I smelled one on someone earlier.
The flowers shouldn't really be that colorful.
They send a fantastic spectrum of scents to all insects.
This one doesn't smell so good.
It's a bloom that really smells awful and that's designed to imitate carrion.
Therefore, flies love them.
They fly in and pollinate them.
This is a helicodiceros, also known as the "dead horse".
I don't know what a dead horse smells like, but the plant probably hits it pretty well.
It's really terrible.
And blowflies can't hold back.
You fly in all the way to the back
and lay their eggs there, which they think it is carrion, without realizing that there is no food for the eggs, which therefore die, but the plant benefits from it because the fly full of pollen flies on again and pollinates the next flower - fantastic.
This is Arum maculatum, the spotted arum.
I photographed him in Dorset last week.
It warms up to approx. 15 ° above the ambient temperature - fascinating.
And if you look inside the plant, there is a kind of barrier behind the inflorescences. Flies are attracted to the heat, which creates volatile chemicals, and are trapped in the bottom of the container.
You drink the wonderful nectar and are sticky afterwards.
At night they get a pollen shower and then the bristles that we saw above slacken and thus give way to the mosquitoes that are full of pollen - great thing.
If you think that's great, here's one of my favorites.
That is the Philodendron Selloum.
If anyone from Brazil is here, you will know the plant.
It is really fascinating.
This kind of phallus there is about 30cm long.
And it does something that no other plant I know does when it blooms. There in the middle are the inflorescences - for about 2 days it has a metabolism that is very similar to that of mammals.
Instead of feeding on starch, which is the diet of plants, it takes something that looks like brown adipose tissue and burns it off so quickly that the rate of fat burning, metabolism, is that of a small cat.
That's twice the energy a hummingbird produces in relation to its weight - insanely impressive.
But he does something else that is unusual.
It not only warms up to 43 to 44 ° C for about 2 days, but also maintains a constant temperature.
He can regulate his temperature and thereby keep it constant.
You ask yourself, "Why is he doing this?"
As you can guess, there are some beetles that love to mate at this temperature.
And they fly in and get started.
(Laughter) And the plant covers them with pollen, and they fly on and pollinate.
What a wonderful thing.
The typical pollinator for us is an insect. But many birds and butterflies also pollinate in the tropics.
And a lot of tropical flowers are red and we think that's because birds and butterflies look similar to us and therefore can see the color red very well.
If you look at the spectrum of birds and humans, we see red, green, and blue so this spectrum here.
Insects see green, blue, and ultraviolet, and various levels of ultraviolet.
So something that goes beyond our spectrum.
And I hear you ask, "Wouldn't it be great if we can see that too?"
Of course we can.
So what does an insect see?
Last week I took a photo of this sun rose in Dorset.
As you can see, there are little yellow flowers, little yellow flowers everywhere.
And this is how they look in visible light.
This is what it looks like when you take the red out.
Most bees don't see red.
And then I took pictures with ultraviolet filters and exposed the special ultraviolet frequencies for a very, very long time, and that’s what came out.
And that's a fantastic target.
We don't know exactly what bees see, just like you don't know what I see when I say "This is red".
We cannot see into the mind of insects or other people.
But the contrast will be something like this. It stands out against the background.
Here's another little bloom - different range of ultraviolet frequencies, different filters similar to pollinators.
And that's what you would see
In case you think all yellow flowers have this property - none of the flowers were harmed for this picture; it was only attached to the tripod, not killed - but it looks like this under ultraviolet light.
And that could serve as the base of a sunscreen, because sunscreens absorb UV light.
The substances in the plant could be helpful in this.
Finally we have an evening primrose that Bjorn Rorslett sent me from Norway - fantastic hidden patterns.
I love the idea of hidden things.
I think there is something poetic about it. Namely, that these pictures were made with UV filters, filters that are mainly used by astronomers to photograph Venus - more precisely, its nebulae.
That is the main purpose of these filters.
Venus is the goddess of love and fertility, and that in turn is the story of the flowers.
And flowers not only show great efforts to attract pollinators, they also manage that we plant large fields full of them and give them to each other at births and deaths, and especially at weddings, which, if you think about it, are the moment on which the exchange of genetic material from one organism to another is determined.
Many Thanks.

Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of emergency for many districts.
The Corona pandemic, which is rampant in Texas, is making the work of the aid workers more difficult, Abbott said, according to the US media.
Evacuees called for caution
"Every hurricane is an enormous challenge", said Abbott according to the newspaper "Houston Chronicle."
Referring to the cyclone in Texas, he added: "This challenge is complicated and is exacerbated, considering that it is sweeping through an area that is the area most affected by Covid-19 in the state."
According to the Johns Hopkins University, around 5,000 people have died in Texas alone as a result of the Corona pandemic.

After that, the Munich team could face a quarter-final against FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, in the semi-finals Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are possible opponents.

Greta Thunberg: Evil eye against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest on Stephen Colbert's well-known latenight show via video switch and revealed in an interview what she had in mind when she met Donald Trump.
Climate activist Greta Thunberg was a guest on a popular US latenight show via video switch.
Among other things, she talked about her struggle against the powerful of the world.
The teenager also spoke about her famous "evil gaze" during her encounter with Donald Trump.
New York City - Over the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has attracted attention with her tireless commitment to the "Fridays For Future" movement.
Now she spoke in a well-known latenight show about her plans for the future and her meeting with US President Donald Trump at the UN climate summit last year.
Latenight host Stephen Colbert welcomed 17-year-old Thunberg to your show on Tuesday and conducted a lengthy interview with the Swede.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the world's powerful.
"There are some things that surprised me", she said.
"How far people go to direct the focus away from the climate crisis" has shocked her.
She has experienced everything from organized hate campaigns to threats just because a group of children are taking to the streets.
She finds heads of state and leading politicians who scoff at her on social media or even try to silence her "funny" because the reactions show her "because they have no other answer."
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was approached about a well-known scene in which she took a bitterly evil look at US President Trump.
At the 2019 UN Climate Summit in New York, for which the activist sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive gaze was captured by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
The short clip resulted in a GIF, an animated image, which ultimately became one of the most frequently used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the US president at that moment?
In response to Stephen Colbert's relatively open question, she answered only briefly and dryly: "To be honest, I think that doesn't need any further explanation."
The experienced satirist Colbert probably did not expect the quick-witted answer and briefly disappeared from the picture laughing.
With her "How dare you?" Speech on the principles of climate protection, she was remembered by many at the climate conference.

Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green died
His life was like a rollercoaster ride: After a rapid climb with Fleetwood Mac, it went steeply downhill and then slowly up again.
Now the blues rock guitarist Peter Green has died at the age of 73.

Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional reaction of a "monumental loss" for all former and current members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
The drummer Fleetwood and the guitarist Green formed the now legendary band in London in 1967. His dreamy instrumental hit "Albatross" is still unforgotten.
The musician's life ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") resembled a roller coaster ride.
Green experienced a rapid rise with Fleetwood Mac - but the band celebrated their greatest successes without him.

In the middle of the blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 together with his Bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross" composed by Green gave the group its first number 1 hit in the winter of 1968 / 69 and catapulted them to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed its downsides: Green could not cope with the media hype and his experiments with the drug LSD became more and more extreme.
He later commented on life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in life is drugs - the best thing was to land a number 1 hit."
Towards the end of the decade, Green surprisingly achieved a respectable success in 1979 with an album inspired by religious themes.
Meanwhile, Fleetwood Mac swam without him in a new formation on a wave of success.
