P. 381 Jan Christopher Horak wrote: "The film is a remarkable achievement in directing.
We will not know.
You could have known.
Please make everyone aware of a very simple fact for a moment: Pretty much everything we know about the universe, we know through light.
We can stand on earth and look into the night sky and look at stars with our naked eyes.
The sun burns our peripheral vision.
We see light reflected by the moon.
And in the time that has passed since Galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope at the celestial bodies, the universe known to us has travelled to us as a visible light, crossing immeasurable ages of cosmic history.
With the help of all our modern telescopes, we have been able to study all this: This impressive silent film of the universe, this series of snapshots that go back to the Big Bang.
But the universe is not a silent movie, because the universe is not silent.
I want to convince you that the universe has a soundtrack and that this soundtrack is played in space itself: Because space can vibrate like a drum.
It can sound a kind of sound recording that can be heard all over the universe, from some of the most dramatic events when they occurred.
Now we would like to add a tonal component to the wonderful visual arrangement we have from the universe.
And even if we have never heard the sounds of the universe before, over the next few years we should slowly turn up the volume control for what is happening out there.
Out of this ambition to capture songs from the universe, we focus our interest on black holes and the promise inherent in them. Black holes hammer against space-time like wooden mallets on a drum. They have a very characteristic sound that I would like to play to you; or our idea of how this song will sound.
One day we may see a shadow cast by a black hole against a bright background, but so far we have not succeeded.
And yet you can hear black holes, even if they are invisible. The reason for this is that they play like on a drum in spacetime.
We owe it to the idea that the universe sounds like a drum, Albert Einstein, to whom we owe so much.
Einstein realized that if space were empty, if the universe were empty, it would have to look like this picture, just without this helpful grid.
But if we moved through space in free fall, even without this helpful grid, we might be able to paint it ourselves, because we would realize that we are moving along straight lines, along undistorted, straight paths through the universe.
Einstein also realized (and that's what it's all about) that if you bring energy or mass into the universe, it curves the universe. If a body in free fall, let's say, passed the sun, it would be distorted, along the natural curvature lines in space.
This is Einstein's great general theory of relativity.
Even light is bent along these paths.
And a body can be bent so much that it enters an orbit around the Sun, like the Earth, or like the Moon in Earth's orbit.
These are natural curvatures in space.
What Einstein did not know was this: If one were to take the sun and compress it into a ball six kilometres in diameter, if one were to take something with millions of times the mass of the earth and compress it to six kilometres, then one would create a black hole; a body of such density that light that would come too close to it could never escape. It would be a black shadow in front of the universe.
But Einstein considered black holes to be a mathematical curiosity throughout his life.
He did not believe that they really existed.
He was convinced that nature would protect us from its emergence.
It would take decades for the term "black hole" to be coined and people realized that black holes are astrophysical bodies. In fact, they are the lifeless state of extremely dense stars that collapse in a terrible catastrophe at the end of their lives.
Our sun, however, will not end up as a black hole.
It is simply not big enough for that.
But we conducted a small thought experiment, as Einstein liked to do. Let's imagine compressing the sun six kilometres in diameter and bringing a tiny earth into its orbit, let's say 30 kilometres away from this black sun.
This earth would shine by itself, so (since the sun would have disappeared, there would be no other source of light) we let our little earth shine by itself.
We could bring the Earth into a carefree orbit about 30 km away from the crushed black hole.
This crushed black hole would be about the size of Manhattan.
It would pour into the Hudson a little bit before it destroyed the earth.
But we're talking about it.
We're talking about something you can squeeze together until it's half the size of Manhattan.
Now we bring the Earth very close, up to about 30 km, and see how it moves in a completely perfect orbit around the black hole.
There is a kind of myth that black holes devour everything in the universe, but in fact you have to get very close to them in order to fall into it.
But what is particularly impressive from our point of view is the fact that we can always see the Earth.
She can't hide behind the black hole.
The light that comes from the earth, some of it falls into it, but some things are scattered and return to us.
So you can't hide anything behind a black hole.
If this is the battle star Galactica and you are fighting the zylons, it is better not to hide behind the black hole.
They can see them.
So our sun won't collapse into a black hole, its mass is not enough, but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
If one of them wiped out the Milky Way, it would look like that.
We would see a shadow of the black hole against the backdrop of billions of stars from the Milky Way galaxy and its glowing orbits of dust.
If we were to fall towards this black hole, we would see all the light bent around it, and we could even step into the shadows without noticing anything unusual happening.
It would be bad if we tried to ignite our engines and escape, because we couldn't do that, just as the light could not escape.
But even if the black hole is dark from the outside, it is not dark inside, because all the light from the galaxy could come in behind us.
And although due to a phenomenon of relativity (the so-called time dilation) our clocks seemed to be slowing down in relation to galactic time, it would look as if the galaxy's evolution had accelerated and shot at us just before we were crushed to death by the black hole.
It would be like a near-death experience when you see the light at the end of the tunnel. However, it would be an extensive experience of death.
(Laughter) And you could not tell anyone about the light at the end of the tunnel.
Now we have never seen such a shadow of a black hole, but black holes can be heard, even if they are invisible.
Please imagine an astrophysically realistic situation. Imagine two black holes that have spent a long life together.
Maybe once it was stars that collapsed into two black holes, each with a mass ten times the size of the sun.
We are now squeezing them together to a diameter of 60 km.
You can rotate several hundred times per second.
At the end of their lives, they circle around each other almost at the speed of light.
They can travel thousands of kilometres in a fraction of a second, and while they do so, they not only bend the room, but leave behind in their wake a sound of space, a real wave of space-time.
Space contracts and expands as it emerges from these black holes and hammers into the universe.
And they travel out into the cosmos at the speed of light.
We owe this computer simulation to a relativity working group of NASA Goddard.
It took almost 30 years for someone to solve this problem.
This was one of those groups.
Here we see two black holes circling around each other, again with the helpful, painted lines.
Maybe you can see - it's a bit unclear - but if you see the red waves leaking, these are gravitational waves.
They actually represent the sound of the sounding space and will escape from these black holes at the speed of light, as they become quieter and eventually merge into a rotating, silent black hole.
If you were close enough, the sound of the converging and expanding space would boom in your ears.
You would literally be able to hear the sound.
Of course, your head would also be pressed and stretched, which would be quite unpleasant, which is why you would also have trouble understanding what is happening.
But I would like to show you what sounds we would predict here.
This is from my working group - a slightly less glamorous computer model.
Imagine a lighter black hole falling into a very heavy black hole.
What you hear is the sound with which the slight black hole hammers into space, every time it passes close by.
When it goes away, it's a bit too quiet.
But it strikes like a mallet and literally smashes the universe, making it vibrate like a drum.
We can predict what this will sound like.
We know that if it falls into it, it gets faster and louder.
And finally we hear the little guy falling into the big guy.
I've never heard it so loud - it's really much more dramatic.
It sounds a bit disappointing at home.
More like ding, ding, ding.
This is another noise from my group.
No, I don't show you any pictures, because black holes don't leave any helpful traces of ink. Space has no colorful, painted lines.
But if you were drifting around in space during a space vacation and you would hear this here, you should make sure you get away.
(Laughter) You should really get away from this noise.
Both black holes are moving.
Both black holes come closer together.
In this case, they swing very strongly at first.
And then they merge.
This chirping is typical of the merging of two black holes that it chirps like this in the end.
This is our idea of what we would see.
Fortunately, we are here in Long Beach, California at a safe distance.
But it is very likely that two black holes have merged somewhere in the universe.
And it is just as certain that space is swinging around us, after it has probably taken millions of light years, or a million years has travelled to us at the speed of light.
But the sound is far too quiet as we could ever hear it.
Experiments are being carried out on Earth with great enthusiasm, one of which is called LIGO - the deviations are to be detected in the way space contracts and expands again, deviations in the order of magnitude smaller than an atomic nucleus over a distance of four kilometres.
It is an incredibly ambitious project and its empathy will be further developed over the next few years - in order to be able to perceive this.
There will also be a mission for space, which will hopefully start within the next ten years. It is called LISA.
Lisa will be able to see huge black holes, black holes with millions or billions of times the density of the sun.
In this picture of the Hubble telescope we see two galaxies.
They look as if they are frozen in an embrace.
Each of them probably contains a huge black hole inside.
But they are not frozen. They merge with each other.
These two black holes collide and become one over billions of years.
Our human perception is unable to capture a song of such a length of time.
But LISA could see the final stage of two giant black holes, earlier in the history of the universe, the last 15 minutes before they merge.
And it's not just about black holes, it's also about all the big disturbances in the universe - and the biggest of all is the Big Bang.
When the term was coined, it was meant to be contemptuous - "Who believes in a big bang, a big bang?"
This animation by friends of mine in the Proton Studios shows an exterior view of the Big Bang, the Big Bang.
We never really want to try; we never want to be inside the universe, because you can never be outside the universe.
So imagine you're in a big bang.
It's everywhere, all around you and space is billowing and swinging completely uncontrolled.
14 billion years are passing, but this song is still heard around us.
Galaxies are forming and generations of stars are born in these galaxies. And around one of these stars, at least one, a habitable planet orbits.
And here we sit and work like crazy on these experiments, make calculations and write computer code.
Imagine two black holes colliding a billion years ago.
Their song has been sounding through space ever since, all the time.
We did not even exist at that time.
It's getting closer and closer - 40,000 years ago we painted cave paintings.
If it was the Big Bang we recorded, it would sound like that.
It is literally the epitome of noise.
It's white noise, it's such a chaotic sound.
But it's all around us, probably if it wasn't wiped out by another process in the universe.
When we record it, it will sound like music to our ears, because it will be a quiet echo, a reverberation of the moment of our creation, of our visible universe.
So within the next two years we will be able to make the soundtrack a little louder and present the universe as a sound image.
But if we can grasp those very earliest moments, it will bring us much closer to understanding the Big Bang, which in turn brings us closer to some of the most complex, hard-to-grasp questions.
If we played a movie of the universe backwards, we would know that there has been a big bang in the past and we could even perceive the cacophony of its sound. But was our big bang the only big bang?
I think we need to ask the question: Has something like this happened before?
Will it be repeated?
I think, in the spirit of the challenge posed by TED - to rekindle the amazement - we can ask questions, at least at this last minute, which might otherwise escape us forever.
But we must ask ourselves: Is it possible that our universe is just an offshoot of a bigger story?
Or is it possible that we are just an offshoot of a multiverse - each offshoot with its own big bang in its past - maybe some of them have drum-playing black holes, others may not - in some there may be intelligent life, in others not - not in our past, not in our future, but in some way fundamentally connected to us?
So we have to ask ourselves: If there is a multiverse, do living beings exist in another fragment of this multiverse?
These are my creatures of the multiverse.
Are there other creatures in this multiverse who are thinking about us and their own origins?
And if they exist, I can imagine that they are like us, that they calculate and write computer codes, build instruments, try to make out the most distant sound of their origins and wonder who is still out there.
Thank you. Thank you.

Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvesters infected
After a mass Corona infection on a large vegetable farm in Mamming, Lower Bavaria, almost 500 people are under quarantine and are no longer allowed to leave the farm.
A security service monitors the ban on going out.
A total of 174 harvesters tested positive for the Corona pathogen Sars-CoV-2 during the series examination, as reported by the district office Dingolfing-Landau on Saturday evening.
In order to avoid further spread, we unfortunately have to take this step to protect the population, explained District Administrator Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees had already been infected in the company - this was the reason for the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm that grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and beetroot - but the cucumbers are only for insertion jars.
Mamming is a rural community with about 3300 inhabitants not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to keep calm: "According to our information, this is a closed group of people."
On the farm, infected people were separated from uninfected employees, and the site is now surrounded by a barrier fence.

From our point of view, it is precisely the hygiene conditions in the workplace and living conditions that need to be strictly controlled.

Many people believe that driving is an activity that is only reserved for people who can see.
Until now, a blind person driving a car safely and independently has been considered an impossible task.
Hello, my name is Dennis Hong, and we want to give blind people freedom and independence by building a vehicle for the blind.
Therefore, before I talk about this car for the blind, they let me talk briefly about another project that I worked on and which was called the darba Urban Challenge.
The aim was to build a robotic car that could drive itself.
They press the start, nobody touches anything, and it can reach its destination completely automatically.
In 2007 our team won half a million dollars by finishing third in the competition.
Around this time, the National Association for the Blind, or NFB, demanded that the Investigation Committee produce a car that can be driven safely and independently by a blind person.
We decided to give it a try, because we thought, hey, how difficult it could be.
We already have an automatic vehicle.
We put a blind person in and it's done, isn't it?
(Laughter) We could not have been wrong anymore.
What the National Association for the Blind (NFB) wanted was not a vehicle for blind people driving around, but a vehicle where a blind person can make active decisions and drive.
That's why we had to throw everything away and start again.
Therefore, to test this crazy idea, we developed a small buggy prototype vehicle to test its feasibility.
And in the summer of 2009, we invited dozens of young blind people from all over the country and gave them the opportunity to take a ride.
It was an absolutely great experience.
But the problem with this car was that it was designed so that it could only be driven in a controlled environment, a flat, traffic-free parking lot, and that even the lanes were highlighted with red guide cones.
Therefore, with this success, we decided to take the next big step in developing a true car that can be driven on the right roads.
How does it work?
Well, it's a pretty complicated system, but let me try to explain it, and maybe I can simplify it.
Well, we have three steps.
We have perception, calculation and non-visual interfaces.
Well, it's clear that the driver can't see, so the system needs to be able to perceive the environment and gather information for the driver.
For this, we use an initial measurement unit.
It measures the acceleration, the angular acceleration, like a human ear, an inner ear.
We merge the information with a GPS unit to get approximately the position of the car.
We also use two cameras to perceive the lanes of the road.
And we also use three laser distance measurements.
The lasers scan the surroundings to detect obstacles, a car coming towards us from the front or from behind, and also any obstacles entering the road, any obstacles around the vehicle.
After that, all this enormous amount of information is transferred to the computer, and the computer can do two things.
First of all, process the information to understand what the environment is like; these are lanes on the road, the obstacles, and this information is provided to the driver.
The system is also smart enough to calculate the safest way to operate the car.
We can also create instructions on how to control the vehicle.
But, the problem is this: How can we convey this information and instructions to a person who cannot see quickly enough and fairly accurately so that they can drive?
For this purpose, we have developed different types of non-visual user interface technology.
We started with a three-dimensional ping sound system, a vibration vest, a click wheel with voice commands, a foot stripe, and even a shoe that puts pressure on the leg.
But today, we will talk about three of these non-visual user interface technologies.
Well, the first interface technology is called DriveGrip.
This is a pair of gloves, and it has its vibrating elements on the ankle side, so they can give instructions on how to control, direction and intensity.
Another device is called SpeedStrip.
These are a chair, to be precise, it is a massage chair.
We undermine it, and we reorganize the vibrating elements into different patterns. And we use them to provide information about the speed, and also to provide instructions on how to use the throttle and brake pedal.
Therefore, they can see here how the computer sees the surroundings. And since they can't see the vibration, we even equip the driver with red LEDs so that he can really see what's going on.
These are the sensory data, and this data is forwarded to the devices via computer.
Therefore, these two devices, DriveGrip and SpeedGrip, are very effective.
But the problem is that they are stabbing devices.
So this is not a real freedom, is it?
The computer tells you how to drive, turn left, turn right, accelerate, stop.
We call it a rear-seat driver problem.
Therefore, let's move away from the stabbing devices and now focus more on the information devices.
A good example of this non-visual information interface technology is AirPix.
Consider it a monitor for the blind.
Well, it's a small tray, it has a lot of holes and it releases compressed air, so it can even draw pictures.
Therefore, even if they are blind, they can put their hand on it, see the lanes and the obstacles on the road.
In fact, they can also change the air frequency that escapes and possibly the temperature.
Therefore, it is in fact a multidimensional user interface.
Well, here you can see the left camera, the right camera seen from the vehicle, and see how the computer interprets this and sends the information to the AirPix.
For this, we show a simulator, a blind person driving and using the AirPix.
This simulator was also very useful to train the blind riders and was also quick to test different types of ideas for different types of non-visual user interfaces.
Therefore, this is how it works mainly.
But this vehicle is a prototype, and it will not enter the road until it is proven that it is safe, or safer than today's vehicles.
And I really believe that this can happen.
But nevertheless, will society accept such a radical idea?
How will we regulate the insurance?
How will we issue driving licences?
Apart from the technological challenges, there are many kinds of hurdles that we have to overcome before it becomes a reality.
Of course, the main goal of this project is to create a car for a blind person.
But potentially more important than this is the huge benefit of the spin-off technology that can be derived from this project.
The sensors needed can be seen in the dark in fog and rain.
And together with this new type of interfaces, we can use this technology and use it in safer cars for normal-sighted people.
Or for blind people, in everyday household appliances, in training and in the office.
Imagine a teacher writing in a classroom on the blackboard, and a blind student can see and read what he has written by using these non-visual interface technologies.
This is priceless.
Therefore, the things I have shown you today are just the beginning.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)

Discussing the abolition of the 50 + 1 rule
Former DFB president Reinhard Grindel has recommended thinking about abolishing the 50 + 1 rule.
German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates a fait accompli, Grindel told the "Bild am Sonntag."
He stressed: "For the clubs that are most likely to be dangerous in Bavaria and Dortmund, the 50 + 1 rules do not work anyway: See Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, one cannot avoid the debate as to whether it is not necessary to make it easier for associations that want to break into this phalanx to involve investors. "
However, he has doubts as to whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority shareholdings, which are prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50 + 1 rule.
It remains a legal risk to draw investment fences around the Bundesliga as a business location in a European internal market, said Grindel.
The former head of the DFB sees the danger that "the attempts to create a more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will ultimately only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but will not lead to more excitement in the championship."

I committed a breach of compliance and it was right to draw conclusions from it, said Grindel.
I was completely transparent and unsuspecting about the ominous watch gift.
Many people in the DFB knew about it. "
He had never "made a secret of the gift," assured the 58-year-old.
This may be called naive, at least this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption. "

Arrived professionally - not yet in private

In the end, everything went very fast: In mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she would succeed Lutz Feller at the Eggenfelden notary's office.

In 2016, she went on parental leave, followed by moving to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken over representative services in various notary offices.
When the position in Eggenfelden was advertised because of the approaching retirement of Lutz Feller, she saw the right time for full career re-entry, explains the 39-year-old.
The team of her predecessor, who will take over the holiday representation at the notary's office in the future, has completely taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer - and immediately has some praise for the firm's team: "It's going very well!"

BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The biggest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be 20 percent filled at the start of the season in the event of a fan return.

If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people in Germany alone are in short-time work, then the need for entertainment is limited, explained Cramer.
The head of marketing in Dortmund praised the BVB professionals for their partial salary waiver, which should help to overcome the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their salary waiver has a different effect than if we put 100 people working in merchandising on short-time work."

Kalbitz expulsion from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "fig leaf"
From the point of view of the FDP, the expulsion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is only a "fig leaf" and does not change the character of the party.
The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the right-wing extremists in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD, the FDP domestic politician Benjamin Strasser told the news agency dpa in Berlin.
On Saturday, after several hours of hearing in Stuttgart, the Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD confirmed the expulsion of Kalbitz, which was decided by the majority of the federal executive board in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD parliamentary group in the Brandenburg state parliament.
If the AfD were really interested in consistently removing right-wing extremists from its party, officials such as Björn Höcke and his supporters would have been excluded long ago, said Strasser.
However, there is no political will for this in the AfD, because right-wing extremism now belongs to the party. "
CSU General Secretary Markus Blume commented similarly: "The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded does not say anything and does not change anything," he told the "Welt am Sonntag."
Rather, it speaks volumes about how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist still has in the middle of the AfD. "
Blume assumes that the AfD will again be below five percent in elections in the future.
The days of the AfD in parliaments are numbered. "
Kalbitz was one of the spokesmen of the now officially dissolved "wing" around the Thuringian AfD state and parliamentary group chairman Björn Höcke; the Protection of the Constitution classifies the Strönung as an "assured right-wing extremist endeavor."
In May, the AfD federal executive had thrown Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason he stated that Kalbitz did not indicate an earlier membership in the now banned far-right "Heimattreuen Deutsche Jugend" (HDJ) and with the Republicans when he joined the party.
Kalbitz denies membership in the HDJ.
The chairman of the left parliamentary group in the Brandenburg state parliament, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court did not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf has only eaten chalk.
The AfD remains a far-right party, with or without Kalbitz. "
Neither the federal party nor the right wing will be weakened with this decision.
The manoeuvre of the Meuthen troops is transparent.
They want to avoid further observation by the Protection of the Constitution and try to get through under the radar, said Walter.
The AfD will not get rid of the ghosts it called.
An expulsion does not change anything, commented the Brandenburg SPD general secretary Erik Stohn on the decision in the Kalbitz case.
Here the AfD state association and the parliamentary group held their right-wing leader to this day. "
The legal dispute over Kalbitz's membership in the AfD will continue.
The latter announced on Saturday that he would now take civil action against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court.

North Sea wind farms provide a good 21 percent more electricity
The wind power plants on the German North Sea fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid in the first six months of the year.
This is a good 21 percent more than in the same period last year, said the network operator Tennet in Bayreuth.
TenneT is responsible for the transmission of North Sea electricity to the mainland and the transmission through the German electricity grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which do not belong to Tennet's grid area, have fed in another 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, wind power from the North Sea and Baltic Sea comes to 13.73 TWh, compared to a good 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind power in Germany, which is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms provide higher generation capacity
In addition to the wind conditions, the increased contribution of offshore wind energy has resulted from higher generation capacities, as new wind farms have been connected to the grid over the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea were all running at full power at the same time, they could generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatts.
By 2030 it is expected to rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
In Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore grid connections, said Tennet Managing Director Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, even at sea, wind farms cannot utilize their capacity, but reach about 40 percent.
The record day so far this year is January 2, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, equivalent to three to four nuclear power plants.
This means that almost seven million households could be supplied with electricity.

More air traffic controllers in Worms in the future
Worms University goes further into the air: "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" is donating a professorship for "Air Traffic Management."
A corresponding contract between the university and DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and will start in 2021.
With the professorship, it is possible to start studying not only in the summer semester, but also in the winter semester.
This makes it possible to train twice as many students as before.
At the same time, capacities at both the university and the air traffic control academy of DFS are being utilized evenly.
DFS will advise the university on setting up and filling the professorship.
Represented at the university since 2019
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students have been studying Air Traffic Management as part of their training as an air traffic controller at Worms University of Applied Sciences.
Nine students have already started this year.
So far, DFS's experience has been very positive and the students' performance is outstanding.
The combination of studies and air traffic controller training contributes significantly to further increasing the attractiveness of the air traffic controller profession.
In these times, promotion is not easy for us economically.
However, we firmly expect air traffic to recover and to grow again in the long term.
In order to be able to fulfil our statutory mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel, says Professor Klaus-Dieter SCHEURLE, Managing Director of DFS at the signing of the contract.
For DFS, the endowed professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, interdisciplinary knowledge base in the long term.
We are therefore continuing our good cooperation with the university and at the same time confirming our attractiveness as an employer. "
This is also underlined by Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of Worms University of Applied Sciences: "The endowed professorship forms an important bridge between science and business.
With it, we would like to build on the existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual bachelor's degree program Air Traffic Management. "
The trust of German air traffic control is both a motivation and an obligation for Worms University of Applied Sciences to further expand its teaching and research expertise in the future fields of aviation.
By working for the air traffic controllers of tomorrow, the university could set very special highlights and innovative priorities for its students with the first endowed professorship for a dual course of study.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary at the Ministry of Science, Continuing Education and Culture, emphasizes: "With its focus on aviation, Worms University of Applied Sciences has a unique selling point in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university. "

Heil wants to examine other industries after the meat industry
The Corona crisis brought the conditions in parts of the meat industry to light again.
Tightening the laws are imminent.
But are they right - and will it stick to that?
Federal Labour Minister Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to review other industries in accordance with the now planned strict regulations against maladministration in the meat industry.
We will look at the industry for industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary, Heil told the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employers are already warning against restricting work contracts in general.
Following the mass Corona outbreak at the meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the federal cabinet wants to pass a law of salvation this Wednesday.
Large slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to deploy external personnel for slaughter, dismantling and meat processing.
For this purpose, the use of contractual and temporary workers is to be banned there.
Employer President Ingo Kramer told dpa: "Hands off a general restriction on work contracts and employee assignment if you don't want to completely strangle the economy."
Work contracts, for example, are mandatory for large areas of crafts, construction and plant engineering as the basis for their added value to the customer.
Individual misconduct cannot destroy such an important instrument. "
Heil assured: "My goal is not to ban works contracts everywhere in the German economy."
Work contracts are meaningful.
If an industrial company commissions a craftsman to install a safety system, this is a normal work contract. "
The German meat industry considers a ban on works contracts and temporary work in its industry alone to be unconstitutional.

Often they did not have a break.
Wages were retained for protective equipment or rent.
It was also noted that the situation in the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively strict law had already come into force for the meat industry in 2017.
However, these were bypassed by "tricky constructions."
Now we need to fundamentally clean up. "
The politician announced: "In the Occupational Health and Safety Act, which we intend to adopt in the cabinet at the end of July, there are also measures that do not only affect the meat industry - for example, higher testing rates for occupational health and safety or clear criteria for community accommodation."
The draft presented to the dpa includes amendments to the law on safeguarding workers' rights in the meat industry and the Occupational Health and Safety Act.

Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - Despite all the threatened penalties and court rulings, drivers continue to accelerate in countless illegal races on the roads of Baden-Württemberg: Last year and the first four months of this year, the police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
There are no comparative figures for the years before, but the racers are increasingly doing the judicial authorities work: In 2018, a total of 155 investigations for illegal races were conducted at the public prosecutor's offices between Konstanz and Mannheim, a year later there were already 252 and in the current year until the beginning of June 151.
The races were less about organised events, according to the response of the Ministry of the Interior to an inquiry from the state parliament SPD.
In most cases, the drivers spontaneously competed against each other or escaped from the police - this is also reported as an illegal race.
At the wheel were mainly German men between the ages of 18 and 60.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases are the racers caught and asked to pay: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines have been imposed since 2018 and 15 prison sentences have been pronounced.
However, there is no evidence that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
Rather, other drivers reacted more sensitively than before due to the numerous tragic accidents and trials of past years and reported more frequently, said a ministry spokesman.
The motorway 8 is particularly popular with racers. Again and again, motorists slow down traffic there in order to gain space and use the free track for a race.
Last August a dozen drivers were caught near Kirchheim unter Teck, three months earlier there were even 18 drivers on the A8 near Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular "race track"
On the A81 the police registered even more races than on any other federal motorway.
With a speed limit, an attempt is made to slow down the racers on the particularly affected section between Engen and Geisingen.
The mostly high-priced and souped-up sports and luxury cars often have Swiss license plates, because the drivers switch to the grass in Germany because of the heavy penalties for driving too fast and racing in the neighbouring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit must not be reduced to a few distances: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometres per hour, we would tackle this problem on motorways," says Martin Rivoir, the transport expert of the SPD parliamentary group.
The inhibition threshold for racers would be significantly higher if you were not allowed to travel here and there legally with 200 kilometres per hour or more. "
Rivoir thinks less about education or image campaigns: "Anyone who ignores all rules in such a way and puts not only their own lives but also the lives of other road users at risk, can hardly be reached with reason."
ADAC calls for stronger police crackdown
However, this is not enough for the ADAC: "We assume that speeders will not be deterred by the speed limits," says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and Environment at the ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and tougher controls on the affected routes.
Not infrequently, the high-speed test of strength turns into painful and consequential seriousness: Since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people across the country have died in the races, two of them uninvolved in a night crash in downtown Stuttgart and one in Gerlingen.
Two young men are said to have engaged in a car race there in November.
One of the vehicles came off the road, crashed into a garden wall and remained lying on its side, the 18-year-old passenger died.
21 other people have been injured in the races over the past two years.
However, according to Interior Minister Thomas Strobl, tougher penalties are not necessary: "There is no need for legislative action to toughen illegal motor vehicle races," says the Interior Ministry's paper.

The first time I visited Antarctica was almost 10 years ago, where I saw my first icebergs.
I was afraid of it.
My heart was racing, I was dizzy while trying to grasp what was in front of me.
The icebergs around me protruded almost 60 meters out of the water. And I could only be amazed that it was a snowflake on another snowflake, year after year.
Icebergs are born as the calf of a glacier or by breaking out of ice floes.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They interact in a clear way with their surroundings and their experiences.
Some refuse to give up and cling to the bitter end, while others can't stand it anymore and collapse in a fit of dramatic passion.
When you look at an iceberg, it is easy to think that they are isolated, separated and alone, just as we humans often see each other.
But the truth is far from it.
As an iceberg melts, I breathe in its prehistoric atmosphere.
As the iceberg melts, it releases mineral-rich drinking water that nourishes many life forms.
In my photographs of these icebergs, I act as if I were taking portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these individual moments they exist in this way, and will never exist again.
It is not death when they melt; it is not an end, but a continuation of their path along the life cycle.
Part of the ice in the icebergs I am photographing is very young - a few thousand years old.
And part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old.
The last pictures I would like to show you show an iceberg that I photographed in Kekertsuatsiak in Greenland.

This is the average size of a Greenland iceberg.
It protrudes about 120 feet from the water, or 40 meters.
And this video is in real time.
(Music) And just like that, the iceberg shows you another side of his personality.
Thank you.

Nuremberg: Unauthorized tuning meeting - police intervene, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
On Saturday night hundreds of cars and at times over 1000 people took part in a "tuning meeting" in the parking lot of a furniture store.
The police implemented their announcement to increase the control of such events.
A big tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (July 25, 2020) in Nuremberg's southern city.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the Middle Franconian police, at around 10.30 p.m. the Nuremberg traffic police detected an increased volume of vehicles in the area of a large parking lot in Ingolstädter Straße.
As a result, the police carried out a large number of vehicle inspections.
Only recently the police announced their intention to step up action against so-called autoposers.
Illegal tuning meeting in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the "scene"
The officers at the top counted about 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, according to the police.

Apparently, the majority of the relevant scene responded to the police appeal.
Based on the vehicles and persons on site, it can be assumed that these were mostly onlookers.

However, when marketing the figure, manufacturer Fisher-Price focuses on its ability to speak with synchronous mouth movements.
They were not allowed to sleep.
You all know that what I'm going to say is true.
The intuition that inequality weakens social cohesion existed even before the French Revolution.
What is new is that we now have proof. We can compare societies, more equal and more unequal, and see what causes inequality.
I would like to show you statistics and explain why there are connections between them.
Let's see what a poor bunch we are.
(Laughter) I would like to start with a paradox.
This shows life expectancy and gross national income - in rich countries on average.
You can see that the countries on the right, Norway and the USA, for example, are twice as rich as Israel, Greece, Portugal on the left.
And that doesn't change their life expectancy.
There is nothing in favour of a connection.
But within societies, there are enormous social health disparities across society.
Here, again, life expectancy.
Here are small areas in England and Wales - the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.
A big difference between the poor and the rest of us.
Even people just below the peak are in worse health than those at the very top.
So income is very important within individual societies, and none at all between them.
The explanation for this paradox is that within societies we are dealing with a relative income, the social position, the status - where we are in relation to each other, and how large the gap between us is.
And when you understand this, you immediately ask yourself: What happens when the differences get bigger, or smaller, when income disparities rise or fall?
And I'll show you that now.
Not with hypothetical data.
With UN data - the same used by the World Bank - on the extent of income disparities in richly developed market democracies.
The measure we use, because it is easy to understand and available for download, is how much richer the top 20 percent are than the bottom 20 percent of each country.
You can see that in the same countries on the left - Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden - the top 20 percent are around 3 1 ⁄ 2, 4 times as rich as the bottom 20 percent.
But on the other hand - the UK, Portugal, the US, Singapore - the differences are twice as large.
On this scale, we are twice as unequal as some of the successful market democracies.
Now I'm showing you what this is doing to our societies.
We have collected data on problems with social disparities, the problems that are more common at the bottom of the social ladder.
Internationally comparable data on life expectancy, children's mathematics, reading and writing skills, child mortality and murder rates, the proportion of the population imprisoned, teenage pregnancies, trust, obesity, mental illnesses - which are included in the standard diagnosis of drug and alcohol addiction - and social mobility.
We have summarized them in an index.
All with equal weight.
There is a kind of average value of these factors for each country.
And here you see it in relation to the degree of inequality that I have shown you, to which I will come back again and again.
The more unequal countries are performing worse in all these social problems.
This is an unusually high correlation.
But if you put the same index of health and social problems in relation to GNI per capita, to gross national income, there is nothing left, no correlation.
We have worried that people think we have only chosen the problems that support our argument and constructed this evidence, which is why we have also published an essay in the British Medical Journal on the UNICEF Index of Child Welfare.
In it, 40 different components were put together by other people.
The index contains whether children can talk to their parents, whether they have books at home, their immunization rates, whether there is bullying at school.
Everything flows in.
Here the index is in proportion to our inequality values.
Children perform worse in unequal societies.
A highly significant relationship.
Again, if you compare the child welfare index with the national per capita income, there is no correlation, not even a hint.
All the data I have shown you so far say the same thing.
The average well-being of our societies no longer depends on national income and economic growth.
These are crucial in poorer countries, but not in the richly developed world.
But the differences between us, where we are compared to each other, have become very important.
I'll show you some parts of our index now.
Here, for example, is the trust.
Simply the proportion of the population who believes that most people can be trusted.
The data comes from the World Values Survey.
On the more unequal side, about 15 percent of the population believe that others can be trusted.
But in the same societies, the figure is up to 60 or 65 percent.
And for the degree of involvement in communal life or social capital, there are similarly close references to inequality.
We've done all this work twice.
First with the rich, developed countries, and then in a second test field again with the 50 American countries - with the same question: Do the more unequal states perform worse on all these scales?
According to data collected by the US government, trust is associated with inequality.
A very similar distribution over a similar range of trust levels.
The same thing is happening here.
Our basic result is that almost all factors associated with trust internationally do the same in the 50 US states, in a separate testing environment.
And this is not just a happy coincidence.
Here are mental illnesses.
The WHO has compiled these figures by conducting the same diagnostic interviews with randomly selected test subjects to compare the rates of mental illness in societies.
This is the percentage of the population who were mentally ill last year.
It goes from 8 percent to three times that amount - entire societies that have three times the rates of mental illness as others.
And again a high correlation to inequality.
And here violence.
These red dots are American states, the blue triangles are Canadian provinces.
Pay attention to the scale of differences.
It ranges from 15 murders per million to 150.
That is the proportion of the population in detention.
There is about ten times the difference on the lateral log scale.
It is estimated that there are about 40 to 400 people detained.
This ratio is not primarily due to higher crime rates.
In some places this is a partial factor.
But the main reason is tougher court rulings.
And more unequal societies are more likely to stick to the death penalty.
Here are children dropping out of school.
Again, pretty big differences.
With devastating effects on the benefits of talent from the population.
Here is social mobility.
Actually, a measurement of mobility based on income.
The question is: Do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons, or is there no connection between them?
On the more unequal side, the income of fathers is much more important -- in Great Britain, in the USA.
And in the Scandinavian countries, the income of the fathers is much less decisive.
There is more social mobility.
We like to say - and I know that many Americans are here in the audience - if Americans want to live the American dream, they should go to Denmark.
(Laughter) (applause) I've just introduced you to a few things.
I could have shown you a lot of other problems.
All these problems are more common at the bottom of the social gradient.
But there are countless problems with social disparities that are worse in more unequal countries - not just a bit, but somewhere between 2 times and 10 times as widespread.
Imagine these costs, the human costs.
But I would like to come back to the graph, in which we have summarized everything, to show two things.
On the one hand, Graph for Graph shows that the countries that are performing poorly, regardless of the result, are apparently the more unequal, and those who are better off seem to be the Nordic countries and Japan.
So what we see is a general social dysfunction that goes hand in hand with inequality.
This applies not just to one or two things, but most of them.
You can see the other very important aspect of this graph below, Sweden and Japan - very different countries in many respects.
The woman's position, how much they hold on to the nuclear family, is due to the opposite poles of the rich, developed world.
Another very important difference is how they achieve greater equality.
In Sweden, there are huge differences in earnings that are offset by taxation, the general welfare state, generous social benefits, etc.
It's completely different in Japan.
Even before the tax, there are smaller differences in earnings.
There are lower taxes.
A smaller welfare state.
And in our analysis of the American states, we find the same contrast.
Some states are successful through redistribution, others are doing well because they have small income disparities before tax.
Our conclusion is that it doesn't matter how to achieve greater equality as long as you somehow achieve it.
I do not mean perfect equality, I am talking about something that already exists in rich market democracies.
Another surprising part of the picture is that not only the poor are affected by inequality.
Apparently there is some truth in John Donne's "No one is an island."
In several studies, one can compare how people in more or less the same countries perform at every level of the social hierarchy.
This is just one example.
Infant mortality.
Some Swedes have kindly classified a large proportion of their infant deaths according to the British register for socio-economic classification.
This is an anachronistic classification according to the occupations of the fathers, so single parents are kept separately.
But where "low social class" is noted, this means unskilled craftsmanship.
Then there are the trained craft professions in the middle, then the subordinate non-craft professions, up to the higher-level professions - doctors, lawyers, executives of larger companies.
You can see that Sweden is better than Great Britain, across the entire social hierarchy.
The biggest differences are at the bottom of society.
But even at the top, it seems to have a small advantage to live in a more equal society.
We show this with five different datasets dealing with educational success and health in the USA and internationally.
This seems to be the case in general - greater equality is the most important thing at the bottom, but even at the top it has some advantages.
But I should say something else about what is happening.
I am concerned with the psychosocial effects of inequality.
This has to do with feelings of superiority and inferiority, the feeling of being appreciated or devalued, respected or despised.
And, of course, the feeling of status competition resulting from it drives consumerism in our society.
It also leads to status uncertainty.
We are more concerned about how we are judged by others, whether we are seen as attractive, smart, etc.
The social judgments are increasing, and the fear of these judgments is increasing.
Interestingly, there is similar research in social psychology: Some people have evaluated 208 different studies in which volunteers were invited to psychological laboratories to measure their stress hormones and their response to stressful tasks.
What interested her in the evaluation was which types of stress most reliably raised the cortis collective level, that of the central stress hormone.
And the result was: Tasks that posed a threat to social assessment - threats to self-confidence or social status, in which others could judge their own performance negatively.
These types of stress have a very specific effect on the physiology of stress.
We have been criticized.
Of course there are people who don't like it here and people who find it very amazing.
I should tell you, however, if we are criticized for a targeted selection of our data, we never select specifically for our purposes.
Our absolute principle is: If our data source has data for one of the countries we are looking at, it will be analyzed.
Our data source determines whether it is reliable data, not us.
Anything else would be bias.
What about other countries?
There are 200 studies on health relative to income and equality in academic peer review journals.
This is not confined to these countries, it is a very simple demonstration.
The same countries, the same inequality scale, one problem after another.
Why are we not checking other factors?
We have shown that per capita income makes no difference.
And, of course, others with more sophisticated methods have also reviewed poverty and education, and others.
What about causality?
A correlation does not prove causality.
We have spent a lot of time doing this.
In fact, people are very familiar with the causal references in some of these results.
The big news in our understanding of the driving forces for long-term health in the richly developed world is how much chronic social stress is affecting the immune system, the cardiovascular system.
Or, for example, the reason why violence is more widespread in more unequal societies is because people are sensitive to being despised.
To cope with this, we need to clarify what happens after the tax and what happens before the tax.
We need to limit the income, the bonus culture income at the top.
We must hold our bosses accountable to the employees as best we can.
But the message to take away is that if we fix the income gap between us, we can improve the actual quality of human life.
Suddenly, there is a lever for the psychosocial well-being of entire societies, and that is very exciting.
Thank you.

Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualified for Champions League
London (dpa) - English football champion Manchester United returns to the Champions League after a year's absence.
The Red Devils secured third place in the table on the last match day of the Premier League with a 2-0 (0-0) win over their direct rivals Leicester City.
The Foxes now have to settle for the Europa League, because Chelsea FC passed by and also qualified for the premier league in fourth place.
In the fight against relegation, Aston Villa was able to cheer.
Manchester United took the lead with a penalty kick from Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in injury time, Jesse Lingard (90th + 8) scored the final score.
Chelsea, opponents of FC Bayern in the Champions League round of 16, won in parallel 2-0 (2-0) against Wolverhampton Wanderers thanks to Mason Mount (45th + 1) and Olivier Giroud (45th + 4).
That means a lot to me, said coach Frank Lampard, who is also in the final of the FA Cup against Arsenal in his first season as Chelsea coach.
Chelsea's win over Wolverhampton also benefited Tottenham Hotspur, which passed the Wolves with a meagre 1-1 (1-0) at Crystal Palace and started in sixth place in the Europa League.
Aston Villa won the long-distance duel with FC Watford and AFC Bournemouth, but had to tremble for a long time for class retention at West Ham United.
The late lead of Jack Grealish (84th) was immediately compensated by Andrej Jarmolenko (85th).
The 1-1 (0-0) was enough because Watford lost 2-3 (1-3) at Arsenal.
The club, which had three coaches in the season, is relegated after five years in the first league.
Just like Bournemouth, which could not save itself by a 3: 1 (2: 1) at Everton FC.
In the end, one point was missing.
Liverpool FC, which has been the English champion since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3-1 (1-1) victory at Newcastle United.
99 points is the highest score the Reds have ever scored in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team narrowly missed the points record in English football.
Manchester City holds the record with 100 points in the 2017 / 18 season.
After the Newcastle lead in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) shot the game for Liverpool on Sunday.
It was an extraordinary season for this wonderful club, said goalscorer van Dijk after the match, "which should encourage us to defend the title.
It will be difficult. "
The Premier League bosses should also be satisfied in the end.

I would like to show you today how we will make things in the future.
I believe that our buildings and machinery will soon assemble, duplicate and repair themselves.
I will show you what I think of today's production methods and then compare them with some natural systems.
In the current manufacturing industry, we have skyscrapers - two and a half years [construction time], half to one million parts, quite complex, new and exciting technologies made of steel, concrete, glass.
We have exciting machines that bring us into space - five years [construction time], two and a half million pieces.
On the other hand, if you look at natural systems, you'll find proteins that have two million types and can fold in ten microseconds, or DNA with three billion base pairs that can be copied in about an hour.
So there is all this complexity in our natural systems, but they are extremely efficient, much more efficient than anything we can produce, far more complex than anything we can build.
They are much more energy efficient.
They almost never make mistakes.
And they are durable, because they can repair themselves.
So there are a lot of interesting things to discover with natural systems.
And if we manage to incorporate this into our built environment, we have an exciting potential for new construction methods.
And I believe that the key is self-assembly.
In my opinion, if we want to use self-assembly in our physical environment, there are four key factors.
The first is that we need to decipher all the complexity of the things we want to build - our buildings and machinery.
And we need to translate this into simple sequences - virtually the DNA of how our buildings work.
Then we need programmable parts that can use this sequence to fold or reconfigure.
We need activating energy so that our parts from the program can fold up.
And we need a kind of redundancy to correct mistakes, so that what we want to build really happens.
I will show you some projects that my colleagues and I are working on at MIT, so that self-assembly can be realized in the future.
The first two are MacroBot and DeciBot.
These projects are large-scale, reconfigurable robots - proteins two and a half to four meters long.
They are equipped with electromechanical devices, sensors.
You decode what you want to fold into a sequence of angles - minus 120, minus 120, 0, 0, 120, minus 120 - something like that; a sequence of angles, or rotations, and you send that sequence through the chain.
Each unit picks up its message - minus 120 - it rotates accordingly, checks whether it has arrived, and forwards it to the neighboring unit.
These are the brilliant scientists, engineers and designers who worked on this project.
And I think it makes one thing really clear: Is this really scalable?
I mean, thousands of dollars, many hours of work to create this two and a half meter high robot.
Can we really scale it up? Can we really embed robotics in every part?
The next project calls this into question and looks at the passive nature or the passive attempt to make reconfiguration programmable.
But it goes a step further and tries to make actual calculations possible.
It basically integrates the most fundamental component of IT, the digital logic gate, directly into the parts.
This is a NAND gate.
You have a tetrahedron, which represents the gate that will carry out the calculations, and you have two input tetrahedrons.
One represents the user's input while making the building blocks.
The other comes from the previous component, which was arranged.
And then it delivers an output in three-dimensional space.
This means that the user can enter what the components should do.
It carries out calculations based on what it has done before, and what the user asks him to do.
And now it's time to move in three-dimensional space - up and down.
On the left side, the input [1.1] corresponds to the output 0 that goes down.
On the right side, the input [0.0] is equivalent to the output 1 that goes high.
What this really means is that our structures now contain plans for what we want to build.
So you have all the information about what has been built.
This means that we can achieve a form of self-replication.
In this case, I call it self-directed replication, because the structure contains the exact blueprints.
If mistakes occur, you can replace a part.
All the local information is integrated to show how to fix it.
So you could have something that climbs along and reads and provides an output from one to one.
It is directly integrated; there are no external instructions.
The last project I'm going to show is called Biased Chains, and it's probably the most exciting example of self-assembling systems we have at the moment.
It picks up the ability for reconfiguration and programming and creates a completely passive system.
Basically, you have a chain of elements.
Each element is completely identical and they are polarized.
Every chain, or element, wants to turn right or left.
So while assembling the chain, you're basically programming it.
Each unit is told whether it should turn right or left.
When you shake the chain, it folds into a configuration that you have programmed - in this case a spiral or in this case two cubes lying next to each other.
So you can passively program any possible three-dimensional shape - or one-dimensional, two-dimensional - into this chain.
What does this tell us about the future?
I think it tells us that there are possibilities for self-assembly, replication and repair in our physical structures, buildings and machinery.
There are new possibilities for programming in these parts.
And this gives rise to new possibilities for IT.
We will have spatial programming.
Imagine that our buildings, bridges, machines, all our components could carry out calculations.
This would mean parallel and distributed computing power, new design possibilities.
So there is an exciting potential for this.
I think these projects, which I have shown here, are only a tiny step towards this future if we implement these new technologies for a new, self-creating world.
Thank you.

Arrests and violence during demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against Netanyahu's head of government are becoming increasingly intense.
During the night there were violent clashes.
On Sunday night in Jerusalem, the Israeli police violently cracked down on participants in a demonstration against the right-wing conservative Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Twelve people have been arrested for participating in riots, said police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld.
Among other things, the police used water cannon to break up the rally.
According to media reports, about 6,000 people gathered near Netanyahu's official residence on Saturday evening.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu's handling of the Corona crisis.

North Korea seals off border town after Corona suspected case
North Korea has so far seen its own measures to ward off the coronavirus as a "shining success."
Now the country is reporting a case of suspicion for the first time.
Because of a first official Corona suspected case in the country, North Korea has completely sealed off a big city for fear of a catastrophe.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defense measures in the past six months, "the malignant virus may have been introduced into the country," state media reported.
A state of emergency has been declared for the region around the border town of Kaesong.
The communist leadership declared the highest level of alert.
If the suspected case is confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the isolated country.
North Korea has not yet registered a single infection and described its defensive measures as a "shining success."
The information was doubted abroad.
The symptoms of the disease were reportedly detected in an "outlier" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
The person had fled to South Korea three years ago and has now returned across the border.
There was initially no confirmation from South Korea of the border crossing within the four kilometres wide and largely mined military buffer zone.
However, according to reports from the national news agency Yonhap, South Korea's military acknowledged the possibility of crossing the border illegally into North Korea as high.
Investigations were conducted on a number of people.
On Saturday, North Korea called an emergency meeting of the Politburo of the Workers' Party, chaired by ruler Kim Jong Un, because of the suspected case.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive disaster."
Kim had already ordered on Friday as a preventive measure to "completely block Kaesong and isolate each district and region from others," it continued.
The person concerned, as well as all the people in Kaesong who had been in contact with her, were quarantined.
Accordingly, the party's central military commission is to investigate the "outlier" and the behaviour of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose severe penalties.
It is estimated that about 300,000 people live in Kaesong.

Everyone thinks they know better, says Klein, who has been a member of the municipal council for a year as the only representative of the citizens' list of Pforzheim.
In fact, after reading the contracts, he is in this position: "I know what I'm talking about."
The exit is cheaper for the city and, contrary to statements by the city administration, the Technical Town Hall is to be renovated for 8.5 million euros after grants, of which Klein is convinced.
The city will develop very differently from what is predicted in the town hall and by business advocates.
Shaping the city through its own efforts and not an investor: This is his plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP / FW / UB / LED faction, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It also essentially envisages the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, the keeping of the Schloßberg open, the rental of the ex-Thale for administrative space and a smaller downtown transformation ideally with local agencies.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues will play a central role.
Among other things, the municipal council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the population of Pforzheim from health noise pollution caused by road traffic, many of which include speed reductions.
In a press release, the local transport club Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of speed 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of the fact that this has to happen, because they have only contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus noise due to the neglect of regular bus traffic with thinned cycles and little commitment to bicycle traffic, according to the VCD.
The municipal council also votes on the city's participation in the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim / Enzkreis.
Also on the agenda are the accession to the climate protection pact of the state of Baden-Württemberg, the reassessment of parental contributions in the municipal daycare centres and the application for inclusion in the federal government's smart city funding.

Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with a lot of delay
With a delay of almost half a year, Tim Zimmermann will start his premiere season in the ADAC GT Masters on July 31.
Before the league of super sports cars can commence regular operation, the first test drives were scheduled.
For Zimmermann, it was all about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 better.
The Corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from embarking on his first business trip in Grasser Racing's new Lamborghini Huracan.
This was now possible under special hygiene conditions.
The 23-year-old from Langenargen made his first laps at the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his premiere in the GT3 car.
There are already a few things that are different from the pre-season Porsche, says Zimmermann.
With the ABS, for example, you have to go into the corners in a different way.
But it was a lot of fun. "
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite his only 25 years, the Dutchman is already experienced in GT sports and was able to help his new team-mate in many things.
I'm not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series also brings new challenges, says Zimmermann.
Steijn and I get along brilliantly and we have made enormous progress from session to session at the Lausitzring. "
This is exactly where - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will host its first race.
From July 31, the 33 super sports cars will race through Lusatia.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 newcomers to the series, knows the track.
In 2015 he was the last guest at the Motodrom.
It worked quickly and I didn't have to get used to the track, says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafen racing community Graf Zeppelin.
The Lausitzring has many fast passages that you have to hit optimally in order to be fast. "
How fast Zimmermann really is then, it turns out in two weeks.
Of course, the teams play a bit of poker during the tests, he says.
In the end, we are very satisfied and are looking forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring. "
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a densely packed calendar.
Seven races are scheduled until the beginning of November.

British Transport Secretary caught cold by quarantine decision
The British government's decision to quarantine holidaymakers to Spain for two weeks after their return has caught the country's transport minister cold, according to press reports.
Accordingly, Grant Shapps is currently on vacation in Spain, of all places, while his colleagues at home decided on the measure on Saturday.
Because of the rising Corona numbers in Spain, the cabinet in London removed the country from the list of countries from which entry without quarantine conditions is possible.
The new regulation will apply from today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to be quarantined after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But the rule applies to those who are only on vacation on the deadline, only from Saturday, August 1, and has not been introduced overnight.
By the way, Spain is still regarded as one of the "safe countries" in Austria for which no quarantine is required in Austria.
Many ministers may have known in advance that there is a possibility of a quarantine being imposed on holidaymakers in Spain, commented Labour MP Diane Abbot.
But apparently nobody bothered to tell Grant Shapps. "

Do you know how many types of flowering plants there are?
A quarter of a million - that is the number of known species - a quarter of a million species of flowering plants.
And flowers are real devil guys.
Plants have a lot of trouble producing them.
They need an enormous amount of energy and raw materials.
Why do they make this effort?
The answer to this is, of course, like so much in the world: Sex.
I know what you're thinking of when you look at these pictures.
And the answer as to why sexual reproduction is so important -- there are many other ways for plants to reproduce.
Let's take offshoots; they can have sex with themselves, so to speak; they can pollinate themselves.
But they actually need to spread their genes to mix them with other genes so that they can occupy ecological niches.
This is how evolution works.
Plants pass on this information about pollen.
Some of you may have seen some of these pictures before.
As I always say, everyone would have to have a scanning electron microscope at home to see it.
There are as many different types of pollen as there are flowering plants.
And this is very useful for forensics and so on.
Most of the pollen that causes hay fever comes from plants that use the wind to spread their pollen, which is a very inefficient process, which is why so much of it ends up in our noses.
Because the plants throw out very large quantities, in the hope that the male sex cells in the pollen will only accidentally hit another flower.
All grasses, i.e. all cereal plants and most trees transport pollen through the wind.
However, most species use insects for their own purposes. And this is the smarter way, as less pollen is needed.
The insects and other species can bring the pollen directly to their destination.
We are naturally aware of the relationship between insects and plants.
This is a symbiotic relationship. Whether flies, birds or bees, they also benefit from it, usually from the nectar.
This symbiosis has led to some wonderful adjustments - the hummingbird warmer is a wonderful adaptation.
The plant benefits from the fact that the hummingbird spreads the pollen.
Plants have developed small runways for bees that do not otherwise find their way.
On many plants there are markings similar to other insects.
These are the dust bags of a lily, a very clever construction. When an unsuspecting insect lands on it, the bags fold up and hit the insect on the back, where the pollen gets stuck and is brought to other plants.
This is an orchid that looks like it has a mouth. As a result, the insects are forced to crawl out and are covered by pollen.
There are at least 20,000 species of orchids - an impressive variety.
And they have all sorts of tricks in store.
They must attract pollinators to help them.
This orchid, known from the investigations of Charles Darwin, who made a great thesis at the sight of it. They see a very long nectar tube coming down from the orchid.
And what insects have to do there in the middle of the flower - they have to put their little suction trunk in there and the whole nectar tube down to get the nectar.
And when Darwin saw this flower, he said, "Something must have developed in parallel."
And indeed, here is this insect.
Normally it rolls in the trunk, but in its stretched shape it looks like this.
You can imagine that if nectar is so valuable and expensive to produce for the plant and attracts a lot of pollinators, then it is like human sex that people begin to deceive.
They say, "I have nectar, do you want to come and get it from you?"
This is a plant.
This is a plant that insects in South Africa simply love, and they have developed a long suction trunk to get the nectar.
And this is an imitator,
A plant that copies the original.
And here is the bow tie with a long trunk that did not get any nectar from the imitator. Because the imitator, unlike the bow tie expected, has no nectar at all.
Not only did the fly not get any nectar, it also has - if you look very closely, at the head of the trunk you will see pollen, which it would have transferred to other plants, if only a botanist had not passed by and glued it to blue paper.
(Laughter) Deception runs through the whole plant kingdom.
These black dots on the flower, they look like black dots for us, but for male insects of certain species they look like two females that are very hot.
(Laughter) And when the insect lands there, it absorbs pollen, which brings it to further plants. If you look at the "Every household should have one" electron microscope picture, you will see that there are certain three-dimensional patterns.
It not only looks good for the insect, but also feels good.
And these electron microscope images - here one of an orchid imitating an insect - show that different parts of the shape have different colors and seemingly different surfaces, and for the perception of an insect the textures are very, very different.
This plant has developed the imitation of a shiny metallic surface, as seen on some beetles.
And under the electron microscope you can see that this surface is very different from the one we have looked at so far.
Sometimes the whole plant imitates an insect, even in our perception.
I think it looks like a flying animal.
It is a wonderful thing.
This one is clever. It's called obsidium.
I sometimes regard it as a treachery.
For certain bees, it looks like another, particularly aggressive bee, so it flies down and repeatedly hits it on its head to drive it away and naturally absorbs a lot of pollen.
At the same time, this plant imitates another orchid, which has plenty of food for insects.
But this one has nothing for them.
So it cheats on two levels - fabulous.
(Laughter) Here we see the cananga tree, an ingredient of many perfumes.
I smelled one on somebody earlier.
The flowers shouldn't be so colorful.
They send a fantastic spectrum of scents to all insects.
This one does not smell so good.
This is a flower that really smells very horrible and it has evolved to imitate carrion.
That's why they love flies.
They fly in and pollinate them.
This is a Helicodiceros, also known as the "dead horse."
I don't know how a dead horse smells, but the plant is probably doing quite well.
It is really terrible.
And blowflies cannot hold back.
They fly all the way to the rear
And lay their eggs there, they think it's carrion, without realizing that there is no food for the eggs that die as a result, but the plant benefits from it, as the fly full of pollen flies on again and the next flower pollinates - fantastic.
This is Arum maculatum, the spotted aron stick.
I photographed him in Dorset last week.
It warms up to about 15 ° above ambient temperature - fascinating.
And if you look into the plant, there is a kind of barrier behind the inflorescences. Flies are attracted by the heat, which creates volatile chemicals, and are then trapped at the bottom of the container.
They drink the wonderful nectar and are sticky afterwards.
At night they get a pollen shower and then the bristles we saw above slackened and clear the way for the mosquitoes, which are full of pollen - great thing.
If you think it's great, now comes one of my favorites.
This is the Philodendron Selloum.
If someone from Brazil is here, you will know the plant.
It is really fascinating.
This kind of phallus there is about 30cm long.
And he does something that no other plant I know does when it blooms. There are the inflorescences in the middle - for about 2 days it has a metabolism that is very similar to that of mammals.
Instead of feeding on starch, which is the food of plants, it takes something similar to brown adipose tissue and burns it so quickly that the fat burning rate, the metabolism, corresponds to that of a small cat.
This is twice the energy production of a hummingbird, in relation to its weight - incredibly impressive.
But he does something else that is unusual.
It not only warms up to 43 to 44 ° C for about 2 days, but also maintains a constant temperature.
It can regulate its temperature and thus keep it constant.
You ask yourself, "Why is he doing this?"
As you can imagine, there are some beetles that love to mate at this temperature.
And they fly in and set off.
(Laughter) And the plant showered them with pollen, and they fly on and pollinate.
What a wonderful thing.
The typical pollinator for us is an insect. But in the tropics many birds and butterflies also pollinate.
And many tropical flowers are red and we think that's because birds and butterflies look similar to us and therefore the color red is very good.
If you look at the spectrum of birds and humans, we see red, green and blue in this spectrum.
Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet and different stages of ultraviolet.
So something that goes further behind our spectrum.
And I hear you ask: "Wouldn't it be great if we could see that too?"
Of course, we can do that.
So what does an insect see?
Last week I photographed this Sun Beauty in Dorset.
As you can see, these are small yellow flowers, small yellow flowers everywhere.
And that's what they look like in visible light.
That's what it looks like when you take the red out.
Most bees do not see red.
And then I photographed with ultraviolet filters and exposed the special ultraviolet frequencies for a very, very long time and that was the result.
And that's a fantastic target.
We don't know exactly what bees see, just as you don't know what I'm seeing when I say "That's red."
We cannot look into the thoughts of insects or other people.
But the contrast will be something like that. It stands out against the background.
Here is another small flower - different bandwidth of ultraviolet frequencies, other filters similar to pollinators.
And that's what they would see.
If you now think all the yellow flowers have this characteristic - no flower was damaged for this picture; it was only attached to the tripod, not killed - but under ultraviolet light it looks like this.
And this could serve as the basis for a sunscreen, because sunscreen absorbs UV light.
The substances in the plant could be helpful.
Finally, we sent me an evening primrose sent by Bjorn Rorslett from Norway - fantastic hidden patterns.
I love the idea of hidden things.
I think there is something poetic about the fact that these images were taken with UV filters, filters that are mainly used by astronomers to photograph Venus - more precisely, their nebulae.
This is the main purpose of these filters.
Venus is the goddess of love and fertility, and that in turn is the story of flowers.
And flowers not only show great efforts to attract pollinators, they also make it possible for us to plant large fields full of them and to give them to each other at births and deaths, and especially at weddings, which, when you think about it, are the moment when the exchange of genetic material from one organism to another is determined.
Thank you very much.

Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of emergency for many districts.
The Corona pandemic, which is rampant in Texas, is complicating the work of the aid workers, said Abbott according to the US media.
Evacuees called for caution
Every hurricane is an enormous challenge, said Abbott, according to the Houston Chronicle newspaper.
Referring to the cyclone in Texas, he added: "This challenge is complicated and exacerbated considering that it is sweeping through an area that is the state's most affected area by Covid-19."
According to Johns Hopkins University, around 5,000 people have died in Texas alone as a result of the Corona pandemic.

For the coastal stretch from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm surge warning was issued and later withdrawn.
Authorities expected a slowdown, while "Hanna" moved further inland and headed for northeastern Mexico.
"Douglas" moves towards Hawaii
In the Pacific, hurricane "Douglas" was heading for Hawaii during the night to Sunday with winds of around 150 kilometres per hour.

On average, there are six hurricanes per year over the Atlantic, three of which develop into storms of great magnitude.
Given the available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and Caribbean, the probability of a normal season is only 30 percent, the probability of a below-average season is only ten percent, it was said at the time.

Greta Thunberg: Evil eye against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest on Stephen Colbert's well-known latenight show via video and revealed in an interview what she had in mind when she met Donald Trump.
Climate activist Greta Thunberg was a guest on a popular US latenight show via video switch.
Among other things, she talked about her struggle against the world's powerful.
The teenager also spoke about her famous "evil eye" during her encounter with Donald Trump.
New York City - Over the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has attracted attention with her tireless commitment to the "Fridays For Future" movement.
Now she spoke in a well-known latenight show about her plans for the future and her encounter with US President Donald Trump at the UN climate summit last year.
Latenight host Stephen Colbert welcomed 17-year-old Thunberg to your show on Tuesday and conducted a lengthy interview with the Swede.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the world's powerful.
There are some things that surprised me, she said.
She was shocked by how far people go to shift the focus away from the climate crisis.
She said she experienced everything from organized hate campaigns to threats just because a group of children are taking to the streets.
She finds heads of state and leading politicians who scoff at her on social media or even try to silence her "funny" because the reactions show her "because they have no other answer."
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was approached about a well-known scene in which she cast a bitterly nasty glance after US President Trump.
At the 2019 UN Climate Summit in New York, for which the activist sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive gaze was captured by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
The short clip resulted in a GIF, an animated image that ultimately became one of the most frequently used images for Trump opponents.
But what was the 17-year-old thinking about the US president at that moment?
To Stephen Colbert's relatively open question, she answered only briefly and dryly: "To be honest, I don't think there is any need for further explanation."
The experienced satirist Colbert did not expect the quick-witted answer and briefly disappeared from the picture laughing.
With her "How dare you?" Speech on the principles of climate protection, she was remembered by many at the climate conference.
