Many of them handed out their vaccine samples to authorities to test and assess its efficacy.
The NAFDAC has also laid out other criteria and regulations that will follow the inclusion of the drug.
The efficacy of the drugs will be tested in animals for the first time.
Mojisola warned drugmakers not to mistake adding another drug without the agency being able to do so.
In May, NAFDAC revealed that only news reports of claims that they had discovered a traditional vaccine that would cure the coronavirus.

"It's not going to be easy," he said. "It's not going to be easy."
In a statement released this week by the APC, the governor of Niger state, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, accused the party's governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello of attempting to bring violence into the party.
The document, signed by President Muhammadu Buhari and secretary-general of the People's Democratic Party (PDP) Muhammed Liman, reveals that during the six years of the party's domination of the state, only 512 million dollars have been received.
The letter went on to say that the meeting with the governor, who led on Wednesday night, would help to keep the party's caucus going, saying they had written to the secretary of state.
According to Engineer Imam, "we understand the Governor of Niger State is trying to divide the heads of the party by arranging a stakeholders meeting, which is illegal, for any complaints against party leaders, to be written to the secretary of the party, to investigate."
He went on to say that so far in the six years since the party's founding, $512 million was in the party's fund.
He said that what he understood as the governor is being part of the National Rescue Committee that was set up July 25, 2020, led by the President to lead the preparation of problems between the party and withdrawing criticism from the party.
"The money we've got to pay the salaries of the party's staff, as well as other activities related to the party, the Democratic Party and the balance of some of the party's problems such as health support because of the lack of access to government funding, not any party money we spend illegally, we're challenging everyone to make excuses for the party's money.
As I have stated, the election was the most important election in the country that we have done with the former commissioners and commissioners who now hold power in all twenty-five counties in the state, whose funds in the elections have been distributed to the commissioners.
So, it's a mistake for anyone to say that party funds are being spent illegally, that's almost unfair and trying to give the dog a bad name to try to hang it up, that's not a commission set up to investigate how the party funds are spent and who sets it up.
Among the money that the complainant claimed to have been left out, was money provided by the secretary of state for the party, not some money, so I challenge anyone on this issue to prove his allegations in any way.
Imam (r.a.) said that we stand firm against defending the APC from any attempt or organization to undermine the party, adding that any allegations against the party or any party leader from the state level will be written by the party's governing body as defined in section 21 (B) (b) (b) (d) on page 82 of the party's structure.
So the party's stakeholders have no role to play, especially if they attempt to seize the power of the committee so their decision has no effect.
For this reason, they are the most qualified party leaders in the state, in the 21st and sixth paragraph on page 87 of the party's constitution, anything contrary to this would not be used.
Because the decision to disqualify the leaders was a mistake.
He said that those present with approval at yesterday's meeting were not members of the party's executive committee in the state.
The chairman of the party's board of directors, Mohammed Imam, will be the only governor to lead the party's leaders.
In a related development, Governor Abubakar Sani Bello said the state government is committed to fulfilling the promises made to the people of the state at the time of the election, walking with party parents in the government so that everyone can benefit in the state and all the churches by giving political appointments, which is the problem of the governor and the party.
The document praises federal lawmakers who refuse to attend and draw attention to reconciling all problems between the party's members, which is not surprising to lawmakers who know themselves, who refuse to accept the arrest as a party law.
As a result, there is a need for the chairman of the National Committee to attract the attention of Governor Abubakar Sani Bello on the right position not to attempt to undermine the state's politics.

Food is the spirit of life of all creatures, cannot live without food.
This is why Chinese authorities are increasingly cautious in ensuring the nation's supply of food.
In the 71 years since the foundation of the People's Republic of China, the country has achieved major achievements in food supply, which has surprised the world with a population of over 1.4 billion.
This effort has helped make China the world's biggest hunger fund, according to Chinese Agriculture and Agriculture Commission President Zhang Wufeng. Since 1949, China has always put hunger at the forefront of all the country's agricultural activities.
But in the past few days, some Western media have again "showed concern" about whether China can raise its nation itself in the shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic across the globe?
We thank them so much for constantly taking care of the presence of Chinese people on the planet.
Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the country has managed to produce enough food based on its efforts.
The issue of supply chains for Chinese food is one of the highest-ranking agenda of the ruling JKS party.
The Minister of State for Food and Drug Administration, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, has said that there is no need for food security in Nigeria. He said that everybody knows that any food security and hard work is being done.
Although this year the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the world economy is also devastating to China's economy, China can provide adequate food to its people.
China's official statistics show that the number of agricultural products produced by the country in the first quarter of 2020, was 27.29 million tonnes, an increase of 1.08 million tonnes, a 3.9% increase compared to the same period of 2019.
He also said that China has made major achievements in terms of supply and food compared to the first phase of implementation of the concept of local changes and opening the door to foreigners.
Huang Jikun, director of China's agricultural policy at Peking University, said during a meeting with the newspaper's representative "The China Science Daily," that the serious challenge facing China is now in the next 2 or three years, whether China can reduce the number of wheat and rice stored in grain stores.
Now the amount of grain each received is 474 kilograms instead of 400 kilograms per person per year.
And China is now importing millions of tonnes of agricultural products to raise domestic animals.
Those concerned should be calm, wash their hands and go to sleep, or focus on their home affairs.
They are able to raise themselves with the food they produce themselves.

The farmers in Biniwe anticipate harvesting and locating in the country - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
Rice farmers in Biniwe state expect to harvest as much as two months after planting.
Some of them gathered in Makurdi expressed hope that the harvest would be at any time between October and November.
A small farmer in the state's Mbatiab-Gboko town, Titus Atondo, said he planted his farm in a two-year-old area in July.
Atondo said he got seed from the market in his area and was part of two CP and OC rice units as he used Dazzle to clear the grounds for planting and composting.
According to Titus Atondo, the challenges of rice farming in rural areas such as mining are high because we rely heavily on labour as customers can't find gardening routes.
Titus Atondo added that we are recruiting people to work from the national level to the harvest, adding that this is tired and too much.
Atondo said all the funds spent on his farm that are now available include planting, clearing, composting applications and are expected to grow to N2020,000.
Titus Atondo went on to say, however, that he expected at least 50 bags of bags as harvest from two hectares that may have been sold at a price of 29,000 bags per 100k bags.
A large rice farmer, Bitalis Tarnongu, planted the plant in June to July at 274 hectares of the garden in which the price stood at $14,500 per hectare while the national field paid $25,000 per hectare.
He sowed 44 seed (Supi) and Faro 61 (OC) seed found from the National Agriculture Council (NDA) and some originated from the Nigerian company Olam Nigeria.
He added that the growth levels at this time are in different areas while others are also in the dairy programme, while others are in the early stages of killing livestock as farming at levels.
Tarnongu added that the challenges so far include financial support since the cost of livestock production is expensive and labor costs have increased.
He said the harvest is expected to begin in October to November.
He added that the total cost of the property at the end of the day would be a minimum of $246,000 per hectare while the production is expected to be three tonnes which could translate to $360,000 per kilogram.
Tarnongu does not use drugs on his rice farm, instead, advocating and implementing traditional farming, adding that, therefore, we are using highly potent plants, killing insects and fertilizers.
The National Farmers Association (AFAN) has expressed hope that the rainy weather this year will fit a lot of rice production.
According to the president of the Nigeria Farmers Association (AFAN), Aondongu Saaku, more farmers entered the rice production business at the end of this year due to the coronavirus pandemic that has prevented many from leaving offices and staying in their fields.
He said this year it will harvest 20 percent of what is produced in 2019 which is estimated to be more than one million tons.
According to him, the collectors are currently taking the statistics of various farmers and if the project is completed, the number of rice farmers in the state will be assessed.
The chairman of the Nigeria Farmers Association (AFAN) Branch of Benue State, Commander Aondongu Saaku, who said he cultivated three hectares of rice farm, noted that some farmers planted rice in June while those looking to short term do so in the wake of the expected harvest season in late November or early December.
The AFAN leader added that farmers are using raw materials to kill aging vegetation, chemical compounds, and insect killers.
He expressed his concern about the challenges of livestock farming, adding that farmers are making hedges, putting ropes and clearing the edges of the fields to deal with the problem.

The film, titled "Black Is King" and "Black Is King," continues to be praised and criticized around the world, thanks to the way it describes African culture.
In South Africa, where this 85-minute film is included, many people say this is even beyond the film.
Black is King, it's a film filled with songs by the famous singer and American poet Beyonce, directed by designer, composer and composer.
This movie is an outstanding version of its song titled "The Lion King: The Gift," namely the Emmy: The Son of Gifts.
Last year the film was filmed in the United States, South and West Africa, and Europe, and contains several African musicians.
The film, which was released in July, has received widespread criticism from the audience, but there are also critics.
Some say Beyonce, who was born in Houston, Texas, has borrowed African-Americans illegally, especially the features that have become African-American in the film, while traditionally it has no basis for African-Americans.
But in South Africa, they're also excited to play this movie.
Sibusiso Mathebula, a film reader, said he was ranked among the filmmakers.
He said the film impressed him.
The film touched on a number of things that weren't taught at school about the history of black people.
He said when he saw the film he began to see the story and the clothes she was wearing and the styles of the film, which had developed a lot more than expected.
Kgosi Motosoane, a fan of Beyonce's songs, said African-Americans abroad - including black Americans - have access to what others think is African heritage.
He was just interested in the film.
Kgosi said that black women are more likely to be given national status in the community.
So they're going to be very effective, it's a very encouraging thing.
Reading how to film, Mathebula said Beyonce's film made him interested in starting the film in order to further spread information about Africa.
Beyoncé's supporters have been skeptical about one thing: If the Black man is King, then Beyoncé is queen.

The new COVID-19 relief bill will be introduced in the United States.
While figures show that the number of COVID-19 cases continues to increase in the United States, on Monday Republicans in the Senate are expected to introduce another stimulus package.
It is thought that sales will reach $1 trillion to ease the coronavirus pandemic in the country.
The plan comes days before the first relief package for millions of Americans who have lost their jobs due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
On Sunday, after days of conversations with Republicans in the Senate, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the funding included expanding the program to help those who lost their jobs.
But, according to them, this time, Americans will see 70 per cent of the money given in the past.
On Friday, the first stimulus package would expire for those who lost their jobs, and they would be offered 600 per week in addition to those provided by the states.

The governor of Kano state, Hon. Hassan Dashi, told the nation that the law would give businesses and the state government the theory of how to spend their money, as well as how the state would crack down on its finances.
Now, local activist groups have welcomed the bill, as long as it will be reviewed several times.
The director of the Organization for Community Civic, Comrade Abdulrazak, said they hope government officials and the state government will implement the law effectively.
But the state commissioner for finance and economic affairs, Alhaji Shehu Na'Allah, said they were well prepared to work with the law.
The governor of Kano state, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, signed this new law last week, and is expected to commence work.

Edo governorship election: PDP chieftains
The chairman of the National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof surfaced that his agency planned to hold the Edo state governor's election, which will be cast on September 19.
Jacob made this encouraging statement on Thursday, during a meeting with the Electoral Commission in Benin, Edo state capital.
According to him, INEC has so far managed to implement up to 10 of the 14 electoral colleges in the state.
James added that the reason for this visit was to see what preparations were already in place before Election Day.
Of course we're getting all the reports of clips going on.
Yet we think it's right to come to our head, to see our eyes clearly.
This agency has released plans for how the Edo and Ondo elections will take place since February 6, 2020.
Turner provided the space for nearly seven to eight months to prepare for the second half.
So today I am glad that we have implemented 10 out of the 14 programs planned by the INEC.
And no one has been found to have been released from the day it will be implemented.
The last thing is to register the overall voter turnout for the 14 parties to contest, Jacob said.
He said the four remaining projects for the INEC include the publication of the election announcements on Tuesday, presenting the names of each party that entered the contest, all in one day.
And the campaign stopped 24 hours before the election.
Turner's campaign will be suspended Thursday night, before Saturday's election.
So we're just saying we're already evaluating, we're just waiting for the election day.
James said.
However, he predicted that the Edo state governor's election would be the first election to take place during the coronavirus pandemic.
On that basis, he said the Electoral Commission has come up with guidelines on how elections can be conducted in this situation.
We tested the system and the rules in a small polling place.
And we plan to repeat the system in this general election in Edo.
The Edo state commissioner of elections, Johnson Alalibo, said there were 2,210,534 registered voters in Edo State.
He said 1,159,325 were men, and 1,051,209 were women.

There is a brilliant woman named Li Yaomei (the name of Islam) who is famous for her struggles in life and her success in trying to get out of poverty.
Her story tells us that trying and trying to reach out is something in the heart.
Initially, Li Yaomei had never been in the classroom with the intention of taking a lesson, making it impossible for her to read aloud.
But God gave her the gift of insight and wisdom and a lot of wisdom, where she was an example of war and poverty.
About 20 years ago, Ms Li Yaomei suffered from abdominal cancer, leading to her surgery in the stomach 3 times.
After waking up again, she encountered a serious accident, now walking with iron placed in her feet.
These challenges have thrown her into a difficult situation in addition to health care, as well as medical expenses, prompting her to borrow about 3,000 yuan, equivalent to more than $16 million.

There's Fear of America's Got Talent's Trial of COVID-19 - Leadership Hausa
The World Health Organization (WHO) director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has expressed concern over the measures taken by other countries to store a COVID-19 vaccine that is expected to be produced, explaining that priority must be avoided in different countries, as the vaccine is distributed.
And the vaccine should be distributed in a timely manner across the globe, as it will fit the huge benefits of different countries.
Indeed, some U.S. politicians are implementing the concept of showing priority on their own interests, about distributing a vaccine, as well as undermining international cooperation in the fight against the pandemic.
Meanwhile, the overall number of confirmed COVID-19 cases across the globe has already exceeded 23 million.
In the same number, there are people who have lost their lives as a result of the virus that has reached more than 800,000.
Under such severe circumstances, more focus is being focused on the effectiveness of the vaccine, and fortunately, in recent days, there have been significant results in studying the vaccine in some countries, creating hope, and faith in the reaction of the international community.
But sadly, some U.S. politicians have expressed a desire to revive the vaccine.
Even the "Science" magazine clarified that the U.S. government has already passed agreements to buy a COVID-19 vaccine worth more than $6 billion, from several pharmaceutical companies.
Despite the fact that the U.S. government is understood to be at the forefront of the spread of the virus, other developing countries also need a vaccine, considering that they are more vulnerable to shortages of medical resources.
The journal "The Ecologist" also pointed out that if the U.S. reaches the goal of evacuating the vaccine, then the amount of vaccines that will be produced by developing countries will decline.
Kaza praised the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) director, John Nkengasong, for his concern about the issue.
As some commentators have pointed out, even if a vaccine is successful, it is not possible to achieve the goal of seeing after the pandemic, unless a vaccine is distributed, which is a very important issue for the international community.
And it's appropriate for countries to further strengthen cooperation between them.
WHO Director-General Tedros also pointed out that, if it is to be seen after the pandemic, it must be curbed from all areas around the world, and it is not possible for some parts of the world, or a few other countries to achieve recovery goals from the impact of the pandemic alone.

Nigeria is facing the worst recession this year.
Tuesday: 24 October2020 - 16:33.
The Federal Bureau of Statistics has announced that the economy has experienced an unprecedented recession over the past 10 years, resulting in a recession that has surpassed the 6 percent seen between April and June this year.
The figures released by the Commission today show that between April and June, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the global pandemic and the suspension of daily activities, the Nigerian economy entered a unprecedented situation between 2010 and 2020.
The agency lists the reasons for the crisis, including forcing people to stay home across the country to restrict travel, ban flights, close schools and businesses.
The agency added that taking such measures around the world has caused oil prices to fall sharply, while factories around the world have also been closed to deal with the crisis.

The state government's efforts under Governor Mai Mala Buni have been credited with reviving the state-owned company, Polythene Bag and Wabba Sacks Company, after more than 10 years in office.
The statement came from the chairman of the company (General Manager), Engineer Adamu Gadaka, at his meeting with our representative at his office in Maiduguri, the capital of Yobe state, earlier in the week.
He said the company had spent more than 10 years in lockdown, but after the arrival of Governor Buni it was difficult to reconsider it, which immediately ordered the removal of $78.8 million to fix key sectors of the company with an additional $48 million in management, while allowing the company to step up its footsteps.
Eng. Gadaka further stated that this gave them the opportunity to acquire the necessary products to start working at the company, including the new 500 KbA power supply device, 500 KbA power distribution device (Taransifoma) 500 KbA, the new vacuum vacuum vacuum, the sewing machine and other equipment that the company needs.
He said, "The main goal of the governor's movement to revive this corporation is to provide young people with jobs, reduce spending and provide the state with income."
He said: "It's amazing.
On the other hand, he said the company had got the favor of its landlord because of the state government's revival of the livestock and livestock plant (Fed Flour and Feed Mill) in the town and the rest of the merchandise that the company produces.
He said that the state government's attempts to fix the composting company were also an example of the company's acquisition of materials.
On the other hand, he said, "There are some challenges that we face, based on how the company has spent more than 10 years in lockdown, while the engineers have begun to work but there is a need to shift us to other supplies to get to work without fear."
Whatever we expect before our operations are over, we will try to bring the other products we need.
In addition, Gadaka said, "On the other hand, we are asking the state government to increase the supply of other equipment, trucks and vehicles that we will use to carry out our operations safely, especially in order to transport our personnel to the office to avoid arrival late, when we begin to work."
He also said the company is currently deploying 25 young people to get training on how to operate brands and devices and manage the products the company uses in its operations and how to interact with the public.
Finally, he said that the company has now begun to produce various skins, including 100kg, 50kg and 25kg and offer to shoppers depending on the colour and condition of their skins, the company is ready to satisfy them.
