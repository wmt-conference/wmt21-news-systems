APC Accuses Niger State Governor Of Attempting To Bring Violence In The Party-Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
The All Progressives Congress (APC) on Tuesday accused Niger State Governor Abubakar Sani Bello of plotting to overthrow the party.
The document, signed by the chairman of the Engineering Party, Muhammad Jibrin Imam, and the party's secretary, Barrister Muhammed Liman, stated that during the party's six years in power, it had received only 512 million Naira find.
The statement added that the meeting convened by the governor, which he chaired on Sunday night, would help to further quell the party's unrest, saying they had written to the secretary. the party failed to keep abreast of developments in the state.
According to Imam, "We understand that the Niger State governor is trying to divide the party by organizing a stakeholder meeting, which is illegal, for any grievances against party leaders. written to the zonal party secretary, for investigation ".
He added that so far in the six years since the party's inception, 512 million Naira has been in the party's treasury.
He said his understanding as the governor was to be part of the national interim committee set up on July 25, 2020, which was chaired by the president to lead the process of resolving disputes between party members and withdraw complaints. in court among party members.
He said the money we received was used to pay the salaries of party secretary. staff, as well as other party-related activities, by-elections and to address other party members' problems such as medical benefits due to lack of access to support the government, not any party money that we have spent illegally, we challenge anyone to bring us the evidence of wasting party money.
As I said, the last local government by-elections in the state were the most important by-election held in the country with the former commissioners and commissioners currently in power in all the local government areas. twenty-five per cent of the state, whose money spent on the elections was distributed to the commissioners to bring them to their wards.
"Therefore, it is a mistake for anyone to say that party funds are being spent illegally. ow party funds are spent and who founded it.He said no committee had been set up to investigate the expenditure of the party and who set it up.
Among the allegations made by the complaint was allegations of misappropriation of funds by the party's national secretary. his allegations in any way.
Imam said we are committed to protecting the APC from any attempt by any party to disband the party, adding that any allegations against the party or any party leader from the state level will be addressed to the zoning committee as described by the party system in section 21 (B) (bi), (d) on page 82 of the party structure.
Therefore, the stakeholders of the party have no role to play especially if they try to seize the power of the committee so their decision has no effect.
For this reason, they are the trusted party leaders approved in the state, in paragraph 21 and paragraph 6 on page 87 of the party constitution, anything contrary to this shall not be used.
Because the decision of despair by the interim leaders was wrong.
He said those who presented and approved it at yesterday's session at an unsuccessful meeting, which was attended by Alhaji Abubakar Magaji, General Muhammed Garba, and Hon. Ahmed Dogonkoli, including Allah Ibrahim Balarabe and all the commissioners, are not members of the party's executive committee in the state.
The executive committee of the party will be chaired by Engineer Mohammed Imam and not by the governor.
The statement added that Governor Abubakar Sani Bello recalled that the issue of fulfilling the promises made to the people of the state during the elections, walking with party parents in government for the benefit of all in the state and all zones through giving political positions, which is the problem of the governor and the party.
The letter commended the members of the Federal Parliament who refused to attend the meeting and called for reconciliation on all issues between the two parties, which is not surprising to MPs who have known their pain, and for refusing to act as party law.
Therefore, there is a need for the Chairman of the National Interim Committee to draw the attention of Governor Abubakar Sani Bello to his position and not to try to destroy the state's politics.

China Achieves Food Achievement Success-Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
Food is the lifeblood of all living things, and we cannot live without food.
That is why the Chinese government is working harder to ensure food security for its people.
In the 71 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the country has made great strides in food security, which has surprised the world with a population of over 1.4 billion..
This effort has helped pilots the issue of why China has made huge contributions to eradicating hunger around the world, as the head of China's grain preservation and agricultural products Zhang Wufeng has never stated that since 1949 until now, China has always put the issue on hunger at the forefront of all the country's affairs processes.
But in recent days, some people and some Western media outlets have once again expressed "concern" over the question of whether China can nurture its own people in the shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic.?
We thank them very much for always keeping an eye on the Chinese presence in the world.
Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the country has made great strides in food security through its efforts.
The issue of adequate food supply for the Chinese is one of the main topics of the ruling CPC's daily agenda.
Last weekend, General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee and President of the People's Republic of China Xi Jinping issued an important order to stop wasting food, noting that everyone knows that it is a work in progress.
Although the impact of COVID-19 on the world this year is also hurting China's economy, China will be able to provide enough food for its people.
According to figures released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the country's rice production in the first quarter of 2020 will reach 27.29 million tons. increased by 1.08 million tons, an increase of 3.9% compared to the same period in 2019.
Ke Bingsheng, a former president of the Chinese Agricultural University, said China has made great strides in terms of food security compared to the beginning of the reform and opening-up policy.
Huang Jikun, director of the China Agricultural Policy Research Center at Peking University, said in an interview with The China Science Daily that the biggest challenge facing China is in the next 2 or three years, or China could reduce the amount of wheat and rice it stores in grain mills.
Now the average grain yield is 474 kilograms instead of the 400 kilograms that every person in the world should get every year.
And now China has installed millions of tons of agricultural products just for raising livestock.
Therefore, those who are concerned should calm down, take a bath and go to sleep, or focus on the internal affairs of their country.
The Chinese are able to feed themselves and produce their own food.

The Contribution of Northern Media Writers to Northern Unity.
Social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram, Bacandamia and others, have long been instrumental in creating forums for dialogue, cooperation and friendship between different communities of the world, as well as the delivery of messages, news., and promoting political, educational and business policies.
Young people in Nigeria have embraced this new technology by using social media, to keep abreast of the latest trends to contribute their voices to the latest developments in their lives.
We can say that these platforms have brought us a lot of development that the youth of the North are benefiting from in the business, economy, education and politics of the region.
Many feed by writing and posting messages online, get jobs or develop projects they manage.
It is unfortunate that some young people, instead of taking advantage of this development, are following in the footsteps of the corrupt children of the southern part of the country who have become notorious for cheating inside and outside the country, or writing articles insulting and abusing the authorities and their predecessors.
It shows the lack of civilization in the development of the youths of this country.
The arrival of the Arewa Media Writers Association in the country is a great achievement, as it provides the youths of the North with a clear vision, a clear direction and a clear focus on what the youths are doing on Social Media, so that they can be creative writers.
It is imperative that we give this organization the cooperation it needs, in order to achieve its noble goals, which will bring benefits not only to our Northern region, but to Nigeria as a whole.
I urge our youths, especially social media users, to come together to protect the integrity of the North and its independence, and to create a system that will make a difference for all.
As our late Northern leaders such as Sardaunan Sakkwato, the first Northern Prime Minister Sir Ahmadu Bello, and his contemporaries aspire to provide for the people of the North.
It has been reported that the late leader of the fight against oppression and poverty, Malam Aminu Kano, once said that Nigeria is one country, but everyone knows his father's house!
So we say, of course, as we call for national development and good governance, at every level, we are further calling for the unity of the people of the North, regardless of religion or ethnicity, to bring about development and growth  to our region
If we look at the North as it was then it is not the same now.
We should therefore use our God-given talents to contribute and adviseto provide the North with a satisfactory way to revitalize its economy.
The North should provide revenue streams to implement its budget without waiting for the federal government to spend money.
In addition, if we want to develop the North, we must give priority to education, agriculture, tourism, health and science and technology.
We don't have to contribute money, there are different ways to do it.
We think that the North will fulfill the aspirations of our forefathers!
North is something we are proud of

Rape Sentence In Nigeria Is The Only Solution-Husbands
Alhaji Aliyu Maigidaje, a civil society activist in Kaduna State, pointed out that the death penalty for rape victims in the country, especially in Northern Nigeria, was the only solution.
Alhaji Aliyu Maigidaje made the announcement in an interview with Leadership Today in Kaduna, adding that as long as the authorities confirmed this after an investigation, the death sentence was the only solution.
He added that the decision would reduce the incidence of rape which could be easily alleviated, but the biggest relief was to reform our minds.
Alhaji Aliyu Maigidaje said, in our capacity as Muslims, we should pray to Allah for the Prophet and stand firm and correct our hearts, because one does not always know when one will die.
He said it was a shame that a full-grown man or an old man had raped a girl or a three-month-old, three or five-year-old girl.
"God forbid, we should not insult the rulers," he said, adding that there was no way the country could prosper if such abuses took place.
He added that this is why we are in a difficult situation in the country, because the country has not developed, and the monarchs, governors and the president themselves have lost their way.
He added that they had to mend that rift and then the moon came up, so it was necessary for us to change our minds so that God could bring us a solution to the issue of rape.

A Man Is A King, For Their Praise.
Beyoncé's song "Black is King" continues to be praised and criticized around the world for its expression of African culture.
In South Africa, where the 85-minute film was filmed, many said it was more than a movie.
Black is King is a full-length film directed by American singer and songwriter Beyonce.
The film is best known for its song "The Lion King: The Gift."
Last year the film was made in the United States, South and West Africa, and Europe, and featured many African artists.
The film, released in July, has been well-received by audiences, but there has also been some criticism.
Some say that Beyoncé, who was born in Houston, Texas, in the United States, borrowed African elements illegally, especially the features that characterize Africa in the film, while traditionally she has no base on the African continent.
But in South Africa, those who made the film are happy.
Sibusiso Mathebula, a student of filmmaking, said he was honored to be included in the cast.
He said the film impressed him.
The film touches on many things that were not taught in school about black history.
He said it was only when he saw the film that he first saw the story and the clothes she was wearing and all the elements of the film, which developed a lot more than expected.
Beyoncé-based singer Kgosi Motosoane says Africans abroad-including black Americans-have access to what some see as cultural artifacts.
He said he was interested in the film.
Kgosi said black women are mostly at the grassroots level in society.
So their emergence in such highly influential issues is encouraging.
Mathebula, a film student, says that Beyonce's film inspired him to start making his own film to spread the word about Africa.
Beyoncé's Africans agree on one thing: If Man's Mouth is King, then Beyonce is queen.

At a time when farmers are on the verge of reaping the benefits of their farming in Nigeria, farmers in Sokoto State are struggling to cope with the threats posed by birds, which could jeopardize the expected harvest.
The threat of red-black birds in the Sokoto State area seems to have returned to normal, given that there are signs of a good food season in 2020.
Some farmers in the area have adopted a traditional method of expelling birds, according to Faruk, a young man from Dange Shuni area.
Sambo Abubakar, one of the farmers in the area, said the birds were now attacking all the plants that were beginning to grow in the fields.
The chairman of the Sokoto State Farmers Association, Murtala Gagado Minannata, said two-thirds of Sokoto state was affected.
He said they were now waiting to hear the situation of local government areas in the state to compile a report to be sent to the state and federal ministries of action to take action to assist farmers.
An official of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture in charge of the Poultry and Pest Control Unit, Yau Maqeri Kagara, said less than a month had passed since the spraying of the pesticide in Sokoto.
He added that the birds were coming from Niger Republic and Benin, and that the international community had to reach an agreement before working together to solve the problem.
In June, the federal government launched a bird-spraying operation in 12 northern Nigerian states bordering foreign countries through which birds enter Nigeria.

The new COVID-19 Support Bill will be introduced in the United States.
As statistics show that the number of people infected with COVID-19 continues to rise in the United States, Republicans in the U.S. Senate are expected to present a bill Monday.
The aid is expected to reach $1 trillion to alleviate the effects of the coronavirus pandemic in the country.
The plan comes days before the expiration of the initial funding period for millions of Americans who lost their jobs as a result of COVID-19.
On Sunday, after days of talks with Republicans in Congress, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the aid included expanding funding for those who lost their jobs.
But according to them, this time around, Americans will see only 70 percent of their previous funding.
On Friday, the initial subsidy period will protect those who have been paid a certain amount of money to those who lost their jobs, and are being paid 600 per week in addition to those provided by the states.

But Democrats, for their part, have challenged this claim, saying that given the growing number of coronavirus cases, some workers are not confident enough to return to work.

The Federal Government has launched an agricultural program to provide food and employment.
The Federal Government has launched the Agriculture for Food and Employment Program (AFGP), which is part of the Economic Sustainability Program.

"And we used not to feed the poor."
Effort, Perseverance, and Self-Sufficiency Is What Is In The Heart-Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
Longyuan Village, Hongsipu County, Wuzhong, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, Northwest China.
There is a brave woman named Li Yaomei or Sadiya (her Islamic name) who is famous for her struggles in life and her success in trying to get out of poverty.
Her story tells us that effort, perseverance, and self-seeking are things that are in the heart.
At first, Li Yaomei or Sadiya never sat in class to study, which is why she could not read or write.
But Allah has endowed her with a wealth of ingenuity and wisdom, making her a model in the fight against poverty.
About 20 years ago, Li Yaomei suffered from stomach cancer, which led to three operations on her abdomen.
After regaining consciousness, she suffered a serious accident and is now walking with the implant in her foot.
These challenges put her in a difficult position in addition to her health, as well as the issue of medical bills, which is why she took out a loan of about 3 thousand Yuan, equivalent to more than N16 million.
Surprisingly, this challenge faced by Malama Sadiya has been a source of inspiration and inspiration for her to improve her life.
The support from the Chinese government has also strengthened her.
Her job is to make different types of brooms based on the use of vegetation.
Due to her tireless efforts, her profession has flourished, with various companies ordering her to pick up.
In addition, she has created several machines that help her simplify the task.
For example, it used to take 15 minutes to assemble one large broom, but now during this time, it will assemble up to 5 brooms.
In addition, it provides some additional cleaning machines that restore the broom.
Then there are the extra machines that clean the animal feed for women, and now these machines are still available to buyers.
Considering the challenges that Ms. Sadiya has faced, and the efforts she is still making to improve her life and that of her staff, it is clear that the applicant is with me.
Fighting poverty and improving the quality of life is not the sole responsibility of the government.
If the government is going to provide support, but the people are not motivated or interested in improving their lives by finding jobs based on their situation, then the backlash will only continue without achieving a goal.
Her story shows that running a business or earning a living does not require any large sums of money or travel to other cities or abroad.
Because she is aware of her situation, she uses the resources available to her to improve her life.
In addition, Ms. Sadiya performed these tasks on her own feet without relying on her husband, for he ran away and left her.
That is to say, effort, perseverance and self-seeking are at the heart of it.
It also shows the power of women to change their lives and stand on their own two feet without seeking someone else's help.
This is also a lesson that shows that, whatever a person does, he should stand on his own two feet, because dependence on someone is uncertain.
Malama Sadiya is a courageous, intelligent and talented woman who is a role model and role model for others.
Also, by March this year, Ms. Sadiya had paid off all her debts and stopped receiving support from the government at her own discretion.

Us Politicians Fear Could Destroy COVID-19-Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
The director general of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has expressed concern over the steps being taken by some countries to save the expected COVID-19 vaccine, saying it must be to avoid showing favoritism to different communities, while distributing vaccines against the epidemic.
And the vaccine should be distributed evenly across the globe, as it will be in the best interests of different countries.
Indeed, some American politicians are pursuing a policy of prioritizing their own interests, in terms of sharing the vaccine, and they are undermining international cooperation in the fight against the pandemic.
Currently, the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide has already exceeded 23 million.
In that number, more than 800 people have died as a result of the disease.
Under such extreme conditions, more attention is being paid to the effectiveness of vaccines, and it is gratifying that, in recent days, there have been great results in the study of vaccines in other countries, a phenomenon that has produced skin, and belief in the entire international community.
But sadly, some American politicians have expressed a desire to get vaccinated.
According to Science, the US government has already signed contracts worth more than $6 billion with COVID-19 from several pharmaceutical companies.
Although the US government's policy is understood to be that the United States is at the forefront of the spread of the virus, other developing countries also need to be vaccinated, given that they suffer from poor health resources.
The Ecologist also points out that if the United States achieves the goal of vaccination, the number of vaccines to be produced in developing countries will decrease.
The director general of the CDC Africa Center for Disease Control, Mr. John Nkengasong, also expressed concern over the issue.
According to some current affairs commentators, even if the vaccine has been successfully developed, it will not be possible to achieve the goal of the disease until the distribution of the vaccine is designed, which is a very important point for the international community.
It is also important for the international community to strengthen cooperation.
Who Director-General Tedros also said that if the disease was to be eradicated, it would be possible for some parts of the world, or even a few countries to achieve the goal of recoveration from the impact of the pandemic alone.
