KORONA: We have not yet finished testing the efficacy of the combined drug in Nigeria.
As European countries continue to test the efficacy of corona vaccines, Nigeria has not been left behind to include its own drug testing.
The National Food and Drug Administration (NAFDAC) has stated that it is testing 40 coronavirus medicines handed over to the agency by traditional pharmacists.
The Chairman of the Board, Mojisola Adeyeye, made the announcement on Tuesday in Abuja.
Mojisola said the drug's efficacy is being tested so as not to find compensation for obesity.
Since the outbreak of the coronavirus, traditional medicine collaborators have launched research to see that they have not been left behind to see the treatment included.
Many of them have handed over samples of their medicine to the authorities for testing and assessing its efficacy.
The NAFDAC also stipulated certain criteria and rules for combining the drug.
The drug's efficacy will be tested in animals for the first time.
Mojisola warned the drugmakers not to dare to test a drug without allowing the agency to do so.
In May, the NAFDAC revealed that social media and newspapers are the only news that claims to have discovered traditional medicine to cure Coronavirus.
Adeyeye said that even one person approached the NAFDAC to look at the efficacy of the drug, which he claimed included traditional medicine, saying it could cure Coronavirus.
The other person, who is not a cure for the disease, was told not to be identified.
He said he had identified the symptoms of illness that are considered to be the symptoms of infection.

APC Repudiates Niger Governor's Attempt to Bring Peoples to the Party - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
In a statement issued by the APC this week, Talatar accused the governor of Niger State, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, of attempting to bring riots into the party.
The document, signed by the Chairman of the Engineering Party Muhammad Jibrin Imam and the Secretary of the Barista Party Muhammed Liman, stated that over the six years that the party has ruled the state, only 512 million naira has been received.
The statement went on to say that the governor's stakeholder meeting, which he chaired on Sunday night last week, would help continue the riots in the party, saying they had written to the secretariat of the national party about the ongoing events in the state.
According to Engineer Imam, "We understand the governor of Niger State is trying to divide the heads of the members of the party by organizing a meeting of stakeholders, which is illegal, because any complaint against the leaders of the party is written to the secretariat of the party for investigation".
He went on to say that so far in the six years since the founding of the party, the sum of 512 million is in the party's fund.
He said what he understood as the governor was to be on the National Holding Committee, which was established July 25, 2020, led by the president to lead the preparation of the problems between the members of the party and the withdrawal of complaints in court between the members of the party.
That is why the funds we receive are paying the salaries of the party's secretariat staff, as well as other activities related to the association, choosing to expel skilled workers and alleviating some of the problems facing the party's pupils such as health support due to lack of access to government funds, not any illegal party funds, we each challenge us to justify the guarantee of party funds.
As I explained, the expulsion election of the state governments last year was the most important expulsion election in the country, which we conducted with the former commissioners and commissioners who now hold supreme power in all twenty-five local governments in the state, whose funds in the elections were allocated by the commissioners to bring their husbands.
In other words, it is wrong for anyone to say that party funds are being spent illegally, this is almost unfair in trying to protect the bad name and try to hang it, saying to a committee that has been set up to investigate how party funds are spent and who has formed it.
Among the funds that the complainant said were the funds he alleged to have been granted, the funds provided by the secretariat of the national association, the funds given to others like that son, so I challenge each person on this issue who has brought his testimony to prove this allegation in any way.
Imam (r.a.) said that we have stood firm against protecting the APC from any movement or organization from the uprising of the party, adding that any allegations against the party or any party leader from the state level will be written by the committee in charge of the party as stated in section 21 (B) (bi), (d) on page 82 of the party system.
Therefore, party stakeholders have no role to play, especially if they attempt to seize committee power and therefore their decision has no effect.
For this reason, they are the most prominent leaders of the party that has been approved in the state, in the 21st rank and sixth paragraph on page 87 of the party's constitution, whatever is usual for this not to be used.
Because of the disappointment of the leaders, you are wrong.
He said those who presented the book with approval yesterday at the unsuccessful meeting, which was attended by Alhaji Abubakar Magaji, General Muhammed Garba, Hon. Ahmed Dogonkoli, including Alhaji Ibrahim Balarabe and all commissioners, were not members of the executive committee in the state.
Only the executive committee of stakeholders chairman of the association Engineering Mohammed Imam will chair him and not the governor will lead the heads of the state party.
The statement added that Governor Abubakar Sani Bello recalled that the issue of fulfilling the promises made to the people of the state during the elections, and moving with the parents of the party in the government would benefit everyone in the state and all districts through political positions, which is the problem of the governor and the party.
The letter commended the members of the Federal Parliament who refused to attend the meeting and drew attention to reconciling all the problems between the members of the party, which is not surprising to members of parliament who are aware of their own illness, who refuse to accept falsehood as a law of the party.
Therefore, there is a need for the chairman of the National Committee to draw the attention of Governor Abubakar Sani Bello on the right position not to attempt to undermine the state's policies.

COVID-19 Stops Trump's Election Summit in Florida.
U.s. President Donald Trump yesterday announced that he had canceled the Republican Party's congress scheduled to be held in Jacksonville, Florida, next month, as a result of a surge in coronavirus cases.
Nevertheless, the general assembly will be held in North Carolina.

Republican representatives will gather in Charlotte, North Carolina, to officially elect Trump on August 24.
Trump said he would make endorsement remarks in a separate draft.
Trump, who has spent months showing an all-in-one attitude to the impact of the pandemic, recently said 99 percent of the cases seen increasing in the United States would not be harmful.

China Achieves Its People's Riches And Food - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
Food is the spirit of life of all creatures, it cannot be lived necessarily except with food.
This is why China's rulers are increasingly determined to ensure the nation's supply of food.
In the past 71 years since the foundation of the People's Republic of China, the country has achieved major achievements in the field of food supply, which has surprised the world with the population of the country, which according to the report shows the number of Chinese has reached 1.4 billion.
This effort has contributed greatly to the fact that China has made a major contribution to eradicating hunger in the world, as China's Chairman of the Food and Agriculture Commission Zhang Wufeng once stated that since 1949 until now, China has always been putting the issue of curbing hunger before all operations of the country's affairs.
But in recent days, some Western media have repeatedly "worried" over the issue of whether China can raise its own people in the shadow of the COVID-19 respiratory epidemic across the globe?
We thank them very much for their constant care for the presence of the Chinese in this world.
Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the country has managed to produce enough food based on its efforts.
The issue of providing sufficient food to the Chinese is one of the main agenda of the ruling CPC party on a daily basis.
At the end of last week, the general secretary of the CPC Supreme Committee, who is the president of China, Xi Jinping issued an important order to stop barning food, pointing out that everyone knows that any foodstuffs and labor difficulties are obtained.
Although this year the impact of the COVID-19 respiratory disease that has hit the world is also detrimental to China's economy, China will be able to provide enough food for its people.
Alkalines released by the Chinese Bureau of Statistics on the quantity of agricultural products, especially the rice that the country will receive this year 2020, showed that the amount of rice produced in the country in the first quarter of 2020, reached 27.29 million tons, increasing by 1.08 million tons, that is, it increased by 3.9% compared to the same period of 2019.
Ke Bingsheng, the former chairman of the Chinese Agricultural University, said China has achieved great achievements in the face of the country's food supply compared to the earlier implementation of the policy of making changes at home and opening doors to foreigners.
Huang Jikun, the head of Beijing University's China Agricultural Policy Research Center, made the remarks during a meeting with China Science Daily correspondent, according to China's current challenge over the next 2 or three years, whether China will be able to reduce the amount of wheat and rice it stores in grain stores.
Now the amount of grain each receives is 474 kilograms instead of the 400 kilograms that each person in the world should receive annually.
And now China is importing some millions of tons of agricultural products for domestic livestock only.
Nevertheless, those who are concerned about the issue should calm their minds, take a bath and fall asleep, or focus on the affairs of their home.
The Chinese are able to raise themselves with the food they produce themselves.

Media Writers' Contribution to Northern Cooperation.
Modern social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram, Bakanda and many others have long played a role in fostering dialogue, solidarity and fellowship between different communities around the world, as well as delivering messages, stories, and promoting political, educational and business interests.
Young people in Nigeria have become involved in this new technology using social networks, to move with modernity, to make contributions or to splash their mouths in ways that affect their lives.
We can say that these centers have brought us many advances that Northern youth benefit from in business, economics, education and politics of the region.
Many others eat food by writing and delivering messages online, getting jobs or developing jobs.
However, it is unfortunate to see some young people instead of using this opportunity to benefit from the progress that has been made, there have been some who follow the corrupt children of the South who have excelled in the world in disturbing the public, inside and outside the country, or in writing comparisons and abuses of judges and predecessors.
This is a sign of a lack of awareness in the development of the country's youth.
The arrival of the North Media Writers Association in the country is a great honor for providing Northern youth with a view, good judgment and cleaning up the things young people do in Soshi Midaya, so that they can be writing meaningful and promoting the interests of the Northern people.

President Trump Wants to Reduce Drug Pricing.
On Friday, July 24, US President Donald Trump signed four presidential legislation reducing Americans' spending on medications written for them by doctors, as he faces a struggle for re-election and anxiety over his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic in the country.
Trump had earlier said he would make almost all changes to the law, which he signed on Friday, but this is the first time the law has been signed.
One of the legislation would allow for the import of medicines that doctors write for cheaper medicines from countries like Canada officially, while another law would require pharmaceutical companies to reduce their prices, Trump said.
Another law requires a reduction in the cost of insulin injections while a fourth law, which is unlikely to be implemented if drug companies are successful, would require Medicare Insurance schemes to buy medicines at prices that other countries buy, Trump said.

New COVID-19 relief funds will be reintroduced in the United States.
While the judges point out that the number of COVID-19 cases continues to increase in the United States, today Monday Republican Party members in the country's Senate are expected to submit a grant.
It is thought that the funding will amount to $1 trillion to alleviate the radiation caused by the coronavirus pandemic in the country.

Yesterday Sunday, after days of talks with Republicans in parliament, the chief of staff of the U.S. government, Mark Meadows and Secretary of the Treasury- Mali Steven Mnuchin said the subsidy consisted of an expansion of the grants program for those who lost their jobs.

Republicans are complaining that the plan is aimed at some people who are paid more than they are paid when they are working, if the federal government subsidies are combined with those paid by the state.
But Democrats, for their part, have challenged the claim, saying that noticing the coronavirus pandemic is increasing, some workers are not comfortable with returning to work.

How the Akure University of Technology (FUTA) tried to crush the PREMIUM TIMES site on the internet.
Akure University of Technology (FUTA) has recruited an experienced adviser to websites, in order to crush the site PREMIUM TIMES, the outstanding "online" newspaper based in Nigeria.
This experience of crossing the internet has made every strategy that hackers follow on people's sites to access their sites, but it has not succeeded.
He began an investigation into interference, that is, "hacking," since February 28, where he dumped bad weapons on his university campus, and attacked him using the university's "data."
On the other hand, if he tries to penetrate the PREMIUM TIMES internet store with a computer, he again attacks his GSM phone.
Five days ago he pursued the door to the site of the Great PREMIUM TIMES, but it was unsuccessful, even though he used various modern weapons.
He did not succeed in penetrating, because the university did not know that the PREMIUM TIMES newspaper had the chips of its program, which built the foundation and the door of a spouse was not enough to break it.
Then PREMIUM has security officers on the state-of-the-art Internet site including the King of PREMIUM TIMES and the General Doctor, the PREMIUM TIMES website.
These security officers have modern skills in crushing any group of attackers or bards who seek to cheat alone, or carrying out martyrdom attempts to attack in the PREMIUM TIMES database.
The kind of weapons that Internet users have attacked PREMIUM TIMES:
At 8 a.m. he started the race by sliding the door of the Great PREMIUM TIMES, to see how he would crash into it, completely knocking down the arch.
It was unsuccessful at night, the next day and early in the morning, at 6:15 p.m. that he was lucky again, this time by using the "WPScan", which is being done to identify the strength or inadequacy of security measures for large Internet sites such as PREMIUM TIMES.
After 90 minutes, he began attempting to penetrate the power of the state-of-the-art computer script, the "custom script".
It was in the morning that he made every effort to use a computer to lock down the PREMIUM TIMES site completely.
How the Agriculture Treats the Tradition of Preparation:
This interlocutor did not know that PREMIUM TIMES had engaged in the treatment of small mice and large cities entering modern network farms to interfere with page closures or seize the site.
This lack of awareness makes all the materials he uses, generally old ones that are unable to harm or harm PREMIUM TIMES.
That day he suffered badly and was tired of attacking DDOS in the NTP's Likau Railway, which is an old road that has been used since Kano village.
It was March 3 that he made every strategy that remained in his brain and mind, but it all failed.
The attempt to break the door of the PREMIUM TIMES General House came just days after PREMIUM TIMES published news of the day-to-day dispute between President Muhammadu Buhari's Security Adviser, Babagana Monguno and former President's Palace Chief of Staff, Marigayi Abba Kyari.
Some members of the Federal University of Technology in Akure have gossiped to PREMIUM TIMES that the university has recruited a soldier to install large rats on Internet sites, in order to infect, destroy or destroy the huge PREMIUM TIMES.
However, when PREMIUM TIMES contacted the FUTA University, it distanced itself from the attempt to attack the Internet's Great PREMIUM TIMES.
The FUTA said that unless only a student at the university tried alone, not a FUTA spokesman.

Efforts, Struggles and Self-Determination are at the heart of - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
In Longyuan, Hongsipu, Wuzhong, Ningxia State, by the independent Hui tribe, in northwestern China.
There is a committed woman named Li Yaomei or Sadiya (that is, her Islamic name) who is famous for her struggle in life and her efforts to escape poverty.
Her story tells us that effort, determination and self-sufficiency are in the heart.
First of all, Li Yaomei or Sadiya, never lived in class intending to take lessons, so she was unable to read text.
However, God gave her a wealth of insight, intelligence and wisdom, so that she was an example in the area of war and poverty.
About 20 years ago, Ms. Li Yaomei, suffered from stomach cancer, where she underwent surgery up to 3 times.
After her recovery, she encountered a terrible accident, and now she is walking with a metal strap in her foot.
These challenges have thrown her into trouble in addition to her health, as well as the issue of medical expenses, why she received a loan of about 3 hundred thousand yuan, equivalent to more than 16 million naira.
Surprisingly, the challenge faced by Ms. Sadiya made it possible for her to choose and insult her in order to see her improve her life.
She was encouraged by the Chinese government's support.
Its practice is to broom different species based on the use of weeds.
Because of her efforts, her profession has grown significantly, with various workers ordering nurses.
In addition, she has created a number of machines that help her simplify the work.
For example, it takes 15 minutes to connect a large broom, but now in this time, it will connect 5 stones.
In addition, it has provided additional machines to clean the weeds it turns into brooms.
Then there are additional machines that clean animal feed for women, and these machines are still sold to applicants.
Given the challenges that Ms. Sadiya has faced, and the efforts she is still making to improve her life and that of her staff, it will be understood that the applicant must accompany it.
The work of fighting poverty and improving life is not the only thing that hangs on the government.
If the government is to provide support, but people are not motivated or interested in improving their lives by seeking jobs based on their situation, then only day after day will it continue without achieving a goal.
Her story shows that running a profession or income project does not require any fundraising or travel to other cities or overseas.
Because she took into account her situation, she used the resources available in her environment to improve her life.
Furthermore, teacher Sadiya carried out these tasks by standing by her feet without relying on her husband to run away from her.
That is to say, efforts, determination and self-sufficiency are in the heart.
He then showed women the strength to change their lives and stand by their unity without asking for anyone's help.
This is also a lesson that shows that whatever one does, one should stop at one's feet, so that one's trust is uncertain.
Of course, Ms. Sadiya was committed, intelligent and capable of being an example and a role model for the general public.
Again, until March of this year, Malama Sadiya completed the payment of all debts owed, and suspended the acceptance of subsidies from the government on her own behalf.

There is a Reason for U.S. Politics to Improve COVID-19 Cancellation Efforts - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
In recent days, World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has expressed concern over measures other countries are taking to preserve the COVID-19 vaccine that is expected to be produced, stating that priority must be avoided for communities of different countries, while vaccines are being distributed.
And the injection should be distributed in an appropriate way around the world, as it will be suitable for the great benefit of different countries.
Indeed, some U.S. politicians are implementing a policy of prioritizing self-sufficiency, distributing vaccines, and undermining national and international cooperation in the fight against the epidemic.
Meanwhile, the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 around the world has already reached 23 million.
In addition, there are people who have lost their lives as a result of the disease that has reached more than 800 thousand.
Under such severe circumstances, more attention is being paid to the effectiveness of the vaccine, and fortunately, in recent days, there have been great results in the study of the vaccine in some countries, which has generated hope, and faith in the dignity of the people of the world as a whole.
But sadly, some U.S. politicians have expressed a desire to seize the injection.
Even the journal "Science" clarified that the U.S. government has already scrapped COVID-19 vaccine purchasing agreements worth more than $6 billion, from several pharmaceutical companies.
Although the US government's objective is understood to be to be at the forefront of the spread of the disease, other developing countries are also in need of injections, considering that they are more likely to suffer from shortage of health resources.
The Ecologist magazine also pointed out that if the United States achieves the goal of producing a vaccine, the number of injections to be produced in developing countries will decrease.
Mr. John Nkengasong, the director general of the African Center for Disease Control (CDC), also expressed concern over the issue.
As some analysts on daily matters have explained, even if the vaccine has been successfully produced, it is not possible to achieve the goal of preventing the disease, but how to divide the vaccine, which is an important issue for the international community.
And it is appropriate for countries around the world to strengthen the cooperation between them.
Tedros, the Director General of the WHO, also pointed out that if the disease is to be seen after, it must be stopped from all sectors around the world, it is not possible for some parts of the world, or a few countries to achieve the goal of recovery from the effects of the epidemic alone.

Nigeria is facing its most severe economic recession this year.

The Nigerian Bureau of Statistics has announced that the country's economy has experienced an unprecedented recession in the past 10 years, as a result of a recession that exceeded more than 6 percent seen between April and June of this year.
Judges released by the Commission today indicated that between April and June, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic that swept the world and the halt to daily affairs, the Nigerian economy entered a situation that had never entered between 2010 and 2020.
The commission listed the reasons behind the problem, including forcing people to stay home across the country, restricting traffic, banning aviation and closing schools and markets.
The Commission added that taking such measures in countries around the world has caused oil prices to fall, while industry in countries around the world has been closed to cope with the crisis.
Last May, Nigerian Minister of Finance Zainab Ahmed said the Bureau of Statistics had predicted a similar situation, as a result of the difficulties that hampered the management of daily affairs, which forced the government to cut its budget.

Yobe Kills Over N78.8m to Recover Leda Company - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
The Yobe State government's efforts, under Governor Mai Mala Buni, to revive the state-owned medical and medical bag company (Yobe State Polythene Bag and Woben sacks Company), have been praised after more than 10 years in garbage production.
The statement came from the company's chairman (General Manager), Engineer Sha'aibu Adamu Gadaka, in a meeting with our representative at his office in Damaturu, the capital of Yobe State, earlier in the week.
He said the company had been locked up for more than 10 years, but after Governor Buni's arrival it was difficult to rebuild it, which immediately ordered the withdrawal of 78.8 million naira to repair the important parts of the company with an additional 48 million naira managed, while allowing the company to step aside.
Eng. Gadaka added that this gave them the opportunity to buy the products needed to start working at the company, including a new 500 KbA power supply (Janareta), a 500 KbA power distribution device (Taranzero) 500 KbA, a new bagging machine, a bag sewing machine (modern) and other equipment that the company needs.
He said, "Even today, the main objective of Governor Buni's move to revive the company is to provide young people with jobs, reduce spending and generate income for Yobe State".
Gadaka said.
On the other hand, he said the company had gained the favor of the charger he was awarding, as the state government has revived the Potiskum-based Flour and Feed Mill and other merchants courting the company's production.
He said that as well as the state government's efforts to repair the fertilizer company, it was also an establishment to purchase the processed goods from the company.
On the other hand, he said, "There are some challenges we are facing, due to the fact that the company has been locked down for more than 10 years, while the engines have begun to operate, but there is a need for replacing them with other equipment in order to be able to operate without any fear".
Whom we expect before our work takes place, we will try to bring the rest of the products we need.
In addition, Gadaka said, "On the other hand, we urge the Yobe government to give us more equipment, trucks and vehicles that we will use to carry out our work easily, especially to transport our staff to the office so as to avoid coming late, when we start working at low cost".
He also said that in the current situation, the company has sent 25 young people to get training on how to operate machines and devices as well as manage the products that the company uses in its operations and how to engage with the businesses and the people they interact with.
Finally, he said the company has now begun producing various colourful medals, including 100kg, 50kg and 25kg as well as offering retailers based on the colour and condition of their bags, the company is ready to satisfy them.
