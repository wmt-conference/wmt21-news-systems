APC Zargi Niger Governor and Yunkurin Kawo Tarzoma A Jam 'iyyar - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
In a statement issued by the APC on Talatar this week, the governor of Niger State, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, attempted to bring civil unrest into the party.
The document, signed by the Chairman of the Engineering Party, Muhammad Jibrin Imam and Secretary of the Party, Barista Muhammed Liman, stated that over the past six years the party has ruled the state, only $512 million has received.
The document went on to say that the governor's meeting of stakeholders, led last Sunday night, will help continue to bring civil unrest to the party, where they say they have written to the Secretary of State for things that continue to happen in the state.
According to Imam Engineering, "We understand the Governor of Niger State has been trying to distribute the heads of the party's children by preparing a meeting of stakeholders, which is illegal, for any complaint against party leaders, written to the secretaries of the association, to investigate."
He went on to say so far in six years the establishment of the party, N512 million is in the party's account.
He said that what he understood as the governor was being part of the Board of Directors, which was set up July 25, 2020, led by the president to lead to organizing problems between the party's children and withdrawing social distancing in court between the party's children.
He said the funds we receive are paid to the salaries of the party's secretaries, as well as other activities related to the union, staffing and equating some of the problems of union members such as health support because of the lack of access to government subsidies, not any union money we have spent in principle, we challenge the commons to justify wasting union funds.
As I explained, the last general election of the state government was the most important election in the country, which we have done with former Commissioners and Commissioners holding power now in all twenty-five counties in the state, whose funds spent in the elections were shared by the Commissioners to bring their constituencies.
However, it is a mistake for each person to say that union funds are being spent in principle, this is almost unfair and an effort to protect the bad reputation of trying to impel him, saying that he is not a commission set up to investigate how to spend money on the association and who set it up.
Among the funds the complaint says that the money he allegedly received was barred, funding provided by the National Secretary of State, giving some funding to such a person, I challenge the commons on this matter to bring his testimony to the person to prove this allegation in any way.
Imam said that we stand firm against the defection of the APC from the party or the party from the party, adding that any allegation against the party or any party leader from the state level would be written by the committee in charge of the party as stated in section 21 (B) (follow), (d) on page 82 of the party system.
So party stakeholders have no role especially when they attempt to seize the commission's strength so their decision has no effect.
For this reason, they are the most trusted party leaders in the state, borrowed by 21 and six paragraphs on page 87 of the party's constitution, and anything contrary to this will not be used.
Because of the decision of despotism by the leaders of their grip you are mistaken.
He said those who presented together with confidence in yesterday's books at an event that did not promote, which Alhaji Abubakar Magaji, and General Muhammed Garba, and Hon. Ahmed Dogonkoli, including Alhaji Ibrahim Balarabe and all Commissioners, were not members of the constitutional committee in the state.
The chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Mohammed Imam, is the only one to lead the governor to lead state union leaders.
According to the statement, Governor Abubakar Sani Bello recalled the matter of fulfilling the promises made to the people of the state during the polls, traveling with the parents of the association in the government as everyone would benefit in the state and all voices by giving political positions, which is the problem of the governor and the union.
The document praised federal legislators who refused to attend the meeting and drew attention to reconciling all the problems between members of the party, this is not surprising for members of parliament who know their own pain, who refuse to accept arrest as a union law.
Therefore, there is a need for the chairman of the Board of Directors to attract Governor Abubakar Sani Bello on the right position not to attempt to undermine state politics.

China Cimma Nasarorin Wadata Jama 'a Da Abinci - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
Food is the spirit of the life of all creatures, and it is not necessary to live with food.
This is why Chinese judges are increasingly determined to ensure the prosperity of the people of the country and food.
Over the past 71 years since the foundation of the People's Republic of China, the country has achieved great achievements in the food supply, which has given the world a surprise look at the population of the country, which estimates the number of Chinese wastes 1.4 billion.
This effort has helped China to make the greatest contribution to global hunger, as China's chairman Zhang Wufeng said since 1949, China has always put the issue of combating hunger in front of all the country's affairs.
But in recent days, some people and other Western media have again "expressed concern" over the issue that is whether China can raise its own community in the shadow of COVID-19 respiratory disease worldwide?
We thank them very much that they constantly maintain the presence of Chinese people in this world.
Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the country has successfully produced enough food on its television efforts.
The issue of providing sufficient food to the Chinese is one of the main constituencies of the ruling JKS on a daily basis.
At the end of last week, the JKS Supreme Committee's Secretary, you're President of China, Xi Jinping issued an important mandate to stop her food, pointing out that everyone knew that any food and hard work was being done.
Although this year the impact of COVID-19 and the world's respiratory disease is also harmful to China's economy, China can provide sufficient food for its communities.
The figures released by China's National Bureau of Statistics on agricultural products, especially rice that the country will receive this year 2020 show that the total amount of rice available in the country in the first phase of 2020, accounting for 27.29 million tons, which increased by 1.08 million tons, that is, increased by 3.9% compared to the same period in 2019.
Ke Bingsheng, China's former chief agricultural officer, said China has achieved great achievements in the face of supply to the country and food compared with the beginning of the process of making changes at home and opening the door to the outside world.
Huang Jikun, Director of China's Peking Agricultural Policy Research Center, made the announcement during a meeting with the reporter, "The China Science Daily," according to China's serious challenge now in the next 2 or three years, whether China can reduce the amount of wheat and rice it has stored in grain store rooms.
Now the amount of grain each receives is 474 kilograms instead of 400 kilograms that each person in the world should receive every year.
And now China has installed millions of tons of agricultural products to raise pets only.
In addition, those who show concern for the issue should calm their minds, wash and sleep, or focus their attention on the affairs of their country.
The Chinese are able to raise themselves with the food they provide themselves.

Modern social media such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram, Bakandamiya and others have long played a role in creating dialogue, cooperation and fellowship between different nations of the world, and delivering messages, stories, and spreading political policies, education and business.
Young people in Nigeria have been involved in this new technology using social media, to travel with the modern world, to donate or support them in new ways that affect their lives.
We can say that these options have brought us a lot of progress that Northern youths benefit from in business, economic, education and local politics.
A number of people eat through writing and delivering messages online, get jobs or enhance the services they manage.
It is very sad to see how some youths instead of using this opportunity to enjoy the progress that has been achieved, some followed by the contamination of southern children of the country who have been outstanding around the world in the benefit of the people, inside and outside the country, or documenting batting and abuse of judges and enemies.

The advent of the Northern Media Writers Association in the Country is a great deal of kindness, in order to provide a view to the youth of the North, a good keynote and clean up of what the youth are doing in Soshiyal Midaya, as they will be writing meaningful and advocating policies of the North.
It is necessary to give this organization the cooperation it needs, to achieve its good objectives, that will bring alfanu not only to our North region, but also to Nigeria as a whole.

How Akure University of Technology (FUTA) has tried to draw closer to PREMIUM TIMES on the internet.
Akure University of Technology (FUTA) has taken charge of a gogarman for social media outlets, in order to move to the PREMIUM TIMES, the "online newspaper" in Nigeria.
This gogarman crossing online casinos, has made every strategy that social media users follow to join their sites, but has not succeeded.
He began his trial for entering kutsen, namely, "hacking" since February 28, in which he destroyed his equipment facility on the University campus, and advised his attacks by using the "data" of the university.
On the other hand, if he tries to thwart PREMIUM TIMES and computer, he attacks his GSM phone again.
Five days later, he left the door to enter the PREMIUM TIMES, but he did not succeed, even though he used various modern technology weapons.
He did not succeed in screaming, because the university did not know that the PREMIUM TIMES had a coherent plan, which built the front line and the doors of an out-of-staff member was not enough to sack her.
And PREMIUM also has the latest Internet security officer including PREMIUM TIMES and General Dakare, PREMIUM TIMES.
These security forces who have modern skills in crushing any group of multiple members or Barden who sought to fight alone, or perform martyrdom efforts in PREMIUM TIMES.
Similar Makaman and Internet Enforcement Agency Reports to PREMIUM TIMES:
At 8 a.m., he began to fall down the front door of PREMIUM TIMES, to see how he would disperse the beans completely.
Unsuccessfully during the night, and early morning, at 6: 15, he tested again, this time using "WPScan," what is being done to identify the strengths or inability of the security of adult Internet sites such as PREMIUM TIMES.
It was 90 minutes later that he began attempting to scream with the strength of modern machine technology, that is, "custom script."
It was early morning that he made any effort to do it through a computer strategy to completely lock up the PREMIUM TIMES.
How the Gona has dealt with bosses:
The kutsen did not know that PREMIUM TIMES had cooperated with small mice and large cities entering the farms of modern communication sites to close the page or confiscate the site.
This lack of knowledge makes it possible for all the tools he used to use, completely old and unable to treat PREMIUM TIMES any harm or harm.
On the other hand, he suffered unease because he followed through an attack on DDOS in NTP, which is an old way to use since Kano is eradicated.
On March 3, he made every strategy left in his brain and mind, but all he did was not succeed.
The attempt to break the door of PREMIUM TIMES comes a few days after PREMIUM TIMES published an article about the rumor between President Muhammadu Buhari's Expert Advisor at Fannin Security, Babagana Monguno and former Chairman of the Presidential Staff, Marigayi Abba Kyari.
Some members of the Federal University of Technology in Akure, gossip to PREMIUM TIMES, said the university had recruited large rats to enter Internet sites, to affect PREMIUM TIMES, to destroy or destroy it.
However, when PREMIUM TIMES contacted the FUTA, she distanced her from trying to deploy PREMIUM TIMES on the Internet.
She said that if only a student who was a student at the university had tried it alone, she would not have been a spokesman for the FUTA.

First of all, Li Yaomei or Sadiya, had never been in a classroom aimed at taking lessons, which is why she was unable to read the text.
However, God gave her the gift of insight, insight, and wisdom, so that she could be an example in the fight against poverty.
About 20 years ago, Madam Li Yaomei, had been suffering from depression, where she was diagnosed with surgery at least 3 times.
After her fall, she encountered a tragic accident, and now she walks with the strength placed inside her leg.
Those challenges have brought her into critical condition in addition to health, even with the issue of medical treatment, why she received a loan of about 3 thousand yuan, equivalent to more than $16 million.
Surprisingly, the challenge Ms. Sadiya faced was a way of choosing and insulting her to see her improve her life.
Then the Chinese government grants it, adding it to it.
Her profession is to get picked up by different kinds based on vegetation use.
Because of her efforts, my business has developed a lot, where various staff are not eager to find it.
In addition, she invented several engines that help her to simplify the project.
For example, it took 15 minutes to connect one big one, but now in this period, it will connect up to 5.
In addition, it has provided additional engines to clean up the weeds.
Then there is an additional machine that cleans animal feed, and now it's selling these engines to the applicants.
Given the challenges Ms. Sadiya has faced, and her efforts to improve her life and that of her staff, it will be understood that the applicant must be with her.
The work of fighting poverty and improving life is not something that hangs over the government.
If the government is to provide support, but people are not interested in improving their lives by advocating themselves for jobs based on their situation, then the future alone will continue to do without achieving a goal.
Her record shows that running a business or income project does not require some money laundering or travel to other towns or overseas.
Because she considered the situation, she used the resources available in Muhallinta to improve her life.
Moreover, Sadiya's teacher carried out those duties on her leg without relying on her husband, to flee and leave her.
That is, the effort and commitment of self-seeking is something that is in the heart.
It also shows the strength that women have to change their lives and stand firm without asking for help.
This is also a lesson that, whatever a person will do, he should stand by his shoulders, in order to rely on someone unsure.
Of course Ms. Sadiya was a committed, smart and talented person who became an example and a model for the rest of the population.
Also, to March of the year, Ms. Sadiya completed the payment of all loans owed, and also suspended receiving support from the government over its own rainfall.

There are fears US Siyasar will Lalata Kokarin Dakile COVID-19 - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
In recent days, the World Health Organization's director, WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, expressed concern over the measures taken by other countries, to preserve the COVID-19 vaccine that is hoped to be produced, in which he explained that priority must be avoided in different countries, while vaccination against the epidemic is being distributed.
And the injection should be distributed in a timely manner across the world, so it would be appropriate for the great benefit of different countries.
Of course some US politicians are implementing a policy of prioritizing their own morals, in terms of separating the vaccine, and thus paralyzing international cooperation in the fight against the epidemic.
Meanwhile, the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide has already lost 23 million.
In the number, there are people who have lost their lives due to the disease that reaches more than 800 thousand.
Under such severe conditions, the impact of the vaccine is increasingly focused, and the content is that in recent days, there have been great results in studying the vaccine in other countries, an issue that provides optimism, faith in the views of the international community.
But the sad thing is that some US politicians have signaled a goal of injecting the vaccine.
Even the journal "Science" clarifies that the US government has already set aside agreements to purchase COVID-19 vaccines worth more than $6 billion, from several pharmaceutical companies.
Although the US government's policy is understood, the presence of the United States is on the forefront of the spread of the disease, but other developing countries also need a vaccine, considering that they are more likely to suffer from low health resources.
The journal "The Ecologist" also pointed out that if the United States achieves the goal of taking the vaccine to be produced, then the number of vaccine to develop developing countries will decrease.
Chicken lika, director of the African CDC Centers for Disease Control, Mr. John Nkengasong, also expressed concern over this matter.
As some daily commentators have explained, even if the vaccine is successfully produced, it is not possible to achieve the goal of seeing after the disease, but how to separate the vaccine, which is an important issue for the international community.
And it is appropriate for the countries of the world to further strengthen the cooperation between them.
The WHO Director-General Tedros, also pointed out that if it is to be seen after the disease, it must be detained from all sectors around the world, it is impossible for other parts of the world, or that few countries achieve the goal of rehabilitation from the effects of the epidemic alone.
