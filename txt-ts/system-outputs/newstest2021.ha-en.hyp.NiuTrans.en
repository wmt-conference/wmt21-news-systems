While European countries are still testing positive for the novel coronavirus, Nigeria is also not left behind in integrating and testing its own drugs.

NAFDAC also set certain criteria and rules for the inclusion of the vaccine.
The effectiveness of the drugs will be tested in animals for the first time yet.
Mojisola warned pharmacists not to venture into addiction to a drug without the agency allowing it.
In May, NAFDAC revealed that only on social media and newspaper pages are seeing stories of claimants finding a traditional cure for Coronavirus.

APC Accuses Niger Governor of Trying To Bring Tazoma To The Nation
In a statement issued by the APC, the governor of Niger State, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, has been accused of attempting to bring about riots within the party.
The petition, signed by the Chairman of the Engr. Muhammad Jibrin Imam and the Secretary to the Party Barrister Muhammed Liman, stated that over the six years the party has ruled the state, only N512 million has been received.
The petition further stated that the meeting called by the governor of stakeholders, which he chaired on Sunday night last weekend will help keep the party afloat. They said they have written to the national secretariat of the party about the ongoing developments in the state.
According to Engr Imam, "we understand the Governor of Niger State has been trying to divide the party's children by organising a stakeholder meeting, which is illegal, so that any complaint against the party leaders is written to the regional secretariat, so that they can investigate."
He went on to say that so far in six years of forming the party, N512 million is in the party fund.
He said that what he understood as the governor was being part of the National Standing Committee which was set up July 25, 2020, chaired by the president to lead the preparation of the problems between the party members and the withdrawal of the complaints in court between the party members.
He said the money we received was paying the salaries of the party secretariat staff, as well as other activities related to the party, primaries and coordinating other issues of party children such as health support due to lack of access to government support, not any party money we spent illegally. We challenge anyone to make excuses for the waste of party funds.
As I stated, the last two local government primaries were the most important primaries in the country which we have had with former commissioners and commissioners who are currently holding office in all the twenty-five local government areas of the state, whose funds in the elections have been distributed to the commissioners to bring their wards.
He said, "It is not a matter of fact, it is not a matter of fact."
I challenge anyone on this issue to bring his evidence to prove this allegation in any way.
Imam said we stand firm on protecting the APC from the movement of any party or group from the breakdown of the party, adding that any allegations against the party or any party leader from the state level will be written by the regional governing committee as stated in section 21 (B) (bi), (d) on page 82 of the party structure.
The party stakeholders therefore have no role especially when they attempt to seize the power of the committee and therefore their judgment has no effect.
For this reason, they are the best leaders of the party in the state, in chess 21 and paragraph six on page 87 of the party constitution.
Because the decision to desegregate the leaders is a mistake.
He said that those who presented and approved yesterday at the invalidated meeting, which was attended by Alhaji Abubakar Magaji, General Muhammed Garba, Hon. Ahmed Dogonkoli, as well as Alhaji Ibrahim Balarabe and all commissioners, were not members of the party executive committee in the state.
It will be chaired by the Executive Committee of the party chairman Engr Mohammed Imam and not led by the governor of the state party.
According to the report, Governor Abubakar Sani Bello recalled that the issue of fulfilling the promise made to the people of the state during elections, going with the parents of the party in government so that everyone can benefit in the state and all the states through political appointments, which is the problem of the governor and the party.
The petition commended the federal legislators who refused to attend the meeting and drew attention to the reconciliation of all the problems between the party members. This is not surprising for the legislators who know their own pain, to reject dictatorship as party law.
Therefore, the chairman of the National Grief Committee needs to attract Governor Abubakar Sani Bello to the right position not to attempt to destroy the politics of the state.

How perishable food is impacting the health of people in Nigeria.
Some scientists have warned people against eating foods used to prevent food from being damaged that eating such foods harms human health.
The experts made the warning after their findings on the quality of food consumed in the country.
The results show that there are some foods that are dumped to prevent them from rotting.
The study also showed that this chemical is most commonly used in beans, alabo flour and dry fish sold to the public.
The chemical is used because when one sees it he will be interested in buying and using it.
Then eating foods containing this protein causes cancer, kidney disease, cardiac arrest and others.
The people of the country have been urged to focus on keeping away from using these kinds of food items for their health.

Olasumbo explained that one thing pupils fail to understand is that using this chemical to nudge vegetables negatively affects people's health.
For this reason there are diseases including vomiting and diarrhea, eye infections, gynaecology, throat cancer, mouth, liver and others.

President of the African Development Bank acquitted of charges - Freedom Radio Nigeria.
The panel of experts chaired by former Irish Prime Minister Mary Robinson has acquitted African Development Bank President AfDB Akinwumi Adesina.
According to the committee Mr. Akinwumi Adesina is innocent of the alleged bribery.

In the past, it was the United States that insisted Adesina must be investigated over the allegations, following his acquittal by the management of the AfDB, prompting the formation of an expert committee to investigate the scandal.

COVID Prevents Trump Campaign Meeting in Florida.
President Donald Trump Thursday announced he was canceling the Repubican convention to be given a ticket scheduled for Jacksonville, Florida, next month, citing a surge in coronavirus cases.
However convention activities will be held in North Carolina.
Trump said in Jacksonville that having a convention was not appropriate at this time.
President Trump moved part of the GOP convention to Florida last month after they conflicted with Democratic leaders in North Carolina over holding the event in a closed conference room with supporters without wearing masks.
A few Republican delegates will gather in Charlotte, North Carolina, to officially nominate Trump on August 24.
Trump said he would make an acceptance speech in a different format.
Trump, who has been characterizing the impact of the pandemic for months, recently even said that 99 percent of the number of cases seen increased in the United States, would not be affected.

China Achieves Its Social and Food Supplies
Food is the soul of the life of all beings, it cannot be lived necessarily with food.
This is why Chinese judges are increasingly determined to ensure the prosperity of the nation with food.
In the 71 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the country has made major gains in food supply surprising the world in view of the population which according to estimates shows the number of Chinese has topped 1.4 billion.
This effort has been instrumental in the fact that China has made a major contribution to eradicating hunger around the world, as Chinese grain and agricultural products chief Zhang Wufeng once said that since 1949 until now, China has always put the issue of tackling hunger ahead of all the countrys management activities.
But in recent days, some people and some Western media have once again "expressed concern" over the issue namely, can China raise its own nation in the shadow of the new coronavirus-19 respiratory disease worldwide?
We thank them very much for constantly paying attention to the Chinese presence in this world.
Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the country has achieved enough food on its own.
The issue of providing the Chinese with adequate food is one of the main pillars of the ruling JKS daily.
At the end of last week, the General Secretary of the JKS Supreme Committee, the President of China, Xi Jinping gave an important directive to stop food waste, pointing out that everyone knows that every food pill and hard work is available.
Though this year the impact of the COVID-19 respiratory disease that has ravaged the world is also impacting the Chinese economy, China can provide enough food for its people.
The figures released by China's statistics agency on the number of agricultural products, especially rice produced by the country in 2020 show that the total rice production in the country for the first quarter in 2020 was 27.29 million tonnes with an increase of 1.08 million tonnes, an increase of 3.9% compared to the same period of 2019.
Ke Bingsheng, a former president of the Chinese University of Agriculture, also said that China has made major gains in terms of supplying the country with food compared to the early phase of the implementation of the policy of making changes at home and opening up foreign exchange.
Huang Jikun, director of the China Agricultural Policy Institute of Peking University, said during a meeting with the reporter "The China Science Daily," that the greatest challenge facing China now is that in the next 2 or three years, whether China can reduce the amount of wheat and rice it has stored in grain warehouses.
Now the amount of grain each gets is 474 kilograms instead of the 400 kilograms that every international person should get annually.
And now China imports millions of tonnes of agricultural products to raise only domestic animals.
Notably, those who are concerned should calm down, take a bath and go to sleep, or focus their attention on the affairs of their country.
The Chinese can raise themselves with their own food.

Contributing to "North Media Writers" to Northern Cooperation.
Social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram, Bakandamiya and others have long played a role in creating lobbies for dialogue, cooperation and fellowship between different nations of the world, delivering messages, stories, and promoting political, educational and business goals.
Young people in Nigeria have been involved in this new technology using social media lobbying, to go digital, donate or spit on their livelihoods.
We can say that these lobbies have brought us a lot of development that the youths of the North benefit from in business, economy, education and local politics.
Many others are eating through writing and delivering messages online, have found jobs or have developed their own operations.
But it is unfortunate to see that some youths instead of using this opportunity to take advantage of the progress that has been made, there have been some who follow the corrupt southern boys who have excelled in the world to target the people, both inside and outside the country, or to write insults and abuse of judges and their predecessors.
It shows a lack of awareness, in the development of the lives of the youth of the country.
The arrival of the Northern Media Writers Association in the country is a great blessing, to provide the youth of the North with a positive outlook, a positive direction and to clean up the things that the youth are doing in Soshiyal Maya, so that they can write meaningful and promote the policies of the people of the North.
It is imperative that we give this group the cooperation it needs, in order to achieve its goodwill goals, that will bring benefits not only to our Northern region, but to Nigeria as a whole.
I would like to advise our youths, especially the users of the social media lobby to come together to protect the dignity of the North and its children and create a system that will make a difference for all.

A coalition of Kano people has sued the state governor, Abdullahi Ganduje to President Muhammadu Buhari over his attempt to borrow from a Chinese bank to build a railway network.
A coalition of more than 15 groups under the guise of Kano Forum has described what it calls the giant debt that the Ganduje administration wants to nourish for the construction of the first phase of the railway line in Kano as futile to see the major challenges facing the state.

Alhaji Aliyu Mahomes made the announcement in his interview with Leadership Today in Kaduna, adding that if the authorities confirm this after making an investigation, the execution is the only solution.

He said it was shameful to say absolutely that an adult or elderly man should have had a little girl or three months old, three or five years old raped her.

Shinkafi Farmers In Biniwe Expect Harvest And Location In Bana Village
rice farmers in Biniwe State expect to harvest as much as two months after planting.
Some of them trucked in Makurdi expressed hope that harvest would be available anytime between October and November.
A small farmer in Mbatiab-Gboko, Titus Atondo, said he planted his rice in a two hectare area in July.
Atondo said he sourced seeds from the market in his area and they are in two groups of CP and OC rice as he uses Dazzle powder to clear land for planting and composting.
According to Titus Atondo, the challenges of growing rice in the countryside such as maina are huge because we rely so much on labor as customers can't find farm alternatives.
Titus Atondo added that we are recruiting people to do agriculture from the national level to the harvest, adding that this is tired and too much.
Atondo said all the expenses on his farm which are now in place include planting, clearing, composting applications and their harvest is expected to be N2020,000.
Titus Atondo went on to say, however, that he was expecting at least 50 bags of bags as harvest from two hectares that would likely be sold at a cost of N29,000 per 100k bag.
Another major rice farmer, Bitalis Tarnongu, also planted sows in June to July in 274 hectares of the farm whose prices stand at N14, 500 per hectare while the ground floor pays N25,000 a hectare.
He planted 44 varieties (Supi) and Faro 61 (OC) varieties derived from the National Agricultural Development Council (seeds) and some originated from Olam Nigeria.
He added that growth levels at this time are in different areas while some are in the breeding programme, others are in the early stages of killing animals as the farm is farmed in stages.
Tarnongu added that the challenges so far include financial ones since the cost of producing selected animals is expensive and labor costs have increased.
He said the harvest is expected to start in October to November.
He added that the total price of raw materials at the end of the day will be a minimum of N246,000 per hectare while production is expected to honey three tonnes which could translate into N360,000 at a rate of N120 per kilo.
Tarnongu does not use medicines on his rice farm. Instead, he advocates and implements traditional agriculture, adding that, therefore, we use highly pesticide plants, pesticides and medicinal fertilizers.
The Chairman of the National Farmers Union (AFAN) Benue State chapter, Comrade Aondongu Saaku, also expressed hope that the rainfall situation this year will be conducive to high rice production.
According to the chairman of the National Farmers Union (AFAN) rehen Benue state, Comrade Aondongu Saaku, more farmers have been involved in rice production at the end of this year due to the coronavirus pandemic which has prevented many from leaving offices and staying in their fields.
He said this year it will harvest 20 per cent of 2019 production valued at over one million tons.
According to him, the collectors are now taking the statistics of various farmers and when the project is completed, the number of rice farmers in the state will be determined.
The chairman of the National Farmers Union (AFAN) Benue State chapter, Comrade Aondongu Saaku who said that he has farmed three hectares of rice farm, noted that some farmers planted the rice in June while those in short-term farming do so during the harvest season expected in late November or early December.
The AFAN chief added that rice farmers are using raw materials to kill aging vegetation, chemical particulates, and pesticides.
He expressed his concern about the animal challenges that threaten rice production, adding that farmers are making barriers, putting up ropes and clearing the land sidewalks to solve the problem.

At a time when farmers are about to take advantage of their nomads in Nigeria, farmers in Sokoto state have begun to struggle with the threat posed by birds, which could hinder the thought crop.
The threat of red birds in Sokoto state is as cheering back in, considering that there have been signs of a good food season this year 2020.
On the dole, some local farmers embraced a traditional strategy to evict the birds as a young man named Faruk from the Dange Shuni area.
Sambo Abubakar, one of the local farmers, said the birds are now culling all the plants that started to grow on farms.
The chairman of the Association of Farmers of Nigeria Sokoto State chapter, Murtala Gagado Minannata, said that now in two-thirds of Sokoto state this is being affected.
He also said they are now waiting to hear the situation of local government areas in the state to put together a report to send to the state and federal Ministry of Agriculture to take action to help farmers.
The Federal Ministry of Agriculture official in charge of the department of bird and pesticide, Ya'u Neweri Kagara, said there was no more than a month to complete the spraying of bird flu in Sokoto area.
He added that the birds are coming in from the Republic of Nijer and Benin, and international business must have an agreement before the issue is jointly addressed.
In June, the federal government launched a bird spraying operation in 12 northern states of Nigeria that are neighbouring foreign countries by which the birds are coming into Nigeria.

New COVID Support Funds Will Be Reintroduced in the US.
As figures show that the number of COVID cases continues to rise in the United States, Monday Republican pupils in the Senate are expected to introduce a funding bill.
It is thought that the support will be worth $1 trillion to ease the pain caused by the coronavirus pandemic in the country.
The plan comes days ahead of the expiration of the first funding relief deadline for millions of Americans who have lost their jobs due to the COVID pandemic.
On Sunday, after days of negotiations with Republican pupils in the National Assembly, the U.S. chief of staff, Mark Meadows and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the funding involved expanding the funding program for those who lost their jobs.
But according to them, this time, Americans will see 70 percent of their previous funding.
On Friday, the initial support deadline will end in which some package of funding is paid to those who have lost their jobs. They are also given 600 per week in addition to the one provided by states.
Republicans, however, argue that this program means some people who are paid get higher rates than they are paid when they work, when federal government subsidies are combined with those paid by the state.
But Democratic lawmakers, for their part, challenged that authority saying that noting the coronavirus pandemic is rising, some workers are not comfortable enough to return to their jobs.

How Akure University of Technology (FUTA) tried to crack down on PREMIUM TIMES online.
The Akure University of Technology (FUTA) has hired an experienced cybersecurity expert to crack down on PREMIUM TIMES, a prominent "online" newspaper in Nigeria.
This experienced crossing of the barriers to the internet has made every strategy for the hardest-hit people to access their sites, but it has not been successful.
He began his addiction to "hacking" since February 28, where he stationed his equipment munitions on campus, and carried out his attacks using the university's "data."
On the other hand when he tries to infiltrate PREMIUM TIMES internet hard drive and computer, he again attacks another GSM phone.
Five days cur spent poaching the entrance to the site of the PREMIUM TIMES Great Archive, but he was unsuccessful, despite using various high-tech munitions.
He did not succeed in infiltrating, because the university did not know that PREMIUM TIMES had a clear plan for it, which built the precinct and the bed of the door by a dagger was not enough to smash it.
Then PREMIUM has the security giants of its Great Internet Archive including the King of the Battle of PREMIUM TIMES and the Great Depression, PREMIUM TIMES Web Warning.
These security forces who have modern experience in crushing any group of multiple or a barden who seek to mumble alone, or perform martyrdom are trying to attack the PREMIUM TIMES Information Archive.
What is meant by Sidratul-Muntaha that the Quran has mentioned?
8 a.m. he started stabbing and sliding the door of the PREMIUM TIMES Great Archive, to see how he would make a suicide and break in, ruining the hard drive completely.
He failed in the night, and the next morning, 6: 15 he became addicted to luck again, this time by using the "WPScan," which is being done to identify the strength or impotence of the security measures of adult Internet sites such as PREMIUM TIMES.
After 90 minutes, he began to attempt to infiltrate the digital skills of the machine, the "custom script."
In the morning, he made every effort by sidelining the computer software in order to completely lock down PREMIUM TIMES.
How the Goa Treated the Key Monkey:
This plaintiff did not know that PREMIUM TIMES had disproportionately treated small rats and large monkeys entering the land of their social networks to crack down on a page or seize a tricycle.
It was his lack of knowledge that caused all the parcels he used, completely old looks that could not do PREMIUM TIMES any harm or harm.
On this day he suffered futile exhaustion because he went through a DDOS attack at the NTP Likau Secretariat, which is an old method that has been used since Kano's village.
March 3, he performed every remaining technique in his brain and mind, but all failed.
The attempt to break the door of the PREMIUM TIMES General Archive came just days after PREMIUM TIMES published a comparison of the takeover between President Muhammadu Buhari's Adviser on Security, Babagana Monguno and former Head of State, Late Abba Kyari.
Some inside the Federal University of Technology in Akure, gulped to PREMIUM TIMES that the university had recruited a cavalry of large rats who were infiltrating Internet sites, so that they could target the page and the Great Archive of PREMIUM TIMES, destroy or destroy it.
However, when PREMIUM TIMES contacted the FUTA university, it distanced itself from this attempt to try to attack the PREMIUM TIMES Internet Archive.
FUTA said unless only a tamper with a student at the university tried it alone, not a FUTA spokesman.

How Ganduje made the princes sacked by King Ado and Sanusi, he will make them kings in Kano.
Governor Abdullahi Ganduje wants the Kano State House of Assembly to amend the 2019 state law, thereby ensuring the appointment of two senior Kano emirates by the late Emir Ado Bayero and King Sanusi, so that state law will ensure their appointment as senior appointees in Kano.
The Kano Assembly Speaker, Abdullahi Gafasa, read the Ganduje request before the House of Representatives, and they are expected to have a session to discuss the matter before the end of July.
The princes who were brought back to Kano Emirate were Aminu Babu Dan'agundi and, who made the Emir of Dawaki Mai Tuta and Cyrus Kano, Sanusi Ado-Bayero.
The two were removed by King Ado and King Muhammadu Sanusi, over alleged constipation.
The Great Son challenged his impeachment in court.

He then challenged his removal in the Kano State High Court up to the Supreme Court.
Before the Court of Appeal, the Federal Court of Appeal ruled that Aminu Babu be reinstated to his seat.
But the Emir of Kano under the rule of Muhamamdu Sanunmsi II, appealed, with the Court of Appeal emphasizing his removal as Hakimin Gabasawa, also the Emir of Dawaki Mai Tuta, on June 5.
After Sanusi Bayero was removed, Cyrus Kano for refusing to accept the Emir of Kano appointed Muhammdu Sanusi II in June, 2014.
He was later appointed Chairman of the National Ports Authority in the Jonathan era.
He was appointed Wamban Kano, under the current Emir of Kano.

Trying To Deliberate and Seeking My Self Is a Mind - Leadership Newspaper.
In Longyuan village of Hongsipu region of Wuzhong, Ningxia, Hui Autonomous Region, in northwestern China.
There is a determined woman named Li Yaomei or Sadiya (her Islamic name) who is famous for her struggles in life and her success in her efforts to get out of poverty.
Her story tells us that the effort, determination, and self-seeking are at heart.
At first, she was Li Yaomei or Sadiya. She never sat in class with the aim of taking lessons, making her unable to read bare text.
However, God has given her the gift of insight, patience, and wisdom.
About 20 years ago, Ms. Li Yaomei, suffered from stomach cancer, leading to surgery on her stomach 3 times.
After her recovery, she encountered a serious accident. She is now walking with a metal placed in her foot.
These challenges have hit her hard in addition to health, even the issue of medical expenses, which is why she received a loan of about 3 hundred thousand yuan, worth more than $16 million.
Ironically, the challenge Ms. Sadiya faced slipped away from her a way of choosing and scrambling to make her life better.
Then the support of the Chinese government increased her confidence.
Her business is to broach different species based on vegetation use.
Because of her naivety, her profession has grown exponentially, with various employers ordering her crumbs.
In addition, she invented several machines that helped her simplify the process.
For example, she takes 15 minutes to attach one large broom, but now in this time, she will attach up to 5 brooms.
In addition, she has developed some additional machines that clean the weeds she repels.
Then there are more machines that clean her pet food, and now even sell these machines to applicants.
Given the challenges Ms. Sadiya has gone through, and the efforts she still makes to improve her life and that of her staff, it will be understood that the applicant is indeed with the receipt.
The task of fighting poverty and betterment is not entirely on the government.
If the government is to provide support, but people have no frustrations or desire to improve their quality of life by finding themselves jobs based on their situation, the egg yolk alone will continue to be done without achieving any goals.
Her story shows that running a business or income project does not require any large sums of money or trips to other towns or abroad.
For her to consider her condition, she used the resources available in her environment to make her life better.
Moreover, educator Sadiya carried out these tasks on standing by her foot without relying on her husband, in order to flee and leave her.
That is to say, efforts, determination, self-determination are at heart.
It then shows how powerful women are to change their lives and stand by their shoulders without asking someone else for help.
This is also a lesson that, whatever one has to do, he should stand by his shoulders, because relying on someone else is uncertain.
Ms. Sadiya was indeed a committed, smart and hapless woman who became an example and a role model for others.
Also, by March this year, Ms. Sadiya had completed the payment of all her loans and also stopped receiving support from the government over her own whisky.

In a statement issued on Monday, February 13, by the president of the All Progressives Congress (APC)
In recent days, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has expressed concern over the steps taken by some countries to preserve the COVID-19 respiratory vaccine that is hoped to have been developed, noting that priority must be avoided on the communities of different countries, while sharing the vaccine for the pandemic.
And the vaccine should be distributed in a timely manner across the world, as it will be in line with the great interests of different countries.
Some US politicians are indeed implementing the policy of prioritising their own interests, regarding vaccine sharing, and also undermining international cooperation in the fight against the pandemic.
Currently, the overall number of confirmed COVID cases worldwide has already topped 23 million.
In the total, there are people who have lost their lives to the virus of more than 800 thousand.
Under such severe circumstances, the focus is increasingly on the effectiveness of the vaccine, and the good news is that in recent days, there have been great results in vaccine studies in other countries, creating hope, and faith in the entire international community.
But sadly, some US politicians have expressed desire to seize the vaccine.
Even the journal "Science" noted that the U.S. government has already brokered deals to buy COVID-19 vaccines worth more than $6 billion, from several pharmaceutical companies.
While the policy of the US government is understood to be the US at the forefront of the spread of the virus, other developing countries also need the vaccine pilots, considering they are more likely to suffer from limited medical resources.
The journal "The Ecologist" also pointed out that if the United States achieves the goal of mass vaccination, the number of vaccines available to developing countries will decrease.
Chicken lika executive director of Africa CDC Mr. John Nkengasong, also expressed concern over this issue.
As some commentators have noted, even if a vaccine is successfully developed, it is impossible to achieve the goal of seeing beyond the pandemic unless the vaccine is designed to be distributed, which is a very important international issue.
And the international community is right to strengthen their cooperation.
WHO Director-General Tedros, too, pointed out that if it is to see beyond the pandemic, it must be curbed from all fields across the world, making it impossible for some parts of the world, or a few other countries to achieve the goal of recovering from the impact of the pandemic alone.

Nigeria is facing its most severe recession this year.
Publishing date: 24 / 08 / 2020 - 16: 33.
The Nigeria Bureau of Statistics has announced that the economy has experienced an unprecedented recession in the past 10 years, with a recession surpassing the more than 6 percent seen between April and June this year.
Figures released today by the Commission show that between April and June, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic that has engulfed countries around the world and the suspension of normal activities, the Nigerian economy entered a state that never entered between 2010 and 2020.
The agency listed the reasons for the problem including forcing people to stay home across the country, banning vehicle traffic, banning flights and closing schools and businesses.
The agency added that similar measures in countries around the world have caused oil prices to fall sharply, while factories in countries around the world have also been closed to tackle the problem.
In May, Nigerian Finance Minister Zainab Ahmed said the Bureau of Statistics predicted a fall in such a situation, as a result of these problems that have hindered day-to-day operations, forcing the government to slash its budget.

The Minister of Niger Delta Development in Nigeria, Godswill Akpabio has named the pupils who were awarded the NDDC contract for some major projects.

Among the names of the pupils who received the contract were the chairman of the Senate Committee on Niger Delta, Peter Nwabaoshi who received a list of 53 contracts as announced by Minister Akpabio.
Mr. Akpabio also said that Senator Mathew Urhoghide kicked off six contracts, and Senator James Manager also received six contracts, while former Senator, Samuel Anyanwu received 19.
As well as the former chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on NDDC, Nicholas Die, he received 74 contracts, which is the highest number as Akpabio disclosed in a series of documents sent to the committee investigating alleged mismanagement in the Niger Delta Development Commission.
There were also a minority of pupils from Ondo and Edo who received the contracts from the NDDC.
The documents released by Akpabio, however, show that most of the contracts were awarded in 2018, but it is not clear how much money was spent on running them.
This comes after Speaker of the House of Representatives Femi Gbajabiamila threatened Akpabio in court over his alleged attempt to discredit pupils.

Yobe Pledges Over N78.8m in Recovery of Leda Corporation.
The efforts of the Yobe State government, under Governor Mai Mala Buni, have been commended for revitalising the plastic and plastic bags, owned by the state (Yobe state Polythene Bag and Woben sacks Company), after over 10 years in the flock not working.
This was disclosed by the chairman of the company (General Manager), Engr. Sha'aib Adamu Gadaka, in a conversation with our representative at his office in Damaturu, Yobe state capital, earlier in the week.
He said that the company has been in lockdown for over 10 years, but after the arrival of Governor Buni it was difficult to forge a restructuring plan, which immediately ordered the disbursement of N78.8 million to rehabilitate key parts of the company with an additional N48 million of management, while allowing the company to step on its feet.
Eng. Gadaka further stated that this gave them the opportunity to buy the products needed to start working in the company, including a new 500 KbA power supply device, a 500 KbA power distribution device, a 500 KbA power distribution device, a new vacuum cleaner, a vacuum cleaner (modern) and other equipment that the company needs.
He said, "Even today, the main objective of Governor Buni's move to revitalise this company is to create jobs for the youth, reduce social distancing and provide Yobe state with income."
Gadaka said.
On the other hand, he said the company has won the favor of masaya hajar it alleges, as the state government has revitalised the flour and animal feed plant (Yobe Flour and Feed Mill) in Potiskum and other traders who are targeting the produce produced by the company.
He said that the flare-up and the attempts by the state government to rehabilitate the composting company are also an outlet for the procurement of goods controlled by the company.
On the other hand, he said, "There are some challenges that we are facing, on the basis that the company has been in lockdown for over 10 years, while the machines are starting to work but there is a need to shift us to other products in order to be able to operate without any fear."
Which we expect before our operations kick off, we will try to bring in other products that we need.
Furthermore, Gadaka said, "On the other hand, we are asking the Yobe government to give us more equipment, a truck and vehicles that we will be using to do our jobs more easily, especially for transporting our workers to the office so as to avoid coming late, when we start working on the bed."
He also said that in the current situation, the company has sent 25 youths to train how to work with drinkers and machines as well as manage the products used by the company in its operations and how to interact with the people they are in contact with.
He said the company has now started producing various types of plastic bags, which include even the size of 100kg, 50kg and 25kg as well as offering footprints to traders depending on the colour and nature of their bags. The company is ready to satisfy them.
