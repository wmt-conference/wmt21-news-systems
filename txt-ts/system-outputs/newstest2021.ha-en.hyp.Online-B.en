Ahmed Dogonkoli, including Alhaji Ibrahim Balarabe and all the commissioners, are not members of the party's executive committee in the state.

The statement added that Governor Abubakar Sani Bello recalled that the issue of fulfilling the promises made to the people of the state during the elections, and walking with party parents in government for the benefit of all in the state and all zones through giving political positions, which is the problem of the governor and the party.
The letter commended the members of the Federal Parliament who refused to attend the meeting and called for reconciliation on all issues between the two parties. they reject dictatorship as party law.
Therefore, there is a need for the chairman of the National Interim Committee to draw the attention of Governor Abubakar Sani Bello to his position and not to try to destroy the state's politics.

And now China imports millions of tons of agricultural products just for raising livestock.
Therefore, those who are concerned should calm down, take a bath and go to sleep, or focus on the internal affairs of their country.

Young people in Nigeria have embraced this new technology by using social media, to keep abreast of the latest trends, to contribute or to contribute their voices to the latest developments in their lives.
We can say that these forums have brought us a lot of development that the youth of the North are benefiting from in terms of trade, economy, education and politics in the region.

We should therefore use our God-given talents to contribute and advise, to provide the North with a satisfactory way to revitalize its economy.
The North should provide revenue streams to implement its budget without waiting for the federal government to spend money.
In addition, if we want to develop the North, we must focus on education, agriculture, tourism, health and science and technology.

A Stranger Man Is A King, For Their Praise.
Beyoncé's song "Black is King" continues to be praised and criticized around the world for its portrayal of African culture.
In South Africa, where the 85-minute film was filmed, many said it was more than a movie.
Black is King is a full-length film directed by American singer and songwriter Beyonce.
The film is best known for its song "The Lion King: The Gift".
Last year the film was made in the United States, South and West Africa, and Europe, and featured many African artists.
The film, released in July, has been well-received by audiences, but there has also been some criticism.
Some say that Beyoncé, who was born in Houston, Texas, in the United States, borrowed African elements illegally, especially the features that characterize Africa in the film, while traditionally she has no base on the African continent.
But in South Africa, those who made the film are very happy.
Sibusiso Mathebula, a student of filmmaking, said he was honored to be included in the cast.
He said the film impressed him.
The film touches on many things that were not taught in school about black history.
He said it was only when he saw the film that he first saw the story and the clothes she was wearing and all the elements of the film, which developed a lot more than expected.
Beyoncé-based singer Kgosi Motosoane says Africans abroad - including black Americans - have the right to use what some see as cultural artifacts.
He said he was interested in the film.
Kgosi said black women are mostly at the grassroots level in society.
So their emergence in such highly influential issues is encouraging.
Mathebula, a film student, says Beyoncé's film inspired him to start making his own film to spread the word about Africa.
Beyoncé's Africans agree on one thing: If Man's Mouth is King, then Beyonce is queen.

Her story tells us that effort, perseverance, and self-seeking are things that are in the heart.
At first, Li Yaomei or Sadiya never sat in class to study, so she could not read or write.
However, God has endowed her with a wealth of ingenuity, talent and wisdom, making her a model in the fight against poverty.
About 20 years ago, Li Yaomei was diagnosed with colon cancer, which led to her undergoing three operations on her abdomen.
After regaining consciousness, she suffered a serious accident and is now walking with the implant in her foot.
These challenges have put her in a difficult position in addition to her health, as well as the issue of medical bills, which is why she has taken out a loan of about 300,000 yuan, equivalent to more than N16 million.

The support from the Chinese government has also strengthened her.
Her job is to make different types of brooms based on the use of grass.

In other words, effort, perseverance, and self-seeking are at the heart of it.
It also shows the power of women to change their lives and stand on their own two feet without seeking anyone else's help.
This is also a lesson that shows that, whatever a person does, he should stand on his own two feet, because dependence on someone is uncertain.
