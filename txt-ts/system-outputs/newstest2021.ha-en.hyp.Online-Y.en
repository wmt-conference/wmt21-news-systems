APC Criticises Governor Neja With Attempts to Bring Repression At the Party - Leadership English Newspapers.
In a statement released by the APC party Tuesday it accused the governor of the State of Neja, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, of attempting to bring violence into the party.
The paper, signed by the Chairman of the Engineering Party Muhammad Jibrin Imam and the Secretary of the Party of Barista Muhammad Liman, states that, over a six-year period of the party's sovereign state, only $512 million received.
The paper goes on to say, a meeting called by the governor of stakeholders, which he chaired on the night of the weekend last week will help to keep the party's agenda, where they say they have written to the secretary of the party's national agenda of ongoing developments in the state.
According to Engineer Imam, “we understand the Governor of the State of Neja is trying to dismantle the heads of the members of the party by organizing a meeting of stakeholders, illegally, for any complaints against the party leaders, in writing to the secretariat of the party, in order to research “.
He went on to say that so far at the age of six the party's founding, 512 million dollars are in the party's fund.
He said, what he understood as governor of his presence in the National Standing Committee that was set up were July 25, 2020, led by the president to lead the coordination of the problems between the members of the party and withdraw the complaints in court between the members of the party.
He said that the funds we receive are paying the salaries of the party's secretaries, as well as other activities related to the party, expert elections and settling some of the party's problems such as health subsidies because of the lack of access to government subsidies, not a party fee we have illegal spending, we challenge every one to bring us the proof of disabling party funds.
As I point out, the election of the State Department last year was the most important expert election held in this country that we have done with the former commissioners and commissioners who currently hold the powers in all twenty-five local authorities in the State, in which the funds spent on elections are split up by the commissioners to bring their nominees.
Therefore, it is a mistake for every person to say that party funds are being spent illegally, this is almost unfair and the efforts to protect the bad are just trying to hang it, saying that there is no commission set up to investigate how the party's money was spent and who founded it.
Among the funds that the plaintist claims were discharged, it was funds provided by the secretariat of the national party, not some such funds and therefore I challenge each one on this subject that brought his testimony to substantiate this allegation in any way.
Imam said that we stand firm on protecting the APC party from the attempted or whoever or party from disrupting the party, adding that any allegations against the party or any other leader of the party from the state level would be written down by the committee in charge of the association as defined by the party's structure in subsection 21 (B) (follow), (d) on page 82 of the party's constitution.
The party's stakeholders therefore don't have any role in particular if they attempt to seize the committee's capacity so their decision has no effect.
For this reason, they are the valid leaders of the party adopted in the State, in article 21 and paragraph six on page 87 of the party's constitution, any contravention of this shall not be applied.
Because the verdict and the leaders grip them you are wrong.
He said, those who presented with confidence yesterday Monday at the event that did not improve, which was held by Alhaji Abubakar, General Mohammed Garba, and Hon. Ahmed Dogonkoli, including Alhaji Ibrahim Balarabe and all commissioners, are not members of the party's ruling committee in the state.
The executive committee of the party's stakeholders leader Engineer Mohammed Imam is the only one to be chaired by not the governor will lead the leaders of the state party.
The paper adds that the governor of Abubakar Sani Bello recalls that the matter of fulfilling the obligations made by the public of the state during the election, the travel of the party's parents in the government so that everyone can benefit in the state and in all directions by granting political positions, which is the problem of the governor and party.
The paper praised the members of the federal legislature who refused to attend the meeting and drew attention to the settlement of all the problems between the members of the party, this is not surprising for those parliamentarians who are aware of their own pain, and reject false arrest as a law party.
Therefore, there is a need for the Chairman of the National Standing Committee to attract Governor Abubakar Sani Bello on the right position not to attempt to undermine the state's politics.

China Acquaints its People's Supply and Food - Leadership English Newspapers.
Food is the life spirit of all creatures, it can not be lived except with food.
That is why China's rulers are increasingly committed to ensuring the prosperity of the nation and food.
In the past 71 years since the foundation of the People's Republic of China, the country has made significant achievements in the field of food production and has given the world a surprise to see the country's population which is estimated to have surged 1.4 billion Chinese dollars.
This effort has greatly helped the case that China has made a huge contribution to the eradication of hunger in the world, as the head of the Chinese agency for the preservation of cereals and agricultural products Zhang Wufeng has once stated that, since 1949 and until now, always, China puts the issue of combating hunger before all the processes of the country's affairs.
But in later days, some people and other Western media have once again “expressed concern” over the issue of whether China could reclaim its nation itself in the shadow of the COVID-19 flu bull all over the world?
We are grateful to them for the new and constantly maintain the presence of the Chinese in this world.
Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the country has successfully produced enough food based on the male of its efforts.
The issue of supply to Chinese food is one of the main agenda of the ruling JKS party on a daily basis.
At the end of last week, the general secretary of the JKS Supreme Committee, you are President of China, Xi Jinping issued an important order to quit food, stating that everyone knows that any food and hard work are found.
Although this year the impact of COVID-19's global warming disease is also causing harm to China's economy, but China can provide enough food to its nation.
The figures released by the Chinese Statistics Agency on the number of agricultural products, particularly the rice that the country will receive in this year 2020 show that the average yield in the country for the first period in 2020, reached 27.29 million tonnes where it increased 1.08 million tonnes, i.e. increased 3.9% compared to the equivalent of the 2019 period.
He also Ke Bingsheng, the former president of China's agricultural university said that China had achieved significant achievements in the country's supply and food compared to the early phase of the implementation of the policy of making domestic changes and opening the door to crossings.
Huang Jikin, director of the China Agricultural Policy Research Center of Peking University, explained during a meeting with a representative of the newspaper “The China Science Daily”, that the severity of the challenge that China now faces is in the next 2 or three years, whether China can reduce the amount of wheat and rice it stores in stores of cereals.
Now the amount of grain per person gets reaches 474 kg instead of the 400 kg that every international person should earn all year.
And now China is importing some millions of tons of farm products for the rendering of domestic animals alone.
Therefore, those who are concerned with the issue should be calm, take a bath and go to sleep, or focus their attention on the affairs of their home country.
The Chinese are able to reproduce themselves with the food they produce themselves.

The contribution of 'Northern Media Writers' to the North Pole.
Modern social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram, Bakandamiya and others have long played a role in creating dialogue, solidarity and intimacy between different international communities, with the delivery of messages, stories, and the spread of political initiatives, Manofe- and business.
Young people in Nigeria participate in this new technology using friendly hubs, to travel the modern world, to contribute or to their mouths in the latest developments affecting their lives.
We can say, these forums have brought us a lot of progress that the young North is benefiting from in the business, economy, education and politics of the region.
Many others are eating through writing and delivering messages on the Internet, have experienced jobs or have developed projects they manage.
It is rather frustrating to see how some young people instead take advantage of this opportunity to benefit from the progress achieved, and some have been tracking the pollution of the South of this country who have gone out of the world in public interest, in and outside the country, or writing writing of the insult and abuse of judges and predecessors.
What symbolizes the lack of civilization, in the development of life of the young country this is in.
The arrival of the North Media Writers Association in this country is a great event, in order to provide the North's young people with a clear vision, optimization and refinement of the experiences of young people in Soshiyal Midya, so that they can become engaged in meaningful writing and spreading the objectives of the North's society.
It is our duty to give this organization the cooperation it needs, in order to achieve its good objectives, that will bring benefits not only to our northern region, but also to Nigeria as a whole.
I advise our young people, especially the users of the friendly hall, to come together to protect the integrity and independence of the North, and to develop a framework that will bring about change for all.
As our North leaders who have fallen right such as the Sardaunes of Sakkato, the North's first premier Sir Ahmadu Bello, his allies have made the goal of creating the North's nation.
It is reported that the late source of war against oppression and poverty Mr. Amini Kano, once said that Nigeria is one country, but everyone knows his father's house!
We therefore say that, of course, when we call for national development and the promotion of governance, at any stage, we are increasingly calling for the unity of the people of the North, without prejudice to religious or ethnic discrimination, to bring our region to progress.
If we consider how the North is at it it is not now.
We should therefore take advantage of the skills that God has given us in contributing and negotiating, in order to provide the North with a satisfactory way to revive its economy.
The North should provide revenue sources to carry out its budget without waiting for the federal government to waste money.
In addition, if we want the development of the North, we attach importance to education, agriculture, tourism, health and science and technology.
It is not necessary that with money we will contribute, there are many different ways of doing it.
We see thus that the North will meet our predecessors!

The Order said that despite these subsidies, there was no role in the government in the health sector and that had led them to begin withdrawing their subsidy.

On the one hand, if he tries to intercept the PREMIUM TIMES hard drive and computer, he also reattacks his GSM phone.
Five days the cur spent trying to access the Super Archives PREMIUM TIMES, but he did not succeed, despite the fact that he used various high-tech weapons.
It did not succeed, because the university did not know that the PREMIUM TIMES newspaper had its own strategic plan, which built the front and the door that was not enough to bust her.
The PREMIUM also has a number of modern website security officers including PREMIUM TIMES Battle King and Chief Defender, PREMIUM TIMES Website Shield.
These are security officers who have the modern experience of crushing down any multiple groups or barders who seek to be alone alone, or martyrdom trying to get into the PREMIUM TIMES Database.

On that day he suffered nonsense to be followed by a DDOS attack on the NTP Likau Rite, which is the oldest method used since the village Kano.
It was March 3 that he made any strategy remaining in his brain and mind, but all did not succeed.
This attempt to break the door of the PREMIUM TIMES complex comes a few days after the PREMIUM TIMES published a string of sanctions between President Muhammadu Buhari in the Security Area, Babagana Monguno and the former Chief of Staff, the late Abba Kyari.
Some at the Federal University of Technology in Akure, told the PREMIUM TIME that the university had recruited the military - hired some of the leading rats on the Internet penetration sites, in order to apply to the Premium TIME hard disk, destroy or destroy it.
However, the PREMIUM TIMES has contacted the University of FANA, and has been able to find the PREMIUM TIMES Internet.

Trying With Himself Seeking, It's a Heart - Leadership English Newspapers.
In the Longyuan village of the Hongsipu suburb of Wuzhong city in Ningxia's self-defeated Hui tribe, located in northwest China.
There is a young woman named Li Yaomei or Sadiya (her Islamic name) famous for her struggles in life and her success based on her attempts to get out of poverty.
Her story tells us that, desperate and self-seeking, it's a thing that's in the heart.
First of all she was Li Yaomei or Sadiya, she never became in class aimed at taking a lesson, which was why she could not read without writing.
But God gave her talent and talent and a lot of wisdom, where she was an example in the fight against poverty.
Approximately 20 years ago, Madam Li Yaomei, underwent abdominal cancer, where she was led to a stomach surgery up to 3 times.
After her revival too, she encounts a terrible accident, now she is walking with a metal embedded in her shoulders.
Those challenges she faced threw her into the most difficult back to the safe, even the issue of the drug, why she took a loan of about 3 thousand yuan, compared to over 16 million dollars.
What is surprising is that this challenge faced by Mrs. Sadia has made her a way of persecution and harassment to see her improve her life.
Then the subsidies offered by the Chinese government, increased her momentum.
Its profession is to make a broom of different varieties based on the use of vegetation.
Because of her male efforts, tata's profession has developed very well, where she is offered by various ministries.
In addition, she has created a number of machines that help her to simplify the task.
For example, it takes 15 minutes to attach one large broom, but now in this time, it will connect the broom up to 5.
In addition, it provides additional machines that clean the cigar and restore the broom.
Then there is an additional machine that cleans women's animal feed, and now that these machines are still sold to applicants.
Given the challenges posed by Ms. Sadia, and her still efforts to improve her life and that of her staff, it will be understood that my solicitor will have to be met.
The fight against poverty and the improvement of life, is not something that hits the covets on the government.
If the government is to continue to provide support, but people are unwilling or willing to improve their well-being by asking themselves for jobs based on their situation, then only the previous one will continue to be done without achieving a goal.
Her article shows that the management of an enterprise or income project does not require certain financial or trips to other cities or abroad.
In order for her to reflect the circumstances of her life, she used the resources available in her environment to improve her life.
In addition, Ms. Sadiya carried out these actions on the basis of standing on her shoulders without relying on her husband, in order to run away and leave her.
That is, the effort and the tiredness of the head, is a thing that is in the heart.
It then shows how strong women have to change their lives and stick to their shoulders without resorting to someone else's help.
This is also a lesson that shows that, whatever one should do, he should stand his shoulder, because dependence on someone is uncertain.
Of course, Mrs. Sadiya was a very talented, smart and talented man who was a model and a learning point for the rest of the population.
Also to the last March, Mrs. Sadiya completed the payment of all the debts under review, and then stopped receiving support from the government on the basis of her own mercy.

There is a Fake of American Polists Will Degrade the Trying of Dakile COVID-19 - Leadership English Newspapers.
In recent days the Director-General of the World Health Organization, WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, expressed concern over measures taken by other countries to preserve the vaccine for COVID-19 expected to be produced, stating that priority must be avoided different countries, while sharing the vaccine for epidemic prevention.
The injection should also be divided in a more appropriate way across the globe, as that would suit the great interests of different countries.
Indeed, some American politicians are implementing the goal of prioritizing their own interests, in terms of sharing vaccines, as well as disrupting international cooperation in the fight against the epidemic.
Meanwhile, the overall number of people confirmed to have been infected with COVID-19 disease across the world has already surpassed 23 million.
In the amount too, there are people who have lost their lives as a result of a disease that reaches more than 800 thousand.
Under such severe circumstances, the focus is increasingly being placed on the impact of vaccines, and the thrill is that, in the later days, there has been significant results in the analysis of the injection in other countries, the cause of optimism, and the belief of the whole international community unanimous.
But the sad thing is that some American politicians have shown the goal of knocking down the needle.
Even the journal “Science” states that the U.S. government has already prolong agreements to buy COVID-19 vaccines worth more than $6 billion, from several pharmaceutical companies.
Although, it is understood that the purpose of the United States government is to be a frontline in the spread of the disease, but other developing countries are also in need of high doses, given that they are more vulnerable to poor health resources.
The magazine “The Ecologist” also pointed out that, if the United States achieved the goal of scrapping the vaccine to be produced, then the number of needles to be produced by developing countries would decrease.
She also co-director of the African Centre for Disease Control CDC Mr. John Nkengasong, he also expressed concern over this issue.
As some modern-day analysts have stated, even if the vaccine is successfully produced, it is not possible to achieve the goal of seeing after the disease, it is planned how to divide the injection, which is a topic of great importance for the international community.
It is also appropriate for the international community to further strengthen the cooperation between them.
WHO's executive director Tedros also pointed out that, if it is to be seen after the disease, it must be exempt from all fields around the world, you are unlikely certain parts of the world, or few other countries to achieve the goal of recovery from the impact of the epidemic alone.

This was announced by FEPSAN Secretary General Gideon Negedu in his interview with the Banguard newspaper.

According to the Secretary General of the FEPSAN Mr. Gideon Negedu, the cost of modern fertilizers which is now legal, will greatly help to address the problem.

FEPSAN Secretary General Mr Gideon Negedu also issued two new figures of the deadline and the public will call for exposing the perpetrators of the same unlawful nature, 08175077773 and 0817577724.

The Statistics Agency of Nigeria announced that the country's economy had experienced a recession after never seen its kind in the last 10 years, resulting from a recession that surged above the 6 percent seen between April to June of this year.

The Commission lists the reasons for the problem, including the forced forced labour of people across the country, the ban on road traffic, the ban on air transport and the closure of schools and businesses.
The Commission added that the adoption of such measures internationally has caused oil prices to fall unresolved, while industry has also been shut down internationally in order to exacerbate the problem.
