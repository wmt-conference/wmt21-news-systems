APC Urges Niger Governor to Praise Tarzoma In Party - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
In a statement released by the APC this week, the APC accused the Governor of Niger State, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, of attempting to bring dissent within the party.
The document, which was signed by Engineer Muhammad Jibrin Imam and Party Secretary Barista Muhammed Liman, stated that during the six years since the party ruled the state, only N512 million has been received.
The document goes on to say that the governor's call for a stakeholder meeting, which he chaired last Sunday night, will help to continue to bring together the party, in which they say they have written to the party's national secretary the developments in the state.
According to Engineer Imam, "we understand the Governor of Niger State has been trying to divert the attention of party members by organizing a stakeholder meeting, which is illegal, so that any complaint that is being made against party leaders is written to the secretary of the association by the association, so that they can investigate."
He said that so far in the six years since the founding of the party, 512 million naira has been in the party's account.
He said what he understood as the governor was that he was part of the National Executive Committee which was set up July 25, 2020, led by the president to lead the preparation of problems among party members and withdraw court complaints from party members.
He said the money we received was to pay the salaries of the staff of the party's secretariat as well as other union work, gubernatorial elections and to stabilize some of the problems of union affairs such as health support due to lack of access to government support, not any party money we spent illegally, we challenge each one to bring us an excuse to misappropriate union funds.
According to me, the last assembly elections in the state were the most important election in the country which we had with former commissioners and current commissioners in all the twenty-five local government areas in the state, in which the money spent in the elections was distributed to the commissioners of their respective constituencies.
In that regard, it is a mistake for anybody to say that union funds are being spent illegally, that is almost unfair and to try to give the defendant a bad name by trying to hang him up, to say that neither committee has set up a committee to investigate how union funds were spent and who set it up.
Out of the money that the complainant claimed was misappropriated, the money was donated by the national secretariat of the association, and I am not raising any such money so I challenge each one on this matter to bring his testimony to prove this allegation in any way.
Imam Khomeini said we stand firm in protecting the APC from attempts by anyone or group to disrupt the party, adding that any allegation against the party or any party leader from the state level will be written to the committee that oversees the affairs of the party as described in section 21 (B) (bi), (d) on page 82 of the party system.
Party stakeholders therefore have no role to play, especially when they attempt to take over the committee so their judgement has no impact.
For this reason, they are the valid leaders of the party that are recognised in the state, in compensation for the 21st and sixth paragraphs on page 87 of the party's constitution, and any eventuality that this may not be used.
It is because of the decision of the leaders to make a mistake.
He said those who presented with approval at yesterday's book session at the unimproved meeting, chaired by Alhaji Abubakar Magaji, General Muhammed Garba, Hon. Ahmed Dogonkoli, including Alhaji Ibrahim Balarabe and all commissioners, were not members of the association's executive committee in the state.
The executive committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC) will be led by only party leader Engineer Mohammed Imam, and the governor will not be led by state party leaders.
The statement added that Governor Abubakar Sani Bello recalled that the issue of fulfilling the promises that were made to the people of the state during the elections, as well as travelling with union parents in the government so that everyone would benefit in the state and all parties by giving political positions, which is the problem of the Governor and the association.
The document credits federal lawmakers for refusing to attend the meeting and for drawing attention to reconciliation on all problems among party members, this is not surprising for legislators who are aware of their own pain and who refuse to accept arrest as a party law.
Therefore, there is a need for the chairman of the National Executive Committee to attract the attention of Governor Abubakar Sani Bello on the appropriate position not to attempt to disrupt the politics of the state.
Let each one of us strive to remain faithful to God and to others.

China Continues to Succeed its People's Food - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
Food is the spirit of life of all worlds, it is not possible to live compulsively except for food.
This is why Chinese authorities are increasingly sensitive to ensuring the country's food security.
In the 71 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, China has achieved major successes in the area of food security and has surprised the world with its large population, which according to estimates shows that the number of Chinese has passed 1.4 billion.
The efforts have contributed to the fact that China has made a major contribution to the eradication of hunger in the world, as the chairman of the China Grain and Agricultural Export Council Zhang Wufeng once said that since 1949 until now, China has always put the issue of addressing hunger before all the country's affairs processes.
But in recent days, some people and some Western media outlets have once again "expressed concern" over the issue - can China raise its own people in the shadow of the worldwide COVID-19 respiratory disease outbreak?
We thank them for being so new that they constantly take care of the Chinese presence in this world.
Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, China has achieved sufficient food production based on its efforts.
The issue of providing food to the Chinese is among the top agents of the ruling JKS party on a daily basis.
Late last week, the Executive Secretary of the JKS Supreme Committee, Xi Jinping, issued an important order to stop food waste, stating that everyone should be aware that any food insecurity and hardship caused by it are exacerbated.
Although this year the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak that has swept the globe is also having a devastating effect on the Chinese economy, China can provide sufficient food for its people.
Figures released by China's National Bureau of Statistics on the number of agricultural products, especially rice that China will receive this year, 2020 show that the amount of rice that was found in the country in the first quarter of 2020 was 27.29 million tons, an increase of 1.08 million tons, that is an increase of 3.9% compared to the same period in 2019.
Ke Bingsheng, also the former president of the National University of Agriculture, said China has made huge successes in facilitating the country's supply of food compared to the beginning of the implementation period of the policy of making changes at home and opening up to the outside world.
Huang Jikun, director of the Peking University China Agricultural Policy Center, said during a meeting with a reporter for "The China Science Daily," that the serious challenge China faces now is in the next 2 or three years, whether China can reduce the amount of wheat and rice it has stored in grain storage rooms.
Now the amount of grains each receives is 474 kilograms instead of the 400 kilograms that each person in the world should receive annually.
And now China has installed millions of tons of farm products to raise domesticated animals.
And so, those who are concerned about the issue should rest assured, bathe and sleep, or focus on their country's internal affairs.
The Chinese are able to raise themselves with the food they produce themselves.

The son of Uwa and a close friend of President Muhammadu Buhari, Mamman Kwankwaso has said that the centuries-old style of governance in Nigeria has become old now.
Mamman Lawal said Nigeria was already in the valley and had now scrapped the end-of-year process to focus on electing the most qualified person in 2023.
BBC Hausa has published an interview with Mamman Lawal in which he explained this.
The process of endorsing the election of a president in Nigeria has not resulted in an eye-opener which began in 1999.
Instead, Kwankwaso said that the focus should be on realising who is eligible unless the receipt process is followed.

On the contrary, since his words have not finished the canvassing process, Ndigbo has hastily released a statement condemning Mamman Kwankwaso, calling him a puppet of sectarianism.

The spokesman for the Chairman of the Igbo Zalla Association, Emeka Attamah, said the words of Mamman Kwankwaso like the Nigerian presidential aspirant in 2023 were against the Igbo ethnic group.

Contribution of 'Northern Media Writers' to Northern Cooperation.
Social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram, Bakandamia and many others have long played a role in promoting dialogue, cooperation and interaction between diverse communities of the world, as well as conveying messages, stories, and spreading political policies, education and commerce.
Young people in Nigeria have taken part in this new technology using social media, to go about their lives, to make donations or to raise awareness about their new lives.
We can say that these settlements have brought us numerous improvements that the youth of the North are benefiting from in the business, economy, education and politics of the region.
Many others are eating by writing and delivering online, have found jobs or have boosted their operations.
But it is unfortunate that some youths instead of taking advantage of this opportunity to enjoy the progress that has been made, there have been some who follow the pollution of Southern children who have been around the world benefiting the public, inside and outside the country, or who have written insults and insults against their constituents and enemies.
That is what shows lack of enlightenment, in the development of the lives of the youth of this country.
The advent of the Northern Media Writers Association in the Country is a great experience, to provide Northern youth with insight into the good fortune and to clean up the things that young people are doing in Soshiyal midaya, so that they become meaningful writers and spread the policies of the people of the North.
It is imperative that we give this organization the cooperation it needs, in order to achieve its gracious goals, that will bring legitimacy not only to our Northern Territory, but also to Nigeria as a whole.
I advise our youths, especially the users of social media, to come together to protect the dignity of the North and its sovereignty and to create a system that will bring about change for all.
As did our Northern leaders who laid down their lives such as Sardaunan Sakura, the first prime minister of the North, Sir Ahmadu Bello, and his appointees, he aspires to provide for the people of the North.

Kano Elders Reach Out Of Buhari - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
A coalition of groups for the protection of the dignity of the people of Kano has reached out to the state Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje to President Muhammadu Buhari over his attempt to borrow from a Bank of China for the construction of a railway line.
A coalition of more than 15 groups under the shadow of the Kano Forum has described what it calls the Ganduje administration's debt relief package for the construction of the first phase of the railway line in Kano City as reckless given the serious challenges facing the state.

Decriminalization of Explosives in Nigeria Is Less Mistakes -Maigidaje.
A fighter in the community in Kaduna State, Alhaji Aliyu Maigidaje, pointed out that the death penalty for those arrested for rape in this country, especially in North NIjeriya is the only solution.
Alhaji Aliyu Maigidaje made the announcement in a Leadership interview today in Kaduna, adding that the very fact that the authorities confirmed this after investigating, the death penalty was the only solution.
He added that the decision would reduce the incidence of rape that can be achieved easily, but the biggest inconvenience was to make our minds heard.
Alhaji Aliyu Maigidaje said, he said in our Muslim gender, we should give Allah to give the Prophet and stand by our hearts and minds, so that man does not always know that he will die.

Farmers In Biniwe Protest Growth And Place In Bengal - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
Rice farmers in Biniwe State are expecting a massive harvest as little as two months after planting.
Some of them who were gathered in Makurdi expressed hope that the harvest would take place anytime between October and November.
Titus Atondo, a smallholder farmer in the state town of Mbatiab-Gboko, said he planted his rice in a two-acre area in July.
Atondo said he sourced seeds from a market in his area and they were in two groups of CP and rice OC while he was using Dazzle to clear the grounds for planting and fertiliser.
According to Titus Atondo, the challenges of rice farming in the countryside such as Mecca are huge because we rely so heavily on labour as customs agents are unable to access the farm roads.
Titus Atondo added that we are recruiting people to do agriculture from the national level as far as the harvest is concerned, adding that this is exhausting and overwhelming.
Atondo said all the money spent on his farm which is now located includes planting, planting, fertiliser applications and was expected to be harvested at N2020,000.
Titus Atondo continued, but he expects at least 50 bags of rubbish to be harvested from two hectares that will likely be sold at a cost of N29,000 per 100k purse.
A large rice farmer, Bitalis TARNONGU, also planted the plant in June to July on 274 hectares of the farm which costs N14, 500 per hectare while the ground floor costs N25,000 a hectare.
He sowed 44 seeds (Supi) and 61 Faro (OC) seeds derived from the National Council for Strength of Agricultural Projects (Seeds) and some originated from Olam Nigeria.
He added that high levels at this time are in various fields while some are in breeding programmes, and others are in the early stages of killing livestock as farming has been underway in stages.
TARNONGU added that the challenges so far have included financial penalties since the price of producing selected animals is low and the price of cocoa has increased.
He said the harvest was expected to start in October to November.
He added that the total price of basic commodities at the end of the day will be a minimum of N246,000 per hectare while production is expected to be three metric tonnes which could translate into N360,000 at a cost of N120 per kilo.
TARNONGU does not use medicines on its rice farm, instead, he advocates and implements traditional agriculture, adding that as such, we use insecticide plants, pesticides and medicinal fertilisers.
Also the Chairman of the National Farmers' Union (AFAN) Benue State branch, Comrade Aondongu saaku, expressed hope that the rainfall conditions this year will be favorable for the cultivation of large quantities of rice.
According to the Chairman of the National Farmers' Union (AFAN), Benue State, Comrade Aondongu saaku, more farmers entered the rice farming sector at the end of this year due to the coronavirus crisis which has prevented many from leaving offices and being on their farms.
He said this year it would harvest 20 percent of what was being produced in 2019, estimated to be more than one million tons.
According to him, the collectors are now taking statistics of various farmers and if the work is completed, the number of rice farmers in the state will be assessed.
The chairman of the National Farmers Association (AFAN) Benue State branch, Comrade Aondongu saaku, who said he had cultivated three hectares of rice farm, noted that some farmers had sown rice in June while those in short-term farming were doing so at the same time as the harvest season expected in late November or early December.
The AFAN chairman added that the rice farmers were using fresh produce to kill aging weeds, kebabs, pesticides.
He expressed concern about the challenges of livestock threatening rice farming, adding that farmers were taking shelter, putting up ropes and clearing the edges of the farms to deal with the problem.

In a document issued by the minister on Thursday, she said there were indeed unpaid leave but that it was not from her office that there was this problem, that the office had already handed over the names of more than 500,000 people to be assessed in compliance with their previous obligations.
She said there was an assessment of names being offered to bankrupt board members, receiving funding after working elsewhere.
The program is for those who are unemployed but thousands of others who are receiving allowances are already working elsewhere and are receiving N-Power allowances.
Savings are now being made to identify them and wander them out of those payments.
She appealed to beneficiaries of the previous unpaid leave program to be more patient that they will soon hear back.
N-Power members protest their suspension by Minister Sadiya in Abuja
Hundreds of youths who attended a rally to protest the suspension of the N-Power Support Scheme from across the country that was held in Abuja on Friday said it was indeed a bad decision to stop the youths being abducted by the government.
The youths have marched to the National Assembly to express their disapproval of the temporary suspension of the program.
One of the attendees of the rally and a representative from Kano State, in an interview with PREMIUM TIMES HAUSA, said that they were calling on the government to delay the decision and pay those who have not yet been paid their three month loan.
They also called for financial support to be given to the fact that the youths have been benefiting from this government support.
After meeting some of the legislators who listened to the cries and went to the Federal Government's staffing department, they asked if they would vote for Sadiya Farouk, the Minister of State for Relief, Sadiya Farouk.
The eminent Human Rights Defender, Komared Mustapha Soron Dinki, who has been gathering since Kano to Abuja with the youths, said this deliberation was made to remind the minister that the beneficiaries of the program had not abdicated their rights before they were suspended.
Young people have been mobilizing in the National Assembly since morning.
We hope that the government will hear the cries of the youths here and provide solutions that will help them to continue living as well.
The youths holding a bottle containing text call on the government to keep them in the eye of mercy.

The film, full of songs by singer Beyonce, entitled "Black is King," is a continuation of the King's Praise and criticism around the world for its evocative African heritage.

Black is King is a singer-songwriter and American singer-songwriter, and Beyonce has directed, compiled and completed.
The film features a song entitled "The Lion King: The Gift," by Zaki Kapoor: The Son of Baiwa.

The film, which debuted in July, received an endorsement from listeners, but was also a hit.
Some say that Beyonce, who was born in Houston, Texas, USA, illegally censors African American content, especially features that nerve Africa in the film, and that it traditionally has no roots in the African continent.

At a time when farmers are yet to enjoy their farming in Nigeria, Sokoto State farmers have begun to struggle against threats adopted by birds, a possible obstacle to crops thought to pose.
The threat of red birds in Sokoto State is very exciting to see, as there are indications of a good food season this year 2020.
On the contrary, some local farmers have embraced the traditional strategy of expelling the bird as described by a young man named Faruk from the Dange Shuni area.
Sambo Abubakar, one of the local farmers, said the birds were now targeting all the plants they had started trying on farms.
The chairman of the Sokoto State Farmers Association, Murtala Gagado Minannata, said that in two-thirds of Sokoto State this problem is now being exacerbated.
He said they were now waiting to hear about the situation in the local government areas of the state to include a report to be sent to the state and federal Ministry of Agriculture for action to help farmers.
The Federal Ministry of Agriculture official in charge of the department of bird and odor medicine, Ya'u Kagara, said it was less than a month before the completion of the bird feeding centers in the area of Sokoto.
He added that the bird was coming from Niger Republic and Benin, and that international intervention was necessary before any agreement was reached to resolve the issue.

New COVID-19 Response Funds To Be Introduced in US.
While numbers of COVID-19 cases continue to rise in the U.S., Republican lawmakers in the Senate are expected Monday to introduce a spending bill.
It is thought that the advertisement will cost a trillion dollars to settle the effects of the coronavirus pandemic in the country.
The plan comes days before the expiration of the first federal relief package for millions of Americans who have lost their jobs due to COVID-19.
On Sunday, after days of talks with Republican lawmakers in the House of Representatives, US Secretary of State Mark Meadows and Treasury Secretary - Mali Steven Mnuchin said the relief package included an expansion of the program to provide loans to those who have lost their jobs.
But according to them, in this crisis, Americans will see only 70 percent of their previous stimulus checks.
On Friday, the first relief package will provide paid leave for those who have lost their jobs and 600 weekly payments to those who have lost their jobs.
Republicans, meanwhile, argue that the program aims to get people who are paid less than they were when they were working, if the federal government's subsidies are combined with that which the state subsidizes.
But Democrats, for their part, have challenged the claim, saying that given the coronavirus crisis, some staff are less secure returning to their workplaces.

How Akure University of Technology (FUTA) tried to drag PREMIUM TIMES off the internet.
The Akure University of Technology (FUTA) has recruited a foreigner to target websites, in order to target PREMIUM TIMES, the popular "online" newspaper in Nigeria.
The ban on crossing internet barriers has made it easier for people to log on to their sites, but to no avail.
He was first tempted to engage in "hacking" since February 28, where he wielded his deadly weapons on campus, and carried out his attacks using the university's "data."
On the other hand, if he tries to smash the hard internet of PREMIUM TIMES with a computer, he also attacks another GSM phone.
Five days later, he left the entrance to the site of the Great PREMIUM TIMES, but was unsuccessful, despite using various sophisticated technologies.
He did not manage to break through, because the university did not know that PREMIUM TIMES had a robust program in place, in which it built a corridor and a corridor was destroyed by a helicopter.
And PREMIUM also has several high-level security officials on its website including the Emir of the Battle of PREMIUM TIMES and the Chief of Staff, PREMIUM TIMES.
These security forces, who have modern experience in crushing any gang member or gang member who seeks to inflame alone, or martyrdom, are trying to break into the PREMIUM TIMES umbrella.
Type Of Weapons Attacked by Internet Trader PREMIUM TIMES:
At 8 a.m., he began siding with the doorbell of the Great PREMIUM TIMES, to see how it would turn out to be inside, completely destroying the storefront.
He would not have succeeded in the night, and the next morning, at 6: 15, he would be tempted again, this time by using "WPScan," a move to identify the strengths or weaknesses of adult internet security measures such as PREMIUM TIMES.
After 90 minutes, he began attempting to break into the power of machine learning techniques, the "custom script."
In the morning, he made every effort to do it by sidestepping a computer device to completely lock down the PREMIUM TIMES page.
How a Burner Treated Migrants:
The barrister did not know that PREMIUM TIMES had provided medicine to small rats and big brides entering the farms of social networks to cover up or destroy the site.
This lack of awareness has caused all the instruments it used, in general, the old captures that were unable to do PREMIUM TIMES any harm or harm.
On this day he suffered from depression and became tired to go through an attack with DDOS on the NTP License, which is an ancient road that has been used since Kano belonged to the village.
On March 3, he had all the mental and mental health problems, but it was all but over.
The attempt to break the door of the Great PREMIUM TIMES came days after PREMIUM TIMES published an article comparing tensions between President Muhammadu Buhari's National Security Adviser, Babagana Monguno and his former Chief of Staff to the President, the late Abba Kyari.
Some in the Federal University of Technology in Akure, told PREMIUM TIMES that the university had hired a large number of rats for Internet sites to smash a page with a large PREMIUM TIMES umbrella, destroy or destroy it.
However, when PREMIUM TIMES contacted the FUTA, it distanced itself from the attempt to hijack the Great PREMIUM TIMES Internet.

A coalition of Yoruba groups has also complained of inconsistencies in sharing positions with the Nigerian government, under the leadership of Muhammadu Buhari.

While the Kano State government has reduced its budget by about N70 billion due to the negative impact the coronavirus pandemic has had on the state economy, the State House of Assembly has passed a new law to oversee the state government's financial services processes.
However, local leadership groups say the issue of proposed legislation is very simple, but implementing it is the challenge.
The introduction of a new law for the procurement of government funds based on democracy is part of the aim of the new law in Kano State which has since been introduced at the federal level as well as in other Nigerian states.
The majority leader of the Kano State House of Assembly, Hon. Kabiru Hassan Dashi, told VOA that the law would give employers and the state government the principle of how to spend their money, along with how the state would allocate its money.
Now, local leadership groups have welcomed the legislation, as long as it is under review.
The Director General of the Organization for Community Civic Engagement in Kano State, Comrade Abdulrazak Alkali said they hoped government officials, and the state government would implement the law properly.
But the Kano State Commissioner for Finance and Economic Affairs, Alhaji Shehu Na'Allah, said they were well prepared to enforce the law.
Kano State Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje had already signed the new law late last week, and it is expected to go into effect.

INEC prepares for Edo -Prof. Yakubu.
The chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, has said that his commission is preparing to contest the Edo State governorship election, in which a vote will be cast on September 19.
Yakubu made the encouraging statement on Thursday, while meeting with the Electoral Management Committee in Benin, the Edo State capital.
The professor said INEC had so far successfully implemented 10 of the 14 plans that it is committed to implementing in relation to the election.
Yakubu added that the reason for this visit was because he had seen what preparations had been made since now before the introduction of the election day.
Of course we get all the reports of the programs that are ongoing.
Yet we find it hard to come to terms with it, to see with our eyes.
This commission has set out a schedule for how the Edo and Ondo elections will take place, since February 6, 2020.
That is, we have given the space of about seven to eight months to prepare for the two elections remotely.
Well today I am happy to say that we have implemented 10 of the 14 plans that INEC plans to implement.
And no one has yet received any extension until it has been released from the date of implementation.
The last thing is to register the total number of black voters for the 14 parties that will contest Yakubu.
He said the four remaining tasks for INEC included publishing the announcement of the upcoming elections, the presentation of the names of the ejan-ejan of each party that participates in the contest, all on the same day.
Campaigns were suspended 24 hours before the election.
That will be the 12th of Thursday night's campaigns, before Saturday's election.

Atyap, Hausa-Fulani Agreement for Peace Between Them.
The communities of Atyap, Fulani and Hausa ethnic groups living in Kaduna State's Zangon Kataf Local Government Area have successfully concluded a reconciliation, to promote sustainable peace in their own region.
The participants, who expressed resolve and willingness to see peace and forgiveness, condemned the killing and destruction of properties in their own region.
They also proclaimed their willingness to help security agencies with personal information, to catch any batteries hiding inside their own areas.
The meeting also commended the government's efforts to appoint security agents in the area, and similarly commended the various youth groups for their tireless efforts to embrace each other and maintain distance from others which could jeopardize the region including their youths' efforts to successfully establish this reconciliation agreement between them.
The meeting, held under the leadership of Agwatyap's son-in-law, Dominic Gambo Yahaya, was convened by the three nations to discuss the peace process.
The event was held at the Mariyamu and Yakubu Ebent Centre in Wakili.
The meeting also earned the leadership of ABM Stephen Shekari (rty) and Dr Salim Umar, who represented the Atyap Emirate, for solidarity among the communities and for stopping the bloodshed and destruction of the sovereign wealth between them.
All the leaders of the three communities of Atyap, Fulani and Hausa communities signed the document after the meeting including the honorable civil servant of Agwatyap.
In the document after the meeting, which contained up to 14 pilgrims, the residents of the Atyap Emirate called on anyone to take the law into his own hands and instead take a rallying cry to the security agencies.
The meeting also highlighted the guarantees given by the country's constitution for any Nigerian to live and self-isolate in any section of the country in need, including the Atyap Emirate, without fear or any threat from anyone else.
The meeting also called on the authorities to speed up the process of returning all the kingdom's refugees back to their homes.
The meeting also recommended the establishment of a peace committee comprising tribes, Hausa, Fulani and Atyap as well as their youth to arrange high-level meetings and discussions on issues relating to security from time to time for peace in their constituency.
The peace reconciliation meeting came hours after the Kaduna State government relaxed its curfew in the local government areas of Zangon Kataf and Kaura, of the State to block the spread of the conflict among the residents of the area.

How Ganduje restored the dignitaries who were fired by Emir Ado and Sanusi, he will return them to their appointees in Kano.
Governor Abdullahi Ganduje wants the Kano State House of Assembly to amend the 2019 State law, so that he can confirm the appointment of two former executives of the Kano Emirate that the late Emir Ado Bayero and Emir Sanusi submitted, so that the state legislature can confirm their appointment as princes appointing the Emir in Kano.
Ganduje's request was read out by the Speaker of the Kano House of Representatives, Abdullahi Gafasa before the House of Representatives, and they are expected to hold a session to discuss the matter before the end of July.
The dignitaries relocated to the Kano Emirate are Aminu the Great Son of'agundi and his accomplice the Emir of Dawaki Mai Tuta and the Kano Ciroman, Sanusi Ado-Bayero.
They were both removed by Emir Ado and Emir Muhammadu Sanusi, on charges of perjury.
Principal Depp challenged his acquittal in court.
17 years on, the Supreme Court has ruled that he is negligent.
Ganduje also wants to restore his reign and amend the law to be among the appointees to the Emir of Kano.
Ado Bayero removed Son'agundi in 2003 after being found guilty of conspiracy and conspiracy to commit political acts.
A committee was set up to investigate him, but he was invited to refuse to come before a committee to defend him.
He then challenged his removal at the Kano State High Court to the Supreme Court.
Before the Supreme Court, the Federal Court of Appeal had ruled that Aminu the Great should be returned to his seat.
But the Kano Emirate, under the rule of Muhamamdu Sanunmsi II, has appealed the decision, with the Supreme Court stressing the removal of him as a Representative of the East, and Emir of Dawaki Mai Tuta, on June 5.
After Sanusi Bayero was removed, Kano Ciroman was rejected by the Emir of Kano who was appointed Muhammdu Sanusi II in June, 2014.
He was later appointed chairman of the National Water Resources Board in the Jonathan era.
He was appointed Wamban Kano, under the current Emir of Kano.

Attempts To Threaten and Demand My Own Mind - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
The village of Longyuan in the Hongsipu region of Wuzhong, Ningxia's semi-autonomous Hui region, is located in northwestern China.
A committed woman named Li Yaomei or Sadiya (that is, her Islamic name) is famous for her struggle for life and success based on her efforts to get out of poverty.
Her story tells us that striving, being committed and looking out for oneself is heartbreaking.
Initially, Li Yaomei or Sadiya, she was never in a classroom intending to take a lesson, so she was unable to read aloud.
However, God gave her the gift of insight, bravery and collective wisdom, which was an example in the area of fighting poverty.
About 20 years ago, Madam Li Yaomei suffered from stomach cancer, where she underwent surgery on her stomach three times.
After her recovery, she suffered a serious accident, now she is walking with the lump placed in her leg.
Those challenges have plunged her into a difficult situation apart from health, even with the issue of prescription medication, which is why she received a loan of about N16 million, equivalent to N16 million.
Unsurprisingly, Malama Sadiya's challenge has paved the way for her to vote and vote in order to improve her life.
The Chinese government's support has also boosted its appeal.
Her specialty is to predict different kinds of weeds based on weeds.
Because of her efforts, her business has thrived exponentially, with various employers ordering her in.
In addition, she has created several engines that help her simplify the project.
For example, it takes 15 minutes to put together one large projection, but now within that time, it will include up to 5 projections.
In addition, it has provided additional engines to clean up the weeds it produces.
There is an additional engine that cleans up animal feed for her, and now it is selling those engines to applicants.
Given Malama Sadiya's challenges, as well as her efforts to improve her life and those of her staff, it is understandable that the applicant is indeed with her.
The work of fighting poverty and improving lives is not something that hangs over the government.
If the government is to provide support, but people are not generous or interested in improving their lives by finding themselves in jobs based on their situation, then lay-offs alone will continue without achieving any objectives.
Her article suggests that conducting a business or income stream does not require any visas or visas to other towns or overseas.
To take into consideration her condition, she used existing resources in her environment to improve her life.
Furthermore, teacher Sadiya carried out these works on the basis of standing by her foot without relying on her husband, so that he could flee her.
That is, the effort, the commitment and the quest for self-determination are at heart.
He expressed the strength of women to change their lives and stand by their shoulders without asking for help.
This is also a lesson that shows that whatever one does, he should stand firm, because relying on someone else is uncertain.
Indeed, Malama Sadiya was a committed, smart and talented person who was an example and a role model for the rest of the people.
Also, by March this year, Malama Sadiya had completed the payment of all her debts, and then suspended the receipt of support from the government on its own terms.

There are fears US Political Activists Will Lose to Stop COVID-19 - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization (WHO), has recently expressed concern over the steps being taken by some countries to store the hoped COVID-19 respiratory disease vaccine, stating that priority must be avoided in various nations, while vaccinating against the epidemic.
And the vaccine should be distributed in a timely manner across the world, because it will be in line with the great good of different countries.
Indeed, some US politicians are implementing policies that prioritize their own good, regarding vaccine distribution, and thus undermine international cooperation in the fight against the pandemic.
Currently, the overall number of confirmed COVID-19 cases across the globe has already surpassed 23 million.
In the same number, there are more than 800 people who have lost their lives to the disease.
Under such extreme circumstances, there is an increased focus on the effectiveness of vaccinations, and happily, in recent days, there have been large results in the study of vaccinations in some countries, which has generated hope and belief in the whole international community.
But sadly, some US politicians have indicated a willingness to snatch the vaccine.
The journal "Science" even speculated that the U.S. government had already clinched agreements to buy a COVID-19 vaccine worth more than $6 billion, from several pharmaceutical companies.
Although the US government's policy is understood to be that Americans are at the forefront of the spread of the disease, other developing countries also need pilot vaccinations, looking at the fact that they are more likely to suffer from shortages of medical resources.
The journal "The ecologist" also pointed out that if the U.S. achieves the goal of securing a vaccine to be produced, then the number of doses to be produced in developing countries will decline.
Chicken, the director of the Africa CDC, Mr. John Nkengasong, also expressed concern over the issue.
As some current commentators have stated, even if a vaccine is successful, it will be impossible to achieve the goal of seeing beyond the pandemic unless the vaccine is designed to be distributed, which is a very important issue for the international community.
It is also imperative that countries around the world strengthen bilateral cooperation.
Tedros, the director general of the WHO, also pointed out that if it is to be seen after the pandemic, it must be contained in all sectors of the world, making it impossible for some parts of the world, or few other countries to achieve the goal of recovery from the impact of the pandemic alone.

Among those summoned to court by Tope are the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, the Minister of Civil Aviation, Hadi Sirika, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, the Minister of Relief and Humanitarian Affairs, Sadiya Umar.

He said the officer warned him not to attempt to escape while he was bathing, adding that at that point he did not think to flee.

Yobe Spends Over N78.8m on Prison for Leaving Corporation - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
The efforts of the Yobe State government, under Governor Mai Mala Buni, have been commended for revitalizing the sprawling company and its sprawling drones, owned by the state (Yobe state Polythene Bag and Woben Sacks Company), after more than 10 years in detention.
The statement was made by the chairman (General Manager), Engineer Sha'aibu Adamu Gadaka, in an interview with our correspondent at his office in Damaturu, the capital of Yobe State, earlier in the week.
He said the company had spent more than 10 years in lockdown, but after Governor Buni's arrival it was difficult for him to revise, in which he instantly ordered the removal of N78.8 million to renovate important sectors of the company with an additional 48 million naira to fund it, while allowing the company to stabilize its founders.
Eng. Gadaka added that this gave them the opportunity to purchase the products needed to start working in the company, which includes a new 500 kba power supply (Janareta), 500 kba power distribution machine (Taransifoma), a new engine for generating power plants, vacuum dryers (modern ones) and other equipment which the company needs.
He also lashed out and said, "Today, the main goal of Governor Buni's movement, to revitalize this company is to create jobs for the youth, reduce inequality and provide Yobe State with income."
Gadaka said.
On the other hand, he said the company was in favor of offering apps that it was partnering with, because of the fact that the state government had revived the Yobe Flour and Feed Mill (Yobe Flour and Feed Mill) in Potiskum and other traders who were courting the company's suppliers.
He said the longstanding opposition to the state government's attempts to renovate the fertiliser company was also a setback to the company's production.
On the other hand, he said, "There are some challenges that we are facing, on the basis of how the company spent over 10 years in lockdown, as the engines started working but there is a need to change us to other commodities in order to be able to operate without hesitation."
Who we expect before our operations resume, we will strive to bring in the rest of our products in need.
In addition, Gadaka said, "On the other hand, we urge the government of Yobe to provide us more equipment, truck carriers and vehicles to make it easier for us to carry out our duties, especially in order to transport our staff to the office due to the fact that it was very late, when we started working remotely."
He also said that in the meantime, the company has sent 25 youths to undergo training on how to operate masts and machines as well as to manage the products that the company uses in its services and how to do business with the people who interact with them.
Finally, he said that now that the company has started producing various bags of beer, including 100kg, 50kg and 25kg, and has provided sets for traders in terms of gleaning and the nature of the drinks they desire, the company is ready to satisfy them.
