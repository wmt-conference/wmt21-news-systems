CORONA SOLUTION: We have not yet completed the test of the quality of the drug included in Nigeria.
As the European Union (EU) continues to test the effectiveness of its combined Korona drug, Nigeria has not been left behind in mixing and testing its own drugs.

Since the outbreak of Korona, traditional healers have been working hard to ensure that they are not left behind in the treatment of the disease.
Many of them have submitted their product samples to the authorities for testing and evaluation.

APC Accuses Niger State Governor Of Attempts To Violence In The Party - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
The All Progressives Congress (APC) on Tuesday accused Niger State Governor Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello of trying to stir up unrest within the party.
The document, signed by the chairman of the Engineering Party, Muhammad Jibrin Imam, and the party's secretary, Barrister Muhammed Liman, stated that during the party's six years in power, it had received only N512 million. find.
The statement added that the meeting convened by the governor of stakeholders, which he chaired on Sunday night last weekend, would help continue to cause unrest in the party, saying they had written to the secretary. the party has failed the developments in the state.
According to Engineer Imam, "we understand that the Niger State governor is trying to divide the party members by organizing an illegal stakeholder meeting, because of any complaints against party leaders. "The party's regional secretariat is being written to investigate."
He added that so far in the six years since the formation of the party, 512 million naira has been deposited in the party's coffers.
He said what he understood as the governor was part of the national interim committee set up on July 25, 2020, led by the president to lead the process of organizing the problems among party members and withdrawing complaints. in court among party members.
He said the money we received was to pay the salaries of the party secretary's staff, as well as other party-related activities, by-elections and address some of the party's problems such as health subsidies due to lack of access to subsidies. government, no party money we spent illegally, we challenge everyone to bring us evidence of misappropriation of party funds.
As I said, the last local government by-elections in the state were the most important by-elections held in the country with the former commissioners and commissioners currently in power in all the local government areas. twenty-five in the state, where the money spent on the elections was distributed to the commissioners to bring them to their constituencies.
Therefore, it is a mistake for anyone to say that party funds are being spent illegally, this is almost unfair and trying to give the protection of a bad name to try to hang it up, he said no committee has been set up to investigate how party funds were spent and who founded it.
Among the money that the complainant alleges was misappropriation of funds by the party's national secretary, there was no such amount of money and I challenge anyone on this issue who has brought evidence to prove it. his accusations in any way.
Imam said we are committed to protecting the APC from any attempt by any party to disband the party, adding that any allegations against the party or any party leader from the state level will be addressed to the committee. governing the zoning as described by the party system in section 21 (B) (bi), (d) on page 82 of the party structure.
Therefore the stakeholders of the party have no role to play especially if they try to seize the power of the committee so their decision has no effect.
For this reason, they are the trusted party leaders approved in the state, in paragraph 21 and paragraph 6 on page 87 of the party constitution, anything contrary to this shall not be do not use it.
Because the decision of despair by the interim leaders was wrong.
He said those who presented and agreed at Monday's meeting at the non-promotion meeting, which was chaired by Alhaji Abubakar Magaji, General Muhammed Garba, and Hon. Ahmed Dogonkoli, including Alhaji Ibrahim Balarabe and all commissioners, are not members of the party's executive committee in the state.
The executive committee of the party will be chaired by Engineer Mohammed Imam and not by the governor.
The statement added that Governor Abubakar Sani Bello recalled that the issue of fulfilling the promises made to the people of the state during the elections, and working with party parents in the government so that everyone in the state and all zones through political office, which is the problem of the governor and the party.
The letter commended members of the Federal Parliament who refused to attend the meeting and drew attention to reconciliation on all the issues between the party members, this is not surprising to lawmakers who are aware of their own illness, and they reject dictatorship as party law.
Therefore, there is a need for the chairman of the National Interim Committee to draw the attention of Governor Abubakar Sani Bello to the right position not to try to destroy the politics of the state.

Huang Jikun, director of the China Agricultural Policy Research Center at Peking University, said in an interview with The China Science Daily that the biggest challenge facing China is in the next two years. or the next three, or China could reduce the amount of wheat and rice it stores in grain mills.
Now the total amount of grain each received is 474 kilograms instead of the 400 kilograms that every international person should get every year.
And now China imports millions of tons of agricultural products just for raising livestock.
Therefore, those who are concerned should calm down, take a bath and go to sleep, or focus on the internal affairs of their country.
The Chinese can raise themselves with the food they produce for themselves.

Contribution of 'Arewa Media Writers' to Northern Unity.
Social media such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram, Bacandamiya and others have long played a key role in creating forums for dialogue, unity and friendship among different peoples of the world, as well as conveying messages, stories. , and promoting political, educational and business policies.
Young people in Nigeria have become involved in this new technology by using social media, to keep pace with the times, to contribute or to express their views on social issues.
We can say that these forums have brought us a lot of development that the youth of the North are benefiting from in terms of trade, economy, education and politics in the region.
Many eat by writing and posting messages online, get jobs or develop projects they manage.
But it is unfortunate that some young people, instead of taking advantage of this opportunity to take advantage of the progress made, there are others who are following the corrupt children of the south who are known around the world for defrauding the people. inside and outside the country, or writing insulting and abusing the authorities and their predecessors.
It is a sign of illiteracy in the development of the lives of the country's youth.
The arrival of the Arewa Media Writers Association in the country is a great blessing, to provide the youth of the North with a clear vision, a clear direction and a clear vision of what the youth are doing on Social Media, so that they can write meaningful articles and spread the word. ummar Arewa.
It is imperative that we give this organization the cooperation it needs, in order to achieve its noble goals, which will bring benefits not only to our Northern region, but to Nigeria as a whole.
I urge our youth, especially social media users, to come together to protect the integrity of the North and its rights, and to create a system that will bring about change for all.

So we say, of course, as we call for national development and the promotion of governance, at all levels, we further call for the unity of the Northerners, without any discrimination on the basis of religion or ethnicity, to bring to our region to move forward.
Considering how the North used to be, it is not right now.
So we should use our God-given talents to contribute and advise, to provide the North with a comprehensive way to revive its economy.
The North should provide revenue streams to implement its budget without waiting for the federal government to spend money.
In addition, if we want to develop the North, we must focus on education, agriculture, tourism, health and science and technology.
We will not only contribute with money, there are different ways to do so.
We think that is how the North will fulfill our aspirations!
The North is our pride.

Rape Sentence In Nigeria Is The Only Solution - Husbands
Alhaji Aliyu Maigidaje, a civil society activist in Kaduna State, pointed out that the death penalty for rape victims in the country, especially in Northern Nigeria, was the only solution.
Alhaji Aliyu Maigidaje made the announcement in an interview with Leadership Today in Kaduna, adding that as long as the authorities confirmed this after an investigation, the death sentence was the only solution.
He added that the decision would reduce the incidence of rape which could be easily alleviated, but the biggest relief was to reform our minds.
Alhaji Aliyu Maigidaje said, in our capacity as Muslims, we should pray to God for the Prophet and stand up and correct our hearts, because one never knows when one will die.
He said it was a shame that a full-grown man or an old man had raped a girl or a three-month-old, a three-year-old or a five-year-old girl.

He added that this is why we are in dire straits in the country, because the country has refused to move forward. The monarchs, governors and the president themselves have no choice.
He added that they had to mend that rift and then the moon came up and therefore, it was necessary to reform our minds so that God could bring us a solution to the issue of rape.

Efforts, perseverance and self-interest are in the heart - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
In Longyuan Village, Hongsipu County, Wuzhong City, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, Northwestern China.
There is a brave woman named Li Yaomei or Sadiya (her Islamic name) who is famous for her struggles in life and her success in her efforts to get out of poverty.
Her story tells us that effort, perseverance, and self-seeking are things that are in the heart.
At first, Li Yaomei or Sadiya had never been in class to learn a lesson, which made her unable to read without writing.
However, God has endowed her with a wealth of ingenuity, talent and wisdom, making her a model in the fight against poverty.
About 20 years ago, Ms. Li Yaomei suffered from stomach cancer, where she underwent three surgeries.
After regaining consciousness, she suffered a serious accident and is now walking with the implant in her foot.
These challenges put her in a difficult position in addition to her health, as well as the issue of medical bills, which is why she took out a loan of about 300,000 Yuan, equivalent to more than N16 million.
Surprisingly, this challenge faced by Malama Sadiya has been a source of inspiration and inspiration for her to improve her life.
And the support provided by the Chinese government has given her more confidence.
Her job is to make different types of brooms based on the use of grass.
Because of her tireless efforts, her profession has grown exponentially, with various ministries ordering her to pick up.
In addition, she has created several machines that help her simplify the task.
For example, it used to take 15 minutes to assemble one large broom, but now during this time, it will assemble up to 5 brooms.
In addition, it has provided additional cleaning machines that restore the broom.
Then there is the extra cleaning machine for her animal feed, and now she is still selling these machines to applicants.
Considering the challenges that Ms. Sadiya has faced, and the efforts she is still making to improve her life and that of her staff, it is clear that the applicant is with me.
Fighting poverty and improving the quality of life is not the sole responsibility of the government.
If the government is going to provide support, but the people are not motivated or interested in improving their lives by finding jobs based on their situation, then the backlash will continue. with the achievement of a goal.
Her story shows that running a business or income project does not require any large sums of money or travel to other cities or abroad.
Because she is aware of her situation, she uses the resources available to her to improve her life.
In addition, Ms. Sadiya carried out these activities by standing with her legs without relying on her husband, because he ran away and left her.
In other words, effort, perseverance, and self-seeking are the things of the heart.
It also shows the ability of women to change their lives and stand on their own two feet without seeking anyone else's help.
This is also a lesson that shows that, whatever a person does, he should stand on his own two feet, because dependence on someone is uncertain.
Malama Sadiya is indeed a courageous, intelligent and talented person who is an example and a role model for the rest of the community.
Also, by March this year, Ms. Sadiya had completed the payment of all her debts and suspended the collection of government subsidies on her own terms.
