Creeping on the world
The market campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland seems to have gone well and shouting and calling out in nature are beginning to pull people wide and wide around the world.
"You have the headline, I need Iceland," says a woman outside the big world in comments on an ad from the marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland on YouTube.
Another viewer says he will preserve Iceland in his heart for all eternity, and a young woman says she must come as soon as possible to Iceland, as her fiancée resides there.
For all the unhappiness, however, she is in the United States and therefore expects to have to wait for some more months.
Yet one viewer asks if the hiking trail to Iceland is capable, because there are no planes.
The story does not follow whether he comes from another time zone.
Egill Þórðarson at the Peel advertising agency, who came to the making of the ads along with the international advertising agency M&C Saatchi, says receipts have been hoped more.
"I came to many Inspired By Iceland campaigns that have been successful, but this new campaign is already starting to hit a record.
In the base, this is about creating PR values, it is getting foreign media to address the campaign, and it has gone incredibly well.
In a relatively short period of time, we have received coverage in about seven hundred media worldwide that total cover roughly two billion people.
The value of that coverage is priced at ISK 1,8 billion.
It is not adorable."
The main market normally is the United States and the campaign has gone very well there, although Americans are not heading to the country for a prey.
According to Egils, known market areas such as Denmark, the United Kingdom and Germany have also taken good care of themselves, like Russia, which are conveniently surprising.
Then there have been reactions from exotic regions, such as India, which were not specifically suggested by.
"These ads have travelled beyond we expected," says Egil, but it can be noted that over four million people have watched the content on YouTube.
"We could not have requested a better start."
The films here at the opening took Árni Sæberg, photographer of Morgunblaðið, during the filming of ads entitled "Let It Out" in the middle of last month.
The delays took place wide and wide, such as the Skólavörðustígur in Reykjavík, in Reynisfjördur, at Skogarfoss, at Sólheimajökull and in a cave at Hjörleifshöfði.
The directors were Samuel Bjarki Pétursson and Gunnar Páll Ólafsson at Skoti productions and filmmaker Óttar Guðnason.
The roles in these films were the Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, who is from Cuba and Hungary.
Dozens of Icelanders came to the making of the ads, but at the same time as recordings took place in South Iceland there was another group in the West and Westfjords.
According to Egil, "Let It Out" is only the first part of the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, but it is aimed at a winter campaign in collaboration with M&C Saatchi.
"This is just the first phase in this work for Icelandic labor," says Egill, adding that the partnership with M&C Saatchi has been very successful.
"It is great to work with them.
In such projects it is important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the markets we are talking to."
Sprengisandur: Discuss the situation in the labour market, pension funds and much more
Asmundur Einar Daðason, Minister of Social Affairs and Children, meets in Sprengisandur, starting at ten o'clock in the Bylgjunni today.
He is also the Minister of Labour and discusses the situation in the labour market as such, the Icelandair case and more issues.
He also discusses rural issues and the transfer of jobs to a country that has progressed poorly and been controversial in recent years and decades.
Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, VR chairman, also attends the show, but he will discuss his criticisms regarding pension funds investments and proposes ideas that labor movement and employers withdraw from the boards of the funds to reduce the risk of conflict of interest.
The Icelandic tourism company Ívar Ingimarsson and Árnheiður Jóhannsdóttir, Director of the Nordic Marketplace, will discuss the situation in tourism in the rural area.
They will look forward in the fall and wonder if the success of the summer is a misleading offer of what to come.
You can listen to the section below but it starts at ten.
This is how she looks today 25 years later
Actress Elisa Donovan had a successful career in teenage episodes of any kind.
She was awarded a world-famous award for her role as Amber in the film Clueless 25 years ago.
She also starred in the series Sabrina: The Teenage Witch alongside Melissu Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury and in Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married with one child.
Little has worn on her lately, but she got to look over the gone road and comment on Clueless on Australian television in the days.
She speaks beautifully about Brittany Murphy who died unexpectedly in 2009 and says she has been a great person.
"I have to admit that I built the character most importantly on girls I met in school that were not good to me.
As soon as I read the script, I knew who this character was," Donovan said about his game in Clueless.
Would not leave the police station after night stay
About fifty cases came on the board of police in the capital area today and says in the police journal that the cases were diverse.
The day at the police station at Hverfisgata began with police having to interfere with a man who had then been recently released from a prison cell after staying there due to drunken driving.
The man would not go away after he was released and did not obey the instructions of the police who told him to go away.
The man earned a continued stay at the police station due to his advancement.
A man was then arrested in the morning, suspected of burglary in a company in Kopavogur.
The police also had to interfere with two men in Breiðholt because of the announcement of a body attack.
It was also suggested that a woman who was sitting in a shopping mall in Kopavogur could not pay for the bill after a meal and was therefore called to the police.
A stuld on a car was also reported in the city centre this morning.
The driver of a white Renault van looked off her for a while and she was then taken free hand.
The car has not been found.
The curse of the Merry - the terrible fate of the Glee Stars
The theory has reached a flight on the Internet that a curse rests over the season of the Happy Orchestra, but actress Naya Rivera drowned in California in the days, thereby becoming the third main actor of the show to die far before age.
The show about Glee is a popular series about singing, dancing and joy.
The show focused on the so-called youth joy squad in high school, their love and destiny.
It was not always taken out with the bliss to be in the joy squad but through singing and dancing, the characters of the show seemed to be able to overwork every situation that arose in their lives.
But outside the place of filming, great disasters have ridden over the players and employees of the show, so very that theories have woken up about a curse resting on the episodes.
Naya Marie Rivera performed the role of Santana Lopez in the show, a cheerleader who did not call her whole grandmother.
After the season, Rivera went on to have actor Ryan Dorsey and had with him his first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and subsequently divorced them.
However, Dorsey refused to file a complaint, and the domestic violence case was dropped.
On July 8, it was announced that Riveru was missing after her four-year-old son was found alone on a drift in a boat on Lake Piru's lake in California.
The boy was found sleeping in a life jacket on board the boat, and he could tell police authorities that he and his mother had stabbed themselves to swimming, and so Rivera had brought him back up to the boat but never returned there himself.
A large search for Rivera.
The day after the search started, the police chief in the area reported that we looked out that Rivera had drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found and was officially ruled dead.
It is believed that she had a huge streaming load in the water and exploited her last claim in saving the son.
The cause of death was recorded drowning by accident.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith performed the role of Finn Hudson in the show, the American footballer with the angel voice who played a key role in moving the Happy Band to road and respect.
Outside the show, Moneith, however, struggled with personal demons.
From the age of 13, he had struggled with addiction and proved difficult to escape it.
In 2013, his colleagues in the show felt enough established, intervened and encouraged him to seek help.
Moneith then went into treatment and seemed all looking to a better way.
Only two months after completing the treatment, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after going out to have fun with friends.
Banamein proved a deadly mix of drugs and alcohol.
It was not believed that there was a will.
Moneith had gone into treatment and his tolerance for drug abuse had decreased so much that the dose he had previously tolerated well, proved fatal.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
His death was heavy on his colleagues, but at the base of his opponent, Lea Michele, it was decided to continue the filming and dedicated them to the whole episode of Moneith's memory and Finn's character.
Mark Wayne Salling performed the role of Noah "Puck" Puckerman in the show, Puck was an American footballer, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellow students in the Merry Orchestra, or until he gained the courage to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his home in Los Angeles suspected of possession of child pornography.
During his home search, a huge amount of child pornography was found and the case soon asked out publicly.
It was clear that Salling was done.
He was subsequently charged and convicted of his offenses.
He had four to seven years in prison, and he would have to be on the list of sex offenders and seek treatment for childbirth.
Before the judge had determined the punishment, Salling, who was then free from bail, was found dead near his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
There were not just actors of the show who fell from far before age forward.
Jim Fuller was the assistant director of the show.
He became acutely sleepy in 2013, only 41 years old.
The show also won a woman named Nancy Motes.
She was the younger sister of the superstar Julia Roberts and did not bear her sister the beautiful story, but she accused Roberts of great control and disrespectful appearance.
Motes took her own life in 2014, but she struggled with severe depression.
She left a letter to her fiancée where she recited her mother and sister among other things responsible for how it was arranged for her.
"My mother and my so-called siblings get nothing after me except the memory that there were those who caused my worst depression."
Lea Michel was the star of the show.
She has recently been accused of applying her co-players bullying and override to the shooting site and being in a superfluous star position.
Jesse Luken performed a guest role in the show in 2012.
He was arrested and charged with drunken driving in 2019, which was considered a huge scandal.
The actress Heather Morris played a major role in the show.
She became aware in 2010 that unpretentious computer bugs came into nude pictures of her and appeared on the Internet.
The actors Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner played both in the show and had an affair outside the show.
Benoist later reported that Jenner has applied her to violence in the relationship.
It can be put flowers on almost everything
It increases the development of children when they get to play outdoors in a garden with the parents cultivating flowers and getting to observe them grow and prosper.
It can also endlessly be done with flowers as Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Just having a moment with the children in the garden is something that never forgets.
They will remember the flowers, the aroma and of course the precious time they got with their parents.
Buyed a boat after tenth grade
"I don’t think we are many fishermen working at the country’s nurseries," says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, who is engaged in coastal fishing in summer but amounts to psychology at the University of Iceland over the winter period."
Coastal fishing is a very convenient summer job when you are studying.
If well fished, you can have good income and I feel great to be able to skip taking student loans.
The income is also good for me in the winter," says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, a 25-year-old psychology student, who is engaged in coastal fishing in the summer as in recent summers.
Axel was just at the pier in Tálknafjörður when a journalist spoke of him late in the evening at the beginning of the week."
"The winter I was in the tenth grade I took command rights for boats that are under twelve meters long and I bought my boat in the summer after I finished the elementary school.
I've been fishing on my boat all summers since.
I bought the boat used by my acquaintance, Hartmann Jonsson, and I made the boat his name.
Hartmann had become an adult when I bought the boat and stopped being to sea and he was very satisfied when he saw that the boat bearing his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took over the boat," says Axel, adding that he bought the boat at three million.
"I made a deal with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of summer but the other half at the end of summer when I had been fishing.
I therefore had the boat indebted at the end of this first summer of mine on him."
But how could a boy have one and a half million to pay out in a boat when he had just finished primary school?
"I had been laying for and collecting money, I had been working with my dad to sea when I was a boy, I was all summers fishing with him and got my share.
I also put my loading money in my boat fund."
Axel was born in Ísafjörður, from where all his mothers are, but he has lived in Kópavogur since he was a boy.
"I can catch here in the western region because I have a legal domicile with my grandmother in Ísafjörður.
I studied in these areas here west of rows with my dad.
I move between the beaches depending on how I feel, because this fishing area covers all the Westfjords.
Although I find it best to stay west, I have also provided around Snæfellsnes and beyond.
I have also provided for the south, but then preferably a gray drop," says Axel, who always strips one early in the morning and says he sometimes talks to the moon and sing for the sky, in solitude for hours outside the ballet.
"The internet connection at sea is good, so I can call, listen to a buffet show and music.
I feel no problem being alone on a boat.
Of course, I try to avoid encountering a rag, but certainly, occasionally something has been weathering, but never a great danger," says Axel, who is lucky with it that he is never seasick.
He says the length of the working day depends on how the catches run each time.
"In the coastal fishing industry, I am never more than 14 hours fishing at once, but I have also been fishing in other systems, for example in the rental quota, but then I have been continuously for one and a half days browsing out at sea fishing."
The arrangement in coastal fishing says he can catch 770 kilograms per day, which he feels inhibitory.
"Other restrictions are that I may not catch Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and I may only catch twelve days a month, these four months of coastal fishing, in May, June, July and August.
In my opinion, sailors should choose their fishing days depending on the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary press is on humans to calm instead of having 48 days over the whole summer and can choose after their head.
So, the regional shift could also go for me, and the seabeds that are well located at the fishing grounds should get to enjoy it," says Axel, who mostly reduces cod salt from the sea during his coastal fishing, but also only ufsa and occasional other species float with.
Axel works over the winter with the university program at the nursery Núpi in Kópavogur.
"I think we are not many sailors who work at the country’s nurseries," says Axel proudly, adding that he was only meant to work temporarily at the nursery.
"I stick there because I like this awesome job.
I hope that psychology is useful to me at the preschool level in the future," says Axel, who also has a long history of business studies.
Recording error prevented return of infection
An error in the registration form that people fill out when they arrive in the country resulted in a person resident in Iceland not being called back for sampling.
It is not a condition to register an ID number if the person fills the form in English, as is when it is done in Icelandic.
"This will be examined during the week," says a specialist in the National Medical Service.
Three domestic infections were detected at the National Hospital's virology department yesterday.
One of those who proved positive came to the country on July 15, two days after the rules on so-called homecoming infection control took effect.
Those residing in Iceland are then screened on arrival in Iceland and again convened for sampling four to five days later.
In the afternoon news, RÚV stated that the person had gone after the old system.
The sampling at the border was negative and he was not called back for screening for the virus.
Kamilla Rut Sigfúsdóttir, a specialist in the National Competent Authority, says in a conversation with the news agency that this is attributable to an error in the electronic registration sheet.
If people complete the registration form in English, it is not a condition to insert an ID number as in the Icelandic version.
It has been thought primarily for foreign tourists.
Therefore, the person concerned has not received an automatic invitation to take samples.
Kamilla says many people, however, have followed up the rules on a homecoming infection portal although they have filled the registration form in English and in some cases employers have also been alert to sending people to sampling again after it arrived in the country.
"This will be examined during the week how people can facilitate access to this to draw attention to the process."
The man is in isolation and six have been placed in quarantine.
They all go for sampling but two were beginning to show symptoms.
Smitrakning is currently ongoing with the three infections detected yesterday, but it is mostly completed due to two infections reported on Friday.
In both cases, sequencing of Icelandic genetic analysis has revealed that there are variants of the coronavirus that have not been found here before.
In the second case, the ties have focused on Israel although it is known that the person who brought the virus to the country had also traveled to other European countries.
Kamilla says it should be available tomorrow where the other virus would be coming from.
A total of 15 are currently in isolation according to the web COVID. is.
135 are in quarantine.
Four out of five infections unrelated
Five domestic infections have been detected in Iceland in recent days.
Of these, four are entirely unrelated and, for example, the origin of the infection that occurred at the Rey Cup sports tournament yesterday.
Smitrakning is still ongoing.
The originals were at a third dozen uniquely sent to quarantine but they were reduced to sixteen.
Overall, 34 are quarantined due to these new infections detected yesterday.
This is the second time in a short time that an infection is detected at a sporting event and has raised questions about whether to hold such events.
Johann K. Jóhannsson, liaison officer at the police department, says it is well possible, as long as people follow the criteria and rules.
"We are constantly complaining to all those who live here that there is a need to sustain individual infection prevention.
We also need to urgently inform people who are holding events that there are certain rules in progress that need to be followed.
Then you can hold events," says Johann.
He says that infection can be prevented by keeping on the air of individual infectious agents.
The rules and criteria are also under constant review.
"What needs to be done, and what the Civil Protection Department and the National Medical Service are constantly urgent for people, is to consider these individual infectious agents.
Both at home and also at service companies.
That people wash their hands and use spritt.
It prevents infection from going on," says Johann.
"We need to urgently ask people to continue on the good road trip we were on, in order to be able to sustain the results we have so far achieved."
40% of COVID-19 victims had diabetes 2
Devon Brumfield heard on the walked phone how hard her father had to catch his breath.
Her father had diabetes and she encouraged him to seek medical help.
The next day he was dead.
The death was attributed to sudden breathing difficulties due to coronavirus infection.
Diabetes was identified on the death certificate as an underlying problem, and Brumfield, who also has diabetes, is terrified that only one should go for himself.
Reuters news agency says Brumfield's fears are not unfounded.
The figures of a new study conducted by the U.S. authorities show that nearly 40% of those deceased had diabetes 2 as an underlying disease.
When the proportion of those who had not reached the age of 65 is checked, the rate rises to half.
A US quarantine (CDC) investigation included more than 10,000 people in 15 states who died from the coronavirus in the period from February to May.
Jonathan Wortham, a specialist in infectious diseases at the CDC, says the results are striking, not least for those diagnosed with diabetes 2 and their loved ones.
Was the magic in slow growth Reuters let make a survey and point the answers from the 12 states that responded to comparable rates.
10 states, among which are California, Arizona and Colombia, are not yet being beginning to disclose underlying diseases.
"Sychia was already an epidemic in slow growth.
Now COVID-19 has broken through as a powerful century," Reuters has by Elbert Huang, CEO of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago.
Diabetes is more common among black and people of South American origin, which also has gone worse out of the coronavirus.
One of the best protections for those with diabetes 2 is to keep the disease under control by physical activity, a healthy diet and the assistance of health care professionals.
The coronavirus epidemic, however, has made many people difficult to keep rosette.
The high price of insulin has then consumed some to continue to show up at work and thereby stop being exposed to the virus.
Reuters points out that US authorities may be aware of the risk that those with diabetes 2 could be caused by the virus.
When the SARS coronavirus passed in 2003, over 20% of them had the disease, and in the swine flu pandemic in 2009, this group was at three times higher risk of having to lie in hospital.
When MERS did so in 2012, one study showed that 60% of those who died or were hospitalized in intensive care had diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz scientist at Yale University says that because the impact of the COVID-19 virus could longer then the epidemic has deprived the cover of a number of previously naughty complications.
"I fear we will see a flood wave of problems when this is over," says Andrew Bolton chairman of the international association of diabetics.
Doctors have warned that the coronavirus epidemic may indirectly lead to an increase in diabetic complications, including kidney disease and kidney dialysis.
Likewise, new studies direct that the coronavirus may lead to an increase in diabetes cases.
Reuters says scientists are trying to understand the link between the coronavirus and diabetes 2.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs and kidneys, organs already weak for many people with diabetes.
In this case, a high rate of glucose and lipids in diabetics may produce a true "cell-injectorm", as it is called when the immune system reacts too hard and attacks the body.
Damaged endothelial cells can also lead to inflammatory formation which in turn can cause fatal blood clots.
"This is all one big puzzle," says Dela Cruz.
"This is all related to each other."
The news has been corrected.
"We were invited champagne, so they left the room"
The couple Ásrún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason received the unusual bonus from artist Ragnari Kjartansson to have sex in front of a camera for a work that the artist was setting up in Paris.
"We loved each other so this was not complicated."
Atli Bollason never forgets when he met his wife and mother, Ásrúna Magnúsdóttir, for the first time.
"I became very fascinated by her.
It was naturally just the radiation, but so I thought it was also quite inexpensively sweet.
And it still seems," he says.
Asrún remembers this too, as the husband recalls the first meeting regularly.
"I am always hearing this story.
Last just this weekend," she says, who also attracted the husband at first encounter.
"I felt and feel so much excitement around Atla, which I like.
There are many things going on and a lot going on and I was fascinated by it."
Atli says the couple have focused on it in their relationship to go their own ways.
"We do not tie our bagging the same knots as fellow travelers.
We avoid the rutins we distinguish around us."
It is possible that they took the errand from Ragnari Kjartansson artist just celebrating, although it was mildly said unusual.
"Christine Anna our common friend contacts us and asks if we can come to eat desert with him, Ragga and Ingibjörg Ragnar's wife, on Snaps."
They then offered, met the three-eye at Snaps, and got themselves a desert wine and their respective desserts.
They listened to Ragnar who led them through their plans at a visual art exhibition he thought to set up in Palais de Tokyo, Paris in the fall.
"He had a multi-channel video work called Scenes from western culture.
He described it in a simple way."
Asrún says he described the work as a banal and dekadent senum from the everyday life of the West.
"He had sketches of all the scenes he was going to shoot and last he told us about what he wanted to know if we were interested in joining."
The scene that Ragnar asked the couple to join was supposed to show a young middle class pair to love in a minimalist room.
"These are intercourse with the beginning and end," says Atli.
The couple did not know Ragnar much though they knew of him and him of them "but they knew us and felt we fit in this.
They had a word that they did not want to advertise people.
Perhaps they thought they would not get the right people but people who would get sexual frustration from performera for others."
They called Ragnar and agreed to think about the matter, but it did not take long.
"When we ran out of Snaps, we said, Are we not just ready for this?
It was just that.
I trust Ragnari as an artist and his entire team," says Ásrún and Atli.
"This is about love and closeness"
The scene was taken up in a finer apartment on Mýrargata.
There was a very rare film team; filmmaker, Ragnar and sounder and the pair.
After the recording had been turned on, everyone left the room to wait outside in a car except Atli and Ásrún.
"We hadn’t decided anything how we should be.
We got some little instructions but we tried to forget the moment and place.
Being unconscious about what we were doing and for whom.
It was nothing played, we just loved each other so it was not complicated," says Ásrún.
But was that romantic?
"Yes, it was a little romantic," says Atli and Ásrún agrees.
"We were offered champagne before they left the room.
This was a little like being on vacation at a fine hotel in Paris."
The team was happy with the couple's performance in the work that moved them.
"When Tommi the cameraman looked at this, he wept, he thought it so beautiful," says Atli.
"This is as much about love as the closest and self-intercourse," says Ásrún.
The couple's parents have seen the work, and Atli says that his mom heard the voice in the son at Reykjavík Art Museum and then realized that he was part of the work.
"Then she turns around and starts puzzling in this," says Atli.
"Mom and Dad saw this in Paris.
We hadn't told anyone that way, but then just my dad sends me a message saying, "Fun to come across the little family in Palais de Tokyo," Ásrún recalls.
And I guess the participation in the work has deepened the relationship between Ásrúnar and Atli?
"We are at least still together so maybe this something deepened.
At least this deepened my relationship with the related family," says Ásrún and laughs.
Asrún herself saw the work in Copenhagen with her colleague.
"I felt a little hard not to be with you but someone else," she says, turning to the husband.
"But it was nice to see this because this is just one sena in a much bigger work and when you saw this with the other works, this is very cool.
I could a little bit break myself from this and was just proud.
And there was the little bean in my stomach," says Ásrún, who was pregnant by another child of the couple when the scene was filmed.
"It was just beautiful."
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke to Ásrúna and Atli in Love stories on Channel 1.
Swansea with victory in the first Premier League
Swansea won a 1-0 victory at Brentford in a dramatic game.
This was the first game of the teams in the finals of the round to get up to the English Premier League.
The game took place at Swansea's home base in Wales.
The half-time position was 0-0.
The locals in Swansea got a penalty in the 64th minute, but Andre Ayew failed the arc art of the vicious point and let defend himself.
Only two minutes later, Rico Henry, Brentford's player, got the red card.
Brentford therefore played the rest of the game a man fewer and in the 82nd minute Swansea players made use of the team difference.
Andre Ayew then added up the video gossip by scoring a great goal and guaranteed Swansea a 1-0 victory.
Swansea therefore leads 1-0 in the duel, while the second game takes place next Wednesday on Brentford's home base.
Ambassador-free for five years from 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, US Ambassador to Iceland, is in the spotlight of the media after CBS reported this morning that he wanted to get an armed guard where he feared for his life.
However, it has not been puzzled for the President of the United States to appoint an ambassador here in Iceland.
Since Carol Van Voorst resigned as Ambassador to the United States at the end of April 2009, the total has been ambassadorless in the country for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst left office under peculiar circumstances, but Kastljós reported in 2009 that she should have received the Fálkaorð.
During a greeting meeting with the President of Iceland, she received a call from the Presidential Office that she would not be honoured.
After she disappeared from Iceland, she taught international relations at Army War College.
Sixteen months passed until Van Voorst's successor came to work, in September 2010.
It is partly due to the fact that Robert S. Connan had been appointed as Ambassador but then retired.
The job finally took Loius Ariega had then worked in the Foreign Service for decades.
He retired in the autumn of 2013 and took office as Ambassador to Guatemala.
Then took over another ambassadorless period.
Robert Barber was approved by the United States Congress in January 2015 and came to work shortly afterwards, but then no ambassador had been on the spot for 13 months.
Barber was politically appointed but not diplomatic, but had worked as a lawyer and supported Baracks Obama's electoral fund.
He retired as soon as Donald Trump took office on 20 January 2017, as is customary with a politically appointed ambassador.
Trump's administration was unusually long to appoint both ambassador and high-ranking officials in the administration system in Washington.
It lasted two years until the U.S. Congress convened Jeffrey Ross Gunter to his meeting to ask him the spies out and confirm afterward as ambassador to Iceland.
In his testimony at the Thing, he said he had never come to Iceland but often to Western Europe, but his wife, who is dead, had been of Dutch rock broken.
Gunter is politically appointed, was previously a dermatologist in California and has been prominent in Jewish organizations in the Republican Jewish Coalition.
The casino owner Sheldon Adelson founded those organizations but Adelson is an intense supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter arrived in Iceland in May 2019, but then no ambassador had been in the country since early 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest example in Iceland.
The reason is both how long Trump's administration was nominating people in key office as well as that in recent years the U.S. Congress's work has been greatly delayed, including confirming the ambassador in office.
Since 2009, it has combined been ambassadorless in Iceland for over five years.
However, it has not prevented the construction of the embassy that recently opened its headquarters at Engjateig.
The construction is believed to have cost about 6.5 billion, but the hnaus thick security walls surround the building and the bulletproof glass is in all windows.
However, it does not seem to have enough to fill the current ambassador's safety feeling because he is said to fear for his life and has requested to receive an armed guard.
The former player of ÍBV suffered racism in Iceland - "It was a mistake to come to Iceland"
Tonny Mawejje, former player of IBV, claims to have suffered racism when he was in Iceland and that he regrets coming to the country.
This is reflected in an interview with Tonny that appeared on the Ugandan media Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined Uganda Police FC as a player in Uganda's top division.
In the interview with Daily Monitor, Tonny discusses many things, including his time in Iceland, but he played with ÍBV, Val and Þróttur in Iceland.
"When I came to Iceland, I didn’t play in the middle as I used to play.
The team captain was in that position, but in addition, he also had the Shirt number I wanted to have so I got neither of what I wanted," says Tonny, but he played on the right edge of the season with IBV.
Among the things Tonny discusses is the racism he suffered in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players will be exposed to when playing in Europe.
"This happened once to me but since I didn’t understand the language, I just ignored what was said to me.
Later I heard about the matter, and then I asked my friend what the matter was about.
He then told me that my opponent has let racial comments fall about me after I enticed him."
In 2014, Tonny left Iceland to Norway where he joined Haugesund.
There he says he made the mistake he sees what most left.
Tonny had not managed to get to the starting line at Haugesund, but he wanted to play more to get to the national team.
Then he asked to return to Iceland on loan, but he then joined Val.
"It was a mistake to return to Iceland on loan.
I think if I had been longer in Norway, I would have had the opportunity I wanted to get," says Tonny, but he hoped that if he would play well in Norway, he would probably get further.
He wants to mean that the loan to Iceland has made out of with his dreams of getting into a big team in Europe.
Find a worm in a woman's neck
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8 cm long black worm in the neck of a woman who was searched there.
Doctors managed to pull the worm out with tweezers.
A study found that there was a parasite.
CNN explains this.
The woman had a few days before eaten sashimi, which are thin meat slices.
The woman quickly improved after the worm was removed but parasites such as these are often in raw meat or fish.
After sushi cleared to bed in the West, cases where parasites have been transmitted to people have increased according to CNN.
Fear that a second wave is starting in Europe
Spain is now in focus in relation to concerns about the second wave of the coronavirus in Europe, where the government has taken action to restrain the spread of the coronavirus epidemic.
In Catalonia, all entertainment life has been put on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona where infections are increasing.
Other European countries have also taken action due to the increase in the number of infections in Spain, but in the UK everyone has to quarantine on return from Spain, as in Norway, and the French have been warned about travel to Spain.
Smitum is also increasing again in France and Germany, as governments try to find the balance of restraining the spread of the virus and re-establishing the economy.
The situation in Europe is, however, good compared to elsewhere in the world, but the incidence of globally transmitted infections is approaching 300 thousand per day, but there counts the most infection in America and South Asia.
Confirmed infections have become 16 million globally, according to Johns Hopkins University's count, and deaths confirmed to be related to the virus have become 644 thousand.
Making's mosaic works finally gets to enjoy themselves to the fullest
In front of the Reykjavík Customs House there is a large and deep hole.
Above it are men with orange helmets.
There is also a large dig.
And more smaller trucks.
The street is closed for traffic.
But the pavement is capable, and there are now many people stalking and respecting artworks from millions of mosaic tiles - as they have never seen it before.
Maybe they've never seen it before.
At least not respected it for themselves.
The work has so far been somewhat hidden, directly in front of it were parking spaces that were always surrounded.
People parked there, locked the car in a snare and then jumped off to conduct their errands in the city center.
"Life and diverse public spaces" and "winning city streets" are a guide to the restoration of the current Tryggvagata.
The aim is to beauty the area and allow the mosaic work of Gerður Helgadóttir at the Toll House to enjoy the vision better.
The front of the work will be a square and where the area is well adjacent to the sun, it is considered suitable as a residential area for road users.
The artwork will be illuminated and the material will now be better enjoyed than before on these 142 square meters.
In the area there will also be small " foggy sprays", some kind of water sculptures, which offer a game and provide the region with certain mystery.
In this way, the renovations are described by the city of Reykjavík which is currently being implemented along with the Veitir.
The pipes of water supply, heat supply and electricity supply will be renewed.
Many of them have arrived in their years, but the sewage and cold water laws are since 1925 and have therefore served residents and businesses in the city centre for nearly a century.
When the street will be reopened after construction, cars can drive around it again.
However, it will be a one-way street and at the same time create a quieter and more accessible space for walking.
In an enlightenment about the customs office on the customs office's website, the building was put into operation in 1971, but its architect was Gisli Halldórsson.
Because the port damage reached through the house, there formed a 250 square meter windowless wall surface out to the street.
The construction committee and architect agreed that such a surface would adversely affect the overall street image, if no specific measures were taken to decorate the appearance of the building.
The parties therefore agreed to calculate by having put there a permanent artwork.
At this time, a great word of Gerður Helgadóttir, an artist, went on in the summary.
She had worked extensively on mosaic art works in Germany and elsewhere.
It was decided to contact her first before deciding whether to compete for the work.
It was often discussed that the work would have to mirror life at the port, as the port had been the lifeblood of Reykjavík since its construction.
When talking to the artist, she had to trax the subject of such a work.
It was agreed that she would receive drawings and other assistance before returning from the country, where she would work on the proposals abroad.
Maker got the time she decided herself to need, and when she returned home she submitted some proposals for discussion.
It was agreed without delay to ask her to do the work.
It was also requested to conclude a comprehensive agreement with her and the famous artwork company in Germany, the brothers Oidtmann, but Gerður had long worked with them for the installation of famous artworks across Europe.
The contract took place and Gerður worked the artwork under installation at the workshop of the brothers, who then took care of the installation at the Toll House.
The whole work was exceptionally well done, both by Gerdur Helgadóttir and Oidtmann Brothers, says in the summary.
It has ever since resisted the unwavering Icelandic weather.
It took Maki about two years to do the work, which was done and installed in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after the Toll House work was completed, only 47 years old.
Prepares the transfer of more institutions to land
The Minister of Social Affairs Ásmundur Einar Daðason calls for more public institutions to be exported to Iceland in the near future.
This said the minister in the episode Explosive on the Wave at noon.
Recently, it was announced that the fire department of the Housing and Construction Agency will be moved north to Sauðárkrókur in the fall.
Six fire experts are employed by the Agency, none of whom intends to follow the Agency north, and the National Association of Firefighters and Sickness Transporters has criticized the migration.
"I think we should step further into this being.
I am preparing further steps in this being.
Further transport," said Ásmundur.
He says he is convinced that the vast majority of the nation wants to see a greater distribution of public institutions around the country.
"I think it needs to take further political decisions on the transfer of public jobs to land, as I was doing with the Housing and Construction Agency," said Ásmundur, but he also took examples of other institutions that have been exported to land and were of great importance to communities outside the country, such as the transfer of the Food Agency to Selfoss, the Icelandic Geography to Akranes and unemployment insurance at Skagaströnd.
All the main from the second day of the Championship
The 94th Championship of Iceland in Free Sports ended at Thorsvellir in Akureyri today.
Several tournaments were set on the second race day.
An exciting competition was calculated in the women's sleggjukast at Thorsvellir, while Vigdís Jónsdóttir from FH set Iceland record in a sleggjukast in 2014 which lasted until Elísabet Rut Rúnarsdóttir from IR added a record in May last year.
Vigdís won the Icelandic record back earlier this summer and has been in fantasy for the past, but she has trimmed Icelandic record for the rest of summer.
Elizabeth Rut has been struggling with injuries and did not get on track today.
She had only one valid throw of five, threw 25.69 yards, which is far from her best.
Vigdis threw the longest of all today, or 60.08 meters in her last attempt and at the same time set a tournament record.
Her Iceland record she set earlier in July is 62.69 meters, and she was therefore somewhat from it.
Guðrún Karítas Hallgrímsdóttir from ÍR had the second best throw of the day, but she improved her best performance with a pitch of 50.18 meters.
In the men's class, FH-inger Hilmar Örn Jónsson, the Icelandic record holder, won a safe victory, but he threw 73.84 yards in his next last pitch and set a tournament record.
His Icelandic record in the industry is 75.26 meters.
Guðni Valur Guðnason, an Olympic and Icelandic record holder, won a ball-ball competition at Thorsvellir yesterday, but today he competed in a round throw that is his main article.
The Icelandic record of Gudna Vals is 65.53 metres, but he threw the longest 59.13 metres today and secured his victory.
Valdimar Hjalti Erlendsson threw the next day, but he had one valid throw that was sufficient in the 2nd place, 49.43 meters.
Hafdís Sigurðardóttir, a long-term Icelandic record holder, won the long-distance competition with superiority, while Hafdís jumped the longest 6.25 meters today, which is nearly 40 cm from her Icelandic record.
In the 200-metre women's race, it was the IR-inger Guðbjörg Jóna Bjarnadóttir who was sprinted but she came to the goal in 24.04 seconds, while her Iceland record in the industry is 23.45 seconds.
Gudbjörg Jóna was victorious in Akureyri, but she won two gold medals yesterday, in a 100-metre run and in a 4 x 100-metre betting run and then also in a 4 x 400-metre betting run today.
In the men's class, Kolbeinn Höður Gunnarsson from FH was the first to score in the 200-metre run in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of Óliver Mána Samúelsson from Ármann.
Like Gudbjörg Jóna, Kolbeinn Höður won gold in the 100 metres yesterday as well as in the 400 metres run.
Do not receive a fine for 27 million crore Bitcoin harvest
The Board of Directors of Taxation has rejected the claim of a tax investigator who demanded a fine over a man for undercounting his capital income that was incurred as a result of the sale of the electronic currency Bitcoin.
The committee concludes that the tax investigator had not provided clear justification for why it was necessary to fine the man.
The committee's ruling states that the tax investigator considered the man to have substitutes for materially incorrect tax returns for the income years 2016 and 2017.
He would have underestimated his capital income that would be due to the sale of Bitcoin's electronic coin of 27 million, either intentionally or by a dramatic carelessness.
The authentic bear man for his conduct.
The man rejected it in a letter to the committee.
However, he struggled to have in 2016 sold electronic coins for 27 million.
He would have acquired with burial in 2009 and 2010 when it had both been easy and undoubted with a normal home computer.
Then he noted that when selling the electronic coin, the tax execution due to such sales had been significantly vague and unpredictable.
It would have been possible to expect citizens to realize such measures on tax returns.
He would not have intended to avoid paying tax on the harvest and would have accounted for his property on the return as a deposit on the currency account.
He would have asked both skilled and state tax directors about how this was done but without success.
He believed that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for several years when he began digging after Bitcoin.
He would have been in a worse position than others to study complex rules that tax authorities had not formed a clear opinion on.
The man therefore considered it appropriate that his taxes for these two income years would be re-established and the burden applied but otherwise not made a penalty.
He then reiterated that he worked in Iceland and had paid taxes in Iceland since 2012.
He would never have intended to escape his duties unduly.
The claim for a fine would be from all moderation and would cast him into debt.
Brynjólfur raises an interview: "This man understands what football is"
Brynjólfur Andersen Willumsson has been considerably between the teeth of people, but also impressed by his advancement for the rest of the season with Breiðablik in the Pepsi Max League.
Bliks will be in the fire line tonight when they receive IA on live broadcast on Station 2 Sport.
Brynjólfur then takes out a playoff ban due to four reminders of the season and therefore does not attend a game with a new haircut as in summer games so far.
He had let write "bla, blah, blah" on his head for the match with HK last Thursday, which HK won 1-0.
"I don’t know who exactly he was answering with the payment, but talking about character then this was rather better trying in the game.
He didn't go into hiding.
He wants to get the ball every single time and if there was someone going to equalize this game, I thought he would do it or create it," said Guðmundur Benediktsson of the Pepsi Max studio, when it was believed that Brynjólfur.
"I should be here for the people."
"It is difficult sometimes to realize what position he is.
He looks a little out on the left when it starts to pass on the games, but he has a very free rull in the team," said Hjörvar Hafliðason.
Thorkel Máni Pétursson tells Brynjólfur a real entertainer and celebrates getting such a colorful man to the league: "No one shares that this is a character.
This is a fun tweet and I love this with my hair, and to be always ready to meet and answer in interviews.
There is an amazing lot of people occupied by him, who tells me that this man understands about what football is.
"I am an entertainer.
I'm supposed to be here for the people and enjoy it."
The people are reading the interviews with Brynjólfur, people are paying themselves in and observing what stands next on his hair.
This man is just a genius," said Máni.
Player KR says he wants to leave the club - "I've been in touch with some teams in the B league"
Tobias Thomsen, a KR player in the Pepsi Max League, seems to be leaving the team.
According to the Danish medium Bold, Tobias is ready to return home to Denmark.
Football.net also reported the case.
Tobias wants to get the start of the season in the home country, but to do so he first has to terminate his contract with KR where the Danish league starts before that Icelandic odds.
The company knows I miss Denmark and has shown me a lot of understanding," Tobias said in a conversation with Bold.
"I have been in contact with some teams in the B-League and will probably switch over before the Icelandic season ends.
There are not many teams in Denmark that can allow themselves to pay up my contract at KR."
Then he says he probably needs to take on a salary reduction in Denmark.
"Companies in Denmark have probably felt more about the economic impact of the virus than in Iceland."
The bike victor Bjartmar has recovered bikes for millions - now answers for himself after coverage of DV
For over a year, Bjartmar Leósson has had a hobby unlike most others.
He sniffs up and saves lost and stolen bikes, electric bikes and scooters.
Bjartmar has earned the name "the bike tailor" as a result.
Yesterday, there was so much floppy when a man published a narrative of his dealings with Bjartmar.
The DV then referred to discussions on the Facebook group of West farmers stating that Bjartmar has taken the man to talk at Austurvellir and said the scooter possibly was stolen.
It was not possible to read from the original writing of the electronic scholar, but that Bjartmar had theft.
That text has now been changed on Facebook and the headline of the original news DV updated accordingly.
Bjartmar says the initial news of the case is not at all representative of what really went on yesterday at Austurvellir.
Bjartmar said he had received information from the victim of an electric scout that this was truly his electric scout.
The information received the alleged owner from others, but the information proved false says Bjartmar.
"I saw the guy and I checked the shuttle, providing information that there was an electrical shuttle that had been missed very long and searched for.
I certainly hesitated first, but when I saw him prepare himself to drive off on the shuttle, I decided to punch on talking to the man.
The owner was sure in his fault and I therefore decided to have a conversation with the man.
In general, I go very fine in such a case, but before I managed to finish what I had to say, the man had taken off me the word."
Bjartmar says that the man on the electric shuttle has at the same time invited him to show him the receipt for the bike and himself called the police.
"Yes, cool," said Bjartmar, "get this just clean."
So the owner of the electric shuttle proved ownership of his electric shuttle and drove off.
Later, the right owner of the electronic shuttle told his story on Facebook, as reported in the previous news.
In the past year, Bjartmar has been engaged in this practice, he says he can count the exchange he encountered with people on the fingers of one hand.
"I have had peaceful relations with Reykjavík’s most difficult men," Bjartmar said, pointing out that bicycle thieves are by far the smallest brothers and sisters of society, addicts, psychotic people and other people for whom some reason is on the street.
"The film is a hard master and somehow the next dose needs to be financed, unfortunately theft of such liquidity is an easy way to that goal," says Bjartmar.
"My relationship with these people is really so good that I have brought many of the good people with me into the team.
There are examples that people have been treated and taken on and then sought me and assisted me with what I am doing," he says.
In general, Bjartmar's relations with bikers are in polite terms.
Some people know of him and what he is doing and offer peacefully to show him receipts, the stell number of reels and so on.
Bike theft is a major problem that has little been dealt with.
Furthermore, Bjartmar says that police are even beginning to point people to talk to him out of stolen bicycles.
Bjartmar is unaware of the previous DV news release and says he is not a kind of self-organized police in a personal search for justice.
Asked if he is still not on the high ice with his act, and whether this is not primarily the role of police, Bjartmar says so certainly.
"Of course, the cops are supposed to do this, but the fact of the case is that the cops are purely not doing this.
I have, for example, watched police officers drive away from a large pile of stolen wheels.
She is purely said grueless in these matters."
"When the cops are not doing anything in this, and this is just in front of your nose, and experience has shown that I can succeed in this category, then why not?" asks Bjartmar.
He says he has achieved so much success in sustaining stolen wheels, that sometimes he runs on his "jokes" on the street that then they just right Bjartmari the wheels they had previously recovered.
The time Bjartmar has called for police assistance has come for her to purely not meet.
"This is just not working with the police, and it is not my fault and it is not the owners of the bicycles to blame," Bjartmar said, and it is sorry that victims of bicycle thefts need to feel for the intimacy of the police in this case category.
The results of Bjartmar are not shared.
Many stories of people thank Bjartmari for having reached their property to them again.
Bjartmar himself says he has long lost his number on the number of bicycles he has returned, but the amounts run by millions, if not millions.
Weigh there electric beads, electric bikes and electric shuttles heavily, but electric bikes can cost up under half a million.
Bjartmar works every day in kindergarten and every other weekend he works in a cohabitation.
His bike search is therefore an unpaid work he performs in his spare time.
Pension funds and long shadows
In 2019, there was a huge anniversary year in the history of pension funds in Iceland.
Officials had, however, been retired from the Danish king all the streets since the 19th century, but in 1919 a pension fund was established by officials who eventually became the pension fund of all public servants.
The basis for the current pension funds of ordinary workers was then laid down by the General Labour Agreement in 1969, which provided for employment-related pension funds with compulsory membership and qualifying fund collection since the beginning of 1970.
In 1974, the law was passed on the basis of these agreements and the pension scheme continued to expand thereafter.
The employee's pension scheme was not the only radical change that the labor movement of the 20th century made by its collective struggle.
Unemployment insurance had been obtained in a similar manner in historic strikes in 1955, and also the organization gradually received its demands for sickness rights and sickness funds, significant holiday rights, shortening of working hours, housing reforms and more such as much exchange.
All these rights cost a great and rigorous struggle but proved, after thinking, a much greater and more lasting benefit than the proliferation of the ounces in the payroll, which disappeared equally hard in the hite of inflation that characterized the period after war and until 1990 as many remember.
The eve of the creation of general pension funds in 1969 was both long and complex.
While people finally agreed that the funds would actually be the property of fund members, the labor movement had to agree that their boards should be appointed representatives of employers and fund members equally.
In the years following the establishment of the funds, the requirement for a majority of the employees in the board of the funds often came to discussion in the employees' organizations, but it never managed to progress, and therefore we still sit up with the abnormal arrangements that the members of the fund members are not in the majority in the boards of the funds.
Article 36 of Law No 129/1997 on compulsory insurance of pension rights and activities of pension funds deals with the investment policy of the funds.
It states in point 1 that ‘the pension fund shall have the interests of members as a guiding principle.
In addition, point 5 states: ‘A pension fund shall establish ethical criteria for investments.
The shareholder policy of the Commercial Pension Fund includes, inter alia, the following provisions, following the aforementioned legal provisions:
The Pension Fund is a member of the United Nations (UN PRI) rules on responsible investments, along with many of the largest pension funds and professional investors of the western and European countries.
The rules address how the focus on environmental and social issues as well as good corporate governance can contribute to the improvement of portfolio investment performance.
This brings together the interests of investors and the goals of society in a broader context.
LV considers it important that companies, in particular those listed on the stock market, put in place a public policy on: to exercise good governance of employee benefits of social responsibility and the environment.
The Pension Fund Value, which has the largest funds in the country, has established a ‘responsible investment policy and there are provisions of a similar nature.
This is all renovated here as an introduction to the Icelandic latest fashion word, "shadow management".
As the word is new in the case, it is not hoped that it has been fully defined, but I think the following definition now is "most taken": Shadow management is when a union leader says in the media that he intends to send the company’s representatives to the board of pension funds recommendations or instructions on how to take a position in a particular case.
If they do not follow the recommendation, they will be released from the board at the earliest opportunity.
If the leader does not take this into the media and does not talk about dismissal, however, it is not a "shadow management", as such communication between men of course is a whole time in the financial world as elsewhere.
I let the reader think about which way he feels "shadower."
There are in particular two people who have tried to shape this definition when this is written, in the morning of Saturday 25 July 2020.
There are Hörður Ægisson journalists at the Newspaper and Governor Ásgeir Jónsson.
The issue of both was created after Bogi Nils Bogason CEO of Icelandair had stated his intention to terminate the company's contracts with flight attendants and flight attendants (say them up), and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairman of the Reykjavík Trade Association, then sent out the recommendation to the company's representatives in the board of the Pension Fund of Traders not to support the potential acquisition of shares in the company, otherwise they might
A little later, Bogi Nils pulled his decision back, and subsequently Ragnar Thor went the same way with his recommendation, which, of course, focused on Boga's decision.
Nonetheless, Hörður and Ásgeir saw a reason to be heard about the case in the newspaper's Friday newspaper in large words about shadow management, law violations and the rich need for changes in the law.
There, a small tuft was truly supposed to overturn a heavy load, although the blessed tuft had been in connection mode and in addition been wiped out swiftly.
Since the issue is important, let us consider the subject itself at the end.
I outlined above the issues of the Pension Fund Act pertaining to this issue.
This means that fund managers should take care of the interests of fund members and have ethical criteria in investments, and these issues are elaborated more closely in the statutes of both Value and Pension Fund of Traders as I mentioned.
However, pension funds should NOT look solely for short-term profitability considerations in their investments.
This would be a very dangerous policy and it is not necessary to seek examples of such a thing in the past, since large banks and funds have flown to unethical adventurers and environmentalists, with tragic consequences.
The CEO of Icelandair was obviously on high ice when he thought to wipe out a whole group of employees, thus significantly reducing the goodwill that the company has enjoyed in the Icelandic market and weakening its position towards investors.
Fortunately he saw and pulled this back.
The time shows whether it is sufficient for the investment of pension funds in the company to be considered responsible to fund members in the event of an outbreak.

One of the infected did not have a return infection check
One of the three people diagnosed with Covid-19 in the country yesterday arrived in the country from the Baltic state on 15 July last, about one and a half weeks ago.
He is an Icelander who is not living here continuously and therefore did not receive clear instructions to carry out a so-called return infection check after arrival in the country and to take another sampling a few days after arrival.
He got negative from screening at the border.
"But he is in Icelandic society and really should go to that resort," says Kamilla Jósepsdóttir, a specialist in the field of quarantine at Landlæknir and a deputy health care practitioner while on summer vacation, in a conversation with the Newspaper today.
"He used the English registration form and there is no obligation to register the ID number and if the ID number is not recorded, you are not automatically invited to the second sample."
She says that the man has been able to use the English registration form because he is actually resident abroad but because of his connection network in the country as Icelander he should have rather used it Icelandic.
However, he did not realize this.
"When the ID is not recorded, you need to seek to come to the second sampling.
Neither he nor his employer seem to have realized that it was the right way," says Kamilla.
"So it is clear that we need to enhance the information about this while we find some way to make an automatic messaging system although Icelanders do not register their ID number.
Or then to make it somehow more obvious who are participants in Icelandic society in the registration system," she explains.
Fortunately, however, the few people left on arrival in Iceland although they are defined as a participant in Icelandic society, a foreigner.
Only six have been sent into quarantine after he was diagnosed yesterday and these six were all in communion with him.
They are due to be sampled, however, two of them are beginning to show symptoms of Covid-19 infection.
The man got negative from his sampling at the border on July 15.
Kamilla says he was likely to have been recently infected with the virus that she was not yet able to be detected in him when the sample was taken at the border.
However, she does not want to rule out that the man has been infected here in Iceland but did not carry the virus with him to the country.
"It is not entirely possible to claim that this is indeed an imported infection because it is that long ago he came to the country that he might have been exposed here like these two who have caused a little styr in relation to the sports tournaments."
However, she says that it is very unlikely because of the few people left here.
"It is really very unlikely," says Kamilla, but states that it cannot be excluded until Icelandic genetic analysis has sequenced the virus in man.
"If we get a virus infection that has not been seen here before, it is almost safe that he has carried it to the country."
Pepper spray and bombs applied against protesters
To the conflict came between police and protesters in Seattle last night.
Police deployed protesters pepper spray and unbanished grenades, but protesters broke the windows and turned on.
45 protesters were arrested and 21 police officers were injured.
Police violence and racism were protested widely in the United States last night, but the protests in Seattle were in support of protesters in Portland, Oregon State.
In Austin, Texas, one protester was shot dead.
As stated on the BBC, the attacker has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands came together in peaceful protests.
A group of people then lit a building site and broke a glass pane in the city's courthouse.
Subsequently, police said the protest was irrational and to the conflict came between groups of protesters and police.
In Aurora, Colorado, Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old black man who was murdered by police in August last year, was remembered by protesters.
Car drove through a group of protesters in the city but no injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of team members of the National Guard of Blacks came together and demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was murdered by police in her home last March.
The group carried firearms and joined the counties to a closed intersection where police duties the group from a group of people who protested the protest and also carried firearms.
Then 75 were arrested in Omaha, Nebraska, where protesters remembered James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man who was murdered by a white bar owner in May.
Solskjær: Not the game that defines our season
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, Manchester United's football manager, does not want to make too much of the importance of the game with Leicester today in the final round of the English Premier League.
If United loses the game, and Chelsea does not lose against Wolves, end Solskjær and his men in 5th place and thereby miss the Champions League seats.
However, they should still hope to get to the Champions League by winning the Europa League next month.
"We are not in the end.
If we reach the level against Leicester, I think people will say we have now not had a bad season," Solskjær said.
"But whatever happens, this is not the end of our journey because we still have a lot of land with reaching the two teams above us," Solskjær said.
It is clear that men's nerves will be breathing at 15 today, but Solskjær tried to pretend that each other game was involved.
"If one wants to belong to Manchester United, one must get used to being under pressure in the last game of the season.
This is nothing new, and on this the company builds.
We have created a great opportunity to end the season well and now it is ours to utilize it," Solskjær said.
"This is not the most important game of the season, this is just the next game.
You can ask anyone in the football, the next game is always the most important.
The results do not define our period, we have already had many moments to define this period."
"Coming Bruno Fernandes changed a lot for us and I believe that whole over we are in better shape and much stronger mentally than last season," Solskjær said.
65,000 infections per solar cycle
65.490 new coronavirus infections were detected in the United States yesterday according to John Hopkins University.
A total of 4,178,021 infections have been confirmed in the western Atlantic since the beginning of the epidemic there in the country.
900 people died from the virus yesterday, but the last four days until then, deaths due to the virus were more than 1,000 per day.
A total of 146,460 deaths due to the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
The CNN news reports that, according to the forecast model of the United States Department of Defense, the number of deaths from the virus will become 175,000 on August 15th.
Fear another wave of the epidemic
The authorities of Spain now try by the weak ones to keep back from the increased spread of COVID-19 in the country.
Spanish health authorities reported over 920 new cases of COVID-19, both on Thursday and Friday.
There, no more people have been diagnosed in one day since early May, and the news comes at the same time as the Spaniards begin to lift one of the strictest exit bans in Europe.
The backlash led to British authorities now obliging passengers arriving from Spain to quarantine upon return.
A week before, Spain was on the British list of safe states.
The situation is what the worst in Catalonia in northeastern Spain where the government has taken broader restrictions to try to stem the growth.
In the capital Barcelona, entertainment venues will be closed for the next two weeks and wavehouses made to close at midnight.
The exit ban is now in force for 200 thousand inhabitants in Segria County in western Catalonia.
It is believed that the British decision will negatively affect the Spanish economy that relies heavily on the arrival of foreign tourists and is poorly played after the epidemic.
Tui, the UK's largest travel agency, canceled all flights planned today to Spain and the Canary Islands.
Governments around the world are said to prepare for the second wave of the epidemic, but little interest seems to be in resorting back to a large curfew that has widely laid the economy in ruin.
For example, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has taken very ill into such a situation and similarly to nuclear weapons he does not want to use.
Then Jean Castex, the French Prime Minister, has said that the nation "would not get a life off, economically or socially," if again a curfew would be taken at national level.
Many councillors hope that local resources that reach the population of individual towns, cities or regions will be sufficient to keep back from the virus in the next round if it comes to it.
Five new infections in Iceland - Three domestic
Three domestic infections were detected yesterday plus two more at the border.
Thus, five people with positive Covid-19 infection were diagnosed yesterday in Iceland.
The civil protection announcement states that one of the infections is related to the infection reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football tournament.
Has the person been sent into isolation and sixteen who were in close contact with him in quarantine.
The infected person was involved in the social work of a sports club in Reykjavík and is according to the announcement, "only part of the sports team" in quarantine.
Others sent in quarantine relate to the man in a different way.
The origin of this infection is unfounded and a contagion in full swing with the National Police Department's infecting team.
The ReyCUP tournament's counterparts have complied with the guidelines and rules of the health care and civil protection still in force and appropriate measures have been taken.
However, pictures of yesterday's tournament attracted attention as it could be seen in a very close communion to celebrate the good rate of his team out on the field.
Just before 11 pm today, the tournament holders published the following announcement on their Facebook page.
It says: Parents please respect the rules that contestants themselves attend their stuff at school.
Parents are NOT allowed to do so.
Thanks for your shown understanding."
Another infection was detected yesterday but is related to the infection reported on the previous day.
The announcement states: "Icelandic genetic analysis has sequenced the infections and a new type of virus that has not been detected here before has been identified."
The infection is also processed and is infected in isolation and 12 in quarantine due to the infection.
The third infection in question is from a man who arrived in Iceland 11 days ago, July 15.
He was diagnosed in the southwest corner of the country.
The person is now in isolation and six who were in close contact with him in quarantine.
Two of them are already beginning to show symptoms of viral infection.
In addition, two were identified at the border and the result of further investigations is awaited as the cross-border transmission curve provides.
Finally, the announcement states: The National Police Department and the National Competent Authority urgently call on people to take care and pay attention to individual infection prevention.
If the least doubt is whether the symptoms of the Covid-19 virus are present, the same is asked to take a sample at the nearest clinic.
Patreksfjörður says the camp site is booked for shopping weekends - Direct guests otherwise
The camp site in Patreksfjörður is fully booked this weekend, according to the announcement of the West.
Visitors are advised to view other accommodation options.
Names the Westbyggð Bíldudalur, Tálknafjörður, Melanes in Rauðasandur, Hótel Flókalund and Hótel Breiðavík as other options in the situation.
There is plenty to be in Patreksfjörður this weekend, because as previous years, Skjaldborg, a festival of Icelandic documentary films will be held in town.
It has been held since 2007 and has become a strong tradition in town.
Of the attack on the camp site to judge, good attendance can be expected this year, if weather does not put a bar in account, but DV said earlier today from a despicable forecast.
However, the worst weather may be expected south, and hope for the Patreksfjords.
The website bb.is first reported, and said that all other accommodations in the town were already fully booked.
A whole villa grots down to the best location in the city
Romanian workers live for free on Dunhaga 18-20.
Meanwhile, owners seek a building permit for renovation, but their errand has rolled around in the system for the third year.
In one of Reykjavík’s oldest, coveted and most expensive neighborhoods, a vegetarian villa stands on three floors.
The ground floor of the building has about 600 square meters of commercial space.
Behind the house there are doors of two stairway enclosures, each containing four fairly vegetative apartments.
They range from 93 to 130 square meters, though most over 100.
The house has a considerable history to store.
It was built in 1959 and has, among other things, hosted video rentals, the Shopping Office, the Milk Coalition, Jóa gunmaker, fish sales and most recently the University print.
The house has, so mild to say, remembered its fiddle more beautiful.
The house is now under severe damage, as can be seen in the attached pictures.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
The owners of D18 Ltd. are according to the company register among others Magnús Magnússon and Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir.
Magnus went before the owners group of Borgun and was the chairman of the holding company Borgun.
In the group of owners of the holding company Borgun is Stálskip ehf.
Stálskip ehf. is an investment company of Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir and her children.
Guðrún is also the owner of a third part of D18 ehf.
Gudrun and her husband, Ágúst Guðmundur Sigurðsson, once drove the company Steelskip.
D18 Ltd. bought the house in the summer of 2009 and has therefore little or nothing been maintained since then.
Tell neighbors that the state of the house has deteriorated continuously since, although most in recent years.
On the Facebook page of residents in the neighborhood, one resident says that the house has "not been particularly lively in the last few years".
It may play into that owners have for several years sought to change the house and plot.
Other neighbors say the house long has not been ok.
"It is long time to do something nice to this spot and boring that this has attracted such a thing."
He also says that he is pissed out in the owners of the house for not having driven himself into finishing this, finding some common surface with the neighbors of the house and stopping this "legal stand".
"Do this just in consultation with the community around so you can hurry up and finish it."
The ‘Law-based app is the organisational process of the field that has been running at least since 2017.
The owners of Dunhaga were then injured 18 and 20 after permission to build a hill on top of the current villa and behind the house, a new elevator house and a building on one floor as well as a basement.
The building permit granted for that implementation was appealed to the Environmental and Resources Committee and the committee repealed it as the implementation did not support the division and the local presentation was not satisfactory.
The city of Reykjavík started with a divisional work and ended it with an ad in the Official Journal in July last year.
That organisation was also appealed and the committee repealed it in March 2020.
At this point, nearly three years had passed since the initial application for building permits and the owners of the building at the starting field.
The house had at this time drank down considerably and neighbors taken to wearing.
When the DV asked the neighbors of the house out in the situation and the reaction of neighbors, the answers were in various ways.
Some had an understanding of the intentions of the owners of the house, others not at all.
Others directed the anger to the city, others not.
Others were just angry but nothing necessarily out into anyone.
Still others said the parking lot was a thriller, but neighbors have exploited the unused parking lot of Dunhaga 18-20 under their vehicle.
One complainant in the case said he was long-awaited by the administration:
"Let us have to go through the process in a three-way is quite amazing.
It is like the city of Reykjavík may not read."
Today the house stands empty, abandoned and is neglected.
A monument to the suspension of the city's administration and the noble intentions of the owner and many years of their work currently in the starting field.
When a journalist hit a park at Dunhaga 18, he blazed a galoped door and a dumpster.
Playstation-computer and recent television lay within about another litter on the ground - victims of Icelandic summer diapers.
It was opened in the old office of the University Print and there was a lot of cats of the urine smell to judge.
It is clear that someone has nested around in one corner but no one is visible.
Stacks of sofas and beds and some pallets of geological pages, which undoubtedly were supposed to become a book, we blazed.
The stairs of the apartment building were also open and life in both of them.
The journalist was so lucky to come across the population of one of them.
There were Romanians boiling potato dishes for dinner and invited a journalist in.
The Romanians work for the staff rental Ztrongforce ehf.
They have been there for some time and simulated DV sources that the company has nothing paid for the housing except heat and electricity.
Due to the state of the house, it is not forbidden to collect rent.
Of the places of mail in the lobby of the house to judge, it is clear that there has been a lot of foreign workers in recent years.
The operation of staff rentals has not been part of the Covid-19 situation, as the contraction in tourism led to a recession in the construction sector, and these two business being the most efficient to take advantage of the service of staff rentals.
Nevertheless, the household members at Dunhaga 18 seemed to have enough to do and hung the work bugs and mittens in the joint to dry after a long working day in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the miserable condition of the house, the apartment that the boys shared seemed to be nicely maintained.
When a journalist greeted the boys Romanian, he became ironic suddenly clear: In the best place in Reykjavík, 1,500 square meters of property stands down.
Owners want to change the house for improvement and neighbors want to improve the situation but share about the definition of "batting".
In between, the city’s planning area sits on the starting field, the victim of endless appeals and appeal options in the planning process and the suspended resolution of the Environmental and Resources Committee.
In the house so Romanian workers, perhaps exactly those who go into improving the situation, when the Icelanders stop fighting.
The article originally appeared in the weekend newspaper DV on July 17.
In an effort against overweight following a coronavirus epidemic
The UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, will provide 10 million pounds in a campaign against overweight, which will include a ban on fast food advertising, following his serious illness, partly due to his weight.
Johnson will present the campaign, which has been named Better Health, tomorrow, Monday, but with the campaign, doctors will be encouraged to prescribe cycling for their clients in overweight and will in addition be undertaken in an effort to propagate cycling paths.
The advertising of fast food restaurants on TV will then be banned before 21 o'clock at night, according to British media sources.
"COVID-19 has attracted us to the short and long-term risks of being overweight, and the Prime Minister is determined that we must use the time to become healthier, more active and eat a healthier diet," the government spokesman says.
Johnson himself has had weight problems, but he was laid in intensive care when he was infected with the coronavirus in the spring, and it is partly his weight because he is believed to have weakened so seriously.
Women better suited to lead the changes
She said the new constitution was the biggest step the nation can take towards greater power distribution, transparency and in counteracting corruption and to the interests of the whole.
"We need to change gear a little bit now and who is better suited to lead such changes than the group of society that is easier to be in these values.
There are women," said Helga.
"Women in Iceland are famous for their women's solidarity.
To stick together and be together in leading changes.
So now it is just our turn to lead these changes."
She said she was a little fading over the focus on Iceland as the "best in the world" in both gender equality and human rights.
"Then we are not as ready to look at what needs to be done.
As Germans are very aware of their history and view everything that needs to be done.
There's lots.
We have to know where we are coming from and know the story and listen.
Listen to the voices of peripheral groups.
We do not live by the same rules all here," said Helga.
She said that women were in many ways in good matters in Iceland, but added that as far as elsewhere Icelanders were building a super masculine force.
She said that politics turned to form about its own interests, dominance and powers that were the forces that maintained inequality in all communities.
"Women are now starting this group and coming together and are just getting a little annoyed that Parliament intends to trekk into a trekk to disregard this referendum from 2012," she said.
"There are these feminine values we are thinking this from.
From human rights and conservation, cooperation and that we all really sit at the same table," she said, adding that the aforementioned values were the baselines in the new constitution.
"We are a very rich country of natural resources and it is ridiculous that here are people who live with poverty.
It is ridiculous, we can switch differently," said Helga.
"It is ridiculous that there is something natural law that women’s work is always lower paid.
It is ridiculous that flight attendants and nurses need to endlessly stand in a collective struggle just to achieve a decent wage."
The signature list of the new constitution can be signed here via electronic Iceland.
Trying to rob a pedestrian in the city center
A man was arrested in the city centre last night after he threatened pedestrians and tried to get money off him.
The police also stopped the production of drugs in Árbær where two were arrested due to the case.
Then the police stopped the driver of a motorcycle in the hills where its driver was at 146 km speed with a maximum speed of 60 km/h.
In addition, he had previously been deprived of driving rights.
The police in the capital area had enough to spin in the night and there were just over 80 cases recorded in the police diary from five yesterday to five this morning.
There was a lot of noise reporting on the party.
On Saturday night, announcements of eleven noisy parties were received and it was thought much in the police journal.
The night, however, stripped 22 noise issues on the board of police.
Six were saved in a prison cell last night.
In Árbær, police were called to the night when the parties shot fireworks on the air.
However, they were ready to save themselves when police officers hit the park.
Then nine drivers were stopped for drunkenness and or drug driving.
Four were arrested for fighting in the city centre last night, one of which was saved in a prison cell.
The two were then moved to the emergency room after they fell on the face, one in the city centre and the other in the West.
One was transferred to an accident department after he was injured by jumping on trampolin in Kopavogur.
In addition, police officers stopped a driver who pulled a caravan at Kjalarnes yesterday.
The caravan's bike was, according to the police diary, in a "very bad condition" and it was detained.
You can stay in Monet's house around the shopping weekend
The house, which impressionist Claude Monet spent the last forty years of his practice in, is now for rent on the site Airbnb.
The next loose nights in the house are about the shopping weekend.
The house is small and cute, located in the town of Givenry in Normandie, France.
The painter world famous lived in the house from 1883 until his death in 1926.
The house has three bedrooms, two lounges and three bathrooms.
Monet first got inspired to paint his famous gardens in this house.
If someone intends to rent the house, he must rent at least two nights.
Considering Airbnb's page, it is next struck after a week, on Sunday of the shopping weekend, and therefore could be ideal for some shoppers on vacation to hurry to book the painter's house.
The two nights over a shopping weekend cost not less than 964 US dollars or just over 130 thousand Icelandic crowns as the Newspaper gets next.
Dozens in quarantine and several of them beginning to show symptoms of the disease caused by the coronavirus
Five have been diagnosed with the coronavirus domestically in the last three days and most of the infected are unrelated.
Dozens are in quarantine because of this and several of them have begun to show symptoms of the disease caused by the virus.
Three people were diagnosed with the coronavirus domestically yesterday and two at border screening.
An expert at the National Medical Office says that the growing number of domestic infections does not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading beyond the community.
"It has been sorted from the previous domestic infection and it is a virus that has not been seen here before so we have no special reason to think that it has gone disguised in society for some time.
This is probably something that is new to the country, but of course we need to be very careful now," said Kamilla Sigríður Josephsdóttir, a specialist in the field of quarantine of the National Medical Service.
Most of the infected have been associated with individuals who came from abroad.
Further sampling will take place in the near future, but several, who were in communion with those infected are beginning to show symptoms of the coronavirus.
"Now influenza is not running and less about other respiratory infections so we can be fairly liberal by doing these tests on individuals who during influenza time would have found a reason to do something else first," Kamilla said.
The quarantine is mostly complete, but it is not excluded that more people need to quarantine.
Two of the infected were diagnosed after attending sporting events.
It has raised questions whether it is forbidden to hold such events.
The civil protection liaison officer says it is well possible as long as people follow the criteria and rules.
Kamilla says almost excluded that the infected have been infected at the sports tournament.
"If there are no more people in isolation from these individuals after passing them at this sports tournament, we can claim that our quarantine on the formulations has worked.
But it is not revealed," Kamilla said.
The civil protection department's work is under constant review.
"We need to be ready to intervene with further advice or restrictions if it seems warranted," Kamilla said.
After over a week, the number of restrictions will be extended to a thousand people.
This new position could affect relaxations.
"Deciding meditation to cook" - See Elisa Viðars menu
Elísa Viðarsdóttir is a football player and plays with Val.
She is also a master student in nutrition, mother, and works as a food expert.
She needs a lot of energy for the amster of the day and usually gives herself time to cook good and nutritious food.
My usual day begins with getting to work up from eight," says Elisha.
"After work, I go to the shop to be able to prepare the dinner before I get my girl to the nursery by three o'clock."
Elisa feels very nutritious to pick up her daughter early in kindergarten.
"It’s good to have time with her before I go to practice the second half.
After exercise it is good to come home and just need to warm up the food.
At night, when the girl is asleep, we like to watch one episode to empty the mind."
Elisha does not follow any particular diet.
She is laying a final hand on a master’s paper in nutrition and therefore knows well what suits her to eat to have enough energy to perform work, school, family and exercises.
"What suits me is to eat a variety of food that is well composed of proteins, carbohydrates and fats.
However, I feel the most important thing to have a healthy relationship with food and not classify food into bad or good, rather nutritious or nutritious.
It is namely okay to eat everything, just not all of a sudden and not always."
Elizabeth is very interested in cooking.
"I feel a certain meditation in standing in the kitchen cooking and getting it very much into it.
I have to say that confidence is with me in the kitchen and I sincerely believe that I am a decent chef."
Breakfast: Oats, chia seeds, hemp seeds, salt, a little lemon juice, let lie in almond milk overnight.
Top this meal so with what is available each time.
Most often it is a banana and a musli & KAFFI.
I'm a great coffee lady.
Intermediate: Incredibly uneven, but fruits or vegetables, flatcakes, pure skyr with bananas and musli, bread with toppings and so I could eat hummus with a spoon up from boxing if so appropriate.
Lunch: I often create all kinds of foody salads from what exists in the fridge, china or barley, falafelbollur, rocket, oven-baked vegetables with good dressing is a bit what I'm working with.
If the layout goes completely out of control (which happens often) then the egg machine at work has brought me pretty often to the rescue and then there are 2 slices of bread with butter, cheese and boiled egg, put no more on you.
Intermediate: Get me something carbohydrate-rich for exercises, bread with toppings, breakfast cereals or fruits.
Dinner: Fish will be very often selected in my home, otherwise some delicious vegetable dishes.
Conflict between police and protesters in Seattle
The city authorities in Seattle, Washington state have declared a rebellion situation following crowded protests in the city center.
Police seized yesterday to flare bombs and pepper sprays to tempt the pavement of a large area subdued by protesters and stretched over many blocks in the vicinity of the parliamentary building in the city.
The police announced on Twitter that at least eleven protesters had been arrested and that an investigation was over on a sabotage that was carried out at a police station in the city yesterday, possibly by some kind of bomb.
The city and police authorities say that protesters stoned police with stones, bottles, bombs and other vacant and one police officer was transferred to a hospital where his injuries were made.
The protests in Seattle were, however, peaceful long in front of.
The blow was to them to show protesters in Portland in Oregon solidarity, but there in the city has repeatedly come to a hard conflict between protesters and heavily armed forces of federal police.
There, as in more cities of the United States, people gather under the banner of Black Lives Matter, recalls Georges Floyds, who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis on May 25, protesting systematic racism in American society and demands corrective action.
Not withdrawn until after voting
It is not yet clear whether the cancellations of the Icelandair flight attendants to take effect next month will be revoked.
The electronic voting on the Icelandic Air Force collective agreement on behalf of a flight attendant at Icelandair ends at noon tomorrow.
The company’s chairman Guðlaug Líney Jóhannsdóttir claims that Icelandair will not make a decision on the redundancies until the outcome of the vote is available.
"This hangs smartly together," says Guðlaug Líney.
"There have been no redundancies withdrawn, this must go to be available so that the machines can be humanised.
So, of course, people are inexhaustible after getting to know if they will have a job after the month-end."
A contract signed a week ago, on the night of July 19.
It is expected to apply until the end of September 2025 and is based on a contract previously incorporated by flight attendants in the vote.
On 17 July, the Board of Directors and the Security Council of the Icelandic Air Force agreed to convene an all-hero job stop at Icelandair, and the members agreed to vote.
It never came to her, but this was decided following Icelandair's decision to cancel negotiations with the Air Force, terminate all its flight attendants and seek agreements with another union.
Then the company's pilots were supposed to take on the jobs of microbes on board temporarily.
Asked how she thinks the vote will go, Guðlaug Líney says it is difficult to tell.
"People are wounded after this attack by Icelandair, when all the flight attendants of the company were dismissed and announced that another union would be negotiated.
Now it turns out if it affects," she says.
940 flight attendants worked at Icelandair at the end of April, with 900 of them, about 95%, dismissed.
Their notice period is different, for those who have the shortest working life he is three months and therefore ends in the mid-July-August months.
This group includes about 90% of Icelandair's flight attendants.
What happens if the contract is not approved?
"Then we wish to continue discussions with our candidates.
With this agreement we are meeting the requirements of Icelandair.
If he is rejected, it is clear that the flight attendants are deemed to have been too far."
The vote on a collective agreement ends and Icelandair presents the settlement of the second quarter tomorrow
The flight attendant's vote for a new collective agreement ends at 12 noon tomorrow.
The Icelandair settlement for the second quarter will also be published tomorrow, but preliminary operating results indicate that the company's revenue has declined by 85 percent from the same period last year.
The electronic voting for the Icelandic Air Force and the Icelandair Labour Party's collective agreement began on Wednesday, July 22, and ends tomorrow, Monday July 27, at 12 noon.
Those who may vote for the contract are employees of Icelandair who pay membership fees to the Air Force.
Icelandair and FFÍ signed a new collective agreement on Sunday 19 July, but Friday before, Icelandair had terminated negotiations with the company after the flight attendants coalitioned the previous agreement in a vote in early July.
Icelandair had then resigned all flight attendants and flight crew members on Friday, but they were withdrawn after a new collective agreement was signed.
Under a new collective agreement, flight attendants need to fly five hours more per month for the same basic wage.
The Core Convention is valid until 2025, which has integrated the provisions of pilots and flight attendants on how long one duty may be flown.
The agreement was presented to members of FFÍ at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica hotel last Monday and described many flight attendants as news agency then discussed dissatisfaction due to the agreement.
However, most people seemed to agree that it would have to accept the agreement to keep FÍ alive.
The Icelandair settlement for the second quarter will be presented tomorrow, while the EBIT company, its operating results for capital items and taxes, is according to preliminary operating results negatively about 100 to 110 million US dollars or about 15 billion ISK.
Icelandair sent OMX ICE preliminary calculations last Wednesday, which said that the company's revenue has amounted to around $60 million in the quarter or about 8.3 billion.
Cash and its equivalent were around US$154 million at the end of the quarter, around ISK 21 billion.
Icelandair also aims to offer the company’s share capital in August.
Icelandair plans to complete agreements with fifteen creditors, the government and the Boeing aircraft manufacturer before the end of the month before the share offer will be made.
New variant rather than new type of virus
"New virus just means that this has been a person who came from abroad.
This is not something that has been grinding here in Iceland," says Már Kristjánsson, head of the National Hospital’s infectious diseases department, about the news that a "new type of virus" has been detected in Iceland.
Three domestic infections were detected yesterday and two at the border.
One who was diagnosed had been involved in the social work of a sports club at the Rey Cup football tournament, but the origin of the infection is unfounded and the infection is ongoing.
An infection was also detected in a person who arrived in the country on July 15 and two people who were in communion with him started showing symptoms of COVID-19.
The infection was then detected yesterday related to the infection reported on the previous day and after sequencing in Icelandic genetic analysis, "a new type of virus that has not been detected here before."
The infection is complete in relation to that infection.
Már states that there is no new virus but this is the same virus that has spread worldwide, i.e. the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
It is more correct to talk about a new variant of that virus than about a new type of virus.
Asked what it means and whether it could say something about the second wave of an epidemic being started, Már says that as is a single case, and it could go so that there will be nothing more from it.
"But, however, if there are cases in Iceland that do not have links from abroad and have the same genotype as this particular variant, then that conclusion could be drawn [about the second wave] but it is premature at present," explains Már.
The happiness in the hot tub
Is the secret that the happiness of Icelanders hidden in the hot tubs?
The BBC programmers lead to the odds in a fun video highlighting the country’s swimming pool and hot tub culture.
The Icelandic bath culture is special globally and it is claimed that nowhere in the world there are as many bathing sites per resident.
The natural earthquake is its foundation, but also the tradition of swimming practice that prevails here.
Children's swimming lessons were mandatory in 1940, but older citizens are no less efficient to take advantage of the hot water for health benefits.
Swimming is described as a fixed part of the general well-being of the country.
In the pot, everyone is equal, regardless of the class and position.
Available on mobile phones, people talk in personal terms about home and space or enjoy the likeable power of the water: meditates and loads batteries of soul and body.
On the steepest to attend a hundred days in elections
A hundred days are until Americans go to elections and choose a president for four years.
Donald Trump seeks re-election, but he has the steepest to attend.
Joe Biden, the prospective candidate of the Democrat Party, has a huge advantage over Trump nationally, taking note of the polls.
According to a new survey by the AP news agency, the record number of Americans believes that the nation is on the wrong path.
Trump's response due to the pandemic of the new coronavirus is likewise very unpopular and in addition, more Americans than before believe that the president has kept ill on economic issues.
Specifically, only two out of ten Americans say the United States is on track.
32 percent claim to support Trump's response due to the epidemic and 48 percent say he has held well on economic issues.
In March, it was a rate of 56 percent and in January it was 67 percent.
According to FiveThirtyEight's average, Biden's follow-up is 49.9 percent nationally while following Trump 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has tried to shift his attention from his performance towards the pandemic to Biden, pushing for so-called cultural disputes and proclaiming policies that are to turn to law and order.
Biden's candidacy, however, makes a huge effort to keep Trump's attention and count the high probability of carrying victory out of the bets if the election really revolves around how Trump has stood in the job in the last four years.
Trump's unpopularity also seems to plan to bring down the Republican Party's senators and fear the Progressives that Democrats could even reach a majority on the U.S. Senate, which so far has although very heap.
Politico said in the days that the remaining follow-up of the party and candidate comparable to that of now, the Republican Party would get its greatest detox for decades.
The suburb has proved to be particularly bad in the 2016 parliamentary elections and now it looks like that development will continue.
Trump has in recent days tried to scare the residents of the suburbs to follow themselves, among other things by saying that if Biden becomes president, he will devastate the suburbs of the United States and push for racism.
Among other things, Trump has waived regulation since Barack Obama's time in the White House designed to diversify the suburbs.
Then he urged "housewives" of the U.S. suburb to read an article by former New York Deputy Secretary of State, in which she claimed that Biden would destroy the suburban United States and took Trump under it.
"Biden will ruin your neighborhoods and the American dream.
I will preserve it, and even make it even better!" the president said.
The population of the suburban United States is an increasingly expanding group of voters.
According to NPR, they are about half of all voters in the United States.
Ever since George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the candidate who has received the majority of the votes of this group has become president.
Except in 2012 when Mitt Romney received a majority of votes from this group but lost to Barack Obama.
Surveys have shown that although Trump secured a minimal majority in the suburbs of 2016, his follow-up there has attracted significantly.
Although it differs between surveys, Biden has recommended about fifteen percentage points of advantage over Trump in the outskirts recently.
Regis Philbin is dead
American television presenter Regis Philbin is dead, 88 years old.
Philbin worked as an actor, director, presenter and singer for about six decades.
He is best known for directing the popular Live chat show! with Regis from 1988 to 2011 along with Kathie Lee Gifford and later Kelly Ripa.
He has then directed factors such as Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and America's Got Talent.
According to Guinness World Records, Philbin is the person who has been most of the hours on American television and has been recognized to that effect.

A number of colleagues, friends and fans have remembered him on social media the last day.
Will the Olympic fire be the light at the end of the tunnel?
After a final decision had been taken to postpone the Olympic Games, events that only world wars have hailed until now, the president of the International Olympic Committee said that the famous Olympic fire would be "the light at the end of the tunnel," and referred there presumably to the pandemic of the coronavirus that the world now passes through together.
The achievements have a year in addition to prepare themselves and the authorities of Japan compensate for the costs of the delay.
Everyone, however, keeps heads end a lot at stake.
When it was announced that Tokyo in Japan would become the venue of the Olympics this year, the cheers of the Japanese representatives were genuine.
They cried and laughed alternately, as Tokyo had applied to keep the games 2016 but bent it to a lower hold for Rio in Brazil.
This time Tokyo City and Japan should bathe in the attention of the world.
The games were scheduled to take place on 24 July to 9 August, but have been postponed for a year and start instead of 23 July 2021 and end on 8 August.
If the games fail to be held then, if the coronavirus still becomes too much threat, the games will be stopped.
No one wants to think that thought to the end.
Olympics are no ordinary sports competition.
Nothing is saved, the show should always be magnificent and strive to top the last play.
The choice of city for Olympics is based on the evaluation of the selection committee on the promotions of the cities.
The more magnificent the presentation is - the greater the chance of getting snooped.
Tokyo spent $150 million trying to get hold of the 2016 Olympics or amounting to roughly $20 billion.
The second time, when applying for the 2020 Games, $75 million, about ten billion, was put into the presentation.
In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo received the plays this year, the Japanese authorities had thus already spent an amount of 30 billion ISK to the project.
But that amount is, however, just a drop in the sea compared to what it costs to build Olympic villages, stadiums and generally to strengthen the country's infrastructure to recruit such tournaments, prepare it and keep the games themselves.
Organizers in Japan have said that the Tokyo Olympics, which should have been running these days but has been postponed by one year due to the coronavirus, would have cost $12.6 billion.
However, a report from a state auditor in Japan published at the end of last year stated that the cost was closer to double that figure.
The cost of suspending the games will likely not be fully estimated, but it has been estimated that it can cost between two and six billion dollars in addition to the initial cost.
The total cost for the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could therefore run between $15 and $30 billion.
There are so high numbers that all the tax revenues of the Icelandic state only settled for about nearly half the Olympics, based on the lowest possible cost.
Olympics are an event of the magnitude that they have often become a topic of the economists, who try to review the numbers and examine the benefits and benefits of the games.
In the shortest case, pretty many people seem to have concluded that the impact of the Olympics is less than so positive for the economy of the cities that hold them.
Short-term effects are some, for example, the number of jobs increases very much in the short term, but in the long term cities often sit up with debt halves and the threat-high operating costs of small used structures.
Rio in Brazil sits up with significant debts due to the 2016 games and has been having trouble costing maintenance on all the big sports facilities built for the games.
The figures have been recorded after the London 2012 Games, but it has been revealed that only 10 percent of those who received employment related to the Olympic Games in the city were unemployed before.
This means that there were no new jobs except to a small extent.
In general, cities have not come particularly well out of the financial holding of Olympics because of the slacking costs associated with the power plants built for the actors.
However, the benefits are often considered to consist of increased traffic of tourists who want to visit the Olympic cities following the Games, which, however, is a major uncertainty regarding the 2021 Games.
It is also uncertain whether all the number of viewers usually attending the games will be accepted.
The main issue is, however, the honor that the cities must be chosen, but it is difficult to value for money.
Therefore, despite the huge cost, it can also be said that the joy that the games bring is not of the nature that it can be placed on a price tag.
But although the exhibition is often magnificent and nowhere to be saved, this is of course not just about money.
There are the sports heroes that are in the foreground.
For some achievement people, it is surprisingly just welcome to postpone the games.
The Australian five-player and gold medalist in his article on the site of the Olympic Games, Chloe Esposito, is, for example, a cosmopolitan and would have been removed from good oldness this summer but does not expect to be in the competition form for the 2021 Games.
She is therefore among those athletes who are just rather happy with the postponement, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who planned to retire after the games this year, they would have been held on time, meaning the postponement of the games in some cases that they cancel competition before the games take place.
Trust their body simply not in order to go through more years of rigorous exercises.
Few athletes were equally well placed in the hearts of the audience at the 2016 Olympics and the fiction star Simone Biles.
She came home with four gold around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has attended several interviews in his home country US lately to discuss the Olympics.
She plans to play 2021, but she is not necessarily sure she can still be on top of the games next year, as she will be 24 years old.
Although it is generally not considered a high age, it is higher for a fictional woman in the front row.
"This is a sensitive issue," says Biles, but smiles out in another interview published on the Olympic Committee's Instagram page asking if she intends to achieve as long as she did in Rio 2016.
"I honestly do not know if I will still be on top after a whole year in addition of exercises," says Biles.
She has previously spoken that her body does not tolerate the stress that follows gymnastic training much longer.
Nevertheless, she practices off the race for the Olympics 2021.
Biles admits that there has been an unpleasant feeling of having to stop suddenly exercising when the pandemic lasted as high as the gymnasium was closed.
There were no exemptions for Biles rather than others while all sports facilities were closed for seven weeks.
All her Olympics could not buy any access beyond the others, she had to find various ways to keep herself in shape like others.
The basic form certainly a little better than in most people.
"We have a rigid plan now.
It was difficult to start exercising first again after the gymnasium opened.
We started slowly but are on full slip again and I will increase the exercises steadily as the year goes on.
We of course do not know quite how these games will be or whether they will be held but we still practice considering that they will be, can not otherwise.
I have put too much on myself to leave the sport now," says Biles.
With it like more, doubts or perhaps rather conscious that the situation may arise that the games will not be held at all in 2021 either.
However, predicting it is hopeless.
No one can know how the situation of the coronavirus pandemic will be in July 2021 and nothing else to do than prepare for the Olympics considering they will be held that year.
Perhaps the Olympic fire will be the light at the end of the Covid corridors.
Suspension of wedding due to epidemic
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding due to the coronavirus.
She was supposed to marry former Bachelorette competitor Wells Adams now this summer.
"I think there are other more important things to think about right now," the actress said in a conversation with People.
"We want to get married sometime and have the dream wedding and have all the attendants who are dear to us.
But we decided to enter it on a deadline and focus on what is important just now and it is helping to share information about the importance of wearing masks and keeping themselves at home.
I look more at world affairs than wedding issues these days.
There are many things going on and we should focus our attention on what is happening in the world."
