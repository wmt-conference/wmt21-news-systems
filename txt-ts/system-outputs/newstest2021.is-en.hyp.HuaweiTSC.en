Cried out to the world
The marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland is considered to have started well and shouts and calls in the wild have begun to attract people all over the world.
"You own the collision, I need Iceland," says a woman in the big world in comments on an advertisement from the marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland on the content provider YouTube.
Another viewer says she will preserve Iceland in her heart for all eternity and a young woman says she has to get to Iceland as soon as possible, as her fiance lives there.
However, to all unhappiness, she is in the United States and therefore expects to have to wait a few more months.
Another viewer asks if the hiking trail to Iceland is suitable, because there are no aircraft.
It doesn't follow the story of whether he comes from a different time zone.
Egill Thórðarson of the advertising agency Peel, who was involved in the preparation of the advertisements together with the international advertising agency M&amp;C Saatchi, says the reception was hoped for above.
"I came across many Inspired By Iceland campaigns that have been very successful but this new campaign is already hitting a record.
Basically, it's about creating PR values, that's getting foreign media to cover the campaign, and it's been incredibly successful.
In a relatively short time, we have received coverage in about seven hundred media around the world, totalling over two billion people.
The value of this consideration is priced at ISK 1.8 billion.
It's not uncomfortable."
The main market is usually the United States and the campaign has been very successful there, although Americans are not on their way to the country soon.
According to Egil, well-known market areas such as Denmark, Britain and Germany have also been welcomed, like Russia, which is comfortably surprising.
In addition, there was a response from exotic areas, such as India, which was not specifically proposed.
"These ads have travelled elsewhere than we expected," says Egill, but it can be noted that over four million people have watched the content on YouTube.
"We couldn't have wished for a better start."
The photos here at the opening, Morgunblaðið photographer Árni Sæberg, filmed advertisements entitled "Let It Out" in the middle of last month.
The filming took place far and wide, such as at Skólavörðustígur in Reykjavik, Reynisfjöra, at Skógarfoss, on Sólheimajokull and in a cave at Hjorleifshöfði.
The directors were Samúel Bjarki Pétursson and Gunnar Páll Ólafsson with Scott productions and filmmaker Óttar Guðnason.
In the aforementioned roles were the Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, who is from Cuba and Hungary.
Dozens of Icelanders came to the advertising, but at the same time as recordings took place in South Iceland, there was another group in the West and Westfjords.
According to Egil, "Let It Out" is only the first part of the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, with the aim of a winter campaign in collaboration with M&amp;C Saatchi.
"This is just the first phase in this work for the Icelandic office," says Egill, adding that the cooperation with M&amp;C Saatchi has gone very well.
"It's great to work with them.
In projects like this, it's important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the markets we're talking to."
Sprengisandur: Discuss the situation in the labour market, pension funds and much more
The Minister of Social Affairs and Children, Ásmundur Einar Daðason, will be in Sprengisandur, which starts at ten o'clock at Bylgja today.
He is also Minister of Labour and discusses the situation in the labour market as such, the Icelandair case and other issues.
He also discusses rural issues and the transfer of jobs to a country that has gone bad and been controversial in recent years and decades.
Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, Chairman of the Board of Directors, will also be on the show, discussing his criticism regarding investments by pension funds and proposing ideas for the labor movement and employers to withdraw from the boards of the funds to reduce the risk of conflicts of interest.
Ívar Ingimarsson, tourism manager in East Iceland, and Árnheiði Jóhannsdóttir, Managing Director of the Nordic Marketing Office, will be discussed about the situation in rural tourism.
They will look ahead to the autumn wondering whether the success of the summer is a misleading omen of what is to come.
You can listen to the show below, which starts at ten o'clock.
This is what she looks like today 25 years later
Actress Elisa Donovan had a successful career in all kinds of teen shows.
However, she gained world fame for her role as Amber in the film Clueless 25 years ago.
She also appeared in Sabrina: The Teenage Witch with Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury and Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49, married with one child.
Little has happened to her recently, but she managed to look across the road and comment on Clueless on Australian television recently.
She talks beautifully about Brittany Murphy, who died unexpectedly in 2009 and says she was a great person.
"I have to admit that I based the character mostly on girls I met in school who were not good to me.
As soon as I read the script, I knew who this character was," Donovan said of his role in Clueless.
Didn't want to leave the police station after overnight accommodation
About fifty cases came on board the police in the Reykjavik area today and the police's diary says that the cases were varied.
The day at the police station on Hverfisgata began with the police having to interfere with a man who had been recently released from a prison cell after staying there due to drunk driving.
The man did not want to go away after his release and did not obey the orders of the police who told him to leave.
The man earned himself an ongoing stay at the police station because of his progress.
In the morning, a man was arrested suspected of burglary of a company in Kópavogur.
Police also had to interfere with two men in Breiðholt due to reports of assault.
It also happened that a woman who was eating at a shopping center in Kópavogur could not pay for the bill after a meal and was therefore called to the police.
The theft of a car was also reported in the city center this morning.
The driver of a white Renault van looked at her for a while and was then taken with a non-free hand.
The car has not been found.
The curse of the party - the terrible fate of the Gleestars
Actress Naya Rivera drowned in California recently, becoming the third leading actor in the series to die long in advance.
The series about the Glee is a popular series about singing, dancing and joy.
The series dealt with the so-called party of high school teenagers, their love and fate.
It wasn't always taken out with the sweetness of being in the party, but through singing and dancing, the characters of the show seemed to overcome the circumstances that arose in their lives.
But outside the set, there have been severe disasters over the actors and staff of the show, so much so that there has been a theory that curse rests on the show.
Naya Marie Rivera played the role of Santana Lopez on the show, a cheerleader who didn't call all her grandmother.
After the season had ended, Rivera married actor Ryan Dorsey and had his first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and subsequently divorced.
Dorsey, however, declined to file a complaint and the domestic violence case was dropped.
On July 8, it was reported that Riveru was missing after her four-year-old son was found drifting alone in a boat on Lake Piru, California.
The boy was found sleeping in a life jacket on board the boat and was able to tell police that he and his mother had stabbed themselves to swim, and Rivera had got him back into the boat but never returned there herself.
An extensive search for Rivera began.
The day after the search began, the local police chief reported that we were expected to have drowned Rivera.
Five days later, Rivera was found and was officially pronounced dead.
She is believed to have encountered a heavy current in the water and used her last claim to save the son.
The cause of death was recorded accidentally intoxicated.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith played the role of Finn Hudson on the show, the American football player with the angel voice who played a key role in bringing the party to the road and respect.
Outside the series, however, Moneith struggled with personal demons.
From the age of 13, he had struggled with addiction and proved difficult to escape.
In 2013, his colleagues thought the show was enough, intervened and encouraged him to seek help.
Moneith then underwent treatment and seemed to be looking for a better hand.
Just two months after completing his treatment, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after going out to party with friends.
Banamein was found to be a fatal combination of drugs and alcohol.
It was not believed that there was a will.
Moneith had undergone treatment and his stamina for intoxicants had decreased so much that a dose he had previously endured was fatal.
He was only 31 when he died.
His death was heavily affected by his colleagues, but at the behest of his tournament actress, Lea Michele, it was decided to continue the shooting of the series and they devoted a whole part to the memory of Moneith and his character Finn.
Mark Wayne Salling played Noah "Puck" Puckerman on the show, Puck was an American football player, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellow party members, or until he gained the courage to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his Los Angeles home, a child pornography suspect.
During a house search at his home, an enormous amount of child pornography was found and the case was soon asked out in public.
It was clear that Salling had been done.
He was subsequently charged and convicted of his offences.
He had a sentence of four to seven years in prison and would have to be on the register of sex offenders and seek treatment for child protection.
Before the judge determined the punishment, Salling, who was then released on bail, was found dead near his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
It wasn't just the actors of the show who fell from a long time ago.
Jim Fuller was the show's assistant director.
He died suddenly in his sleep in 2013, at the age of 41.
A woman named Nancy Motes also worked on the show.
She was the younger sister of superstar Julia Roberts and didn't bore her sister the beautiful story, but she accused Roberts of extreme governance and disrespectful behaviour.
Motes took her own life in 2014 but she suffered from severe depression.
She left behind a letter to her fiance in which she said her mother and sister were, among other things, responsible for how she was arranged.
"My mother and my so-called siblings get nothing after me except the memory that it was the ones that caused my worst depression."
Lea Michel was the star of the series.
She has recently been accused of bullying and aggression her co-stars on set and wearing overwhelming star seats.
Jesse Luken made a guest appearance on the show in 2012.
He was arrested and charged with drunk driving in 2019, which was considered a major scandal.
Actress Heather Morris played a major role in the series.
In 2010, she suffered from unscrupulous computer criminals getting into nude photos of her and publishing on the Internet.
Actors Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both starred on the show and had an affair outside the series.
Benoist later reported that Jenner violated her in the relationship.
You can put flowers on almost everything
It increases the development of children when they are allowed to play in the garden with their parents to grow flowers and be allowed to watch them grow and thrive.
It can also be done endlessly with flowers, as Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Just having a time with the children in the park is something that will never be forgotten.
They will remember the flowers, the fragrance and, of course, the precious time they had with their parents.
Bought himself a boat in tenth grade
"I don't think we're many fishermen working in kindergartens in Iceland," says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, who works coastal fishing during the summer but studies psychology at the University of Iceland during the winter."
Coastal fishing is a very convenient summer job when you are studying.
If you fish well, you can have a good income and I think it's great to be able to not take student loans.
The income is also enough for me into the winter," says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, a 25-year-old psychology student, who is engaged in coastal fishing this summer, as in previous summers.
Axel had just arrived at a dock in Tálknafjörður when a journalist caught up with him late in the evening at the beginning of the week."
"The net I was in tenth grade I took command rights for boats that are under twelve meters long and I bought my boat the summer after I finished elementary school.
I have practiced coastal fishing in my boat all summers since.
I bought the boat used by my acquaintance, Hartmann Jónsson, and I named the boat his name.
Hartmann had grown up when I bought the boat and stopped being at sea and he was very satisfied when he saw the boat bearing his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took over the boat," says Axel, adding that he bought the boat for three million.
"I made a deal with Hartmann to pay half, a million and a half, at the beginning of the summer and the other half at the end of the summer when I was done fishing.
So I had the boat debt-free at the end of my first summer on it."
But how could a boy have a million and a half to pay out in a boat when he had just finished elementary school?
"I had laid up and collected money, I had been working with my dad at sea when I was a boy, I was fishing with him all summers and got my share.
I also put my confirmation money into my boat fund."
Axel was born in Ísafjörður, where all his mother is, but he has lived in Kópavogur since he was a boy.
"I can fish here in the west because I have a legal domicile with my grandmother in Ísafjörður.
I studied these areas in the west from rowing with my dad.
I move between the fjords depending on how I feel, because this fishing area covers the whole of the Westfjords.
Although I think it's best to be in the west, I have also fished around the Snæfellsnes peninsula and elsewhere.
I've also fished in the south, preferably grayling," says Axel, who always rows one early in the morning and says he sometimes talks to seagulls and sings in the sky, in solitude for hours in the ocean.
"The internet connection at sea is good, so I can call, listen to podcasts and music.
I don't think it's a big deal to be alone in a boat.
Of course, I try to avoid getting into danger, but certainly there has been something wrong with the weather occasionally, but never a great danger," says Axel, who is lucky with the fact that he is never seasick.
He says the length of the working day depends on how the hunting goes.
"In coastal fishing, I'm never more than 14 hours fishing at a time, but I've also been fishing in other systems, for example in the rental quota, when I've been grazing at sea continuously for 24 and a half hours."
He says the arrangements for coastal fishing are such that he can catch 770 kilograms a day, which he finds inhibitory.
"Other restrictions are that I am not allowed to fish Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and I am only allowed to fish twelve days a month, during the four months of coastal fishing, in May, June, July and August.
In my opinion, fishermen should choose their fishing days depending on the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is on people to calm instead of having 48 days throughout the summer and can choose according to their own preference.
In addition, the regional shift could also go because of me and seafood spaces that are well located by the fishing grounds should be allowed to enjoy it," says Axel, who mainly draws cod from salty sea during his coastal fishing, but also only ufsa and occasional other species float with.
Axel works during the winter with his university studies at the nursery Núpi in Kópavogur.
"I don't think we're many sailors working in kindergartens in the country," Axel says proudly, adding that he only intended to work temporarily in the nursery.
"I got stuck there because I think this is a great job.
I hope that the psychology program will be useful to me at the preschool level in the future," says Axel, who has also come a long way to study business administration.
An error in the registration prevented a homecoming contagion
An error in the registration form that people fill out when they come to the country caused a person, resident in this country, to not be called back for sampling.
It is not a requirement to register a personal identification number if the person fills out the form in English, as is when it is done in Icelandic.
"This will be examined this week," says an expert at the National Physician's Disease Prevention Department.
Three domestic infections were diagnosed at the virology department of the National Hospital yesterday.
One of those who tested positive came to the country on 15 July, two days after so-called homecare rules came into force.
Those who were resident in Iceland are then screened on arrival in Iceland and again called for sampling four to five days later.
In RÚV's lunch news, it was pointed out that the person in question, however, had followed the old system.
The border sampling was negative and he was not called back for screening for the virus.
Kamilla Rut Sigfúsdóttir, an expert at the National Physician's Disease Prevention Department, says in a conversation with the news agency that this can be attributed to an error in the electronic registration form.
If people fill out the registration form in English, it is not a requirement to enter a personal identification number as in the Icelandic version.
Because it was primarily intended for foreign tourists.
Therefore, the person concerned has not received an automatic invitation to come for sampling.
Kamilla says many people have followed the rules on the return portal even though they have filled the registration form in English and in some cases employers have also been vigilant about sending people back for sampling after they came to the country.
"This week, we will look at how to make it easier for people to access this to raise awareness of the process."
The man is in isolation and six have been quarantined.
They all go for sampling but two had begun to show symptoms.
Smitrakning is now underway with the three infections diagnosed yesterday, mostly completed due to two infections reported on Friday.
In both cases, a sequential analysis of the Icelandic genetic analysis has revealed that it contains variants of the coronavirus that have not been found here before.
In the second case, the ties have been directed at Israel, although it is known that the person who brought the virus to the country had also travelled to other European countries.
Kamilla says it should be clear tomorrow where the other virus was coming from.
A total of 15 are now in isolation according to the web COVID. is.
135 are in quarantine.
Four out of five infections unrelated
Five domestic infections have been diagnosed in Iceland in recent days.
Of these, four are entirely unconnected and, for example, the origin of the infection that occurred at the Rey Cup sports tournament yesterday has not been found.
Smitrakning is still ongoing.
Originally, over three dozen were uniquely sent to quarantine, but they were reduced to sixteen.
A total of 34 are in quarantine for these new infections diagnosed yesterday.
This is the second time in a short time that infection is diagnosed at sporting events and has raised questions about whether to hold such events.
Jóhann K. Jóhannsson, Communications Director at the Federal Commissioner for Civil Protection, says it's possible as long as people follow criteria and rules.
"We are constantly urgent for all those who live here that individual infectious agents need to be maintained.
We also need to be urgent for people who are holding events that there are certain rules in place that need to be followed.
Then you can hold events," says Johann.
He says infection can be prevented by holding up individual infectious agents.
In addition, rules and criteria are under constant review.
"What needs to be done, and what the Department of Civil Protection and the Directorate of Health are constantly urgent for people, is to consider these individual infectious agents.
Both at home and also at service companies.
That people wash their hands and use alcohol.
This prevents infection from continuing," says Johann.
"We need to be urgent for people to continue on the good journey we were on in order to be able to sustain the results we have achieved so far."
40% of COVID-19 victims had diabetes 2
Devon Brumfield heard on the phone how difficult it was for her father to catch his breath.
Her father had diabetes, so she encouraged him to seek medical help.
The next day, he was dead.
The death was attributed to sudden difficulty breathing due to coronavirus infection.
Diabetes was identified on the death certificate as an underlying problem and Brumfield, who also has diabetes, is terrified that the same will happen.
Reuters news agency says Brumfield's fear is not unfounded.
Figures from a new study conducted by US authorities show that almost 40% of those who are dead with diabetes 2 were as an underlying disease.
When the percentage of those who had not reached the age of 65, the percentage rises to half.
A study by the US Centers for Disease Prevention (CDC) included more than 10,000 people in 15 states who died from the coronavirus between February and May.
Jonathan Wortham, an infectious disease expert at the CDC, says the results are striking, not least for those who have been diagnosed with diabetes 2 and their loved ones.
Was hidden in slow growth Reuters conducted a survey and the responses from the 12 states that responded to comparable proportions.
10 states, including California, Arizona and Colombia, have not yet reported underlying diseases.
"Diabetes was already a slow-growing epidemic.
Now, COVID-19 has broken through like a powerful century," according to Reuters, Elbert Huang, CEO of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at Chicag University.
Diabetes is more common among black people and people of South American origin, who have also been worse out of the coronavirus.
One of the best defences for those with diabetes 2 is to keep the disease under control through physical fitness, a healthy diet and the help of healthcare professionals.
However, the coronavirus pandemic has made it difficult for many to maintain a routine.
In addition, the high price of insulin has forced some to continue to work, thereby risking exposure to the virus.
Reuters points out that US authorities could be aware of the risk that those with diabetes 2 could be caused by the virus.
When the SARS coronavirus passed in 2003, more than 20% of them had the disease and during the swine flu pandemic in 2009, this group had a three times higher risk of having to be hospitalized.
When MERS manifested itself in 2012, one study showed that 60% of those who died or were admitted to intensive care had diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, researcher at Yale University, says that because the impact of the COVID-19 virus could be longer, the epidemic has removed the cover of a number of previously unknown complications.
"I'm afraid we'll see a tsunami of problems when this is over," says Andrew Bolton, chairman of the International Diabetic Association.
Doctors have warned the coronavirus pandemic may indirectly lead to an increase in diabetes-related complications, including kidney disease and kidney dialysis.
Similarly, new studies direct that the coronavirus may lead to an increase in diabetes cases.
According to Reuters, scientists are trying to understand the relationship between the coronavirus and diabetes 2.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs and kidneys, organs that are already sick in many people with diabetes.
In addition, a high percentage of glucose and lipid in diabetics can induce a true "cell catheter," as it is called when the immune system reacts too harshly and attacks the body.
Damaged intestinal cells can also lead to inflammation, which in turn can cause a deadly blood clot.
"It's all one big jigsaw puzzle," says Dela Cruz.
"It's all connected to each other."
The news has been corrected.
"We were offered champagne, then they left the room"
The couple Ásrún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason received the unusual request from the artist Ragnar Kjartansson to have sex in front of a camera for a work the artist was staging in Paris.
"We loved each other, so it wasn't complicated."
Atli Bollason never forgets that when he met his wife and childmother, Ásrún Magnúsdóttir, for the first time.
"I became very fascinated by her.
Of course, it was just the radiation, but I also thought it was completely unheard of cute.
And it still seems," he says.
Ásrún also remembers this, as the husband regularly recalls the first meeting.
"I'm always hearing this story.
Last just this weekend," says she, who was also attracted to the husband at first encounter.
"I felt and felt so much excitement around Atli, which I like.
There's a lot going on and a lot going on and I was fascinated by it."
Atli says the couple have emphasized in their relationship to go their own ways.
"We don't tie our bales to the same knots as fellow travellers.
We avoid routines that we distinguish around us."
That's probably why they just welcomed the message from artist Ragnar Kjartansson, although that was, to say the least, unusual.
"Christine Anna, our mutual friend, contacts us and asks if we can come to eat desert with her, Ragga and Ragnar's wife Ingibjörg, on Snaps."
They accepted the invitation, met the trio on Snaps and had desert wine and each dessert.
They listened to Ragnar, who led them through his plans for an art exhibition, which he intended to set up in the Palais de Tokyo in Paris in the autumn.
"He had a multitude of video works called Scenes from western culture.
He described it in a simple way."
Ásrún says that he described the work as banal and decadent scenes from the everyday life of Westerners.
"He had sketches of all the scenes he was going to shoot and last time he told us what he wanted to know if we were interested in taking part in."
Senan, in which Ragnar asked the pair to join, was supposed to show young middle-class couples making love in a minimalist room.
"These are intercourse with beginning and end," says Atli.
The couple didn't know much about Ragnar even though they knew about him and him about them "but they knew us and thought we fit into this.
They had said that they did not want to advertise for people.
Perhaps they believed that they would not get the right people, but people who would get sexual masturbation from performing for others."
They said goodbye to Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it didn't take long.
"When we walked off Snaps, we said: Aren't we just ready for this?
It was just like that.
I trust Ragnar as an artist and his whole team," says Ásrún and Atli agrees.
"It's about love and intimacy"
Senan was filmed in a fancy apartment on Mýrargata.
There was a very small film team there; the cameraman, Ragnar and the musician and the couple.
After the recording had been turned on, everyone left the room to wait in the car except Atli and Ásrún.
"We hadn't decided anything how we should be.
We got some little instructions but we tried to forget the moment and place.
To be unconscious of what we were doing and for whom.
There was nothing played, we just loved each other, so it wasn't complicated," says Ásrún.
But was that romantic?
"Yes, it was a little romantic," says Atli and Ásrún agrees.
"We were offered champagne before they left the room.
It was a little like being on vacation in a fancy hotel in Paris."
The team was pleased with the pair's performance in the work that moved them.
"When Tommi cameraman watched this, he cried, he thought it was so beautiful," says Atli.
"It's as much about love and intimacy as the intercourse itself," says Ásrún.
The pair's parents have seen the work and tells Atli that his mother heard the voice in the son at the Reykjavík Art Museum and then realised that he was part of the work.
"Then she turns around and starts thinking about this," says Atli.
"Mom and Dad saw this in Paris.
We hadn't told anyone that way, but then my dad just texted me and said: "It's nice to bump into the little family in the Palais de Tokyo," Ásrún recalls.
And do you think participation in the work has deepened Ásrún's and Atli's relationship?
"At least we're still together, so maybe it deepened somewhat.
At least this deepened my relationship with the family-in-law," says Ásrún and laughs.
Ásrún herself saw the work in Copenhagen with her colleague.
"I found it a little difficult not to be with you but someone else," she says, turning to the husband.
"But it was nice to see it because it's only one scene in a much bigger work and when you saw it with the other works, it's very cool.
I could break away from this a little bit and was just proud.
And there was the little bean in my stomach," says Ásrún, who was pregnant by the couple's second child when the scene was filmed.
"It was just beautiful."
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke to Ásrún and Atli in Ástarsög on Rás 1.
Swansea with victory in previous semi-final
Swansea won a dramatic 1-0 victory over Brentford.
This was the first game of the teams in the semi-finals of the round to qualify for the Premier League.
The match took place at Swansea's home ground in Wales.
The score at half-time was 0–0.
Locals in Swansea received a penalty in the 64th minute, but Andre Ayew failed the bow list from the point of battle and was defended.
Just two minutes later, Brentford player Rico Henry received the red card.
Brentford therefore played the rest of the game fewer and in the 82nd minute Swansea players took advantage of the team difference.
Andre Ayew then improved the penalty by scoring a great goal and securing a 1–0 victory for Swansea.
Swansea will lead 1–0 in the match, with the second match taking place next Wednesday at Brentford's home ground.
No ambassador for five years since 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the US ambassador to Iceland, is in the spotlight of the media after CBS reported this morning that he wanted an armed bodyguard as he feared for his life.
However, it has not gone without end for the President of the United States to appoint an ambassador to Iceland.
Since the resignation of U.S. Ambassador Carol Van Voorst at the end of April 2009, the country has been without ambassador for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst retired from office under strange circumstances, but Kastljós reported in 2009 that she should have received the Falcon Medal.
On her way to a farewell meeting with the President of Iceland, she received a call from the Oval Office to the effect that she would not be honoured with the word.
After her disappearance from Iceland, she taught international relations at Army War College.
Sixteen months passed until Van Voorst's successor came to work, in September 2010.
It can be attributed to the fact that Robert S. Connan had been appointed as ambassador but then resigned.
Loius Ariega had then worked in the Foreign Service for decades.
He then retired in the autumn of 2013 and took office as ambassador to Guatemala.
Then took over another ambassador-free period.
Robert Barber was approved by the U.S. Congress in January 2015 and came to work shortly after, when there had been no ambassador on site for 13 months.
Barber was politically appointed and not a diplomat, but had worked as an attorney and supported Barack Obama's electoral fund.
He retired as soon as Donald Trump took over the presidency on January 20, 2017, as is customary with a politically appointed ambassador.
The Trump administration took an unusually long time to appoint both ambassador and high-ranking officials in the political system in Washington.
Therefore, two years passed until the U.S. Congress called Jeffrey Ross Gunter to its meeting to ask him questions and confirm afterwards as ambassador to Iceland.
In his testimony in parliament, he said he had never come to Iceland but often to Western Europe, but his wife, who has died, had been broken by Dutch rock.
Gunter is politically appointed, was formerly a dermatologist in California and has been a prominent member of the Republican Jewish Coalition.
Casino owner Sheldon Adelson founded that organization, while Adelson is a keen supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to work in Iceland in May 2019, when there had been no ambassador in the country since early 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest example of in Iceland.
The reason is both how long Trump's administration was appointing people to a key office as well as that in recent years, the work of the U.S. Congress has slowed considerably, including confirming an ambassador to office.
Since 2009, the total has been without ambassador in Iceland for over five years.
However, this has not prevented the construction of the Embassy, which recently opened its headquarters at the Enggaig.
The construction is estimated to have cost around 6.5 billion, while clump-thick security walls surround the building and bullet-proof glass is in all windows.
However, it does not seem to have enough to fill the current ambassador's sense of security because he is said to be afraid for his life and has requested an armed bodyguard.
Former ÍBV player suffered racism in Iceland - "It was a mistake to come to Iceland"
Former ÍBV player Tonny Maveyye says he suffered racism when he was in Iceland and that he regrets coming to Iceland.
This is stated in an interview with Tonny, who appears on the Ugandan medium Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined Uganda Police FC, which plays in the top division of Uganda.
In the interview with the Daily Monitor, Tonny talks about many things, including his time in Iceland, playing with ÍBV, Valur and Þróti in Iceland.
"When I came to Iceland, I didn't play in the middle as I used to play.
The team's captain was in that position, but he also had the jersey number I wanted, so I didn't get what I wanted," says Tonny, who played on the right flank of the season with ÍBV.
Tonny talks about racism he suffered in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players suffer when they play in Europe.
"It happened to me once, but since I didn't understand the language, I just ignored what was said to me.
Later, I heard about the case and then I asked my friend what the matter was about.
He then told me that my opponent made racial comments about me after I tackled him."
In 2014, Tonny left Iceland to Norway where he joined Haugesund.
There, he says he made the mistakes he most regrets.
Tonny had not managed to join Haugesund's starting team, but he wanted to play more to qualify for the national team.
He then asked to go back to Iceland on loan, but he then joined Valur.
"It was a mistake to come back to Iceland on loan.
I think if I had been in Norway longer, I would have had the opportunity I wanted," says Tonny, but he hoped that if he played well in Norway, he would probably go further.
He wants to mean that the loan to Iceland has destroyed his dreams of joining a major team in Europe.
Found a worm in a woman's neck
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8-cm-long black worm in the tonsil of a woman who searched there.
Doctors managed to pull the worm out with tweezers.
An investigation revealed that there was a parasite.
CNN reports this.
The woman had eaten sashimi, which are thin slices of meat, a few days before.
The woman quickly recovered after the worm was removed, but parasites such as this are often in raw meat or fish.
After sushi spread to the fore in the West, the number of cases where parasites have spread to people has increased, CNN said.
Fear that another wave is about to begin in Europe
Spain is now the focus of concerns over a second wave of the coronavirus in Europe, where governments have taken action to restrain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.
In Catalonia, all entertainment life has been put on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona where the number of infections is increasing.
Other European countries have also taken action to increase the number of infections in Spain, while in the UK everyone has to be quarantined on their return from Spain, like in Norway, and France has been warned of travelling to Spain.
Smitum is also increasing again in France and Germany, as governments try to find a balance of curbing the spread of the virus and restarting the economy.
However, the situation in Europe is good compared to the rest of the world, with the incidence of infections globally approaching 300,000 a day, with the highest rates of infection in the Americas and South Asia.
There are 16 million confirmed infections worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University, with deaths confirmed to be related to the virus at 644 thousand.
Gerðar's Mosaic Works finally get to enjoy themselves to the full
In front of the Reykjavík Customs House there is a large and deep pit.
Above it, there are men wearing orange helmets.
There is also a large dig there.
And more smaller trucks.
The street is closed to traffic.
But the sidewalk is good and many people stop there and observe artworks made of millions of mosaic tiles - as if they have never seen it before.
Maybe they've never seen it before.
At least it didn't respect itself.
The work has so far been somewhat hidden, directly in front of there were parking spaces that were always occupied.
People parked there, locked the car in a hurry and then jumped off to do their business in the city center.
"Living and diverse public spaces" and "attractive city tricks" are the beacons of the ongoing reconstruction of Tryggvagöt.
The aim is to beautify the area and allow Gerður Helgadóttir's mosaic work at Tollhús to enjoy a better view.
There will be a square in front of the work and as the area lies well against the sun, it is believed to be a suitable residence for passers-by.
The artwork will be illuminated and will now enjoy the material better than before on these 142 square meters.
There will also be small "fog sprayers," a kind of water sculpture, that offer play and provide the area with a certain mystery.
In this way, the improvements are described by the city of Reykjavik, which is currently under construction with Veitum.
The pipes of the water supply, heating and electricity supply will be renewed.
Many of them have come to their own, but the school pipes and cold water pipes date back to 1925 and have therefore served residents and businesses in the city center for almost a century.
When the street is reopened after construction, cars can drive around it again.
However, it becomes a one-way street and at the same time creates quieter and more accessible spaces for pedestrians.
According to information about the Customs House on the website of the customs officer, the house was inaugurated in 1971, the architect of which was Gísli Halldórsson.
Because harbour damage reached through the house, a windowless wall area of 250 square meters was formed there to the street.
The building committee and the architect agreed that such a surface would have a bad effect on the overall street image if special measures were not taken to adorn the appearance of the house.
The parties therefore agreed to expect a permanent work of art to be installed there.
During this time, there was a lot of talk about artist Gerður Helgadóttir, says in the summary.
She had worked extensively on mosaic art in Germany and elsewhere.
It was decided to contact her first before deciding whether to hold a competition for the work.
It had often been said that the work had to reflect life at the harbor, as the harbor had been the life of Reykjavík since it was built.
When she talked to the artist, she became aware of such a work.
It had to be agreed that she would receive drawings and other assistance before leaving the country again, where she would work on the proposals abroad.
Gerður received the time she herself decided it would take, and when she returned home she submitted several proposals for discussion.
It was agreed without delay to ask her to do the work.
At the same time, it was requested to conclude a comprehensive contract with her and the famous art company in Germany, the Brothers Oidtmann, but Gerður had long worked with them on the installation of famous works of art across Europe.
Contracts were successful and Gerður worked the artwork under the installation of the workshop of the brothers, who were then in charge of the installation of the Customs House.
The whole work was carried out exceptionally well, both on the part of Gerður Helgadóttir and the Oidtmann brothers, the summary says.
It has since withstood the unpleasant Icelandic weather.
It took Gerði about two years to do the work, which was done and installed in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after the Customs House was completed, at the age of 47.
Prepares for the transfer of more institutions to the country
The Minister of Social Affairs, Ásmundur Einar Daðason, announces that more public institutions will be exported to Iceland in the near future.
The Minister said this in the episode Sprengisandur at Bylgja for lunch.
Recently, it was announced that the fire department of the Housing and Construction Authority will be moved north to Sauðárkrókur in the autumn.
The agency employs six fire experts, none of whom intend to follow the agency to the north and the National Federation of Fire and Health Transports has criticized the move.
"I think we should take further steps into this creature.
I'm preparing further steps into this creature.
Further transport," said Asmund.
He says he is convinced that the vast majority of the nation wants to see more distribution of public institutions around the country.
"I think further political decisions need to be made about the transfer of government jobs to the country, as I was doing with the Housing and Construction Agency," said Ásmundur, who also took examples of other institutions that have been moved to the country and were of great importance to communities in the country, such as the transfer of the Food and Drug Administration to Selfoss, Land surveys of Iceland to Akranes and unemployment insurance in Skagaströnd.
All the main things from the second day of the Championship
The 94th Icelandic Championship in free sports ended at Thorsvellir in Akureyri today.
Several tournament records were set on the second day of the competition.
Vigdís Jónsdóttir from FH set the Icelandic record in a ventricular attack in 2014, which lasted until Elísabet Rut Rúnarsdóttir from ÍR improved the record in May last year.
Vigdís won the Icelandic record back earlier this summer and has been in great shape lately, but she has tripled the Icelandic record for the remainder of the summer.
Elizabeth Rut has been struggling with injuries and has not recovered today.
She had only one valid throw out of five, throwing 25.69 metres, which is far from her best.
Vigdis threw the longest of all today, 60.08 metres in her last attempt and at the same time set a tournament record.
Earlier in July, she set her Icelandic record of 62.69 metres, so she was somewhat away.
Guðrún Karítas Hallgrímsdóttir from ÍR had the second best throw of the day, improving her best result with a throw of 50.18 metres.
In the men's category, FH-ring Hilmar Örn Jónsson, Icelandic record holder in a ventricular attack, won a decisive victory, throwing 73.84 metres in his next last throw and setting a tournament record.
His Icelandic record in the industry is 75.26 metres.
Guðni Valur Guðnason, Olympic champion and Icelandic record holder in the round, won a competition in a sphere broadcast in Thorsvellir yesterday, but today he competed in a round, which is his main discipline.
Guðni Valur's Icelandic record is 65.53 metres and he threw the longest 59.13 metres today and secured the victory.
Valdimar Hjalti Erlendsson threw the second longest throw today, but he had one valid throw that reached second place, 49.43 metres.
Hafdís Sigurðardóttir, Icelandic record holder in a long jump, won the long jump competition with excellence while Hafdís jumped 6.25 metres long today, which is almost 40 cm from her Icelandic record.
In the women's 200-metre race, ÍR-ring Guðbjörg Jóna Bjarnadóttir was the toughest sprinter, finishing in 24.04 seconds, with her Icelandic record in the industry being 23.45 seconds.
Guðbjörg Jóna was victorious in Akureyri and won two gold medals yesterday, in the 100 metres and in a relay of 4 x 100 metres and also in a relay of 4 x 400 metres today.
In the men's category, Kolbeinn Höður Gunnarsson from FH was first in the 200-metre race in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of Ármann's Óliver Máni Samúelsson.
Like Guðbjörg Jóna, Kolbeinn Höður won gold in the 100 metres yesterday as well as in the 400 metres race.
Receives no fine for 27 million Bitcoin harvest
The Internal Revenue Committee has rejected a claim by a tax investigator who demanded a fine on a man for undercounting his capital income resulting from the sale of the electric coin Bitcoin.
The committee concluded that the tax investigator had not given a clear argument as to why it was necessary to fine the man.
The committee's ruling states that the tax investigator believed the man to have submitted substantially incorrect tax returns due to the income years 2016 and 2017.
He would have failed to return his capital income resulting from the sale of the electric coin Bitcoin of 27 million, either intentionally or out of spectacular recklessness.
The man bears a fine for his conduct.
The man rejected that in a letter to the committee.
However, he managed to have sold electric coins for 27 million in 2016.
He would have acquired it with a burial in 2009 and 2010 when it would have been both easy and undaunted with a regular household computer.
He then pointed out that when he sold the electric coins, the tax enforcement of such a sale would have been significantly unclear and unpredictable.
It could hardly have been expected that citizens would be aware of such measures on tax returns.
He would not have meant to avoid paying tax on the harvest and would have accounted for his property on the return as a deposit on a currency account.
He would have asked both connoisseurs and the Internal Revenue Director about how this was done but unsuccessfully.
He then believed that it was necessary to take into account that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he began digging for Bitcoin.
He would therefore have been in a worse position than others to study complex rules that the tax authorities would not have formed a clear opinion on.
The man therefore considered it appropriate for his taxes for the two income years to be re-established and imposed, but otherwise not punished.
He then reiterated that he worked in Iceland and had paid taxes in Iceland since 2012.
He would never have meant to escape his duties in an undue way.
The penalty claim would be out of moderation and would plunge him into debt.
Brynjólfur raises publicity: "This man understands what football is"
Brynjólfur Andersen Willumsson has been considerably between people's teeth but has also been impressed by his progress for the remainder of the season with Breiðablik in the Pepsi Max league.
Blikar will be in the fire line tonight when they will host ÍA live on Channel 2 Sport.
Brynjólfur then takes out a ban on four reminders during the season and therefore does not appear with a new haircut as in the games of the summer so far.
He had had "bla, blah, blah" written on his head before the match with HK last Thursday, which HK won 1–0.
"I don't know who exactly he was answering with the payment, but speaking of a character, this one was better off trying in the game.
He didn't go into hiding.
He wants the ball every time, and if there was someone going to match this game, I thought he would do it or make it," said Guðmundur Benediktsson in the Pepsi Max stands, when Brynjólfur was thought to be.
"I should be here for the people."
"It's difficult sometimes to figure out what position he is in.
He looks a little bit out on the left when the games begin to pass, but he has a very free role in the team," said Hjörvar Hafliðason.
Þorkell Máni Pétursson says Brynjólfur is a real entertainer and celebrates getting such a colourful man into the league: "No one disputes the fact that this is a character.
This is a fun type and I love this with my hair, and to be always ready to show up and answer in interviews.
There are an incredible amount of people busy with him, who tells me that this man understands what football is about.
"I'm an entertainer.
I should be here for the people and enjoy it."
The people are reading the interviews with Brynjólfur, people are paying in and watching what's next on his hair.
This man is just a genius," said Máni.
Player KR says he wants to leave the club - "I've been in touch with several teams in the B league"
Tobias Thomsen, KR player in the Pepsi Max league, seems to be leaving the team.
According to Danish medium Bold, Tobias is ready to return to Denmark.
Football.net also reported the case.
Tobias wants to get the start of the season in his home country, but for that he first has to terminate his contract with KR, since the Danish league starts before the Icelandic odds.
The club knows that I miss Denmark and have shown me a lot of understanding," Tobias said in a conversation with Bold.
"I have been in contact with several teams in the B league and will probably switch before the Icelandic season ends.
There are not many teams in Denmark who can afford to pay up my contract with KR."
He then says that he probably has to accept a reduction in wages in Denmark.
"Companies in Denmark have probably felt the economic impact of the virus more than in Iceland."
Bjartmar has recovered wheels for millions - Answers now for itself after DV's coverage
For over a year, Bjartmar Leósson has had a hobby unlike most others.
He smells up and rescues lost and stolen bicycles, electric bikes and scooters.
Bjartmar has earned the name "The Bicycle Indicator" as a result.
Yesterday there was a considerable upset when you published a story of your relations with Bjartmar.
DV then referred to a discussion on Facebook a group of West Pensioners stating that Bjartmar spoke to the man in Austurvöllur and said the wasp may be stolen.
It was not possible to read from the electric scooter's original writings other than that Bjartmar thefted him.
That text has now been changed on Facebook and the headline of DV's original news updated accordingly.
Bjartmar says that the original news of the case is not at all representative of what really went on yesterday in Austurvöllur.
Bjartmar said he received information from the victim of an electric debt that these were truly his electric scooters.
The alleged owner received this information from others, but the information turned out to be false, says Bjartmar.
"I looked at the guy and I recognized the shuttle, with information that there was an electric scooter that had been missing for a long time and was searched for.
I certainly hesitated at first, but when I saw him preparing to drive off on the shuttle, I decided to punch on talking to the man.
The owner was certain in his fault, so I decided to have a conversation with the man.
In general, I'm very good at this, but before I managed to finish what I had to say, the man had taken the word from me."
Bjartmar says that the man on the electric shuttle immediately invited him to show him the receipt for the bike and called the police himself.
"Yes, cool," said Bjartmar, "let's just get it straight."
Then the owner of the electric shuttle proved ownership of his electric shuttle and drove off.
Later, the electric shuttle owner's right told his story on Facebook, as reported in an earlier news release.
In the more than year that Bjartmar has pursued this practice, he says he can count the exchange he caught up with people on the fingers of one hand.
"I have had peaceful relations with Reykjavik's most difficult people," said Bjartmar, pointing out that bicycle thieves are by far the smallest brothers and sisters in the community, addicts, disabled people and other people who are on the street for some reason.
"The addiction is a tough master and somehow the next dose needs to be funded, unfortunately, the theft of such liquid assets is an easy way to that goal," says Bjartmar.
"My relations with these people are actually so good that I have many of the good people with me on my side.
There are examples of people undergoing treatment and taking care of themselves and then looking to me and helping me with what I'm doing," he says.
In general, Bjartmar's relations with bicyclists are social.
Some people know about him and what he's doing and offer peacefully to show him receipts, bike position numbers and so on.
Bicycle theft is a major problem that has not been discussed.
Furthermore, Bjartmar says that the police are even advising people to talk to him on stolen bicycles.
Bjartmar is unhappy with DV's previous news report and says he is not some kind of self-appointed police in a personal search for justice.
Asked if he is still not on slippery ice with his actions, and whether this is not primarily the role of the police, says Bjartmar certainly.
"Of course, the cops are supposed to do this, but the fact of the matter is that the cops are simply not doing this.
For example, I have watched police officers drive away from a large pile of stolen bikes.
She is clearly said to be weak in these matters."
"When the cops aren't doing anything about this, and it's just in front of your nose, and experience has shown that I can succeed in this area, why not?" asks Bjartmar.
He says he has achieved so much success in finding stolen bikes that he sometimes comes across his "clients" on the street that they just got the Bjartmar bikes they had previously recovered.
The time Bjartmar has called for police assistance has happened that she simply did not show up.
"It's just not working with the police, and it's not my fault, and it's not the owners of the bicycles' fault," Bjartmar said, sorry that victims of bicycle theft have to suffer the emptiness of the police in this area.
Bjartmar's success is not disputed.
In many places you can find stories of people thank Bjartmari for having recovered their belongings to them.
According to Bjartmar himself, the figure has long been lost on the number of bicycles he has returned, but the amounts probably run on millions, if not millions.
Weigh there electric scooters, electric bikes and electric scooters heavily, but electric bikes can cost up to half a million.
Bjartmar works day in kindergarten and every other weekend he works in a community.
His bicycle search is therefore unpaid work that he carries out in his spare time.
Pension funds and long shadows
2019 was a major anniversary year in the history of pension funds in Iceland.
Admittedly, officials had received retirement from the Danish king all the streets since the 19th century, but in 1919 a pension fund was established by officials, which eventually became the pension fund of all civil servants.
The basis for existing pension funds for employees was subsequently laid by comprehensive collective bargaining agreements in the labour market in 1969, which provided for job-related pension funds with compulsory membership and a qualified fund collection from the beginning of 1970.
In 1974, legislation was passed on the basis of these agreements and the pension system continued to strengthen thereafter.
The workers' pension system was not the only radical change driven by the 20th-century labor movement through its wage struggle.
Unemployment insurance had been achieved in a similar way in the historic strike conflict in 1955, and the organization also gradually implemented its claims for sickness rights and sickness funds, significant leave rights, reduction of working hours, housing reforms and more as a major factor.
All these rights cost a great and strict struggle but proved, in retrospect, a much greater and more lasting wage improvement than an increase in the money in the wage envelope, which disappeared as quickly as the inflation that characterized the post-war period and until 1990 as many remember.
The run-up to the creation of general pension funds in 1969 was both long and complicated.
While people eventually agreed that the funds would actually be the property of fund members, the labor movement had to agree that their boards should be composed of equal representatives of employers and fund members.
In the years after the establishment of the funds, the requirement for the majority of workers on the board of the funds was often discussed by workers' organisations, but it never succeeded, and therefore we are still stuck with the abnormal arrangements that the representatives of fund members are not a majority on the boards of the funds.
Article 36 of Act No. 129/1997 on the compulsory insurance of pension rights and the activities of pension funds deals with the investment policy of the funds.
It says in point 1 that "a pension fund shall be guided by the interests of members."
Point 5 also says: "Pension funds should establish ethical criteria in investments."
The shareholder policy of Lífeyrissjóður merchants includes the following provisions, following the aforementioned legal provisions:
The Pension Fund is a member of the United Nations (UN PRI) rules on responsible investments, along with many of the largest pension funds and professional investors in the US and Europe.
The rules discuss how focusing on environmental and societal issues as well as good corporate governance can contribute to improved portfolio investment performance.
Thus, the interests of investors and the objectives of society go together in a broader context.
LV believes it's important for companies, especially those listed on the stock market, to adopt a public policy: to have good governance of remuneration, social responsibility and environmental issues.
The pension fund Gildi, which is one of the largest funds in the country, has adopted a "responsible investment policy" and contains provisions of a similar nature.
This is all recalled here as an introduction to Iceland's latest fashion motto, "shadow management."
Since the word is new to the case, there is no hope that it has been fully defined, but to me the following definition now seems to be "most taken": Shadow management is when a union leader says in the media that he intends to send a recommendation or instructions to the company's representatives on the pension fund's board on how to take a stand on a particular case.
If they do not follow the recommendations, they will be removed from the board at the earliest convenience.
However, if the leader doesn't deal with this in the media and doesn't talk about resignation, it's not "shadow management" as relations between people are, of course, universal in the financial world as elsewhere.
I leave the reader to reflect on which way he thinks is "shadowy."
In particular, there are two people who have tried to formulate this definition when this is written, on the morning of Saturday 25 July 2020.
There are journalist Hörður Ægisson at Fréttablað and Governor Ásgeir Jónsson.
The reason for both came after Bogi Nils Bogason, CEO of Icelandair, had announced his intention to terminate the company's contracts with flight attendants and flight servants (withdraw them), and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairman of the Reykjavik Commercial Society, then sent out the recommendation to the company's representative on the board of Lífeyrissjóður merchants not to support the fund's possible purchase of shares in the company, otherwise they might be relieved.
Some time later, Bogi Nils withdrew his decision and subsequently Ragnar Thor went the same way with his recommendations, which were, of course, aimed at Bogi's decision.
Nevertheless, Hörður and Ásgeir saw reason to talk about the case in the Friday newspaper Fréttablaðið with big words about shadow management, violation of the law and a rich need for changes to the law.
There was certainly a small thump to overturn a heavy load even though the blessed thump had been in a connection mode and was also quickly wiped out.
Since the issue is important, let's consider the substance itself in the end.
I previously discussed the issues of the Pension Funds Act relating to this matter.
This means that fund managers should protect the interests of fund members and have ethical investment criteria, and these issues are further elaborated in the statutes of both Gildis and Lífeyrissjóður merchants as I mentioned.
However, pension funds should NOT look only at short-term profitability considerations in their investments.
This would be a highly dangerous policy and need not look long for examples of this in the past, as large lending by banks and funds has flowed to unethical adventurers and environmental codes, with disastrous consequences.
The CEO of Icelandair was obviously on slippery ice when he thought of wiping out a whole group of employees, thus significantly reducing the benevolence the company has enjoyed in the Icelandic market and weakening its position towards investors.
Fortunately, he saw in and withdrew this.
Time reveals whether this is enough for the investment of pension funds in the company to be considered liable to members at the end of the day.

One of the infected did not have a home contagion
One of the three people diagnosed with Covid-19 in the country yesterday came to the country from the Baltic state on 15 July, about a week and a half ago.
He is an Icelander who, however, does not reside here on a regular basis and therefore did not receive clear instructions to apply so-called homecare after arriving in Iceland and go for another sampling a few days after arriving.
He received a negative screening at the border.
"But he's in Icelandic society and should actually go to that resource," says Kamilla Jósepsdóttir, an expert in the quarantine department at Landlækni and deputy quarantine surgeon while he's on vacation, in a conversation with Fréttablaðið today.
"He used the English registration form and it is not mandatory to register the ID number and if the ID number is not registered, you are not automatically called to the second sample."
She says the man could have used the English registration form because he actually resides abroad but because of his network in the country as an Icelander he should have preferred to use it Icelandic.
However, he did not realize this.
"When the ID number is not registered, you have to seek it yourself to come to the second sampling.
Neither he nor his employer seem to have realized that was the right way," says Kamilla.
"Thus, it's clear that we need to strengthen the disclosure of this while we find some way to make an automatic messaging system even though Icelanders do not register their ID number.
Or to somehow make it more obvious who are participants in Icelandic society in the registration system," she explains.
Fortunately, few people are familiar with the person concerned on arrival in Iceland, although he is defined as a participant in Icelandic society, a living Icelander.
Only six have been quarantined after he was diagnosed yesterday and all six were in contact with him.
They are going to be sampled, but two of them have begun to show symptoms of Covid-19 infection.
The man got negative from his sampling at the border on 15 July.
Kamilla says it is likely that he was recently infected with the virus that he was not yet able to be diagnosed when the sample was taken at the border.
However, she does not want to rule out that the man was infected here in Iceland but did not carry the virus with him to the country.
"It's not entirely possible to argue that this is indeed an imported infection because it's been a long time since he came to the country that he may have been exposed here like these two who have caused a little strength in connection with the sports tournaments."
However, she says that it is very unlikely because of how few people are known here.
"It's actually very unlikely," says Kamilla, but notes that this cannot be ruled out until Icelandic genetic analysis has sequentially diagnosed the virus in man.
"If we get a type of virus that hasn't been seen here before, it's almost certain that it has carried it to the country."
Pepper sprees and bombs used against protesters
Clashes occurred last night between police and protesters in Seattle.
Police deployed pepper straws and non-lethal grenades, while protesters broke windows and set on fire.
45 protesters were arrested and 21 officers were injured.
Police violence and racism were widely protested in the United States last night, with protests in Seattle in support of protesters in Portland, Oregon State.
In Austin, Texas, one protester was shot dead.
As reported on the BBC, the attacker has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands gathered in peaceful protests.
A group of people then set fire to a construction site and smashed windows in the city's courthouse.
Police subsequently said the protests were a riot and clashes occurred between groups of protesters and police.
In Aurora, Colorado, Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old black man killed by police in August last year, was remembered by protesters.
A car drove through a group of protesters in the city but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of Black National Guard members gathered to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman killed by police in her home last March.
The group carried firearms and walked in squads to a closed intersection where police separated the group from a group of people who protested and also carried firearms.
There were 75 arrests in Omaha, Nebraska, where protesters commemorated James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man killed by a white black owner in May.
Solskjær: Not the game that defines our season
Manchester United football manager Ole Gunnar Solskjær does not want to make too much of the importance of the match with Leicester today in the final round of the Premier League.
If United lose the match, and Chelsea do not lose against Wolves, Solskjær and his men finished in fifth place, thereby losing the Champions League seat.
However, they still have hope of entering the Champions League by winning the Europa League next month.
"We have not arrived at the terminal.
If we score points against Leicester, I think people will say we haven't had a bad season now," Solskjær said.
"But whatever happens, this is not the end of our journey because we still have a lot to do ashore with getting the two teams above us," Solskjær said.
It is clear that people's nerves will be strained at 15 a.m. today, but Solskjær tried to pretend that every other game was involved.
"If you want to belong to Manchester United, you have to get used to being under pressure in the last game of the season.
This is nothing new, and the company is based on this.
We have created a great opportunity to end the season well and now it's us to take advantage of it," Solskjær said.
"It's not the most important game of the season, it's just the next game.
You can ask anyone in football, the next game is always the most important one.
The finals don't define our season, we've already had many moments defining this season."
"The coming of Bruno Fernandes changed a lot for us and I believe that we are in better shape and much stronger mentally than last season," Solskjær said.
65,000 infections per day
65,490 new coronavirus infections were diagnosed in the United States yesterday, according to John Hopkins University.
A total of 4,178,021 infections have been confirmed in the US since the beginning of the epidemic in that country.
900 died from the virus yesterday, with deaths due to the virus more than 1,000 per day in the last four days to date.
A total of 146,460 deaths due to the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
According to the forecast model of the U.S. quarantine authorities, the number of deaths caused by the virus will reach 175,000 on August 15th.
Fear of the second wave of the epidemic
The Spanish authorities are now trying to restrain the increased spread of COVID-19 in the country.
Spanish health authorities reported over 920 new cases of COVID-19, both on Thursday and Friday.
No more people have been diagnosed there in 24 hours since the beginning of May and the news comes at the same time as Spaniards begin to lift one of the strictest curfews in Europe.
The backlash led to UK authorities now requiring passengers arriving from Spain to be quarantined on return.
A week before, Spain was on Britain's list of safe states.
The situation is worst in Catalonia in northeastern Spain, where governments have taken wider restrictions to try to stem the growth.
In the capital of Barcelona, entertainment venues will be closed for the next two weeks and wave houses will be closed at midnight.
In addition, a curfew is now in force for 200,000 residents in Segria County in western Catalonia.
It is believed that Britain's decision will have a negative impact on the Spanish economy, which is heavily reliant on the arrival of foreign tourists and is poorly played after the epidemic.
Tui, the UK's largest travel agency, canceled all flights planned for today to Spain and the Canary Islands.
Governments around the world are said to be preparing for the second wave of the epidemic, but there seems to be little interest in resorting to an extensive curfew that has widely destroyed the economy.
For example, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has taken this very badly and likened it to nuclear weapons that he does not want to use.
In addition, French Prime Minister Jean Castex said that the nation "would not survive, economically or socially," if a national curfew were again imposed.
Many policymakers hope that local resources that reach residents of individual towns, cities or regions will suffice to hold back the virus in the next round if it comes to it.
Five new infections in Iceland - Three in Iceland
Three domestic infections were diagnosed yesterday plus two more at the border.
Thus, five people with a positive Covid-19 infection were diagnosed yesterday in Iceland.
The Civil Protection announcement says that one infection is related to the infection reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football tournament.
The person has been sent to isolation and sixteen who were in close contact with him in quarantine.
The infected person was a participant in the social work of a sports club in Reykjavik and is, according to the announcement, "only part of the sports team" in quarantine.
Others sent to quarantine relate to the man in a different way.
The origin of this infection is unfounded and the infection is in full swing by the National Commissioner's Task Force.
The ReyCUP tournament's opponents have followed the guidelines and rules of a quarantine surgeon and civil protection surgeon that are still in force and appropriate measures have been taken.
However, pictures of the tournament yesterday attracted attention, as it was possible to celebrate the good team on the field in very close communion.
Just before 11 a.m. today, opponents posted the following announcement on their Facebook page.
It says "NOTE: Parents please respect the rules that competitors pick up their own stuff at the school.
Parents are NOT allowed to do so.
Thank you for your understanding."
Another infection was diagnosed yesterday but is related to the infection reported the day before yesterday.
The announcement says: "Icelandic genetic analysis has sequentially identified the infection and a new type of virus has been revealed that has not been diagnosed here before."
A contagion is also underway in this case and the one infected in isolation and 12 in quarantine due to the infection.
The third infection in question is from a man who came to Iceland 11 days ago, 15 July.
He was diagnosed in the southwest corner of the country.
The person is now in isolation and six who were in close contact with him in quarantine.
Two of them have already begun to show symptoms of virus transmission.
In addition, two people were diagnosed at the border and are awaiting the outcome of further investigations, as provided for by a border infection process.
Finally, the announcement says: The National Commissioner for Civil Protection and the National Physician's Office are urgent for people to be careful and pay close attention to individual infectious agents.
If there is little doubt as to whether the symptoms of the Covid-19 virus are present, the same person is asked to have a sampling at the nearest clinic.
Patreksfjörður says the camp site is booked up for a weekend of merchants - Direct guests
The camp site in Patreksfjörður is fully booked this weekend, according to Vesturbyggð's announcement.
Guests are advised to look at other accommodation options.
Names Vesturbyggð Bíldudalur, Tálknafjörður, Melanes in Rauðasandur, Hotel Flókalund and Hotel Breidavík as other options in the position.
There is plenty to be in Patreksfjörður this weekend, because like previous years, Skjaldborg, a festival of Icelandic documentaries will be held in the town.
It has been held since 2007 and has therefore become a strong tradition in the town.
Judging by the camp site's attack, a good attendance can be expected this year if the weather does not take into account, but DV said earlier today about a detrimental forecast.
However, the worst weather can be expected in the south, and hope for the people of Patreksfjörður.
The website bb.is first reported, and said that all other accommodations in the town were already fully booked.
An entire apartment building grows to the best location in the city
Romanian workers live for free at Dunhaga 18-20.
Meanwhile, owners are seeking a building permit for improvement, but their business has been successful in the system for the third year.
In one of the oldest, healthiest and most expensive neighborhoods in the city of Reykjavík, stands a magnificent apartment building on three floors.
On the ground floor of the house there is about 600 square meters of shopping space.
Behind the house are the doors of two stairways, each of which contains four fairly magnificent apartments.
They range from 93 to 130 square metres, although most exceed 100.
The house has a considerable history.
It was built in 1959 and has housed, among other things, video rental, the school office, the milk shop of the Mjólkursamsölur, Jóa gunsmith, fish sale and most recently Háskólaprent.
To put it mildly, the house has remembered its fool more beautiful.
The house is now under severe damage, as can be seen in the attached photos.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
According to the register of companies, the owners of D18 ehf. include Magnús Magnússon and Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir.
Magnús went to Borgun's ownership group and was the president of Borgun's holding company.
Stálskip ehf. belongs to the owners of the holding company Borgunar.
Stálskip ehf. is an investment company of Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir and her children.
Guðrún is also the owner of a third share in D18 ehf.
Guðrún and her husband, Ágúst Guðmundur Sigurðsson, once ran the fishing company Stálskip.
D18 ehf. bought the house in the summer of 2009 and therefore little or nothing has been maintained since then.
Neighbors say the condition of the house has deteriorated steadily since, although mostly in recent years.
On the Facebook page of residents in the neighborhood, one resident says the house has "not been particularly lively in recent years."
It may play into the fact that owners have for several years sought to change the house and the plot.
Other neighbors say the house hasn't been okay for a long time.
"It's long time to do something decent about this spot and it's sad that it's slowed down like this."
He also says that he is pissed off at the owners of the house for not getting involved in finishing this, finding some common space with the neighbors of the house and stopping this "lawyer's blanket."
"Just do this in consultation with the surrounding community so that this can be accelerated and completed."
The "lawyer" referred to by the resident is the planning process of the field that has been going on at least since 2017.
The owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 sought permission to build a floor on top of the existing apartment building and behind the house, a new elevator house and an extension on one floor as well as a basement.
The building permit granted for that project was appealed to the Environmental and Resource Appeals Committee and the committee repealed it as the project was not based on a dispute plan and a local presentation was not satisfactory.
The city of Reykjavik then started with planning work and ended it with an advertisement in the Official Journal in July last year.
That organisation was also appealed and the committee repealed it in March 2020.
At this point, nearly three years had passed since the original application for a building permit and the owners of the house at the starting point.
At that time, the house had drawn down considerably and neighbors began to wear out.
When DV asked the neighbors of the house about the situation and the reaction of the neighbors, the answers were in various ways.
Some had an understanding of the intentions of the owners of the house, others not at all.
Others directed the anger at the city, others did not.
Others were just angry but nothing necessarily about anyone.
Others said the parking spaces were a pillar of contention, but neighbors have used Dunhaga's unused parking space 18-20 under their vehicles.
One complainant in the case said he was long tired of the administration:
"That we have to go through the process in a trio is absolutely amazing.
It's like the city of Reykjavik doesn't know how to read."
Today, the house stands empty, abandoned and neglected.
A memorial to the suspended administration of the city and the noble intentions of the owner and the many years of work of those who are now at the starting point.
When a reporter came to a park at Dunhaga 18, he was blown open by doors and garbage piles.
Playstation computer and recent television were surrounded by other debris on the ground - victims of Icelandic summer wetness.
The old office of the University of Iceland was open and a considerable number of cats were judged by the smell of urine.
It is clear that someone has nested in one corner but none can be seen.
Stacks of sofas and beds and a few pallets of geological journals, which were undoubtedly supposed to become a book, blasted.
The stairways of the apartment building were also open and life in both of them.
A journalist was lucky enough to bump into the residents of one of them.
Romanians were there to boil potato dish for dinner and invited a journalist.
The Romanians work for the temporary agency Ztrongforce ehf.
They have been there for a while and DV's sources say that the company paid nothing for the premises except heating and electricity.
Due to the condition of the house, it is not precautionary to collect rent.
Judging from the stands of mail in the lobby of the house, it is clear that a large number of foreign workers have lived there in recent seasons.
The temporary agency has not been a part of the Covid-19 situation, as the decrease in tourism led to a decrease in the construction sector and these two businesses were the most efficient way to take advantage of temporary agency services.
Nevertheless, householders at Dunhaga 18 seemed to have plenty to do and the work suits and gloves in the joint were hanging dry after a long day of work in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the miserable condition of the house, the apartment the boys shared seemed to be well maintained.
When a journalist said goodbye to the boys Romanian, the irony suddenly became clear to him: In the best location in Reykjavik, 1,500 square meters of property stands demolished.
Owners want to change the house for the better and neighbors want an improved situation but dispute the definition of "improved."
In between, the city's planning department sits at its starting point, the victim of endless appeals channels and appeals in the planning process, and the suspended resolution of the Environment and Resource Appeals Committee.
In the house, Romanian workers, perhaps precisely those who go into improving the situation, live when the Icelanders stop arguing.
The article originally appeared in the weekend newspaper DV on 17 July.
In an effort against overweight following a coronavirus pandemic
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will award £10m to a campaign against overweight, which will include a ban on fast food advertising, following his serious illness, partly because of his weight.
It says that Johnson will present the campaign, which has been named Better Health, tomorrow, Monday, with the campaign encouraging doctors to prescribe cycling for their overweight clients and will also undertake an effort to increase the number of cycling paths.
In addition, advertising by fast food restaurants on television will be banned by 21 o'clock at night, according to British media sources.
"COVID-19 has raised us against the short and long-term risks of being overweight, and the prime minister is determined that we must use the time to become more healthy, active and eat healthy diets," a government spokesman said.
Johnson himself has had weight problems, but he was admitted to intensive care when he was infected with the coronavirus in the spring, partly because of his weight that he is believed to have been so seriously ill.
Women better suited to lead the changes
She said the new constitution is the biggest step the nation can take toward greater distribution of power, transparency and in combating corruption and the interests of the whole.
"We need to start changing gear a little bit now and who is better suited to lead such changes than the group of society that is easier to be in these values.
They are women," said Helgi.
"Women in Iceland are famous for their women's solidarity.
To stick together and be together to lead change.
So now it's just our turn to lead these changes."
She said she was a little concerned about the emphasis on Iceland as the "best in the world" in both gender equality and human rights.
"Then we're not as ready to look at what needs to be done.
Like Germans, they are very aware of their history and look at everything that needs to be done.
There's a lot.
We have to know where we're coming from and know the story and listen.
Listen to the voices of marginalized groups.
We don't all have the same rules here," said Helga.
When asked, she said women are in many respects in good matters in Iceland, but added that, as in many places elsewhere, Icelanders live with incredibly masculine values.
She said that politics was about, for example, own interests, dominance and powers that were the forces that maintained inequality in all societies.
"Women have now formed this group and come together and are just a little annoyed that Parliament is going to be troubled to ignore this referendum from 2012," she said.
"It's these feminine values that we're thinking this from.
On the basis of human rights and nature conservation, cooperation and that we all really sit at the same table," she said, adding that the aforementioned values were the basic values in the new constitution.
"We are a very rich country of natural wealth and it's ridiculous that there are people living in poverty.
It's ridiculous, we can divide differently," said Helga.
"It's ridiculous that there is some law of nature that women's work is always lower paid.
It's ridiculous that flight attendants and nurses have to stand in a wage struggle forever just to achieve a decent salary."
The signature list on the new constitution can be signed here via electronic Iceland.
Tried to kidnap a pedestrian downtown
A man was arrested in the city center last night after threatening pedestrians and trying to get money from him.
The police also stopped the production of drugs in Árbæ where two people were arrested over the case.
The police then stopped the driver of a motorcycle in the Hlíðinn area, where its driver was at 146 km speed with a maximum speed of 60 mph.
In addition, he had previously been deprived of driving rights.
The Reykjavik police had enough spinning last night and more than 80 cases were recorded in the police diary from five yesterday to five this morning.
There was a lot of noise notifications about parties.
On the night of Saturday, eleven noisy parties were received, which was widely considered in the police diary.
Last night, however, 22 noise issues ran on the board of the police.
Six were detained in a prison cell last night.
In Árbænir, police were called up last night when parties fired fireworks.
However, they had escaped when police officers came to the park.
At that time, nine drivers were stopped for intoxication and or drug driving.
Four people were arrested for a fight in the city center last night, one of whom was detained in a prison cell.
Two people were taken to the emergency department after they fell on their faces, one in the city center and the other in the West Village.
One person was taken to the emergency room after he was injured while jumping a trampoline in Kopavogur.
In addition, police stopped a driver who towed a caravan in Kjalarnes yesterday.
The trailer's bicycle equipment was, according to the police's diary, in "very poor condition" and was detained.
Stay in Monet's house during the shopkeeper's weekend
The house, which Impressionist Claude Monet spent the last forty years of his life, is now rented on the site Airbnb.
The next available nights in the house are during the shopkeeper's weekend.
The house is small and cute, located in the town of Givenry in Normandie, France.
The world famous painter lived in the house from 1883 until his death in 1926.
The house has three bedrooms, two lounges and three bathrooms.
Monet was first inspired to paint her famous gardens in this house.
If someone intends to rent the house, they must rent at least two nights.
Based on Airbnb's page, it's next vacant in a week, on the Sunday of the shopkeeper's weekend, so it might be ideal for some shoppers on vacation to hurry to book the painter's house.
The two nights over a weekend of merchants cost only 964 US dollars or just over 130 thousand Icelandic crowns as Fréttablaðið gets next.
Dozens in quarantine and several of them have begun to show symptoms of the disease caused by the coronavirus
Five have been diagnosed with the domestic coronavirus in the last three days and most of the infected are unrelated.
Dozens have been quarantined because of this and several of them have begun to show symptoms of the disease caused by the virus.
Three were diagnosed with the domestic coronavirus yesterday and two during border screening.
An expert at the Directorate of Health says that the increasing number of domestic infections does not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading elsewhere in the community.
"The first domestic infection has been sequentially identified and it is a virus that has not been seen here before, so we have no special reason to think that it has been dull in the community for some time.
This is probably something that has just arrived in Iceland, but of course we need to be very careful now," said Kamilla Sigríður Jósefsdóttir, an expert in the quarantine department of the Directorate of Health.
Most of those infected have been associated with individuals who came from abroad.
Further sampling will take place in the near future, but several people who were in contact with the infected have begun to show symptoms of the coronavirus.
"Now there's no influenza going on and less about other respiratory infections, so we can be fairly liberal with doing these tests on individuals who during influenza time would have found reason to do something else first," Kamilla said.
The contagion has mostly been completed, but it is not impossible for more people to be quarantined.
Two of the infected were diagnosed after attending sporting events.
It has raised questions whether it is precautionary to hold such events.
The Director of Civil Protection says it's possible as long as people follow criteria and rules.
Kamilla says it's almost impossible for the infected to be infected at the sports tournaments.
"If there are no more people in isolation from these individuals after dealing with them at these sports tournaments, we can argue that our quarantine measures at the tournaments worked.
But it's not revealed," Kamilla said.
The Civil Protection Department's procedures are under continuous review.
"We need to be ready to intervene with further advice or restrictions if that seems to warrant," Kamilla said.
In more than a week, the number limits will be extended to a thousand people.
This new situation could affect relaxation.
"Certain meditation to cook" - See Elizabeth Viðar's menu
Elísa Viðarsdóttir is an achievement woman in football and plays with Valur.
She is also a master student in nutrition, mother, and works as a food scientist.
She needs a lot of energy for the least of the day and usually takes time to cook good and nutritious food.
A normal day for me begins by coming to work from eight," says Elísa.
"After work, I go to the store to be able to prepare dinner before picking up my girl at kindergarten at about three o'clock."
Elizabeth finds it very nutritious to pick up her daughter early in kindergarten.
"It's good to have an appointment with her before I go to rehearsal in the second half.
After training, it's good to come home and just have to warm up the food.
At night, when the girl is asleep, we like to watch one episode to drain our minds."
Elisha does not follow any specific diet.
She is finishing a master's thesis in nutrition and therefore knows well what suits her to eat to have enough energy to do work, school, family and exercises.
"What suits me is eating a wide range of foods that are well composed of proteins, carbohydrates and fats.
However, I think it's most important to have a healthy relationship with food and not classify food into bad or good, rather nutritious or nutritious.
You see, it's okay to eat everything, just not all of a sudden and not always."
Elisha is very interested in cooking.
"I find a certain meditation in standing in the kitchen to cook and therefore very much into it.
I have to say that the confidence is with me in the kitchen and I sincerely believe that I am a decent chef."
Breakfast: Oats, chia seeds, hemp seeds, salt, a little lemon juice, leave in almond milk overnight.
Top this meal with what's available.
Most often it's banana and crispy muesli &amp; COFFEE.
I'm a big coffee lady.
Intermediate language: Incredibly different, but fruit or vegetables, flat cakes, pure skyr with bananas and muesli, bread with toppings and then I could eat hummus with a spoon out of a box if that's the case.
Lunch: I often make all kinds of food-rich salads from what's in the fridge, Chinese or barley, falafelballs, rocky salad, oven-baked vegetables with good dressing is a little bit what I'm working with.
If the organization goes completely out of control (which happens often) then the egg machine at work has saved me quite often and then there are 2 slices of bread with butter, cheese and boiled egg, don't put on you anymore.
Intermediate language: Give me something rich in carbohydrates for exercises, bread with toppings, breakfast cereals or fruit.
Dinner: Fish are very often chosen in my home, otherwise some delicious vegetable dishes.
Clashes between police and protesters in Seattle
Seattle city officials in Washington state have declared a state of impeachment following crowded protests in the city center.
Police yesterday resorted to flash bombs and pepper spray to try to clear a large area occupied by protesters, stretching across multiple blocks in the vicinity of the city's parliament building.
The police announced on Twitter that at least eleven protesters had been arrested and that there was an investigation into a vandalism carried out at a police station in the city yesterday, possibly with some kind of bomb.
City and police authorities say that protesters stoned police with stones, bottles, detonators and other loose ones, and one officer was taken to a hospital where his injuries were reported.
However, the protests in Seattle were peaceful for a long time.
They were praised to show solidarity to protesters in Portland, Oregon, where there have been repeated severe clashes between protesters and heavily armed federal agents.
Like more cities in the United States, people gather there under the banner of Black Lives Matter, recalls Georges Floyds, who was killed by a Minneapolis police officer on May 25, protesting systemic racism in American society and demanding corrective action.
Not withdrawn until after the vote
It is still unclear whether the layoffs of the flight attendant Icelandair, who are due to take effect in the coming months, will be withdrawn.
An electronic vote on the Icelandic Airfrey Association's collective bargaining agreement on behalf of Icelandair's flight attendant will end tomorrow at noon.
Guðlaug Líney Jóhannsdóttir, chairman of the association, says she is confident that Icelandair will not decide on the layoffs until the outcome of the vote is available.
"It's definitely connected," says Guðlaug Líney.
"No layoffs have been withdrawn, this must be in place so that the engines can be manned.
Of course, people are impatient to know if they will have a job after the end of the month."
An agreement signed a week ago is voted on the night of 19 July.
It is expected to apply until the end of September 2025 and is based on a deal previously voted by flight attendants.
On 17 July, the Board of Directors and the Council of Representatives of the Icelandic Airfrey Association agreed to call a general work stoppage at Icelandair, members agreed to it in a vote.
She never came to it, but this was decided following Icelandair's decision to stop negotiating with the airline, resign all its flight attendants and seek contracts with another union.
The company's pilots were to undertake the work of security teams on board temporarily.
Asked how she believes the vote will go, Guðlaug Líney says it's difficult to predict.
"People are hurt after Icelandair's involvement, when all the company's flight attendants were resigned and announced that an agreement would be reached with another union.
Now it turns out whether that has an effect," she says.
940 flight attendants worked for Icelandair at the end of April, when 900 of them, about 95%, were cancelled.
Their notice period varies, for those who have the shortest working life he is three months and therefore ends at the end of July-August.
This group includes about 90% of Icelandair flight attendants.
What will take if the agreement is not approved?
"Then we call for continued dialogue with our negotiators.
With this agreement, we are meeting Icelandair's demands.
If he is rejected, it is clear that flight attendants think they have gone too far."
Voting on collective bargaining agreement ends and Icelandair presents second quarter financial statements tomorrow
The flight attendant's vote on a new collective bargaining agreement ends at 12 noon tomorrow.
Icelandair's financial statements for the second quarter will also be published tomorrow, but preliminary results indicate that the company's revenue fell by 85 percent from the same period last year.
An electronic vote on the collective bargaining agreement between the Icelandic Airfrey Association and the Icelandair Confederation started on Wednesday, 22 July, and ends tomorrow, Monday 27 July, at 12 noon.
Those who are allowed to vote for the contract are Icelandair employees who pay membership fees to the airline attendant.
Icelandair and FFÍ signed a new collective bargaining agreement on the night of Sunday 19 July, but Icelandair had previously broken up negotiations with the company after flight attendants dropped the previous agreement in a vote in early July.
Icelandair had dismissed all flight attendants and flight crew of the company on Friday, but they were withdrawn after a new collective bargaining agreement was signed.
Under a new collective bargaining agreement, flight attendants have to fly five hours more a month for the same basic salary.
The collective bargaining agreement is valid until 2025, which has integrated the provisions of pilots and flight attendants on how long to fly on a single shift.
The agreement was presented to FFÍ members at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica Hotel last Monday and many flight attendants who were discussed by the news agency expressed dissatisfaction with the agreement.
However, most seemed to agree that the agreement had to be approved to keep the FFÍ alive.
Icelandair's financial statements for the second quarter will be presented tomorrow, but the company's EBIT, its operating income for capital items and taxes, is negative by $100 to 110 million, or about ISK 15 billion, according to preliminary results.
Icelandair sent preliminary calculations to the Exchange last Wednesday, which said that the company's revenue amounted to about $60 million in the quarter, or about ISK 8.3 billion.
Cash and its equivalent was around $154 million at the end of the quarter, around $21 billion.
Icelandair also aims to tender the company's share capital in August.
Icelandair plans to conclude contracts with fifteen creditors, the government and the Boeing aircraft manufacturer by the end of the month before a share offering.
A new variant rather than a new type of virus
"A new virus just means that it's been a person who came from abroad.
This is not something that has been simmering in Iceland," says Már Kristjánsson, head physician at the infectious disease department of the National Hospital, about the news that "a new type of virus" has been diagnosed in Iceland.
Three domestic infections were diagnosed yesterday and two at the border.
One who was diagnosed had taken part in the social work of a sports club at the Rey Cup football tournament, but the origin of the infection is unfounded and an infection is ongoing.
An infection was also diagnosed in a person who came to the country on 15 July and two people who were in contact with him have begun to show symptoms of COVID-19.
An infection related to an infection reported the day before yesterday was diagnosed yesterday and after a sequential analysis by the Icelandic Genetic Analysis, it was revealed "a new type of virus that has not been diagnosed here before."
A contagion has been completed in connection with that infection.
Már says that it is not a new virus, but that it is the same virus that has spread around the world, i.e. the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
It's more appropriate to talk about a new variant of that virus than about a new type of virus.
Asked what that means and whether it could say something about the start of a second wave of an epidemic, Már says that there is currently a single case and it could happen that there will be nothing more out of it.
"But if there are cases in the country that do not have links from abroad and have the same genotype as this particular variant, that conclusion could be drawn [on the second wave], which is premature at this time," explains Már.
Happiness in the hot tub
Is the secret that Iceland's happiness hidden in the hot tubs?
The BBC's programme makers lead to the likelihood in a fun video that sheds light on the country's swimming pool and hot pot culture.
The Icelandic bath culture is special worldwide and it is claimed that there are nowhere in the world the same number of bathing places per inhabitant.
The natural geothermal energy is its foundation, but also the tradition of swimming here.
Children's swimming lessons were mandatory in 1940, but older citizens are no less diligent in using the hot water for health benefits.
Swimming is described as a fixed part of the country's general welfare.
In the pot, everyone is equal, regardless of class and position.
Free of mobile phones, people talk personally around the world and space or enjoy the palliative power of the water: meditate and charge the batteries of the soul and body.
On the steep side to attend a hundred days of elections
There are a hundred days until Americans go to the election and choose a four-year president.
Donald Trump is seeking re-election, but he is steep to pursue.
Joe Biden, the Democratic Party's forthcoming candidate, has a huge advantage over Trump nationally, taking into account polls.
According to a new poll by the AP news agency, a record number of Americans believe that the nation is on the wrong track.
Trump's response to the pandemic of the new coronavirus is also very unpopular, and more Americans than before believe that the president has held the economy poorly.
Specifically, only two in ten Americans say the United States is on the right track.
32 percent say they support Trump's response to the epidemic and 48 percent say he has held well on economic matters.
In March, that rate was 56 percent and in January it was 67 percent.
According to the FiveThirtyEight average, Biden follows 49.9 percent nationally while Trump follows 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has tried to shift the attention away from his performance against the epidemic to Biden, promoting so-called cultural disputes and proclaiming policies that should relate to law and order.
However, Biden's candidacy puts great effort into keeping the attention on Trump and considers it highly likely to win the prize if the election is actually about how Trump has performed in the last four years.
Trump's unpopularity also seems to bring down Republican senators, fearing that Democrats could even gain a majority in the U.S. Senate, which has so far been very slow.
Politico recently said that the party and the candidate remain comparable, and that is now the Republican Party would have its greatest abuse in decades.
The suburbs proved to be particularly bad for the party in the 2016 parliamentary elections and it is now likely that this trend will continue.
In recent days, Trump has tried to intimidate suburban residents to follow, including by saying that if Biden becomes president, he will destroy suburbs of the United States and promote racial disputes.
Among other things, Trump has abrogated a regulation from Barack Obama's time in the White House intended to diversify suburbs.
He then urged "housewives" of suburbs in the United States to read an article by the former deputy governor of New York, claiming that Biden would destroy suburbs of the United States and agreeing to Trump.
"Biden will destroy your neighborhoods and the American dream.
I will preserve it, and even make it even better!" The president said.
The population of the suburbs of the United States is an increasingly expanding group of voters.
According to NPR, they account for about half of all voters in the United States.
Ever since George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the candidate who has received the majority of the votes of this group has become president.
Except in 2012 when Mitt Romney received a majority of votes from this group but lost to Barack Obama.
Polls have shown that despite Trump securing a small majority in the suburbs in 2016, his follow-up there has slowed considerably.
Although there are differences between the polls, Biden has recommended a fifteen percentage point advantage over Trump in the outskirts recently.
Regis Philbin is dead
American broadcaster Regis Philbin has died at the age of 88.
Philbin worked as an actor, show host, presenter and singer for about six decades.
He is best known for directing the popular talk series Live! with Regis between 1988 and 2011 with Kathie Lee Gifford and later Kelly Ripa.
He has also directed shows such as Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and America's Got Talent.
According to Guinness World Records, Philbin is the person who has spent most hours on American television and has been recognized to that effect.
He won six Emmy Awards during his working life and was nominated 37 times in total.
A statement from his family states that Philbin died of natural causes.
A number of colleagues, friends and fans have remembered him on social media in the last 24 hours.
Will the Olympic fire be the light at the end of the tunnel?
After the final decision had been made to postpone the Olympics, events that only world wars have advanced to date, the president of the International Olympic Committee said that the famous Olympic fire would be "the light at the end of the tunnel," referring presumably to the coronavirus pandemic that the world is now undergoing together.
Athletes have another year to prepare and the Japanese authorities are compensating for the cost of the delay.
At least everyone holds a head, as there is a lot at stake.
When it was announced that Tokyo in Japan would be the venue for this year's Olympics, the cheers of the Japanese representatives were genuine.
They wept and laughed alternately, as Tokyo had applied to host the 2016 Games, but that time was lower for Rio in Brazil.
This time, Tokyo and Japan should bathe in the attention of the world.
The tournament was scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August but has been postponed for a year and will instead start on 23 July 2021 and end on 8 August.
If the Games are not held, if the coronavirus still becomes too much of a threat, the Games will be cancelled.
However, no one wants to completely think that thought to the end.
Olympics is no ordinary sports competition.
There is nothing saved, the show should always be magnificent and strive to top the last games.
The selection of a city for the Olympics is based on the selection committee's assessment of the cities' presentations.
The more magnificent the presentation - the more likely it will be.
Tokyo spent $150 million trying to host the 2016 Olympics, or more than ISK 20 billion.
The second time, when the 2020 Games were applied for, $75 million, about $10 billion, was put into the presentation.
In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo will receive the Games this year, the Japanese authorities had already spent ISK 30 billion on the project.
However, that amount is just a drop in the ocean considering the cost of building Olympic villages, toys and generally strengthening the country's infrastructure to cope with such tournaments, prepare it and host the Games themselves.
Organizers in Japan have said the Tokyo Olympics, which should have been running these days but has been delayed by a year due to the coronavirus, would have cost $12.6 billion.
However, a report from the State Auditor of Japan, published at the end of last year, stated that the cost was almost double that figure.
It is likely that it will not be possible to fully assess the cost of postponing the Games, but it has been estimated that it can cost between two and six billion dollars in addition to the original cost.
The total cost for the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could therefore run between $15 and $30 billion.
There are so high figures that all tax revenues of the Icelandic state would only cover almost half of the Olympics, compared to the lowest possible cost.
The Olympics are an event of the magnitude that they have often become a topic of discussion for economists, who try to review figures and look at the benefits and benefits of the Games.
In the shortest matter, quite a lot of people seem to have concluded that the impact of the Olympics is less than so positive for the economy of the cities that hold them.
There are some short-term effects, for example, the number of jobs is increasing considerably in the short term, but in the long term, cities are often stuck with debt deals and the threatening operating costs of low-used structures.
Brazil's Rio is stuck with significant debt due to the 2016 Games and has been having trouble costing maintenance of all the major sports facilities built for the Games.
Figures have been reviewed after the London 2012 Games, which revealed that only 10 percent of those who won a related Olympics in the city were unemployed in the past.
This means that there were no new jobs except to a small extent.
In general, cities have not come out particularly well of hosting the Olympics financially because of the adjacent costs associated with the structures built for the Games.
However, there is often thought to be an increase in the traffic of tourists who want to visit the Olympic cities following the Games, which is, however, a lot of uncertainty regarding the 2021 Games.
It is also uncertain whether it will be possible to accept all the number of spectators who usually attend the Games.
However, the main issue is the honor the cities are allowed to be chosen, but it is difficult to estimate for money.
Therefore, despite enormous costs, it can also be said that the joy brought by the Games is not of the nature that a price tag can be placed on it.
But although the exhibition is often magnificent and there is nowhere to be saved, of course, it's not just about money.
It's the sports heroes that are in the foreground.
For some athletes, it's accidentally just welcome to postpone the Games.
For example, the Australian fifth-winner and gold medallist in her article at the last Olympics, Chloe Esposito, is casolate and would have been away from good fun this summer, but has hope of being in the form of a competition for the 2021 Games.
She is therefore among the athletes who is just rather pleased with the postponement, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who planned to retire after this year's Games, if they had been held on time, the suspension of the games means in some cases that they will retire before the Games take place.
Simply don't trust their body to go through years in addition to strict exercises.
Few athletes appeared as thoroughly in the hearts of the audience at the 2016 Rio Olympics as gymnastics star Simone Biles.
She came home with four gold around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has attended several interviews in his home country the United States recently to discuss the Olympics.
She is planning the 2021 Games, but she is not necessarily sure that she will still be at the top of the Games next year, as she will then be 24 years old.
Although it is generally not considered a high age, it is higher for a leading gymnast.
"This is a sensitive issue," says Biles, but smiles at another in an interview published on the Olympic Committee's Instagram page asked if she intends to achieve the 2021 Games as long as she did in Rio 2016.
"I honestly don't know if I'll still be at the top after a whole year in addition to rehearsals," says Biles.
She has previously said that her body can't stand the stress of gymnastics training for much longer.
Nevertheless, she practices hard for the 2021 Olympics.
Biles admits it was an uncomfortable feeling to have to suddenly stop practicing when the pandemic was at its peak and the gymnasium was closed.
There were no exemptions for Biles rather than others while all sports facilities were closed for seven weeks.
All her Olympic gold could not buy any access above the others, she had to find various ways to stay in shape like others.
The basic form certainly a little better than most people.
"We have a rigid plan now.
It was difficult to start rehearsing first after the gymnasium opened.
We started slowly but are back at full speed and I will increase the rehearsals steadily as the year progresses.
Of course, we don't know exactly how these games will be or whether they will be held, but we still practice considering they will be, can't help.
I've worked too hard to leave the sport now," says Biles.
With it, like others, doubt or perhaps rather awareness that the situation may arise that the Games will not be held at all in 2021 either.
Predicting that, though, is hopeless.
No one can know how the coronavirus pandemic will be in July 2021 and nothing else to do but prepare for the Olympics considering they will be held that year.
Perhaps the Olympic fire will be the light at the end of the Covid Tunnel.
Postponed wedding due to epidemic
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding due to the coronavirus.
She was supposed to marry former Bachelorette contestant Wells Adams this summer.
"I think there are other more important things to think about right now," the actress said in a conversation with People.
"We really want to get married someday and then have the dream wedding and have all the people present who are dear to us.
But we decided to set that deadline and focus on what's important right now, and that's helping share information about the importance of wearing masks and staying at home.
I look more at world affairs than weddings these days.
There are many things going on and we should focus our attention on what is happening in the world."
