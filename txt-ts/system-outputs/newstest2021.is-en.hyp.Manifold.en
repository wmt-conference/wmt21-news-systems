Shouted at the world
The Looks Like You Need Iceland marketing campaign is considered to have started off well, and shouts and calls in nature are beginning to pull people around the world.
"You have the mystery, I need Iceland," says a woman in the big world, commenting on an advertisement from the marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland on YouTube's content platform.
Another viewer says that she will keep Iceland in her heart forever and a young woman says that she must get to Iceland as soon as possible, as her fiancé resides there.
Luckily, however, she is in the US, so she expects to have to wait for some more months.
Another viewer asked if the hiking trail to Iceland is passable, because there are no planes.
The story doesn't follow whether he comes from another time zone.
Egill Þórðarson of the advertising agency Peel, who was involved in the production of the advertisements along with the international advertising agency M & C Saatchi, says that the reception was more hopeful.
"I was involved in many Inspired By Icelandic campaigns that have been very successful, but this new campaign is already breaking a record.
Basically, it's about creating PR values, it's getting foreign media to cover the campaign, and it's been incredibly successful.
In a relatively short time, we have received coverage in around seven hundred media around the world totalling over two billion people.
The value of this discussion is priced at ISK 1.8 billion.
That's not amusing. "
The main market is usually the United States and the campaign has been very successful there, although Americans are not heading to the country soon.
According to Egils, well-known market areas such as Denmark, the United Kingdom and Germany have also welcomed themselves, such as Russia, which is comfortably surprising.
There have also been responses from exotic areas, such as India, that were not specifically proposed.
"These adverts have traveled wider than we expected," says Egill, noting that more than four million people have watched the content on YouTube.
"We couldn't have requested a better start."
The photos here at the opening were taken by Morgunblaðið photographer Árni Sæberg during the shooting of advertisements entitled "Let It Out" in the middle of last month.
The filming took place in many places, such as Skólavörðustígur in Reykjavík, Reynisfjördur, Skógarfoss, Sólheimajökull and in a cave by Hjörleifshöfði.
Directors were Samuel Bjarki Pétursson and Gunnar Páll Ólafsson at Skoti productions and cameraman Óttar Guðnason.
The roles in the films were Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, who is from Cuba and Hungary.
Dozens of Icelanders were involved in the production of the advertisements, but at the same time as recordings were made in South Iceland there was another group in West Iceland and the Westfjords.
According to Egils, "Let It Out" is only the first part of the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, with the aim of a winter campaign in collaboration with M & C Saatchi.
"This is just the first phase of this work for Iceland Post," says Egill, adding that the collaboration with M & C Saatchi has been extremely successful.
"Working with them is great.
In such projects, it is important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the markets we are talking to. "
Explosive Sand: Discuss the situation in the labour market, pension funds and much more
The Minister of Social Affairs and Child Affairs, Ásmundur Einar Daðason, arrives at Sprengisandur starting at ten o'clock at Bylgjan today.
He is also Minister of Labour and discusses the situation in the labour market as such, the Icelandair issue and other issues.
He also discusses rural issues and the export of jobs to a disadvantaged country that has been controversial in recent years and decades.
VR Chairman Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson will also attend the show, where he will discuss his criticism of pension fund investments and put forward ideas for the union movement and employers to withdraw from the fund's boards in order to reduce the risk of conflict of interest.
Ívar Ingimarsson, a tourist in East Iceland, and Árnheiði Jóhannsdóttir, Managing Director of the Nordic Marketing Agency, will also discuss the situation in rural tourism.
They will look forward to the autumn and wonder if the success of the summer is a misleading premonition about what is to come.
You can listen to the show below, starting at 10: 00.
This is what she looks like today 25 years later
Actress Elisa Donovan had a successful career in teenage shows of all kinds.
However, she gained world fame for her acting as Amber in the film Clueless 25 years ago.
She also appeared on Sabrina: The Teenage Witch with Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury and in Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49, married with one child.
She hasn't had much trouble lately, but she recently got to look across the road and comment on Clueless on Australian television.
She talks beautifully about Brittany Murphy who died unexpectedly in 2009 and says she was a great person.
"I have to admit, I based the character mostly on girls I met in school who weren't nice to me.
As soon as I read the script, I knew who this character was, "Donovan said about his play in Clueless.
Didn't want to leave the police station after overnight accommodation
About fifty cases came to the attention of the Reykjavik Metropolitan Police today and the police diary says that the cases were varied.
The day at the police station on Hverfisgata began with police having to interfere with a man who had recently been released from a holding cell after staying there because of drunk driving.
The man did not want to leave after he was released and did not follow the orders of the police who told him to leave.
The man earned himself a continued stay at the police station because of his progress.
A man was arrested in the morning suspected of burglary into a company in Kópavogur.
Police also had to intervene in two men in Breiðholt as a result of a report of assault.
It also happened that a woman who was eating at a shopping mall in Kópavogur was unable to pay for the bill after the meal, so the police were called.
The theft of a car in the town centre was also reported this morning.
The driver of a white Renault van looked off her for a while and was then taken by her free hand.
The car has not been found.
The curse of the Joy Orchestra - The horrible fate of the Joy Stars
The Internet theory has reached a flight that the series about the Joy Orchestra is cursed, while actress Naya Rivera recently drowned in California, becoming the third lead actor of the series to die far ahead of her age.
The Glee series is a popular series about singing, dance and joy.
The series was about the so-called joyful band of high school teenagers, their love and fate.
Being in the joyful band wasn't always taken out with bliss, but through singing and dancing, the characters of the series seemed to be able to overcome any circumstances in their lives.
But outside the set, there have been great disasters over the cast and staff of the series, so there have been theories that the series is cursed.
Naya Marie Rivera played the role of Santana Lopez on the series, a cheerleader who didn't call everything her grandmother.
After the season had expired, Rivera married actor Ryan Dorsey and had with him her first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and subsequently divorced.
Dorsey declined to file a complaint, however, and the domestic violence case was dropped.
On 8 July last year, Rivera was reported missing after her four-year-old son was found alone drifting in a boat on the lake Lake Piru, California.
The boy was found asleep in a life vest on board the boat and he was able to tell police authorities that he and his mother had stabbed themselves swimming, and then Rivera had brought him back to the boat but never returned there themselves.
An extensive search for Rivera began.
The day after the search began, the local police commissioner reported that during the search it was presumed that Rivera had drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found and officially declared dead.
She is believed to have experienced a heavy current load in the water and made use of her last claim to save the son.
The cause of death was recorded as accidental drowning.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith played the role of Finn Hudson in the series, the American football player with the angel voice who played a key role in bringing the Happy Squad to honor and respect.
Outside the series, however, Moneith struggled with personal demons.
Since he was 13, he had struggled with addiction and found it difficult to escape it.
In 2013, his colleagues on the series felt that was enough, intervened and encouraged him to seek help.
Moneith then went to rehab and everything seemed to look for a better way.
Just two months after completing his treatment, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after going out to have fun with friends.
Banana stone turned out to be a fatal combination of drugs and alcohol.
It was not believed to be a willful act.
Moneith had undergone treatment and his resistance to drugs had declined to such an extent that a dose he had previously tolerated well turned out to be fatal.
He was only 31 years old when he was killed.
His death fell heavily on his colleagues, but at the heart of his opponent, Lea Michele, it was decided to continue the series and devoted a whole part to the memory of Moneith and his character Finn.
Mark Wayne Salling played the role of Noah "Puck" Puckerman in the series, Puck was an American football player, like Finn, and had little respect for his colleagues in the Joy Orchestra, or until he gained the courage to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his home in Los Angeles suspected of child pornography custody.
An enormous amount of child pornography was found during a search at his house, and the case was soon heard in public.
It was clear that Salling was done.
He was subsequently charged and convicted of his offences.
He had four to seven years in prison as well as having to be on the sex offenders' register and seek treatment for childcare.
Before the judge had determined the punishment, Salling, who was then on bail, was found dead near his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
It wasn't just the actors of the series who fell off far in advance.
Jim Fuller was Assistant Director of the series.
He was urgently summoned to sleep in 2013, at the age of 41.
A woman named Nancy Motes also worked on the series.
She was the younger sister of superstar Julia Roberts and didn't bear her sister the beautiful story, but she accused Roberts of her great control and degrading behaviour.
Motes took her own life in 2014, but she struggled with severe depression.
She left a letter to her fiancé saying that her mother and sister were responsible, among other things, for how she was arranged.
"My mother and my so-called siblings get nothing after me except the memory that they were the ones who caused my worst depression."
Leah Michel was the star of the series.
She has recently been accused of bullying and aggressing her co-stars on set and having aggressive observatories.
Jesse Luken played a guest role on the series in 2012.
He was arrested and charged with drunk driving in 2019, which was considered a major scandal.
Actress Heather Morris played a major role in the series.
She suffered in 2010 from unorthodox hackers getting into nude photos of her and publishing them on the Internet.
Actors Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both starred on the series and had an affair outside the series.
Benoist later reported that Jenner violated her in the relationship.
You can put flowers on almost everything
It increases children's development when they are allowed to play in the garden with their parents to grow flowers and watch them grow and thrive.
It can also be done endlessly with flowers, as Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Just having a moment with the children in the garden is something that will never be forgotten.
They will remember the flowers, the aroma and of course the precious time they received with their parents.
Bought himself a boat after tenth grade
"I don't think we are many fishermen who work in the country's kindergartens," says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, who goes coastal fishing during the summer but studies psychology at the University of Iceland during the winter. "
Coastal fishing is a very convenient summer job when you're studying.
If you're well fished, you can have a good income, and I think it's great to be able to skip taking student loans.
The income is also good enough for me into the winter, "says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, a 25-year-old psychology student, who is engaged in coastal fishing this summer as in recent summers.
Axel had just docked in Tálknafjörður when a reporter spoke to him late in the evening at the beginning of the week. "
"In the winter I was in tenth grade, I took boatmasters' rights for boats less than twelve meters long and I bought my boat the summer after finishing elementary school.
I've been coastal fishing on my boat ever since.
I bought the boat used by my acquaintance, Hartmann Jónsson, and I named the boat his name.
Hartmann had grown up when I bought the boat and stopped being at sea and he was very happy when he saw that the boat had his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took over the boat, "says Axel, adding that he bought the boat at three million.
"I entered into a contract with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of summer and the other half at the end of summer when I had already caught.
So I had the boat indebted at the end of my first summer on it. "
But how could a boy have one and a half million to pay out in a boat when he had just finished elementary school?
"I had already contributed and raised money, I had been working with my dad at sea when I was a boy, I spent all summers fishing with him and got my share.
I also put my bar mitzvah money into my boat fund. "
Axel was born in Ísafjörður, from where all his mother's people are, but he has lived in Kópavogur since he was a boy.
"I'm allowed to fish here in the west because I have a legal domicile with my grandmother in Ísafjörður.
I studied these areas in the west from rowing with my dad.
I move between the fjords depending on how I feel, as this fishing area covers the entire Westfjords.
Although I find it best to stay in the west, I have also fished around Snæfellsnes peninsula and elsewhere.
I have also fished in the south, preferably a grey release, "says Axel, who always roars one early in the morning and says that he's sometimes talking to the seagulls and singing for the sky, alone in the prom sea for hours.
"The internet connection at sea is good, so I can call, listen to buffet shows and music.
I don't think it's a problem to be on my own.
Of course I try to avoid being in danger, but certainly occasionally something has been wrong with the weather, but never much danger, "says Axel, who is lucky that he is never seasick.
He says the length of the working day depends on how the fishing goes at any given time.
"In coastal fishing, I'm never more than 14 hours fishing at a time, but I have also been fishing in other systems, for example in the rental quota, when I have been fishing continuously for one and a half days grazing at sea."
The arrangement for coastal fishing, he says, is such that he can catch 770 kilos a day, which he feels is inhibitory.
"Other restrictions are that I am not allowed to fish Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and I am only allowed to fish twelve days a month, during the four months of coastal fishing, in May, June, July and August.
In my opinion, fishermen should choose their days of fishing depending on the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is on people to row instead of having 48 days all summer and be able to choose in their own way.
This could also be enjoyed by the regionalization because of me, and marine space that is well located by the fishing grounds should be enjoyed, "says Axel, who mainly reduces cod from salted sea water during his coastal fishing, but also only sauna and individual other species float along.
Axel works for the winter with the university program at Nupur kindergarten in Kópavogur.
"I don't think we're many sailors working in the country's kindergartens," says Axel proudly, adding that he only intended to work temporarily in the kindergarten.
"I got stuck there because I think it's an awesome job.
I hope that psychology will benefit me at kindergarten level in the future, "says Axel, who has also come a long way since his studies in business administration.
An error in registration prevented return care
An error in the registration form that people complete when they enter the country caused a person residing in Iceland not to be called back for testing.
It is not a condition to register a personal identification number if the person completes the form in English, as is the case when this is done in Icelandic.
"This will be examined this week," says an expert at the Directorate of Health's Disease Prevention Department.
Three domestic infections were diagnosed at the virology department of the National Hospital yesterday.
One of those who turned out to be positive entered the country on 15 July, two days after the entry into force of the rules on so-called return care.
Those who resided in Iceland are then screened on arrival in Iceland and re-summoned for testing four to five days later.
It was stated in RÚV's lunch news that the person in question had followed the old system.
The sampling at the border was negative and he was not called back for screening for the virus.
Kamilla Rut Sigfúsdóttir, expert at the Directorate of Health's Disease Prevention Department, said in a conversation with the news agency that this was due to an error in the electronic registration form.
If people complete the registration form in English, it is not a condition to insert a personal identification number as is in the Icelandic version.
This was primarily intended for foreign tourists.
Therefore, the person in question has not received an automatic invitation to be tested.
Kamilla says, however, that many people have followed the rules on the return portal even though they have filled the registration form in English and in some cases employers have also been alert to sending people back for testing after they arrived in the country.
"This week we will look into how to make it easier for people to access this to draw their attention to the process."
The man is in isolation and six people have been quarantined.
They all undergo testing, but two were beginning to show symptoms.
Infection tracing is now underway with the three infections diagnosed yesterday, mostly completed due to two infections reported on Friday.
In both cases, a sequence analysis of Icelandic genetic analysis has shown that it contains variants of the coronavirus that have not been found here before.
In the second case, the ties have focused on Israel although it is known that the person who brought the virus into the country had also traveled to other European countries.
Kamilla says it should be known tomorrow where the other virus was coming from.
A total of 15 people are now being isolated according to the web COVID. is.
135 people are in quarantine.
Four out of five infections unconnected
Five domestic infections have been diagnosed in Iceland in recent days.
Of these, four are completely unrelated and, for example, the origin of the infection that occurred at the Rey Cup Sports Tournament yesterday has not been found.
Infectious tracing is still ongoing.
Originals in the early thirties were exceptionally sent into quarantine, but the number was reduced to sixteen.
A total of 34 people are in quarantine due to these new infections diagnosed yesterday.
This is the second time in a short period of time that infection has been diagnosed at a sporting event, which has raised questions as to whether such events should be held.
Jóhann K. Jóhannsson, liaison manager at the National Commissioner's Civil Protection Department, says that this is well possible, as long as people follow criteria and rules.
"We are constantly urging all those living here to maintain individual biosecurity measures.
We also need to urge people who are holding events that there are certain rules in place that need to be followed.
Events can also be held, "says Johann.
He says that infections can be prevented by maintaining individual biosecurity measures.
In addition, the rules and criteria are under constant review.
"What has to be done, and what the Civil Protection Department and the Directorate of Health are constantly urging people, is to consider these individual biosecurity measures.
Both at home and also at service companies.
That people wash their hands and use a burst.
This prevents infections from moving forward, "says Johann.
"We need to urge people to continue on the good road we were on in order to sustain the results we have so far achieved."
40% of COVID-19 victims had diabetes 2
Devon Brumfield heard over the phone how difficult her father had to catch his breath.
Her father had diabetes, so she urged him to seek medical attention.
The next day, he was dead.
The death was attributed to sudden breathing difficulties due to a coronavirus infection.
Diabetes was indicated on the death certificate as an underlying problem and Brumfield, who also has diabetes, is terrified that the same will happen.
Reuters News Department says Brumfield's fears are not unfounded.
The figures of a new study conducted by the US authorities show that almost 40% of those who are deceased had diabetes 2 as an underlying disease.
When the proportion of those who had not reached the age of 65 is examined, the proportion rises to half.
An investigation by the US Disease Prevention Service (CDC) involved more than 10,000 people in 15 states who died of the coronavirus between February and May.
Jonathan Wortham, an infectious disease expert at the CDC, says the results are striking, not least for those diagnosed with diabetes 2 and their loved ones.
Was hidden in slow growth, Reuters commissioned a survey, suggesting responses from the 12 states that responded to equivalent ratios.
10 states, among which are California, Arizona and Colombia, are not yet reporting underlying diseases.
"Diabetes was already an epidemic in slow growth.
Now COVID-19 has broken through like a powerful wave, "Reuters quotes Elbert Huang, CEO of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago.
Diabetes is more common among blacks and people of South American origin, who have also fared worse from the coronavirus.
One of the best preventive measures for those with diabetes 2 is to contain the condition through exercise, a healthy diet and the assistance of health care professionals.
However, the coronavirus pandemic has made it difficult for many to maintain routine.
In addition, the high price of insulin has forced some to continue attending work, thereby risking being exposed to the virus.
Reuters points out that US authorities may have been aware of the dangers that the virus may pose to those with diabetes 2.
As the SARS coronavirus passed in 2003, more than 20% of them had the disease, and during the swine flu pandemic in 2009, this group was at three times higher risk of having to be hospitalized.
When MERS was observed in 2012, one study showed that 60% of those who died or were admitted to intensive care had diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz scientist at Yale University says that because the effects of the COVID-19 virus could last longer, the pandemic has uncovered a number of unprecedented complications.
"I fear that we will see a tidal wave of problems when this is over," says Andrew Bolton, chairman of the International Diabetes Association.
Doctors have warned that the coronavirus pandemic may indirectly lead to an increase in complications related to diabetes, including kidney disease and renal dialysis.
Likewise, new studies suggest that the coronavirus may lead to an increase in the number of diabetic cases.
Reuters says scientists are trying to understand the link between the coronavirus and diabetes 2.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs and kidneys, organs that are already sick in many people with diabetes.
In this case, a high rate of glucose and lipide in diabetics can produce a true "cell messaging storm," as it is called when the immune system responds too aggressively and attacks the body.
Damaged endothelial cells can also lead to inflammation, which in turn can cause a fatal blood clot.
"It's all one big puzzle," says Dela Cruz.
"It's all connected to each other."
The story has been corrected.
"We were offered champagne, then they left the room"
The couple Ásrún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason accepted an unusual request from artist Ragnari Kjartansson to have sex in front of a camera for a work that the artist was installing in Paris.
"We loved each other so it wasn't complicated."
Atli Bollason will never forget the first time he met his wife and mother-in-law, Ásrún Magnúsdóttir.
"I was very fascinated by her.
Of course, it was just the radiance, but then I thought it was quite unheard of cute, too.
And still thinks so, "he says.
Ásrún remembers this, too, as the husband recalls the first meeting regularly.
"I'm always hearing this story.
Last just this weekend, "she says, who was also attracted to her husband at first encounter.
"I felt and felt so agitated around Atli, which I like.
There's a lot going on and a lot going on and I was fascinated by it. "
Atli said that he and his wife had focused on going their own way in their relationship.
"We don't tie our bales to the same knots as fellow travellers.
We avoid routine that we analyze around us. "
That's possibly why they just welcomed the talk from artist Ragnari Kjartansson, although that was the least unusual.
"Our mutual friend Kristín Anna contacted us and asked if we could come to eat desert with her, Raggi and Ragnar's wife Ingibjörg, at Snaps."
They accepted the invitation, met the trio at Snaps and had desert wine and separate desserts.
They listened to Ragnar who led them through his plans to an art exhibition he intended to set up in Palais de Tokyo, Paris in the autumn.
"He had a multifaceted video work called Scenes from western culture.
He described it in a simple way. "
Ásrún says that he described the work as banal and decadent scenes from the everyday lives of Westerners.
"He had sketches of all the scenes he was going to shoot and last time he told us about what he wanted to know if we were interested in participating in."
The scene that Ragnar asked the couple to take part in was supposed to show a young middle class couple making love in a minimalist room.
"These are intercourse with the beginning and the end," says Atli.
The couple didn't know Ragnar much even though they knew about him and him about them, "but they knew us and thought we fit into it.
They had a word that they didn't want to advertise for people.
Maybe they didn't think they would get the right people, but people who would get sexual masturbation from performing for others. "
They said goodbye to Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it didn't take long.
"When we walked out of Snaps, we said: Aren't we just ready for this?
It was just like that.
I trust Ragnar as an artist and his whole team, "says Ásrún and Atli.
"It's about love and intimacy"
The scene was filmed in a finer apartment on Mýrargata.
There was a very small film team; a cameraman, Ragnar and a soundman and the couple.
After a recording had been turned on, everyone left the room to wait in the car except Atli and Ásrún.
"We hadn't decided how to be.
We had some little instructions, but we tried to forget about time and place.
Being unaware of what we were doing and for whom.
Nothing was played, we just loved each other, so it wasn't complicated, "says Ásrún.
But was that romantic?
"Yes, it was a little romantic," says Atli, and Ásrún agrees with that.
"We were offered champagne before they left the room.
It was a little like being on vacation in a nice hotel in Paris. "
The team was delighted with the couple's performance in the piece that moved them.
"When Tommi the cameraman looked at it, he cried, he thought it was so beautiful," says Atli.
"It's as much about love and intimacy as the sexual intercourse itself," says Ásrún.
The couple's parents have seen the work and Atli says that his mother heard the voice in the son at the Reykjavík Art Museum and realised that he was part of the work.
"Then she turned around and began to think about it," says Atli.
"Mom and Dad saw this in Paris.
We hadn't told anyone that way, but then my dad just sent me a message saying: Nice to come across the little family in Palais de Tokyo, "Ásrún recalls.
And I wonder if the participant in the work has deepened the relationship between Ásrún and Atli.
"At least we're still together, so maybe it deepened something.
At least this deepened my relationship with my father-in-law, "says Ásrún, laughing.
Ásrún herself saw the work in Copenhagen with her colleague.
"I found it a little difficult not to be with you but with someone else," she says, turning to her husband.
"But it was nice to see this because it's only one scene in a much bigger piece, and when you saw it with the other pieces, it's really cool.
I could tear myself away from this a little bit and I was just proud.
And there was the little bean in my stomach, "says Ásrún, who was pregnant with one of the couple's children when the scene was filmed.
"It was just beautiful."
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke to Ásrún and Atli in Love Stories on Rás 1.
Swansea with a win in the first semi-final
Swansea won a 1-0 victory over Brentford in a dramatic match.
This was the first game of the teams in the semifinals to qualify for the English Premier League.
The game took place at Swansea's home stadium in Wales.
The score at half-time was 0-0.
The locals in Swansea received a penalty in the 64th minute, but Andre Ayew failed the archery from the penalty point and had it defended.
Just two minutes later, Brentford player Rico Henry received the red card.
So Brentford played the rest of the game fewer, and in the 82nd minute Swansea players took advantage of the team difference.
Andre Ayew then compensated for the penalty trumpet by scoring a great goal and guaranteed Swansea a 1-0 win.
Swansea will therefore lead 1-0 in the duel, while the second match will take place next Wednesday at Brentford's home stadium.
Ambassador free for five years since 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, US Ambassador to Iceland, is in the media spotlight after CBS reported this morning that he wanted an armed bodyguard as he feared for his life.
However, appointing an ambassador to Iceland has not gone without difficulty for the President of the United States.
Since Carol Van Voorst resigned as Ambassador of the United States at the end of April 2009, the country has had no ambassador in total for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst resigned in strange circumstances, but Spotlight reported in 2009 that she should have received the Falcon Medal.
On her way to a farewell meeting with the President of Iceland, she received a call from the Presidential Office to the effect that she would not be honored with the medal.
After disappearing from Iceland, she taught international relations at Army War College.
Sixteen months passed until Van Voorst's successor came to office in September 2010.
This is partly due to the fact that Robert S. Connan had been appointed ambassador but then cancelled.
The post was finally taken over by Loius Ariega, who had served in the Foreign Service for decades.
He then retired in the autumn of 2013 and took office as Ambassador to Guatemala.
Then took over another ambassador free period.
Robert Barber was approved by the United States Congress in January 2015 and came to office shortly afterwards, when no ambassador had been on site for 13 months.
Barber was politically appointed and not a diplomat, but had worked as an attorney and supported Barack Obama's campaign fund.
He retired as soon as Donald Trump took over the presidency on 20 January 2017, as is customary with politically appointed ambassadors.
It took the Trump administration an extraordinary period of time to appoint both ambassadors and high-ranking government officials in Washington.
It took two years for the United States Congress to summon Jeffrey Ross Gunter to ask him questions and confirm him after that as Ambassador to Iceland.
In his parliamentary testimony, he said he had never been to Iceland but often to Western Europe, but his deceased wife had been broken from Dutch rock.
Gunter is politically appointed, was formerly a dermatologist in California and has been a prominent member of the Republican Jewish Coalition.
Casino owner Sheldon Adelson founded that organization, but Adelson is an enthusiastic supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to work in Iceland in May 2019, when no ambassador had been in the country since early 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest example in Iceland.
The reason is both how long Trump's administration was appointing key members as well as the fact that in recent years the work of the US Congress has been greatly delayed, including confirming an ambassador to office.
Since 2009, the total ambassador to Iceland has been out of office for over five years.
However, this has not prevented construction work carried out by the Embassy, which recently opened its headquarters at Engjateig.
The projects are estimated to have cost around 6.5 billion, while smooth safety walls surround the building and bullet-proof glass is in all windows.
However, it doesn't seem to have been enough to fill the current ambassador with a sense of security because he is said to fear for his life and has requested an armed bodyguard.
Former IBV player suffered racism in Iceland - "It was a mistake to come to Iceland"
Tonny Mawejje, a former IBV player, claims to have suffered racism when he was in Iceland and that he regrets coming to Iceland.
This is reflected in an interview with Tonny published on the Ugandan media Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined the Uganda Police FC team that plays in Uganda's top league.
In his interview with the Daily Monitor, Tonny discusses many things, including his time in Iceland, playing with IBV, Val and Sports in Iceland.
"When I came to Iceland, I didn't play in the middle the way I used to play.
The team captain was in that position, but in addition, he also had the jersey number I wanted, so I didn't get either of what I wanted, "says Tonny, who played on the right flank of the season with IBV.
Among the things Tonny talks about is the racism he suffered in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players are exposed to when playing in Europe.
"This happened to me once, but since I didn't understand the language, I just ignored what was said to me.
Later on, I heard about the matter, and then I asked my friend what it was all about.
He told me then that my opponent made racist comments about me after I tackled him. "
In 2014, Tonny left Iceland for Norway where he joined Haugesund.
That's where he says he made the mistakes he regrets most.
Tonny had not been able to join Haugesund's starting lineup, but he wanted to play more to join the national team.
Then he asked to go back to Iceland on loan, when he joined Val.
"It was a mistake to come back to Iceland on loan.
I think if I had stayed in Norway longer, I would have had the opportunity I wanted, "says Tonny, who hoped that if he would play well in Norway, he would probably go further.
He wants to mean that the loan to Iceland destroyed his dreams of joining a major team in Europe.
Found a worm in a woman's neck
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8-cm long black worm in the tonsils of a woman who searched there.
Doctors managed to pull the worm out with forceps.
An investigation revealed that it was a parasite.
CNN reports this.
The woman had eaten sashimi, which are thin slices of meat, a few days before.
The woman improved quickly after the worm was removed, but parasites such as these are often present in raw meat or fish.
Since sushi penetrated the West, the number of cases where parasites have been infected has increased, according to CNN.
Fear that another wave is about to begin in Europe
Spain is now a focus in relation to concerns about another wave of coronavirus in Europe, where the government has taken action to prevent the spread of the coronavirus pandemic again.
In Catalonia, all entertainment life has been put on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona where the number of infections is increasing.
Other European countries have also taken action to increase the number of infections in Spain, but in the United Kingdom everyone has to go into quarantine on their return from Spain, as in Norway, and France has been warned against travel to Spain.
Infections are also on the rise again in France and Germany, as governments try to find a balance of curbing the spread of the virus and restarting the economy.
However, the situation in Europe is good compared to elsewhere in the world, but the global incidence of infections is approaching 300,000 a day, including the most infections in America and South Asia.
Confirmed infections have reached 16 million worldwide, according to a Johns Hopkins University census, and deaths confirmed to be related to the virus have reached 644 thousand.
Gerdur's mosaic work is finally able to enjoy itself to the fullest
In front of the Reykjavík Customs House is a large and deep hole.
Above it are men wearing orange helmets.
There is also a large grave there.
And more smaller construction machinery.
The street is closed to traffic.
But the sidewalk is passable, where many stop and look at works of art made of millions of mosaic tiles - as if they had never seen it before.
Maybe they've never seen it before.
At least don't imagine that.
The work has so far been somewhat hidden, directly in front of it were parking spaces that were always besieged.
People parked there, locked the car in a hurry and then jumped off to do their business in the city centre.
"Vibrant and diverse public spaces" and "attractive city taste" are a guiding light for the current restoration of Tryggvagata.
The goal is to beautify the area and allow Gerður Helgadóttir's mosaic work at the Customs House to enjoy a better view.
In front of the project there will be a square and since the area lies close to the sun, it is considered suitable as a resort for road users.
The artwork will be illuminated and the material will now be better enjoyed than before in this 142 square metre area.
There will also be small "fog sprinklers," a kind of water sculptures, that offer play and provide a certain degree of mystery to the area.
In this way, the renovations are described by the city of Reykjavik, which is currently undergoing construction together with Veitur.
The pipelines of water supply, heat supply and electricity supply will be refurbished.
Many of them have reached their age, but the waste water pipeline and cold water pipeline date back to 1925 and have therefore served residents and businesses in the town centre for almost a century.
When the street is reopened after construction, cars can drive around it again.
However, it will be a one-way street while creating a quieter and more accessible space for pedestrians.
Information about the Customs House on the Directorate of Customs's website says that the building was opened in 1971, whose architect was Gísli Halldórsson.
Because the harbour damage reached through the house, a 250 square metre windowless wall area was created to the street.
The building committee and architect agreed that such a facet would adversely affect the overall street picture, if no special measures were taken to adorn the appearance of the building.
The parties therefore agreed to expect to have a permanent work of art set up there.
At this time, a great word was spoken by artist Gerði Helgadóttir, according to the summary.
She had worked extensively on works of mosaic art in Germany and elsewhere.
The plan was to contact her first before deciding whether to hold a competition for the work.
It had often been discussed that the work had to mirror the life by the harbour, as the harbour had been the livelihood of Reykjavík since its construction.
When talking to the artist, she became a trax obsessed with such a work.
It was agreed that she would receive drawings and other assistance before leaving the country, where she would work on the proposals abroad.
Gerdur got the time she herself decided to be needed, and when she returned home, she put forward a number of proposals for discussion.
It was agreed without delay to ask her to do the work.
At the same time, a complete contract was requested with her and the famous German art company, Brothers Oidtmann, who had long worked with them on the installation of famous works of art across Europe.
Contracts were concluded and Gerdur did the artwork under the installation of the workshop of the brothers, who were then responsible for the installation of the Customs House.
The whole work was exceptionally well performed, both by Gerður Helgadóttir and the Oidtmann brothers, according to the summary.
It has ever since resisted the harsh Icelandic weather.
It took Gerdi about two years to carry out the work, which was carried out and installed in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after the Customs House was completed, at the age of 47.
Prepares for the export of more institutions to the country
The Minister of Social Affairs, Ásmundur Einar Daðason, calls for more public institutions to be exported to Iceland in the near future.
That's what the Minister said on the show Explosive Sand on the Wave at noon.
Recently it was announced that the fire department of the Housing and Construction Agency will be moved north to Sauðárkrókur this autumn.
Six fire experts work for the agency but none of them intend to follow the agency north and the National Association of Firefighters and Ambulance Movers has criticised the migration.
"I think we should take further steps into this creature.
I'm preparing for further steps into this creature.
Further transport, "said Ásmundur.
He says that he is convinced that the vast majority of the population wants to see more distribution of public institutions around the country.
"I think there is a need to make further political decisions on the export of public jobs to the country, as I was doing with the Housing and Construction Agency," said Ásmundur, who also took examples of other institutions that have been exported to the country that were of great importance to communities in the country, such as the transfer of the Food Safety Authority to Selfoss, the Icelandic Surveys to Akranes and unemployment insurance in Skagaströnd.
All the main things from the second day of the Championship
94. The Icelandic Free Sports Championship ended at Þórsvöllur in Akureyri today.
Several tournament records were set on the second day of the competition.
An exciting competition was expected in women's sledgehammer throwing at Þórsvöllur, while Vigdís Jónsdóttir from FH set Iceland's record in a sledgehammer throwing in 2014, which lasted until Elísabet Rut Rúnarsdóttir from ÍR improved the record in May last year.
Vigdís won the Icelandic record back earlier this summer and has been in fantaform lately, but she has tripled the Icelandic record for the rest of the summer.
Elizabeth Ruth has been struggling with injuries and did not recover today.
She had only one out of five valid throws, throwing 25.69 metres, which is far from her best.
Vigdís threw for the longest time today, or 60.08 metres in her last attempt, while at the same time setting a tournament record.
Her Icelandic record she set earlier in July is 62.69 meters, although she was somewhat away from it.
Gudrun Karítas Hallgrímsdóttir from ÍR had the second best throw of the day, but she improved her best results with a throw of 50.18 meters.
In the men's category, FH player Hilmar Örn Jónsson, the Icelandic sledgehammer record holder, won a safe victory, throwing 73.84 metres in his second last throw and setting a tournament record.
His Icelandic record in the industry is 75.26 meters.
Guðni Valur Guðnason, Olympic and Icelandic record holder in a round throw, won a globular competition at Þórsvöllur yesterday, but today he competed in a round throw, which is his main subject.
Guðni Valur's Icelandic record is 65.53 metres, but he threw the longest 59.13 metres today and secured the victory.
Valdimar Hjalti Erlendsson threw the second longest today, but he had one valid throw in second place, 49.43 meters.
Hafdís Sigurðardóttir, Iceland's long jump record holder, won the long jump competition with excellence, while Hafdís jumped the furthest 6.25 metres today, which is almost 40 cm from her Icelandic record.
In the women's 200-meter race, it was IR-ing Guðbjörg Jóna Bjarnadóttir who was the fastest but she reached the finish line in 24.04 seconds, while her Icelandic record in the industry is 23.45 seconds.
Guðbjörg Jóna was victorious in Akureyri, winning two gold medals yesterday, in a 100 meter race and in a 4 x 100 meter race, as well as in a 4 x 400 meter race today.
In the male category, Kolbeinn Höður Gunnarsson from FH was the first to finish in the 200-metre race in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of Óliver Már Samúelsson from Ármann.
Like Guðbjörg Jóna, Kolbeinn Höður won gold in the 100 metres yesterday as well as in the 400 metre race.
Doesn't receive a fine for a Bitcoin harvest of ISK 27 million
The Central Tax Committee has rejected a claim by the Tax Investigator who demanded a fine on a man for understating his capital income resulting from the sale of Bitcoin's electronic coin.
The committee concluded that the Tax Investigator had not argued clearly why it was necessary to fine the man.
The committee's ruling states that the tax investigator considered the man to have submitted materially incorrect tax returns for the income years 2016 and 2017.
He would have understated his capital income resulting from the sale of Bitcoin's electronic currency of 27 million, either intentionally or negligently.
The man should be fined for his conduct.
The man rejected it in a letter to the committee.
However, he agreed to have sold electronic coins for 27 million in 2016.
It would have been acquired by digging in 2009 and 2010 when it would have been both easy and undoorable with a normal home computer.
He also pointed out that when he sold the electronic currency, the tax implementation due to such sales had been significantly unclear and unpredictable.
Citizens could hardly have been expected to be aware of such measures on a tax return.
He would not have intended to avoid paying taxes on the harvest and would have explained his property on a return as a deposit in a foreign exchange account.
He would have inquired both knowledgeable and the Directorate of Internal Revenue about how this was done but without success.
He also believed that account should be taken of the fact that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he began digging for Bitcoin.
He would therefore have been in a worse position than others to study complex rules that the tax authorities would not have formed a clear opinion on.
The man therefore considered it appropriate that his taxes for these two income years should be redetermined and the burden levied, but otherwise not punished.
He reiterated that he worked in Iceland and had paid taxes in Iceland since 2012.
He would never have intended to unduly escape his duties.
The claim for a fine would be disproportionate and would plunge him into debt.
Brynjólfur raised a conversation: "This man understands what football is"
Brynjólfur Andersen Willumsson has been considerably between people's teeth but has also been impressed because of his progress for the remainder of the season with Breiðablik in the Pepsi Max League.
Tinks will be in the fireline tonight when they receive ÍA live on Channel 2 Sport.
Brynjólfur will then take out a play ban on four reminders during the season, so he will not be playing with a new haircut as in summer games so far.
He had had "blah, blah, blah" written on his head before the match with HK last Thursday, which HK won 1-0.
"I don't know who exactly he was answering with the payment, but speaking of character, this one was definitely trying in the game.
He didn't go into hiding.
He wants the ball every time, and if there was anyone going to equalise this game, I thought he would do it or make it, "said Guðmundur Benediktsson in the Pepsi Max stands when it came to Brynjólfur.
"I'm supposed to be here for the people."
"It's difficult sometimes to figure out what position he's in.
He searches out a little bit to the left as the games begin to pass, but he has a very free rule in the team, "said Hjörvar Hafliðason.
Thorkell Máni Pétursson says that Brynjólfur is a real entertainer and welcomes getting such a colourful man into the league: "No one disputes that this is a character.
It's a fun type and I love it with my hair, and being always ready to show up and answer in interviews.
There are incredibly many people busy with him, who tell me that this man understands what football is about.
"I'm an entertainer.
I'm supposed to be here for the people and enjoy it. "
The people are reading the interviews with Brynjólfur, people are paying in and watching what's next on his hair.
This man is just a genius, "said Moon.
KR player says he wants to leave the club - "I have been in contact with several teams in the B league"
Tobias Thomsen, a KR player in the Pepsi Max League, seems to be leaving the team.
According to Danish media Bold, Tobias is ready to return to Denmark.
Football.net also reported on the matter.
Tobias wants to reach the beginning of the season in his home country, for which he first has to terminate his contract with KR, where the Danish league starts before that Icelandic likelihood.
The company knows that I miss Denmark and has shown me a great understanding, "Tobias said in a conversation with Bold.
"I have been in contact with several teams in the B league and will probably switch over before the end of the Icelandic season.
There are not many teams in Denmark that can afford to pay up my contract with KR. "
He also says that he probably has to undertake a reduction in wages and salaries in Denmark.
"Companies in Denmark have probably experienced more of the economic impact of the virus than in Iceland."
Bicycle whisperer Bjartmar has recovered bikes for millions - Now answers for himself according to DV coverage
For over a year Bjartmar Leósson has had a hobby unlike most others.
He sniffs and rescues missing and stolen bicycles, electric bikes and scooters.
Bjartmar has earned the name "bicycle whisperer" as a result.
There was a considerable feather yesterday when you published an account of your dealings with Bjartmar.
DV then referred to discussions on the West Side Facebook group stating that Bjartmar spoke to the man at Austurvöllur and said the scooter could possibly be stolen.
It was only possible to read from the original writings of the electric shuttle driver that Bjartmar had thieved him.
That text has now been edited on Facebook and the headline of the original DV story updated accordingly.
Bjartmar says that the original news of the case is not at all representative of what really went on yesterday at Austurvöllur.
Bjartmar said that he had received information from the victim of electric shuttle theft that it was truly his own electric shuttle.
That information was received by the alleged owner from others, but the information turned out to be incorrect, Bjartmar says.
"I saw the guy and I recognized the shuttle, as I had information that there was an electric shuttle that had been missing for a very long time and had been searched for.
I certainly hesitated first, but when I saw him get ready to drive off on the shuttle, I decided to make a punch to talk to the man.
The owner was sure of his fault, so I decided to have a conversation with the man.
In general, I go very finely into something like this, but before I managed to finish what I had to say, the man had taken off the word. "
Bjartmar says that the man on the electric shuttle immediately invited him to show him the receipt for the bike and called the police himself.
"Yes, cool," Bjartmar said, "let's just get this straight."
Then the owner of the electric shuttle proved ownership of his electric shuttle and drove off.
Later, the rightful owner of the electric shuttle told us about his story on Facebook, as reported in a previous report.
This over a year Bjartmar has been engaged in this activity, he says he can count the times he hit one side with people on one hand.
"I have had peaceful relations with Reykjavík's hardest men," Bjartmar said, pointing out that bicycle thieves are by far the smallest brothers and sisters in society, addicts, people with mental disabilities and other people who are on the street for some reason.
"Addiction is a tough master and somehow the next dose has to be financed, unfortunately the theft of such movable property is an easy way to achieve that goal," Bjartmar says.
"My dealings with these people are actually so good that I have brought many of the good people with me.
Examples are that people have gone to rehab and taken care of themselves and then come to me and help me with what I'm doing, "he says.
In general, Bjartmar's interaction with cyclists is polite.
Some know about him and what he's doing and offer peacefully to show him receipts, bike star numbers and so on.
Bicycle theft is a major problem that has been little dealt with.
Furthermore, Bjartmar says that the police are even beginning to point people to talk to him about stolen bicycles.
Bjartmar disagrees with DV's previous news release and says that he is not some kind of self-appointed police in personal search of justice.
Asked if he is still not on slippery ice with his actions, and if this is not primarily the role of the police, Bjartmar says that he certainly is.
"Of course the cops are supposed to do this, but the fact of the matter is that the cops are simply not doing this.
For example, I've watched police officers drive away from a large heap of stolen bikes.
She is frankly powerless in these matters. "
"When the cops are not doing anything about it, and it's just in front of your nose, and experience has shown that I can succeed in this area, why not?" Bjartmar asks.
He claims to have made so much progress in tracking down stolen bikes, that sometimes he bumps into his "clients" on the street that they just straightened out the Bjartmar bikes they had previously recovered.
The times Bjartmar has called for police assistance, it has happened that she simply does not show up.
"It's just not working with the police, and it's not my fault and it's not the fault of the owners of the bicycles," Bjartmar said, and is sorry that victims of bicycle theft have to suffer from police emptiness in this area.
Bjartmar's success is not disputed.
You can find stories of people in many places to thank Bjartmar for getting their belongings back to them.
Bjartmar himself says that he has long lost the figure on the number of bicycles he has returned, but the sums probably run at millions, if not millions.
Weigh there electric scooters, electric bikes and electric shuttles heavily, but electric bikes can cost up to half a million.
Bjartmar works by day in kindergarten and every other weekend he works in a cohabitation.
So his bicycle search is an unpaid job he does in his spare time.
Pension funds and long shadows
The year 2019 was a great anniversary year in the history of pension funds in Iceland.
Admittedly, officials had retired from the King of Denmark all the way since the 19th century, but in 1919 an officials' pension fund was set up, which eventually became a pension fund for all civil servants.
The basis for the current pension funds for civil servants was then laid down by a comprehensive collective labour agreement in 1969 which provided for occupational pension funds with compulsory membership and a qualifying fund collection from the beginning of 1970.
In 1974, laws were passed on the basis of these agreements and the pension scheme continued to grow stronger thereafter.
Employees' pension scheme was not the only radical change driven by the labor movement of the 20th century through its wage struggle.
Unemployment insurance had been obtained in a similar way in a historic strike conflict in 1955, as well as gradually pursuing its demands for sickness rights and sickness funds, substantial leave entitlements, reduction of working hours, housing reform and other important matters.
All these rights cost a great and rigorous struggle, but in retrospect they turned out to be much higher and more permanent wage compensation than an increase in the number of ounces in the pay envelope, which disappeared as soon as possible into the chalk of inflation that characterised the period after the war until 1990 as many remember.
The prelude to the establishment of general pension funds in 1969 was both long and complex.
Although people finally agreed that the funds would in fact be the property of fund members, the union movement had to agree that their boards should be composed of equal representatives of employers and fund members.
In the years following the establishment of the funds, the requirement for a majority of employees on the board of the funds was often discussed in employees' organisations, but it never succeeded, so we still have such abnormal arrangements that representatives of fund members do not hold a majority on the boards of the funds.
Article 36 of Act No. 129 / 1997 on Mandatory Pension Insurance and the Activities of Pension Funds deals with the investment policy of the Funds.
It states in point 1 that "a pension fund shall be guided by the interests of fund members."
It is also stated in point 5: "A pension fund shall establish ethical criteria in investments."
The shareholder policy of the Tradesmen's Pension Fund contains, inter alia, the following provisions, following the aforementioned legal provisions:
The Pension Fund is a member of the United Nations (UN PRI) Code on Responsible Investments, along with many of the largest pension funds and professional investors in the West Sea and Europe.
The rules discuss how focus on environmental and societal issues as well as good corporate governance can contribute to improving the investment performance of portfolios.
Thus, the interests of investors and the objectives of society coincide in a broader context.
LV believes that it is important for companies, particularly those listed on the stock market, to establish a public policy on: to maintain good governance of social responsibility and the environment.
The Pension Fund Values, which is one of the country's largest funds, has established a "responsible investment policy," which contains provisions of a similar nature.
This is all recalled here as an introduction to Icelandic's latest fashion word, "Shadow Management."
As the word is new in the matter, there is no hope that it has been fully defined, but it seems to me that the following definition is now "most widely taken": Shadow management is when a union leader says in the media that he intends to send recommendations or instructions to members of the Pension Fund Board on how to take a position on a particular matter.
If they do not follow the recommendation, they will be removed from the Board at the earliest opportunity.
However, if the leader does not deal with this in the media and does not talk about dismissal, it is not "shadow management," as this kind of communication between people is of course common in the financial world, as elsewhere.
I leave the reader to reflect on which way he thinks is "more shady."
In particular, there are two people who have attempted to formulate this definition at the time of writing, on the morning of Saturday 25 July 2020.
These are Hörður Ægisson, journalist on Fréttablaðið, and Ásgeir Jónsson, Governor of the Central Bank.
The occasion arose after Bogi Nils Bogason, CEO of Icelandair, had stated his intention to terminate the company's contracts with flight attendants and flight attendants (terminate them), and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairman of the Reykjavík Chamber of Commerce, sent out a recommendation to the company's representatives on the Board of Directors of the Pension Fund of Commercial Officers not to support the fund's potential acquisition of shares in the company, otherwise they might be removed.
Some time later, Bogi Nils withdrew his decision, followed by Ragnar Þór following his recommendation, which was of course based on Bogi's decision.
Nevertheless, Hörður and Ásgeir saw reason to talk about the matter in the Newspaper's Friday newspaper in big words about shadow management, criminal offences and the strong need for amendments to the law.
A small cap was certainly supposed to overturn a heavy load even though the blessed cap had been in an attachment mode and was also erased quickly.
Since the issue is important, let's consider the subject itself at the end.
I outlined above the issues in the Pension Fund Act pertaining to this matter.
These imply that fund managers should protect the interests of fund members and have ethical investment criteria, and these issues are elaborated in more detail in the statutes of both Valid and the Tradesmen's Pension Fund, as I mentioned.
However, pension funds should NOT look solely at short-term profitability considerations in their investments.
This would be a very dangerous policy and do not have to look for long for examples of this in the past, as large loans from banks and funds have accrued to immoral adventurers and environmental slobs, with tragic consequences.
The CEO of Icelandair was obviously on slippery ice when he thought of wiping out a whole group of employees, thereby significantly reducing the goodwill that the company has enjoyed in the Icelandic market and weakening its position towards investors.
Fortunately, he took care of himself and pulled this back.
Time reveals whether this is sufficient for the investment of pension funds in the company to be considered responsible to fund members at the end of the day.
The author is a former professor of physics and scientific history.
One of the infected did not take return care
One of the three diagnosed with Covid-19 in the country yesterday arrived in the country from the Baltic State on 15 July last year, about a week and a half ago.
He is an Icelander who does not reside here on a regular basis and therefore did not receive clear instructions to carry out so-called return care after arriving in Iceland and undergo another sampling a few days after his arrival.
He received negative from border screening.
"But he is in Icelandic society and should actually go on that resort," says Kamilla Jósepsdóttir, expert at the Directorate of Health's Disease Prevention Department and Deputy Epidemiologist while on summer vacation, in a conversation with Fréttablaðið today.
"He used the English registration form and there is no obligation to register the personal identification number, and if the personal identification number is not registered, you are not automatically invited to the second sample."
She says that the man could have used the English registration form because he actually resides abroad, but because of his network in the country as an Icelander, he should rather have used the Icelandic one.
At least he didn't realise this.
"When the personal identification number is not registered, you have to seek to enter the second sampling yourself.
Neither he nor his employer seem to have realised that that was the right way, "says Kamilla.
"So it is clear that we need to strengthen the information on this while we find some way to create an automatic messaging system even if Icelanders do not register their personal identification number.
Or to make it somehow more obvious who are members of Icelandic society in the registration system, "she explains.
Fortunately, however, the person concerned hung out with few people on arrival in Iceland, although he is defined as a member of Icelandic society, being an Icelander.
Only six people have been sent into quarantine since he was diagnosed yesterday, all six of whom were in contact with him.
They are yet to be tested, although two of them are beginning to show symptoms of Covid-19 infection.
The man received a negative from his sampling at the border on 15 July.
Camilla says it was likely that he was so recently infected with the virus that it could not yet have been detected in him when the sample was taken at the border.
However, she does not want to rule out that the man was infected here in Iceland but did not carry the virus with him to the country.
"You can't quite argue that this is definitely an imported infection because it's been so long since he came to the country that he might have been exposed here like those two who have caused a little shortage in connection with the sports tournaments."
That's what she says, however, is highly unlikely because of how few people were around here.
"In fact, it's highly unlikely," says Kamilla, noting that it cannot be ruled out until Icelandic genetic analysis has sequenced the virus in man.
"If we get a type of virus that hasn't been seen here before, it's almost certain that he carried it to the country."
Pepper spray and bombs deployed against protesters
There was a conflict between police and protesters in Seattle last night.
Police used pepper spray and non-lethal grenades by protesters, while protesters smashed windows and set them on fire.
45 protesters were arrested and 21 police officers were injured.
Police violence and racism were protested across the United States last night, while the protests in Seattle were in support of protesters in Portland, Oregon State.
In Austin, Texas, one protester was shot to death.
As stated on the BBC, the attacker has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands gathered in peaceful protests.
A group of people then set a construction site on fire and smashed windows in the city's courthouse.
Subsequently, the police said the protest was a riot and there was a conflict between groups of protesters and the police.
Require justice In Aurora, Colorado, Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old black man who was murdered by the police in August last year, was remembered by protesters.
A car drove through a group of protesters in the city but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of members of the Black National Guard gathered and demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman who was murdered by police at her home last March.
The group carried a firearm and marched in formation to a closed intersection where police separated the group from a group of people who protested against the protest and also carried firearms.
Then 75 were arrested in Omaha, Nebraska, where protesters remembered James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man murdered by a white bar owner in May.
Solskjær: Not the game that defines our season
Manchester United footballer Ole Gunnar Solskjær does not want to overstate the importance of the match with Leicester today in the final round of the English Premier League.
If United loses the game, and Chelsea won't lose against Wolves, Solskjær and his men will be in 5th place, thereby missing out on Champions League seats.
However, they should still expect to qualify for the Champions League by winning the Europa League next month.
"We're not at the terminal yet.
If we reach a point against Leicester, I think people will say that we have now not had a bad season, "Solskjær said.
"But whatever happens, this is not the end of our journey because we still have quite a bit to do with catching the two teams above us," Solskjær said.
It is clear that human nerves will be stretched at 15 o'clock today, but Solskjær tried to pretend that it was any other game.
"If you want to belong to Manchester United, you have to get used to being under pressure in the last game of the season.
This is nothing new, and on this the company is based.
We have created a great opportunity to end the season well and now it's for us to take advantage of it, "Solskjær said.
"This is not the most important game of the season, this is just the next game.
You can ask anyone in football, the next game is always the most important one.
The results do not define our season, we have already had many moments to define this period. "
"The arrival of Bruno Fernandes changed a lot for us and I believe that we are in better shape and much stronger mentally than last season," Solskjær said.
65,000 infections per day
65,490 new infections of the coronavirus were diagnosed in the United States yesterday according to John Hopkins University.
A total of 4,178,021 infections have been confirmed in the West Sea since the beginning of the pandemic in that country.
900 died of the virus yesterday, but in the last four days until then, deaths due to the virus were more than 1,000 per day.
A total of 146,460 deaths due to the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
CNN reports that according to a forecast model from the US Disease Prevention Authority, the number of deaths caused by the virus will reach 175,000 on 15 August.
Fear of the second wave of the pandemic
Spain's authorities are now trying to restrain the increased spread of COVID - 19 in the country with weakness.
Spanish health authorities reported over 920 new cases of COVID - 19, both on Thursday and Friday.
No more people have been diagnosed there in 24 hours since the beginning of May, and the reports come at the same time as the Spaniards begin lifting one of the strictest curfew in Europe.
The backlash led British authorities to now oblige passengers arriving from Spain to quarantine on their return.
A week earlier, Spain was included in Britain's list of safe states.
The worst situation is in Catalonia in northeastern Spain, where the government has resorted to broader restrictions to try to stem the growth.
In the capital Barcelona, entertainment venues will be closed for the next two weeks and wave houses will be required to close at midnight.
A curfew is now in force for 200,000 inhabitants in Segria County in western Catalonia.
It is believed that Britain's decision will have a negative impact on the Spanish economy, which relies heavily on the arrival of foreign tourists and is badly played after the pandemic.
Tui, the UK's largest travel agency, cancelled all flights planned today to Spain and the Canary Islands.
Governments around the world are said to be preparing for the second wave of the pandemic, but there seems to be little interest in taking back an extensive curfew that has devastated the economy in many places.
For example, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has handled this very badly, comparing it to nuclear weapons that he does not want to use.
French Prime Minister Jean Castex has also said that the nation "would not survive, economically or socially," if a nationwide curfew was again imposed.
Many policymakers hope that local resources covering residents of individual towns, cities or regions will suffice to restrain the virus in the next round if they arrive.
Five new infections in Iceland - Three Domestic
Three domestic infections were diagnosed yesterday as well as two more at the border.
Thus, five persons with a positive Covid-19 infection were diagnosed yesterday in Iceland.
The Civil Protection announcement states that one infection is related to the infection reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football tournament.
The person has been sent to isolation and sixteen who were in close contact with him in quarantine.
The infected person participated in the social activities of a sports club in Reykjavik and, according to the announcement, "only part of the sports team" is in quarantine.
Others who were sent into quarantine are otherwise connected to the man.
The origin of this infection is undetected and contact tracing is in full swing with the National Commissioner's contact tracing team.
The tournament hosts of the ReyCUP tournament have followed the Disease Prevention and Civil Protection Agency's instructions and protocols that are still in force, and appropriate measures have been taken.
However, photos of the tournament yesterday attracted attention as it could be seen in a very close interaction to celebrate the success of his team in the field.
Just before 11 o'clock today, tournament hosts posted the following notice on their Facebook page.
It read "NOTE: Parents please respect the rules for competitors to pick up their own stuff at the school.
Parents are NOT allowed to do so.
Thanks for the shown understanding. "
Another infection was diagnosed yesterday but is related to the infection reported the day before yesterday.
According to the announcement: "Icelandic genetic analysis has sequenced the infection and a new type of virus has been found that has not been diagnosed here before."
Contact tracing in this case is also underway and the infected person is in isolation and 12 in quarantine because of the infection.
The third infection in question is from a man who came to Iceland 11 days ago, July 15th.
He was diagnosed in the southwest corner of the country.
The person is now in isolation and six who were in close contact with him in quarantine.
Two of them are already showing symptoms of a viral infection.
In addition, two were diagnosed at the border, waiting for the outcome of further investigations as provided for in the border infection procedure.
Finally, the announcement states: The National Commissioner's Civil Protection Department and the Directorate of Health urge people to be careful and pay close attention to individual biosecurity measures.
If there is least doubt as to whether symptoms of the Covid-19 virus are present, the same person is asked to take a test at the nearest clinic.
Patreksfjörður says the camp site is booked for a shopping weekend - Direct visitors to another
The camp site in Patreksfjörður is fully booked this weekend, according to a notice from Vesturbyggð.
Guests are advised to explore other accommodation options.
Mentions Vesturbyggð Bíldudalur, Tálknafjörður, Melanes in Rauðasandur, Hótel Flókalundur and Hótel Breiðavík as other options.
There is plenty going on in Patreksfjörður this weekend, as like previous years, Skjaldborg, a festival of Icelandic documentaries, will be held in town.
It has been held since 2007 and has thus become a strong tradition in town.
Judging from the attendance at the camp site, good attendance can be expected this year if the weather does not change, but DV reported earlier today on a terrible forecast.
One can expect the worst weather in the south, however, and hope for the Patreksfirðingar.
The website bb.is first reported, and said that all other accommodation in the town was already fully booked.
An entire apartment building crumbles to the best location in the city
Romanian workers live at Dunhaga 18-20 for free.
Meanwhile, owners are seeking building permits for renovation, but their talk has been rolling through the system for a third year.
In one of Reykjavík's oldest, stony and most expensive neighbourhoods stands a splendid apartment building on three floors.
On the ground floor of the building there is about 600 square meters of commercial space.
Behind the house are the doors of two stairway enclosures, each holding four pretty splendid apartments.
These are between 93-130 square metres, although most of them are over 100 square metres.
The house contains quite a bit of history.
It was built in 1959 and has hosted a video rental, the shoe office, the milk shop of the milksalesman, Jóa gunsmith, fish sales and most recently a University rent.
The house has, to put it mildly, remembered its fairer fool.
The house is now heavily damaged, as can be seen in the attached photos.
The owner of the house is D18 Ltd.
The owners of D18 Ltd. are according to the business register among others Magnús Magnússon and Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir.
Magnús was the head of Borgun's ownership group and was the head of Borgun's holding company.
Among the owners of the holding company Borgun is Stálskip ehf.
Steel Ship Ltd. is the investment company of Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir and her children.
Gudrun is also the owner of one-third of D18 Ltd.
Gudrun and her husband, Ágúst Guðmundur Sigurðsson, once ran the fishing company Stálskip.
D18 Ltd. bought the house in the summer of 2009 and has therefore little or nothing been maintained since then.
Tell neighbors that the condition of the house has deteriorated steadily since then, although most in recent years.
On the Facebook page of neighborhood residents, one resident says that the house has "not been particularly lively in recent years."
It may play into the fact that owners have for several years sought to change the house and the plot.
Other neighbors say the house has long not been OK.
"It's long time to do something nice with this spot and I'm sorry it slowed down like this."
He also says that he is pissed at the owners of the house for not having driven himself to finish this, found some common ground with the neighbors of the house and stopped this "legal stopper."
"Do this just in consultation with the surrounding community so that you can hurry up and finish it."
"The "legal app" to which the resident refers is the planning process of the field that has been underway at least since 2017.
Then the owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 sought permission to build a floor on top of the existing apartment building and behind the house, a new elevator house and an extension on one floor as well as a basement.
The building permit granted for this project was appealed to the Environmental and Resource Appeals Committee and cancelled as the project did not support the division structure and the local presentation was not satisfactory.
The City of Reykjavik then launched a division planning work and completed it with a notice in the Official Journal in July last year.
That structure was also appealed against and cancelled by the committee in March 2020.
At this point, nearly three years had passed since the original application for a building permit and the owners of the building at the starting point.
At this time, the house had drowned down considerably and neighbors began to get tired.
When DV asked the house's neighbors about the situation and the reaction of neighbors, the answers were in various ways.
Some understood the intentions of the owners of the house, others not at all.
Others directed the anger at the city, others did not.
Others were just angry but nothing necessarily about anyone.
Still others said the parking spaces were hassle apples, while neighbors have used Dunhaga 18-20's unused parking spaces under their vehicles.
One complainant in the case said he was tired of the administration by far:
"That let's have to go through the process in trilogy is absolutely incredible.
It's like the city of Reykjavik doesn't know how to read. "
Today, the house stands empty, abandoned and is neglected.
A memorial to the late administration of the city and the noble plans of the owner and years of work of those who are now at the beginning.
When a reporter came to the courtyard at Dunhaga 18, he was faced with wide open doors and piles of garbage.
Playstation computer and recent television were lying among other debris on the ground - victims of Icelandic summer wetness.
The old University Print office was open, with quite a few cats judging from the smell of urine.
It is clear that someone has nested in one corner but no one can be seen.
Stacks of sofas and beds and a few pallets of geological pages, which were undoubtedly supposed to become a book, were obvious.
The stairway enclosures of the residential building were also open and life in both of them.
A reporter was lucky enough to come across the inhabitants of one of them.
Romanians were boiling potato dishes there for dinner and invited a journalist in.
The Romanians work for temporary agency Ztrongforce Ltd.
They have been there for some time and DV sources say that the company has paid nothing for the premises except heat and electricity.
Due to the condition of the house, it is not considered defensible to collect rent.
Judging from the standing post in the lobby of the building, it is clear that a large number of foreign workers have lived there in recent years.
Temporary agency operations have not been part of the Covid-19 situation, as the decline in tourism has led to a decline in the construction sector and these two sectors have been the most active in using temporary agency services.
Nevertheless, household members at Dunhaga 18 seemed to have plenty to do, and the scaffolding and mitts in the common areas hung out to dry after a long working day in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the miserable condition of the house, the apartment that the boys shared seemed to be well maintained.
When a journalist said goodbye to the boys of Romanian, the irony suddenly became clear to him: in the best location in Reykjavik, 1,500 square meters of real estate stands humiliated.
Owners want to change the house for better, and neighbors want an improved condition, but dispute over the definition of "improved."
In between, the city's planning department sits at the beginning, the victim of endless appeals and the possibility of appeals in the planning process, and the slow resolution of the Environmental and Resource Appeals Committee.
Romanian workers, perhaps exactly those who go into improving the situation, live in the house when the Icelanders stop arguing.
The article was originally published in the weekend newspaper DV on 17 July.
In an effort to combat overweight following the coronavirus pandemic
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Boris Johnson, will give £10 million to an overweight campaign, which will include a ban on fast food advertising, following his serious illness, partly due to his weight.
Johnson is expected to present the campaign, which has been renamed Better Health, tomorrow, Monday, but the campaign will encourage doctors to prescribe cycling for their clients in obesity, while efforts will also be made to increase the number of cycling paths.
Advertising of fast food restaurants on television will also be prohibited before 21: 00 at night, according to British media sources.
"COVID - 19 has raised us to the short-term and long-term risks of being overweight and the Prime Minister is determined that we must use the time to become healthier, more active and eat healthier diets," according to a government spokesman.
Johnson himself has had weight problems, but he was admitted to intensive care when he was infected with the coronavirus this spring, which is partly due to his weight as a result of which he is believed to have been so seriously ill.
Women better suited to lead the changes
She said that the new constitution was the biggest step that the nation can take towards greater distribution of power, transparency and in combating corruption and the interests of the whole.
"We need to start changing gear a little bit now and who is better suited to lead such changes than the group of society that is easier to be in these values.
These are women, "said Helga.
"Women in Iceland are famous for their female solidarity.
To stick together and be together to lead change.
So now it's just our turn to lead these changes. "
She said that she was a little anxious about the focus on Iceland as "the best in the world" in both gender equality and human rights.
"Then we're not as ready to look at what needs to be done.
Like Germans are very aware of their history and look at everything that needs to be done.
That's lots.
We have to know where we're coming from and know the story and listen.
Listen to the voices of marginalized groups.
We don't live with the same rules all here, "said Helga.
When asked, she said that women are in many ways in good shape in Iceland, but added that as in many other places, Icelanders live with extremely masculine values.
She said that politics was about, for example, her own interests, domination and power, which were the forces that maintained inequality in all societies.
"Women have now formed this group and come together and are just getting a little irritated that Parliament is reluctantly going to ignore this 2012 referendum," she said.
"It is these feminine values from which we are thinking.
Based on human rights and nature conservation, cooperation, and that we are all really on the same footing, "she said, adding that the aforementioned values were the basic values of the new Constitution.
"We are a very rich country of natural resources and it's absurd that there are people living in poverty here.
That's absurd, we can switch differently, "said Helga.
"It's absurd that it's some kind of law of nature that women's jobs are always lower paid.
It's ridiculous that flight attendants and nurses have to face a wage struggle indefinitely just to achieve a decent salary. "
The signature list for a new constitution can be signed here via electronic Iceland.
Tried to rob a pedestrian downtown
A man was arrested downtown last night after he threatened pedestrians and tried to get money from him.
The police also stopped the production of drugs in Árbær, where two people were arrested for the case.
The police also stopped the driver of a motorcycle in Hlíðir where its driver was at 146 km / h with a maximum speed of 60 km / h
Moreover, he had previously been deprived of driving rights.
The police in the capital area had enough to spin last night and more than 80 cases were recorded in the police diary from five yesterday to five this morning.
There was also particularly much noise reporting due to parties.
On Saturday night, eleven noisy parties were reported, which was considered to be a great deal in the police diary.
Last night, however, 22 noise issues found their way on board the police.
Six were detained in a holding cell last night.
In Árbær, police were summoned last night when the parties launched fireworks.
However, they had escaped by the time police officers came to the park.
Nine drivers were then stopped for drunk and / or drug driving.
Four people were arrested for fighting downtown last night, one of whom was detained in a holding cell.
Two were taken to the emergency room after they fell on their faces, one downtown and the other in Vesturbær.
One was transferred to the emergency room after he was injured jumping on a trampoline in Kópavogur.
In addition, police officers stopped a driver towing a caravan in Kjalarnes yesterday.
The caravan's bicycle gear, according to the police diary, was in "very bad condition" and it was detained.
You can stay in Monet's house this shopping weekend
The house, which impressionist Claude Monet spent the last forty years of his life in, is now for rent on the site Airbnb.
The next available nights in the house are during the shopping weekend.
The house is small and adorable, located in the town of Givenry, Normandie, France.
The world famous painter lived in the house from 1883 until his death in 1926.
The house has three bedrooms, two lounges and three bathrooms.
Monet was first inspired to paint her famous gardens in this house.
If anyone intends to rent the house, they must rent at least two nights.
Based on Airbnb's page, it's next available in a week, on Sunday of the Commercial Weekend, so it may be ideal for some merchants on vacation to hurry to book the painter's house.
The two nights over the shopping weekend cost no more than USD 964, or just over ISK 130.000, as Fréttablaðið comes next.
Dozens in quarantine and several of them are beginning to show symptoms of the disease caused by the coronavirus
Five people have been diagnosed with the coronavirus domestically in the last three days and most of the infected are unrelated.
Dozens of people are in quarantine because of this and several of them are beginning to show symptoms of the disease caused by the virus.
Three were diagnosed with the coronavirus domestically yesterday and two at border screening.
An expert at the Directorate of Health says that the growing number of domestic infections does not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading elsewhere into society.
"The first domestic infection has been sequenced and it's a virus that has not been seen here before, so we have no particular reason to think it has been sad in the community for some time.
This is probably something that has just come to Iceland, but of course we need to be very alert now, "said Kamilla Sigríður Jósefsdóttir, expert at the Directorate of Health's Disease Prevention Department.
Most of the infected have been in connection with persons who came from abroad.
Further testing will be carried out in the near future, but several people who were in contact with the infected are beginning to show symptoms of the coronavirus.
"Right now, there is no influenza going on and less of other respiratory infections, so we can be quite liberal about doing these tests on individuals who at influenza time would have felt there was a reason to do something else first," Kamilla said.
Infectious tracing is largely completed but it is not ruled out that more people will have to go into quarantine.
Two of the infected were diagnosed after attending sporting events.
It has raised questions as to whether it is representative to hold such events.
The Civil Protection Communications Manager says that this is well possible as long as people follow criteria and rules.
Kamilla says it's almost impossible for the infected to have been infected at the sports tournaments.
"If no more people go into isolation from these individuals after hanging out with them at these sporting events, then we can argue that our quarantine at the tournaments has worked.
But that is not revealed, "said Kamilla.
The Civil Protection Unit's procedures are under constant review.
"We need to be ready to intervene with further advice or restrictions if that seems warranted," Kamilla said.
In over a week, it is planned to extend mass restrictions to a thousand people.
This new situation could affect relaxations.
"Certain meditation to cook" - See Elisha Vidar's menu
Elísa Viðarsdóttir is a successful footballer and plays with Valur.
She is also a master's student in nutrition, a mother, and works as a food scientist.
She needs a lot of energy for the least of the day and most often takes the time to cook good and nutritious food.
My normal day starts by coming to work out of eight, "says Elisha.
"After work, I went to the store to prepare dinner before picking my girl up from kindergarten around three o'clock."
Elisha finds it very nourishing to pick up her daughter early from kindergarten.
"It's good to have time with her before I go to rehearsal later.
After rehearsal, it's good to come home and just have to warm up the food.
At night, when the girl is asleep, we like to watch one episode to empty our minds. "
Elisha doesn't follow any specific diet.
She is finalising her master's thesis in nutrition, so she knows well what suits her to eat to have enough energy to do work, school, family and exercise.
"What suits me is eating a wide range of food that is well composed of protein, carbohydrates and fat.
However, I think the most important thing is to have a healthy relationship with food and not classify food into bad or good, rather nutritious or nutrient-poor.
You see, it's okay to eat everything, just not all of a sudden and not always. "
Elisha is very interested in cooking.
"I find a certain meditation in standing in the kitchen cooking and therefore retrieving very much from it.
I must say that confidence is with me in the kitchen and I sincerely believe that I'm a decent chef. "
Breakfast: Oats, chia-seeds, hemp seeds, salt, a little lemon juice, leave in almond milk overnight.
Then top this meal with what exists at any given time.
Most often it's banana and crispy muesli & COFFEE.
I'm a big coffee woman.
Intermediate: Amazingly uneven, but fruits or vegetables, flatcakes, pure skyr with banana and muesli, bread with toppings, and then I could eat hummus with a spoon out of a box if appropriate.
Lunch: I often make myself all kinds of edible salads from what is available in the fridge, quinone or barley, falafel cups, rocket, oven baked vegetables with good dressing is a little what I'm working with.
If the layout is completely out of control (which happens often), the egg machine at work has come to my rescue quite often, and there are two slices of bread with butter, cheese and a boiled egg, put no more on you.
Intermediate: Get me something carbohydrate-rich for exercises, bread with toppings, breakfast cereals or fruits.
Dinner: Fish are chosen very often in my home, otherwise some delicious vegetarian dishes.
Clashes between police and protesters in Seattle
The city authorities of Seattle, Washington, have declared a rebellion situation following crowded protests in the city centre.
Police grabbed flash bombs and pepper spray yesterday to try to clear a large area conquered by protesters and stretched over many rentals in the vicinity of the city's parliament building.
The police announced on Twitter that at least eleven protesters had been arrested and that there was an investigation into sabotage carried out at a police station in the city yesterday, possibly with some kind of bomb.
The city and police say that protesters stoned the police with stones, bottles, detonator bombs and other loose items and one policeman was taken to a hospital where his injuries were repaired.
However, the protests in Seattle were peaceful for a long time in front of them.
They were blown to show solidarity between protesters in Portland, Oregon, where there has repeatedly been a fierce conflict between protesters and heavily armed federal troops.
Like other US cities, people gather under the banner of Black Lives Matter, recalls Georges Floyds, who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis on 25 May, protests systematic racism in American society and demands corrective action.
Not withdrawn until after the vote
It is not yet clear whether the dismissals of the flight attendants of Icelandair, which are due to take effect in the coming month, will be cancelled.
An electronic vote on the collective bargaining agreement between the Icelandic Stewardess Association on behalf of a stewardess at Icelandair will end at noon tomorrow.
Guðlaug Líney Jóhannsdóttir, chairman of the Association, says she is confident that Icelandair will not make a decision on the redundancies until the outcome of the vote is known.
"It definitely hangs together," says Guðlaug Líney.
"There have been no redundancies cancelled, these must be available so that the machines can be manned.
Then, of course, people are impatient to know if they will have a job after the end of the month. "
An agreement signed a week ago on the night of 19 July is voted for.
It is expected to be valid until the end of September 2025 and is based on an agreement that flight attendants had previously struck in a vote.
On 17 July, the Board of Directors and the Council of Representatives of the Icelandic Stewardess Association agreed to call for an all-military stoppage at Icelandair, and the members agreed to do so in a vote.
It never came to her, but this was decided following Icelandair's decision to cancel negotiations with the Stewardess Association, terminate all its flight attendants and seek agreements with another trade union.
In addition, the company's pilots were to take on the duties of security crew on board temporarily.
Asked how she believes the vote will go, Guðlaug Líney says it's hard to predict.
"People are wounded after this assault by Icelandair, when all of the company's flight attendants were terminated and informed that an agreement would be concluded with another union.
Now it turns out whether this has an effect, "she says.
940 flight attendants worked for Icelandair at the end of April, when 900 of them, around 95%, were cancelled.
Their period of notice varies, for those with the shortest working life is three months, ending at the end of July-August.
This group includes around 90% of Icelandair's flight attendants.
What will take over if the contract is not approved?
"Then we wish to continue discussions with our negotiators.
With this agreement, we are meeting Icelandair's demands.
If he is rejected, it is clear that flight attendants feel that they have gone too far. "
Voting on a collective bargaining agreement ends and Icelandair presents its second quarter financial statements tomorrow
The flight attendant's vote on a new collective bargaining agreement ends at 12 noon tomorrow.
Icelandair's financial statements for the second quarter will also be published tomorrow, but preliminary operating results indicate that the company's revenue has declined by 85 percent since the same period last year.
An electronic vote on the collective bargaining agreement between the Icelandic Stewardess Association and the Federation of Icelandic Employers for Icelandair began on Wednesday, 22 July, and ends tomorrow, Monday 27 July, at 12 noon.
Those who are allowed to vote for the contract are employees of Icelandair who pay membership fees to the stewardess company.
Icelandair and the Icelandic Kennel Club signed a new collective bargaining agreement on Sunday 19 July, but the previous Friday Icelandair had terminated negotiations with the company after the flight attendants cancelled the previous agreement in a vote in early July.
By then, Icelandair had terminated all of the company's flight attendants and flight crew on Friday, but they were withdrawn after a new collective bargaining agreement was signed.
According to a new collective bargaining agreement, flight attendants must fly five hours more a month for the same basic salary.
The collective agreement is valid until 2025, which has integrated the provisions between pilots and flight attendants on how long one shift can be flown.
The agreement was presented to members of the Icelandic Kennel Club at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica Hotel last Monday and many flight attendants who spoke to the news agency expressed dissatisfaction about the agreement.
However, most people seemed to agree that the agreement had to be approved to keep the Icelandic Kennel Club alive.
Icelandair's financial statements for the second quarter will be presented tomorrow, while EBIT, its operating results before capital items and taxes, is according to preliminary operating results negative by USD 100 to 110 million, or around ISK 15 billion.
Icelandair sent preliminary calculations to OMX ICE last Wednesday, which stated that the company's revenue amounted to around $60 million in the quarter, or around ISK 8.3 billion.
Cash and equivalent amounted to around USD 154 million at the end of the quarter, around ISK 21 billion.
Icelandair also plans to offer the company's share capital in August.
Icelandair plans to complete contracts with fifteen creditors, the government and the Boeing aircraft manufacturer by the end of the month before entering into a public offering.
New variant rather than new type of virus
"A new virus just means that this has been an individual who came from abroad.
This is not something that has been simmering in Iceland, "says Már Kristjánsson, head physician at the Infectious Disease Department of the National Hospital, about the reports that a" new type of virus "has been diagnosed in Iceland.
Three domestic infections were diagnosed yesterday and two at the border.
One who was diagnosed had been involved in the social activities of a sports club at the Rey Cup football tournament, but the origin of the infection is undetected and contact tracing is ongoing.
An infection was also diagnosed in a person who arrived in Iceland on 15 July and two people who were in contact with him have begun to show symptoms of COVID - 19.
They diagnosed an infection yesterday related to an infection reported the day before and after sequencing in Icelandic genetic analysis found "a new type of virus that has not been diagnosed here before."
Infectious tracing has been completed in connection with that infection.
Már notes that it is not a new virus but that it is the same virus that has spread worldwide, namely the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
It's more correct to talk about a new variant of that virus than about a new type of virus.
Asked what that means and if it could say something about the start of a second wave of the pandemic, Már says that there is currently a single case and it could go so that there will be nothing more out of it.
"However, if there are domestic cases that do not have connections from abroad and have the same genotype as this particular variant, this conclusion could be drawn [about the second wave] but it is premature at present," Már explains.
Happiness in the hot tub
Is the secret to Icelanders' happiness hidden in the hot tubs?
The BBC programmers lead to the likelihood in a wonderful video that highlights the country's pool and hot tub culture.
The Icelandic bathing culture is special globally and it is claimed that there are nowhere so many bathing places per inhabitant in the world.
The natural geothermal energy is the basis of it, but also the tradition of sundipping that prevails here.
Children's swimming lessons were mandatory in 1940, but older people are no less diligent in using the hot water for health benefits.
Swimming trips are described as a permanent part of the country's general welfare.
In the pot, everyone is equal, regardless of class and position.
Free from their mobile phones, people talk personally about home and space or enjoy the palliative power of the water: meditating and charging the batteries of their soul and body.
Steep to pick up a hundred days in elections
A hundred days have elapsed before Americans go to the elections and choose a four-year president.
Donald Trump is seeking re-election, although he is steep.
Joe Biden, the presumptive candidate of the Democratic Party, has a huge advantage over Trump nationally, taking polls into account.
According to a new AP News Department survey, a record number of Americans believe that the nation is on the wrong track.
Trump's response to the pandemic of the new coronavirus is also very unpopular, and moreover, more Americans than before believe that the President has had a bad economic situation.
Specifically, only two out of ten Americans say that the United States is on the right track.
32 percent say that they support Trump's response to the pandemic, and 48 percent say that he has handled the economy well.
In March, that percentage was 56 percent and in January it was 67 percent.
According to FiveThirtyEight's average, Biden's adherence is 49.9 percent at national level, while Trump's adherence is 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has attempted to shift attention from his performance toward the pandemic to Biden, promoting so-called cultural divides and proclaiming policies meant to relate to law and order.
However, Biden's candidacy makes great efforts to keep attention on Trump and believes that there is a high likelihood of winning if the election is actually about how Trump has done in the last four years.
Trump's unpopularity also seems to come down to Republican Party MPs, fearing that Democrats could even reach a majority in the Senate, which so far has felt very slow.
Politico recently reported that following a party and a candidate comparable to what it is now, the Republican Party would have its greatest demise in decades.
The suburbs have proved to be particularly bad for the party in the 2016 parliamentary elections and it is now likely that this trend will continue.
Trump has in recent days attempted to scare suburban residents to follow himself, including by saying that if Biden becomes President, he will destroy the suburbs of the United States and encourage racial disputes.
Among other things, Trump has waived a regulation since Barack Obama's time in the White House designed to diversify the suburbs.
Then he urged the "housewives" of the suburbs of the United States to read an article by the former Deputy Governor of New York claiming that Biden would destroy the suburbs of the United States and Trump agreed to that.
"Biden will destroy your neighborhoods and the American dream.
I will preserve it, and even make it even better! "said the president.
The population of the suburbs of the United States is an ever-growing group of voters.
According to NPR, they account for about half of all voters in the United States.
Ever since George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the candidate who has received the majority of the votes of this group has become president.
Except in 2012 when Mitt Romney received a majority of votes from this group but lost to Barack Obama.
Public opinion polls have shown that although Trump secured a small majority in the suburbs of 2016, his follow up there has declined significantly.
While there are differences between the polls, Biden has recently measured an advantage of fifteen percentage points over Trump in the outposts.
Regis Philbin is dead
American television host Regis Philbin is dead at the age of 88.
Philbin worked as an actor, show host, presenter and singer for about six decades.
He is best known for running the popular talk series Live! with Regis between 1988 and 2011 with Kathie Lee Gifford and later Kelly Ripa.
He has also directed shows such as Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and America's Got Talent.
According to Guinness World Records, Philbin is the person who has spent most hours on American television and has received recognition to that effect.
He won six Emmy Awards during his working life and was nominated 37 times in total.
A statement from his family states that Philbin died of natural causes.
A number of colleagues, friends and fans have remembered him on social media in the last 24 hours.
Will the Olympic fire be the light at the end of the tunnel?
After a final decision had been taken to postpone the Olympic Games, events so far conducted by only World Wars, the President of the International Olympic Committee said that the famous Olympic fire would be the "light at the end of the tunnel," referring presumably to the coronavirus pandemic that the world is now undergoing together.
Achievements have another year to prepare and the cost of the delay is compensated for by Japan's authorities.
At least everyone holds their heads, as there's a lot at stake.
When it was announced that Tokyo, Japan, would be the venue for this year's Olympic Games, the cheers of the Japanese representatives were genuine.
They wept and laughed alternately, as Tokyo had applied to hold the 2016 Games, but bent that time lower for Rio, Brazil.
This time, Tokyo City and Japan should bathe in the attention of the world.
The Games were scheduled to take place from July 24 to August 9 but have been postponed for a year, starting instead on July 23, 2021 and ending on August 8.
If the Games cannot be held, if the coronavirus remains too much of a threat, the Games will be cancelled.
At least no one wants to completely think that thought through.
Olympics are no ordinary sports competition.
Nothing is saved, the show should always be magnificent and strive to top the last games.
The selection of a city for the Olympic Games is based on the selection committee's assessment of the cities' presentations.
The more magnificent the presentation is - the greater the likelihood of getting the knee.
Tokyo spent $150 million trying to host the 2016 Olympics, which amounts to more than ISK 20 billion.
The second time, when the 2020 Games were applied for, $75 million, around ISK 10 billion, was put into the presentation.
In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo would receive the Games this year, the Japanese authorities had already spent ISK 30 billion on the project.
But this amount is just a drop into the sea considering how much it costs to build Olympic villages, stadiums and generally to strengthen the country's infrastructure to handle tournaments like this, prepare them and host the Games themselves.
Organizers in Japan have said that the Tokyo Olympics, which should have been running these days but have been postponed by one year due to the coronavirus, would have cost 12.6 billion dollars.
However, a report from the Statutory Auditor in Japan published at the end of last year found that the cost was almost twice that figure.
The cost of postponing the games is likely not to be fully estimated, but it has been estimated that it can cost between $2 and $6 billion in addition to the original cost.
The total cost for the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could therefore run between $15 billion and $30 billion.
There are so high figures that all tax revenues from the Icelandic state would cover only almost half of the Olympic Games, based on the lowest possible costs.
Olympic Games are an event of such a magnitude that they have often become the subject of economists who try to review numbers and look at the benefits and benefits of the Games.
In the shortest possible case, quite a few people seem to have concluded that the impact of the Olympic Games is less than positive for the economy of the cities that hold them.
There are some short-term effects, for example, the number of jobs increases greatly in the short term, but in the long term cities are often left with debt deficits and tremendous operating costs of little-used infrastructure.
Rio, Brazil, has significant debts due to the 2016 Games and has had trouble costing the maintenance of all the large sports facilities built before the Games.
Figures have been reviewed after the London Games in 2012, where it has been found that only 10 percent of those who received employment related to the city's Olympics were unemployed before.
That means that there were no new jobs except to a small extent.
In general, cities have not particularly benefited financially from hosting the Olympics because of the surging costs associated with the structures built for the Games.
However, the benefits are often considered to be increased traffic for tourists who want to visit the Olympic cities following the Games, although there is great uncertainty about the 2021 Games.
It is also unclear whether it will be possible to accept all the number of spectators who usually attend the games.
The main thing, however, is the honor for the cities to be chosen, but it is difficult to value for money.
Because despite enormous costs, it can also be said that the nature of the joy that the games bring is not such that a price tag can be placed on it.
But although the exhibition is often magnificent and there is nowhere to save, of course, it's not just about money.
It's the sports heroes who are in the foreground.
For some successful people, postponing the games is accidentally just appealing.
In her article at the latter Olympic Games, Australian and gold medalist Chloe Esposito is pregnant, for example, and would have been far from having fun this summer, but sees hope of being in competition shape for the 2021 Games.
She is therefore among the athletes who are just rather happy with the postponement, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who intended to leave after this year's Games, had they been held on time, the postponement of the Games in some cases means that they will cancel the competition before the Games take place.
Simply don't trust their bodies to go through another year of rigorous exercises.
Few athletes placed themselves as thoroughly in the hearts of the audience at the Rio Olympics 2016 as gymnastics star Simone Biles.
She brought home four gold around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has attended several interviews in his home country in the United States recently to discuss the Olympics.
She plans to attend the 2021 Games, although she is not necessarily confident that she will still be at the top of the Games next year, as she will then be 24 years old.
Although it is generally not considered a high age, it is higher for a leading gymnastician.
"This is a sensitive issue," says Biles, while smiling at one another in an interview posted on the Olympic Committee's Instagram page asked if she intended to go as far at the 2021 Games as she did in Rio 2016.
"I honestly don't know if I'll still be at the top after another year of practice," Biles says.
She has previously talked about her body not tolerating the stress of gymnastics training for much longer.
Nevertheless, she rehearses hard for the 2021 Olympics.
Biles admits that it was an uncomfortable feeling to have to stop rehearsing suddenly when the pandemic was high and the gymnastics hall was closed.
There were no exemptions for Biles rather than others while all sports facilities were closed for seven weeks.
All her Olympic gold couldn't buy any access over the others, she had to find various ways to stay in shape like others.
The basic form certainly a little better than in most people.
"We have a rigorous plan now.
It was difficult to start rehearsing first again after the gymnastics hall opened.
We started slowly but are fully crawling again and I will increase the exercises steadily as the year progresses.
Of course, we don't know exactly how these games will be or whether they will be held, but we still practice considering that they will be, can't help it.
I've worked too hard to leave the sport now, "says Biles.
With her, like others, there is doubt or perhaps rather awareness that there may be a situation where the matches will not be held at all in 2021 either.
At least predicting this is hopeless.
No one can know what the situation of the coronavirus pandemic will be like in July 2021 and nothing else to do but prepare for the Olympics considering that they will be held in a year.
Maybe the Olympic fire will be the light at the end of the Covid tunnel.
Postpone wedding due to pandemic
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding because of the coronavirus.
She was due to marry former Bachelorette contestant Wells Adams this summer.
"I think there are other more important things to think about right now," the actress said in a conversation with People.
"We would love to get married someday and have the dream wedding and have everyone present who cares about us.
But we decided to suspend that and focus on what's important right now, and that is to assist in sharing information on the importance of wearing masks and staying at home.
I look more at the world than at weddings these days.
There are many things going on and we should focus our attention on what's happening in the world. "
