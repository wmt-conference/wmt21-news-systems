Crying out for the world
The marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland seems to have fared well, and shouting and hollering in the wild has begun to pull in people far and wide around the world.
“You have the corollary, I need Iceland,” a woman out in the big world comments on an ad from the marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland on the content provider YouTube.
Another viewer said she will preserve Iceland in her heart for all eternity, and a young woman says she must directly reach Iceland as soon as possible, as her fiancé resides there.
Unfortunately, however, she is in the United States, so she expects to have to wait some months yet.
Another viewer asks if the hike to Iceland is achievable, because none are the planes.
Whether he comes from another time zone does not follow the story.
Egill Þórðarson of advertising agency Peel, who was involved in the creation of the ads along with international advertising agency M&C Saatchi, says reception has been hopeful.
“I came to many Inspired By Iceland campaigns that have been very successful, but this new campaign is already breaking records.
Basically, it's about creating PR values, it's getting foreign media to cover the campaign, and it's been amazing.
In a relatively short time, we've had coverage in about seven hundred media outlets worldwide, totaling roughly two billion people.
The value of that coverage is priced at 1.8 billion ISK.
It’s not pleasant.”
The main market normally is the United States, and the campaign has been very successful there, even though Americans aren't going to the country anytime soon.
According to Egils, well-known market areas like Denmark, the UK and Germany have also taken well, as has Russia, which is a convenient surprise.
Then there was a response from foreign regions, such as India, that was not specifically suggested.
“These ads have travelled far and wide than we expected,” Egill says, “but over four million people may have watched the content on YouTube.”
“We couldn’t have asked for a better start.”
The images here at the opener took Árni Sæberg, Morgunblaðið’s photographer, to take on ads titled “Let It Out” in the middle of last month.
The expeditions took place far and wide, such as on the Skólavörðustígur trail in Reykjavík, in Reynisfjara, by Skógarfoss waterfall, on Sólheimajökull glacier and in a cave at Hjörleifshöfði.
The directors were Samúel Bjarki Pétursson and Gunnar Páll Ólafsson of Skoti productions and cameraman Óttar Guðnason.
In roles in said shoot were Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, who is from Cuba and Hungary.
Dozens of Icelanders came to make the ads, but at the same time as the recording took place in South Iceland, another group was in West Iceland and the West Fjords.
According to Egils, “Let It Out” is only the first item in the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, but a winter campaign is planned in collaboration with M&C Saatchi.
“This is just the first phase of this work for Íslandsstofa,” Egill says, adding that the collaboration with M&C Saatchi was extremely successful.
“It’s great to work with them.
In projects like this, it’s important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the markets we’re talking to.”
Explosive spirit: discuss the state of the labour market, pension funds and much more
Minister of Social Affairs and Children Ásmundur Einar Daðason, attends Sprengisand, which begins at ten o’clock on Bylgjan today.
He is also the Minister of Labour and discusses the situation in the labour market as such, the Icelandair case and other matters.
He also discusses rural issues and the relocation of jobs to a country that has been badly mismanaged and contested over the past year and decades.
Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairman of VR, also attends the show, which will discuss his criticisms regarding pension fund investments and lay out ideas for unionization and employers to withdraw from the funds’ management to reduce the risk of conflict of interest.
Then we will talk to Ívar Ingimarsson, a tourist in East Iceland, and Árnheiður Jóhannsdóttir, managing director of the Marketing Office of North Iceland, about the situation in tourism in the country.
They will look ahead to the autumn and wonder if the summer's success is a misleading omen of what is to come.
You can listen to the show below, which starts at ten.
This is what it looks like today 25 years later
Actress Elisa Donovan had a successful career in teen shows of all kinds.
However, worldwide fame was given to her acting as Amber in the film Clueless 25 years ago.
She then also acted in the show Sabrina: The Teenage Witch along with Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury and in Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49, married with one child.
Little has happened to her recently, but she did get a look across the road and comment on Clueless on Australian daytime television.
She speaks fondly of Brittany Murphy, who died unexpectedly in 2009 and says she was a great person.
“I have to admit that I based the character most of the time on girls I met at school who weren’t nice to me.
As soon as I read the script, I knew who this character was,' Donovan said of his acting in Clueless.
Not wanting to leave the police station after a night out
About fifty cases came to the capital area police’s desk today, and the police diary says that the cases have been varied.
The day at the police station on Hverfisgata began with police having to intervene with a man who had recently been released from a prison cell after staying there due to drunken driving.
The man did not want to go away after his release and did not obey police orders telling him to leave.
The undercover man sees an ongoing stay at the police station because of his efforts.
Then a man was arrested in the morning on suspicion of burglary in a Kópavogur business.
Police also had to intervene with two men in Breiðholt for reports of an assault.
It also happened that a woman who was eating at a shopping mall in Kópavogur was unable to pay for the bill at the end of the meal and was therefore called to the police.
A vehicle was also reportedly struck downtown this morning.
The driver of a white Renault van glanced off her for a moment and she was taken unawares.
The car has not been found.
The Curse of the Pleasure Squad - The Horrible Destiny of the Globes
The theory has caught flight on the Internet that a curse lingers over the series about the Merry Squad, but actress Naya Rivera drowned in California at dawn, making her the show's third lead actor to be killed long ago.
The "Glee" episodes are a popular series about singing, dancing and joy.
The talks centered on the so-called joy squad of high school teenagers, their loves and fates.
It wasn't always taken out with the euphoria of being in the cheering squad, but through song and dance, the show's characters seemed to be able to overcome whatever circumstances arose in their lives.
But outside of the filming location, there has been a lot of hardship riding on the actors and staff of the show, so much so that theories have been raised that curses are on the show.
Naya Marie Rivera played the role of Santana Lopez on the show, a cheerleader who didn't call everything her grandmother.
After the series had run its course, Rivera went on to marry actor Ryan Dorsey and had with him his first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and subsequently divorced.
But Dorsey refused to press charges, and the domestic violence case was dropped.
On July 8 last year, Rivera was reported missing after her four-year-old son was found all alone adrift in a boat on Lake Piru, California.
The boy was found sleeping in a life jacket aboard the boat, and he was able to tell police authorities that he and his mother had jumped for a swim, and then Rivera had put him back in the boat, but never returned there herself.
The extensive search for Rivera began.
The day after the search began, the local sheriff reported that a search assumed Rivera had drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found and officially pronounced dead.
It is believed she encountered a large current in the water and made her last claim in saving the son.
Cause of death was listed as accidental drowning.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith played the role of Finn Hudson in the show, the American football player with the angelic voice who played a key role in bringing glory to the Glory squad.
Outside of the show, though, Moneith wrestled with personal demons.
Since the age of 13, he had struggled with addiction and found it difficult to escape it.
In 2013, his colleagues in the show felt enough, intervened and urged him to seek help.
Moneith then went to therapy and everything seemed to be looking better.
Only two months after he completed his treatment, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after going out partying with friends.
A fatal combination of drugs and alcohol was found.
It was not believed to be a voluntary act.
Moneith had undergone treatment and his tolerance for high-level drugs had decreased to such an extent that a dose he had previously well-tolerated, proved fatal.
He was only 31 when he died.
His death was heavily felt by his colleagues, but at the instigation of his counterpart Lea Michele, it was decided to continue the taking of the show and devoted a whole section to the memory of Moneith and his character Finn.
Mark Wayne Salling played the role of Noah “Puck” Puckerman in the show, Puck was an American football player, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellow students in the Merry Squad, or up until he gained the courage to admit he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his Los Angeles home on suspicion of possession of child pornography.
A search of his house found a vast amount of child pornography and the case was soon publicly heard.
It was clear Salling was finished.
He was subsequently charged and convicted of his offences.
Had four to seven years in prison, plus he would come to have to be on the sex offenders register and seek treatment for child lust.
Before the judge had determined the punishment, Salling, who was then free on bail, was found dead near his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
It wasn't just the show's actors who fell far short.
Jim Fuller was the show's co-director.
He preyed on sleep in 2013, aged just 41.
The show also featured a woman named Nancy Motes.
She was the younger sister of superstar Julia Roberts and didn't carry her sister's beautiful story, but she accused Roberts of high control and disrespectful conduct.
Motes took her own life in 2014, but she had severe depression.
She left a letter to her fiancé, claiming her mother and sister, among other things, were responsible for how she was placed.
“My mother and my so-called siblings get nothing after me except the memory that they were the ones that caused my worst depression.”
Lea Michel was the star of the show.
She has recently been accused of bullying and bullying her co-stars on location and having extravagant stardom.
Jesse Luken had a guest role on the show in 2012.
He was arrested and charged with drunken driving in 2019, which was considered a major scandal.
Actress Heather Morris played a major role in the show.
It was exposed in 2010 by rogue hackers accessing nude photos of it and posting on the Internet.
Actors Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both played the show and had affairs outside the show.
Benoist later reported that Jenner was violent in the relationship.
You can put flowers on almost everything
It increases children's development when they are allowed to play in the garden with the parents growing flowers and being allowed to watch them grow and thrive.
It can also endlessly be done with flowers, as Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Just having a moment with the children in the garden is something that will never be forgotten.
They will remember the flowers, the fragrance and, of course, the precious time they had with their parents.
Bought a boat by the tenth grade
“I don’t think there are many sailors who work in the country’s kindergartens,” says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, who fishes in the summer but studies psychology at the University of Iceland during the wintertime.”
Coastal fishing is a very comfortable summer job when you're studying.
If you fish well, you can have a good income and I think it's great to not be able to take student loans.
The income will also do me well into winter,” says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, a 25-year-old psychology student, who is fishing for the summer as recently as summer.
Axel was the latest to dock at Tálknafjörður when a reporter caught up with him late in the evening at the beginning of the week.”
“The winter I was in tenth grade, I took ship’s license for boats that are under twelve meters long, and I bought my boat the summer after I finished elementary school.
I've been coast fishing in my boat all summer since.
I bought the boat used by an acquaintance of mine, Hartmann Jónsson, and I let the boat be called his name.
Hartmann had grown up when I bought the boat and stopped being to sea, and he was very happy when he saw that the boat bore his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took the boat,” Axel says, adding that he bought the boat at three million.
“I made a deal with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of the summer, and the other half at the end of the summer when I would have fished.
So I had the boat without debt at the end of that first summer of my life on it.”
But how could a boy have one and a half million to pay out in a boat when he had just finished primary school?
“I had parked and collected some money, I had been working with my dad to sea when I was a boy, I was all summers fishing with him and got my share.
I also put my loading money in my boat fund.”
Axel is born in Ísafjörður, where all his mother’s people are from, but he has lived in Kópavogur since he was a boy.
“I may hunt here in the western area because I am domiciled with my grandmother in Ísafjörður.
I learned these areas west of here from rowing with my dad.
I move between distances depending on how I feel, because this fishing area covers all of the Westfjords.
Although I think it’s best to be west, I’ve also fished around Snæfellsnes and beyond.
I’ve also fished down south, but then I prefer greyhounds,” says Axel, who always mulls one early morning fire and says he sometimes speaks to the seagulls and sings for the sky, in the solitude for hours out on the balmy sea.
“The internet at sea is good, so I can call, listen to podcasts and music.
I don't think it's a big deal to be on your own.
Of course I try to avoid getting into danger, but certainly occasionally something has been wrong with the weather, but never a great danger,” says Axel, who is lucky that he is never seasick.
He says the length of the workday depends on how the hunt goes each time.
“In the coastal fishing I’m never more than 14 hours fishing at once, but I’ve also been fishing in other systems, for example in the rental quota, in which case I’ve been continuously for a day and a half grazing out at sea fishing.”
The coastal fishing regime says it is such that it can catch 770 kilos a day, which it finds restrictive.
“Other restrictions are that I am not allowed to fish Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and I am only allowed to fish twelve days a month, the four months of coastal fishing, in May, June, July and August.
In my opinion, sailors should choose their fishing days depending on the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is on men to calm down instead of having 48 days throughout the summer and be able to pick their own way.
So the regional division could go my way, too, and sea lakes that are well situated at fishing grounds should be allowed to enjoy it,” says Axel, who draws most of the cod from the salty seas of his coastal fisheries, but also only pollock and the occasional other species float.
Axel works during the winter time with the university at the nursery school Núpi in Kópavogur.
“I don’t think we are many sailors working in the country’s kindergartens,” Axel says proudly, adding that he only intended to work temporarily at the kindergarten.
“I got stuck there because I think it’s an awesome job.
I hope that my psychology studies will be of use to me at the kindergarten level in the future,” says Axel, who is also at an advanced stage of business studies.
Recording error prevented repatriation asepsis
An error in the registration sheet that people fill out when they arrive in the country resulted in a resident person not being recalled for sampling.
Registration of a personal identification number is not required if the person fills in the form in English, as is the case when doing so in Icelandic.
“This will be examined this week,” says an expert at the Directorate of Disease Control.
Three domestic infections were diagnosed in the virology department of the National Hospital yesterday.
One of those who tested positive arrived on July 15, two days after the rules on so-called repatriation contagion took effect.
Those who resided in Iceland are then screened upon arrival and again summoned for sampling four to five days later.
It was stated in RÚV’s noon news that the person, however, had followed the old system.
The sample at the border was negative and he was not recalled for screening for the virus.
Kamilla Rut Sigfúsdóttir, a specialist at the Directorate of Disease Control, tells the press that this is the result of an error in the electronic registration sheet.
Filling in the registration sheet in English is not a requirement for placing a social security number, as is the case in the Icelandic version.
Though it was primarily planned for foreign tourists.
Therefore they have not received an automatic invitation to take samples.
But Kamilla says many people have followed the rules of repatriation contagion even though they have filled the registration form in English, and in some cases, employers have also been vigilant about sending people for sampling again after they arrived in the country.
“This will be looked at this week how to make it easier for people’s access to this to draw their attention to the process.”
The man is in isolation and six have been quarantined.
They all go for a sampling, but two were starting to show symptoms.
Smiling is now under way with the three infections detected yesterday, which are largely over due to two infections reported on Friday.
In both cases Icelandic DNA sequencing reveals coronavirus variants not previously found.
In the second case, the bandits have targeted Israel, although it is known that the person who brought the virus to the country had also travelled to other European countries.
Kamilla says it should be known tomorrow where the other virus was coming from.
There are now 15 in isolation according to the website COVID.is.
135 are in quarantine.
Four out of five spreads offline
Five domestic infections have been diagnosed here in recent days.
Of those, four are entirely unrelated and, for example, have not found the source of the infection that occurred at the Rey Cup sports tournament yesterday.
Smiling is still ongoing.
The original third dozen were uniquely sent into quarantine, but this was reduced to sixteen.
Overall, 34 are in quarantine for these new infections detected yesterday.
This is the second time in a short period that a contagion has been detected at a sporting event and has raised questions about whether such events should be held.
Jóhann K. Jóhannsson, communications director at the rikispoli’s Civil Protection Department, says that’s a good thing, as long as people follow the criteria and rules.
“We are constantly urging all those who live here that individual infection control needs to be maintained.
We also need to urge people who are holding events that there are certain rules that need to be followed.
Then you can hold an event,” Jóhann says.
He says infection can be prevented by airing individual infection controls.
Moreover, the criteria and rules are kept under review.
“What needs to be done, and what the Civil Protection Department and the Directorate of Health are constantly urging people to do, is to consider these individual infection controls.
Both at home and so for service companies.
Washing hands and using alcohol
It prevents transmission from going forward,” Jóhann says.
“We need to urge people to continue on the good road we were on, in order to be able to sustain the progress we have so far.”
40% of COVID-19 victims had diabetes 2
Devon Brumfield heard the walking phone how hard her father had to breathe.
Her father had diabetes, so she urged him to seek medical attention.
The next day he was dead.
The death was attributed to sudden difficulty breathing due to a coronavirus infection.
Diabetes was identified on the death certificate as an underlying problem, and Brumfield, who also has diabetes, is terrified that the same thing is going to happen.
Reuters reports Brumfield's fears are not unfounded.
Figures from a new study commissioned by US authorities show that almost 40% of those who are dead had diabetes 2 as an underlying disease.
When looking at the proportion of those who had not reached the age of 65, the proportion rises to half.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) study involved more than 10,000 people in 15 states who died of the coronavirus between February and May.
Jonathan Wortham, an infectious disease specialist at the CDC, says the findings are sobering, not the least for those diagnosed with diabetes 2 and their loved ones.
Hidden in slow growth, Reuters commissioned a survey, pointing out the answers from the 12 states that responded to comparable rates.
10 states, which include California, Arizona and Colombia, are not yet reporting underlying diseases.
“Diabetes was already an epidemic of slow growth.
Now COVID — 19 has broken through like a powerful century, Reuters' Elbert Huang, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago.
Diabetes is more common among blacks and people of South American descent, who have also been worse off from the coronavirus.
One of the best protections for those with diabetes 2 is to control the disease through exercise, a healthy diet and the help of healthcare professionals.
However, the coronavirus outbreak has made it difficult for many people to keep their routine.
Meanwhile, high prices for insulin have forced some people to keep showing up for work, risking being exposed to the virus.
Reuters suggests U.S. authorities may have been aware of the risks that those with diabetes 2 could pose to the virus.
As SARS coronavirus passed in 2003, more than 20% of them had the disease, and during the swine flu pandemic in 2009, this group had three times the risk of having to be hospitalized.
When MERS did so in 2012, one study showed that 60% of those who died or were admitted to intensive care had diabetes.
Yale University researcher Charles S. Dela Cruz says that because the impact of the COVID-19 virus could last longer, the outbreak has taken away a number of previously unknown complications.
"I fear we will see a tidal wave of problems once this is over," says Andrew Bolton chairman of the Global Diabetes Association.
Doctors have warned that the coronavirus outbreak may indirectly lead to an increase in diabetes-related complications, including kidney disease and kidney dialysis.
Similarly, new research directs that the coronavirus may lead to an increase in diabetes cases.
Reuters says scientists are trying to understand the link between the coronavirus and diabetes 2.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs and kidneys, organs that are already weak in many people with diabetes.
In this case, high glucose-to-lipid ratios in diabetics can produce a true 'cytokine storm', as they are called when the immune system overreacts and attacks the body.
Damaged endothelial cells can also lead to inflammation, which in turn can cause fatal blood clots.
“It’s all one big puzzle,” Dela Cruz says.
“It’s all interrelated.”
The story has been corrected.
“We were offered champagne, then they left the room”
The couple Ásrún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason had the unusual request from art director Ragnar Kjartansson to have sex in front of a camera for a work the artist was putting up in Paris.
“We loved each other so it wasn’t complicated.”
Atli Bollason never forgets when he met his wife and mother of his child, Ásrún Magnúsdóttir, for the first time.
“I became very fascinated with her.
It was just the natural emission, but then I also thought it was completely unlistenable.
And still feel," he says.
Ásrún remembers this, too, as the husband recalls the first meeting regularly.
“I’m always hearing this story.
Last only this weekend,' she says, who was also attracted to her husband on first impression.
“I felt and feel so excited around Atli, who I fancy.
There is a lot going on and a lot happening and I was impressed by it.
Atli says the two have stressed in their relationship to go their separate ways.
“We don’t tie our balms the same knots as fellow passengers.
We avoid routines that we detect around us.”
That’s possibly why they took the business away from artist Ragnar Kjartansson just celebrating, although that would be the least unusual.
“Our mutual friend Kristin Anna contacts us and asks if we can come to eat desert with her, Ragga and Ragnar’s wife Ingibjörg, at Snaps.”
They accepted the offer, met the threesome at Snaps and had desert wine and their respective desserts.
They listened to Ragnar, who led them through his plans at an art exhibition he was planning to put up at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris in the fall.
“He had a multi-channel video project called Scenes from western culture.
He described it simply.”
Ásrún says he described the work as banal and decadent scenes from everyday Western life.
“He had sketches of all the scenes he was going to shoot and last time he told us what he wanted to know if we were interested in participating.”
The send-up Ragnar asked the couple to join was supposed to show a young middle-class couple making love in a minimalist room.
“It’s intercourse with beginnings and ends,” Atli says.
The pair didn’t know Ragnar much, although they knew about him and he knew about them “but they knew us and thought we fit this.
They had a word that they didn't want to advertise for people.
Maybe they thought they wouldn’t get the right people, but people who would get sexual frowns from performing for others.”
They said goodbye to Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it didn’t take long.
“When we walked out of Snaps, we said, ‘Aren’t we just up for this?
It was just like that.
I trust Ragnar as an artist and his whole team,” Ásrún and Atli state.
“It’s about love and intimacy”
Senan was taken up in a nice apartment on the Marsh Road.
There was a very sophisticated film team; cameraman, Ragnar and sound guy and the couple.
After a recording was turned on, everyone left the room to wait in the car except Atli and Ásrún.
“We hadn’t decided anything how we should be.
We had some small instructions, but we tried to forget a time and a place.
To be unaware of what we were doing and for whom.
There was no play, we just loved each other so it wasn’t complicated,” Ásrún says.
But was it romantic?
“Yes, it was a little romantic,” Atli says, and Ásrún agrees.
“We were offered champagne before they left the room.
It was a bit like being on holiday in a nice hotel in Paris.”
The team was pleased with the pair's performance on the job that moved them.
“When Tom the cameraman watched it, he cried, he thought it was so beautiful,” Atli says.
“It’s as much about love and intimacy as the actual intercourse,” Ásrún says.
The couple’s parents have seen the work and tell Atli that his mom heard the voice in the son at the Reykjavík Art Museum and then realized he was part of the work.
“Then she turns around and starts to ponder this,” Atli says.
“My mom and dad saw this in Paris.
We hadn’t told anyone this way, but then just Dad sends me a message and says, “Nice to run into the little family in Palais de Tokyo,” Ásrún recalls.
And I wonder if the participation in the work has deepened the relationship between Ásrún and Atli.
“At least we’re still together so maybe it deepened something.
At least this deepened my relationship with my in-law family,” Ásrún says, laughing.
Ásrún herself saw the work in Copenhagen with her colleague.
“I found it a little hard not to be with you but with someone else,” she says, turning to her husband.
“But it was nice to see this because it’s just one session in a much bigger job, and when you saw it with the other acts, it’s very cool.
I could tear myself away from it a little bit and I was just proud.
And there was the little bean in my stomach,” says Ásrún, who was pregnant with the couple’s second child when the session was recorded.
“It was just beautiful.”
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke to Ásrún and Atli in Ástarsögu on Rás 1.
Swansea with a win in the first leg
Swansea win 1 — 0 over Brentford in dramatic game
It was the first game of the playoffs to get up to the Premier League.
The game took place at Swansea's home ground in Wales.
The halftime score was 0–0.
Swansea's visitors were awarded a penalty in the 64th minute, but Andre Ayew failed to convert from the penalty spot and had his effort disallowed.
Only two minutes later, Brentford's Rico Henry was given the red card.
So Brentford played the rest of the game a man down and in the 82nd minute Swansea's players took advantage.
Andre Ayew then made up for the monumental blunder by scoring a superb goal to give Swansea a 1–0 victory.
Swansea therefore lead 1–0 in the conference, with the second game taking place next Wednesday at home to Brentford.
Ambassador-free for five years from 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the US ambassador in Iceland, is in the media spotlight after CBS reported this morning that he wanted an armed guard as he feared for his life.
But it hasn't gone without a hitch for the president of the United States to appoint an ambassador here.
Since Carol Van Voorst left the U.S. ambassador's office at the end of April 2009, the country has been ambassador-free for 62 months in total, more than five years.
Van Voorst left office under peculiar circumstances, but Kastljós reported in 2009 that she should have received the Fellowship.
On her way to a farewell meeting with the President of Iceland, she received a phone call from the Oval Office to the effect that she would not be honoured with the medal.
After she disappeared from Iceland, she taught international relations at the Army War College.
Sixteen months passed until Van Voorst's successor came into office, in September 2010.
That may be due in some part to the fact that Robert S. Connan had been appointed as ambassador, but then dropped out.
The job was finally taken by Loius Ariega, who had been working in the foreign service for decades.
He then retired in the fall of 2013 and took up the Guatemalan ambassador's office.
Then took another ambassador-free season.
Robert Barber was approved by the United States Congress in January 2015 and came into office shortly thereafter, by which time no ambassador had been in place for 13 months.
Barber was a political appointee, not a diplomat, but had worked as an attorney and supported Barack Obama's campaign.
He retired as soon as Donald Trump assumed the presidency, on January 20, 2017, as is customary with political appointees.
The Trump administration was unusually long appointing both ambassadors and high-level government officials in Washington.
Therefore, it took two years before the United States Congress convened Jeffrey Ross Gunter to question him and, after that, confirm him as ambassador to Iceland.
In his parliamentary testimony, he said he had never been to Iceland but often to Western Europe, while his wife, who has died, had been of Dutch extraction.
Gunter is a political appointee, used to be a dermatologist in California and has been a prominent member of the Jewish organization of the Republican Jewish Coalition.
Casino owner Sheldon Adelson started that organization, but Adelson is an enthusiastic supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to work in Iceland in May 2019, by which time no ambassador had been in the country since early 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest-running example in the region.
This is both because of how long the Trumps administration was appointing people to key posts as well as the fact that the past year's work by the U.S. Congress has been very long, including confirming ambassadors.
Since 2009, therefore, the aggregate has been ambassador-free in Iceland for over five years.
But that hasn't prevented work by the embassy that just opened its headquarters at No.
The project is estimated to have cost about 6.5 billion, but the stuccoed security walls surround the building and bulletproof glass is in all windows.
However, that does not appear to have enough to fill the current ambassador with a sense of security because he is said to fear for his life and has asked for an armed bodyguard.
Former BV player subjected to antisemitism in Iceland – “It was a mistake to come to Iceland”
Tonny Mawejje, a former BV player, says that he was battered when he was in Iceland and that he regrets coming to the country.
It comes during an interview with Tonny that appeared on the Ugandan Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined the Uganda Police FC team playing in the Uganda Senior League.
In the interview with the Daily Monitor, Tonny discusses many things, including his time in this country, who played with ÍBV, Val og Þrótti in Iceland.
“When I came to Iceland, I didn’t play in the middle like I used to play.
The team captain was in that position, but besides, he also had the jersey number I wanted so I didn't get either of the things I wanted," says Tonny, who played on the right side of the season with BV.
Meanwhile, Tonny discusses a butt he suffered in Iceland.
He says this is a problem many black players suffer when they play in Europe.
“It happened to me once, but since I didn’t understand the language, I just ignored what was said to me.
Later I then heard about it and then I asked my friend what it was about.
He told me then that my opponent made a rash comment about me after I tackled him."
In 2014, Tonny left Iceland for Norway, where he joined Haugesund.
It says he made the mistake he regrets the most.
Tonny had not been able to make his first team debut at Haugesund, but he wanted to play more to make the national team.
Then he asked to go back to Iceland on loan, but he joined Val.
“It was a mistake to come to Iceland again on loan.
I think if I had stayed in Norway longer I would have had the opportunity I wanted, Tonny says, but he hoped that if he would play well in Norway he would probably get further.
He insists the loan to Iceland has done away with his dreams of making a big team in Europe.
Found worm in woman's throat
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8-cm-long black worm in the tonsil of a woman seeking it.
Doctors were able to extract the worm using forceps.
Investigation revealed it was a parasite
CNN is reporting.
The woman had eaten sashimi a few days before, which are thin slices of meat.
The woman recovered quickly after the worm was removed, but parasites such as this are often in raw meat or fish.
After sushi surged in the West, the number of cases involving parasites in people has increased, CNN reported.
Fears of a second wave starting in Europe
Spain is now at the heart of concerns about a second wave of the coronavirus in Europe, in which the government has taken action to control the coronavirus outbreak again.
In Catalonia, all entertainment has been put on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barceloneas where the number of infections is increasing.
Other European countries have also taken action on the increase in infections in Spain, while in the UK everyone has to quarantine on their return from Spain, as in Norway, and the French have been warned against travel to Spain.
Smitum is also growing again in France and Germany, as the government tries to find a balance of controlling the spread of the virus and restarting the economy.
However, the situation in Europe is good compared to elsewhere in the world, with global incidences of infection approaching 300 thousand per day, which includes the most infection in the Americas and South Asia.
Confirmed infection has reached 16 million worldwide, according to a Johns Hopkins University count, with deaths confirmed to be linked to the virus reaching 644 thousand.
Mosaic Works Made Finally Get to Enjoy
In front of the Customs House in Reykjavík, there is a large, deep hole.
It's got men in orange helmets on it.
There is also a large grave.
More smaller machines.
The street is closed to traffic.
But the pavement is capable, and there are now many people who linger and respect the art of millions of mosaic tiles — like they’ve never seen it before.
Maybe they've never seen it before.
At least don't respect it.
The work has so far been somewhat hidden, right in front of it were parking spaces that were always under siege.
People parked there, locked the car in quick succession and then jumped off to do their business in the city centre.
The "lively and diverse public spaces" and "attractive cityscapes" are a beacon for the current Trust's restoration.
The goal is to beautify the area and allow Gerður Helgadóttir’s mosaic at Tollhúsið to enjoy a view better.
The front of the work will be a square, and since the area is well exposed to the sun, it is considered suitable as a resort area for passers-by.
The artwork will be illuminated and will now get the materials to enjoy themselves better than before on this 142 square metre surface.
The area will also have small “fog sprays”, a type of water sculpture, which offer play and provide a certain mystery to the area.
In this way, the renovations are described by the City of Reykjavík, which is currently under construction along with Veitir.
Pipes of water supply, heating and electricity will be upgraded.
Many of them date back to their years, but the sewage and cold water pipes date back to 1925, so they have served downtown residents and businesses for nearly a century.
When the street is reopened at the end of the project, cars can drive around it again.
But at least it will be a one-way street, while creating a quieter, more accessible space for walking.
In a feature about Customs House on the customs director’s website, the house was commissioned in 1971, and its architect was Gísli Halldórsson.
Because harbour damage extended through the house, it created a 250 square metre windowless wall surface to the street.
The building committee and architect agreed that such a surface would adversely affect the overall streetscape, if no special arrangements were made to adorn the appearance of the building.
The parties therefore agreed to include having a permanent artwork installed there.
During this time, a lot of word went out of Gerður Helgadóttir, an artist, the summary says.
She had worked extensively on mosaics in Germany and beyond.
The council was to contact her first before deciding whether to contest the work.
It had often been discussed that the work would have to mirror life at the harbor, as the harbor had been the lifeblood of Reykjavík since it was made.
When talking to the artist, she had to trawl through such a work.
Had to agree that she would receive blueprints and other aid before leaving the country again, where she would work on the proposals abroad.
Gerður got the time she herself decided she needed, and when she returned home she made some suggestions for discussion.
It was agreed without delay to ask her to do the job.
At the same time, it was requested to enter into a global agreement with her and the famous German art company, the Brothers Oidtmann, who had long worked with them to install famous works of art across Europe.
Agreements were made and Gerður did the artwork under the installation of their brothers’ workshop, which then oversaw the installation of Tollhúsið.
The whole work was extremely well done, both by Gerður Helgadóttir and the Oidtmann brothers, the summary states.
Has it ever since withstood the unseasonal Icelandic weather.
It took Gerdi about two years to do the work, which was done and installed in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after the Custom House work was finished, aged just 47.
Prepares the move of additional institutions to another country
Minister of Social Affairs Ásmundur Einar Daðason is calling for more public institutions to be exported to the country in the near future.
That's what a minister told the Explosives on the Wave show at lunchtime.
It was recently announced that the Housing and Infrastructure Department's fire emergency will be moved north to Southern Cross in the autumn.
Six fire experts are employed by the agency, but none of them plan to follow the agency north, and the National Fire and Emergency Services Union has criticized the move.
“I think we should step further into this being.
I am preparing a further step for this creature.
Further transportation,” Ásmundur said.
If he says he is convinced that the vast majority of the people want to see more distribution of public institutions across the country.
“I think further political decisions need to be made on the relocation of public jobs to the country, like I was doing with the Housing and Infrastructure Agency,” Ásmundur said, “but he also took examples of other institutions that have been exported to the country and were important to offshore communities, such as the relocation of the Food Authority to Selfoss, the Icelandic National Survey to Akranes and unemployment insurance in Skagaströnd.
All the main things from the second day of Championships
The 94th Icelandic Sports Championship ended at Þórsvöllur in Akureyri today.
Some tournament records were set on the second day of competition.
A thrilling women’s sledging competition was expected at Þórsvöllur, but Vigdís Jónsdóttir of FH set an Icelandic record in sledding in 2014, which stood up until Elísabet Rut Rúnarsdóttir of ÍR improved the record last May.
Vigdís won the Icelandic record back earlier in the summer and has been in fantasy form of late, but she has triple-bogeyed the rest of the summer.
Elizabeth Rut has been dealing with injuries and did not recover today.
She had only one valid throw of five, throwing 25.69 yards, far from her best.
Vigdís threw the longest ever day, or 60.08 meters in her last attempt, while setting a meet record.
Her Icelandic record earlier in July is 62.69 metres, so she was a bit off.
Guðrún Karítas Hallgrímsdóttir of ÍR had the second best throw of the day, but she improved her best result with a throw of 50.18 metres.
In the men’s event, FH-ing Hilmar Örn Jónsson, the Icelandic record holder, earned a confident victory, throwing 73.84 metres in his next last throw and setting a meet record.
His national record in the discipline is 75.26 metres.
Guðni Valur Guðnason, the Olympic and Icelandic all-around champion, won a round-robin competition at Þórsvöllur yesterday, but today he competed in a round which is his main event.
Guðni Valur’s Icelandic record is 65.53 metres, but he threw a longest 59.13 metres today, securing the victory.
Valdimar Hjalti Erlendsson threw the second longest today, but he had one valid throw that was enough for the 2nd, 49.43 yards.
Hafdís Sigurðardóttir, the Icelandic long jump record holder, won the long jump competition with an advantage, while Hafdís jumped the longest 6.25 meters today, which is less than 40 cm from her Icelandic record.
In the women’s 200 meters, it was ÍR-ingur Guðbjörg Jóna Bjarnadóttir who was sprinting hardest, coming in 24.04 seconds, while her Icelandic record in the discipline is 23.45 seconds.
Guðbjörg Jóna was victorious in Akureyri, but she won two gold medals yesterday, in the 100 meters and in the 4 x 100 meters relay, and then also in the 4 x 400 meters relay today.
In the men’s event, FH’s Kolbeinn Höður Gunnarsson was first in the 200-meter dash in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of Ármann’s Óliver Máni Samúelsson.
Like Guðbjörg Jóna, Kolbeinn Höður won gold in the 100 metres yesterday, as well as in the 400 metres.
Don't get fine for $27 million Bitcoin harvest
The High Commission has rejected a claim by a tax inspector who demanded a fine over a man for underreporting his capital gains that were generated from the sale of Bitcoin electronic coins.
The panel concludes that the IRS had not clearly argued why it was necessary to fine the man.
The panel's ruling states that the IRS believed the man had locations for materially incorrect tax returns for the 2016 and 2017 income years.
He would have understated his capital gains arising from the sale of Bitcoin's cryptocurrency to 27 million, either intentionally or out of spectacular hesitancy.
The man would be fined for his conduct.
The man turned it down in a letter to the committee.
However, it went on to sell electronic coins in 2016 for 27 million.
It would have been acquired by burial in 2009 and 2010 when this would have been both easy and unobtrusive with a regular home computer.
He then pointed out that when he sold the electronic coins, tax enforcement for such sales had been substantially unclear and unpredictable.
More recently, civilians could have been expected to be aware of such measures on a tax return.
He would not have intended to avoid paying tax on the crop and would have accounted for his property on a future as a deposit in a foreign exchange account.
He would have inquired with both the know-how and the governor about how this was done, but was unsuccessful.
He then believed that it needed to be taken into account that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he began digging for Bitcoin.
He would therefore have been in a worse position than others to look at complex rules on which the tax authorities would not have formed a clear opinion.
The man therefore believed that his taxes for those two income years should be re-established and levied, but otherwise not punished.
Then he reiterated that he works in Iceland and had paid taxes in this country since 2012.
He would never have intended to shirk his duties unduly.
The demand for a fine would be out of all proportion and would plunge him into debt.
Brynjólfur evokes conversation: “This man understands what football is”
Brynjólfur Andersen Willumsson has been significant between people’s teeth, but also made an impression because of his efforts during the rest of the season with Breidablik in the Pepsi Max League.
Blue will be in the lineup tonight when they receive the IA live on Channel 2 Sport.
Brynjólfur takes them out of contention for four reminders of the season, so they won’t be able to play with a new haircut like this summer’s games so far.
He had had “blah, blah, blah” written on his head before the HK game last Thursday, which HK won 1–0.
“I don’t know who exactly he was answering with the payment, but speaking of carapace, this one was rather trying the game.
He didn't go into hiding.
He wants the ball every single time, and if there was anyone about to match this game, I thought he would do it or make it,” said Guðmundur Benediktsson at the Pepsi Max studio, when it came to Brynjólfur.
“I’m supposed to be here for the people.”
“It’s hard sometimes to figure out what position he’s in.
He looks a bit out on the left when the games start to pass, but he has a very free-flowing ruck in the team,” Hjörvar Hafliðason said.
Þorkell Máni Pétursson says Brynjólf is a real entertainer and celebrates having such a colourful man in the league: nobody disputes the fact that it’s Caribbean.
It's a fun type and I love it with my hair, and to always be ready to show up and answer in interviews.
There's an incredible amount of people busy with him, who tell me this man understands what football is about.
“I’m an entertainer.
I’m supposed to be here for the people and enjoy it.”
The people are reading the interviews with Brynjólf, people are paying in and watching what’s next on his hair.
This man is just a genius,” said Máni.
KR player says he wants to leave the union - 'I have been in contact with some B-League teams'
Tobias Thomsen, a Pepsi Max League player, appears to be leaving the team.
According to Danish medium Bold, Tobias is ready to go back home to Denmark.
Football also reported.
Tobias wants to get the start of the season in his home country, but to do so he must first cancel his contract at KR, where the Danish league starts before that Icelandic likelihood.
The company knows I miss Denmark and have shown me a lot of understanding,' Tobias said to Bold.
“I have been in contact with several teams in the B-League and will probably switch over before the Icelandic season ends.
There are not many teams in Denmark that can let them pay up my contract at KR.”
Then he says he probably needs to take a pay cut in Denmark.
“Companies in Denmark have probably felt more of the economic impact of the virus than in Iceland.”
Wheel Whisperer Bjartmar Has Restored Wheels for Millions - Now Responding After DV Discussion
For over a year, Bjartmar Leósson has had a hobby unlike most others.
He sniffs up and rescues lost and stolen bicycles, electric bikes and purses.
Has Bjartmar earned the name “the wheel whisperer” by now.
Yesterday, there was such a significant amount of suspense when you published a report of your dealings with Bjartmar.
DV then referenced discussions on Vesturbæingar Facebook group, stating that Bjartmar took the man to speak in Austurvöllur and said the purse was possibly stolen.
There was no other way to read from the original writings of the electrocutor but that Bjartmar tipped him off.
That text has now been changed on Facebook and the headline of the original DV news updated accordingly.
Bjartmar says the initial news of the case is not at all representative of what actually went on yesterday in Austurvöllur.
Bjartmar said he was informed by the victim of electrocution that these were indeed his electrodes.
That information was allegedly given to the owner by others, but the information turned out to be false says Bjartmar.
“I saw the guy and I recognized the shuttle, as there was information that there was an electrical shuttle that had been missing for a very long time and that was searched for.
I certainly hesitated first, but when I saw him preparing to drive off on the shuttle, I decide to punch talk with the man.
The owner was sure of it, so I decided to have a conversation with the man.
In general, I am very nice about this kind of thing, but before I could finish what I had to say, the man had taken off the word.”
Bjartmar says the man on the electric scooter immediately invited him to show him the receipt for the bike and called police himself.
“Yes, cool,” Bjartmar said, “let’s just get it straight.”
Then, the owner of the electric shuttle proved ownership of his shuttle and drove off.
Later, the rightful owner of the electrocution told his story on Facebook, as reported in an earlier story.
In this more than a year that Bjartmar has indulged in this practice, he says he can count the times he got up against people on the fingers of one hand.
“I have had peaceful relations with Reykjavík’s hardest men,” Bjartmar said, pointing out that bicycle thieves are by far the smallest brothers and sisters in society, addicts, people with mental disabilities and other people who for some reason are on the street.
“The addict is a hard master and somehow the next dose needs to be funded, unfortunately the theft of such loot is an easy way to accomplish that goal,” says Bjartmar.
“My relations with these people are really so good that I have brought many of the good people with me.
There are examples of people going to therapy and taking it on and then looking to me and helping me with what I'm doing," he says.
In general, Bjartmar’s interactions with bicycle people are on a courteous note.
Some people know about him and what he is doing and peacefully offer to show him receipts, ­numbers of bikes and so on.
Bicycle theft is a big problem that hasn't been addressed much.
Furthermore, Bjartmar says that the police are even beginning to point out people talking to him about stolen bicycles.
Bjartmar is unconvinced by DV’s earlier press and says he is not some sort of self-appointed police officer in a personal search for justice.
Asked whether he is now still not on the slippery slope with his act, and whether this is not primarily the role of police, Bjartmar certainly is.
“Of course the cops should do this, but the fact of the matter is that the cops are honestly not doing this.
I have, for example, watched police drive away from a large pile of stolen bikes.
She’s clean-shaven in these cases.”
“When the cops aren’t doing anything about this, and this is just in front of your nose, and experience has shown that I can succeed in this area, then why not?” asks Bjartmar.
He says he has had so much success tracking down stolen bikes, that sometimes he bumps into his “clients” on the street that they just handed the Brighter bikes they had previously caught.
The times that Bjartmar has called for police help have happened to be that she honestly doesn’t show up.
“It’s just not working with the police, and it’s not my fault, and it’s not the bike owners’ fault,” Bjartmar said, “and it’s sorry that victims of bicycle theft have to suffer from police indifference in this area.”
Bjartmar’s success is not shared.
You can find stories of people thanking Brighter for getting their belongings back to them.
Bjartmar himself says he has long lost count of the number of bicycles he has returned, but the sums probably run into millions, if not millions.
Weigh in on electric scooters, electric bikes and electric scooters heavily, while electric bikes can cost upwards of half a million.
Bright works day to day kindergarten and every other weekend he works in a community.
So his bicycle search is unpaid work he does in his spare time.
Pension funds and long shadows
The year 2019 was a big anniversary year in the history of pension funds in Iceland.
Officials had, incidentally, been retired from the King of Denmark all streets since the 19th century, but in 1919 a pension fund of officials was established which eventually became the pension fund of all public servants.
The basis for the current general employee pension funds was subsequently laid down by a global labour agreement in 1969 which provided for occupational pension funds with compulsory membership and qualifying fund collections from the beginning of 1970.
In 1974 the law was then passed on the basis of these agreements and the pension system continued to be strengthened thereafter.
The workers' pension system was not the only radical change driven by the 20th-century labor movement through its collective bargaining.
Unemployment insurance had been similarly obtained during historic strikes in 1955, and the organization also gradually received its claims for sickness rights and sickness funds, substantial leave entitlements, a reduction in working hours, housing reforms, and more importantly.
All these rights cost a great deal of effort, but proved, after all, to be much more and more lasting benefit than the increase in the amount of money in the wage envelope, which disappeared as hard as the hike in inflation that characterised the post-war period until 1990 as many remember.
The lead-up to the creation of general pension funds in 1969 was both long and complex.
Although it was ultimately agreed that the trusts would effectively be the property of trustees, the SNP had to agree that their boards should be made up of equally representative employers and trustees.
In the years following the creation of the funds, the requirement for a majority of workers on the board of trustees often came up for debate in the workers' organisations, yet it never materialised, and so we are still stuck with the abnormal arrangement whereby members of trustees do not represent a majority of the boards of trustees.
Article 36 of the Law No 129/1997 on compulsory insurance of pension rights and pension fund operations deals with the investment policy of the funds.
It states in point 1 that 'a pension fund shall be in the best interests of the members'.
Also, in point 5, ‘Pension funds shall establish ethical criteria for investments’.
Whereas the policy of shareholders of the commercial pension fund includes, as a consequence of the abovementioned provisions:
The pension fund is a member of the United Nations Code of Responsible Investment (UN PRI), along with many of the largest pension funds and professional investors in the Western Hemisphere and Europe.
The Code addresses how focusing on environmental and societal issues as well as good corporate governance can contribute to improving the investment performance of portfolios.
This will bring together the interests of investors and the aims of the wider society.
LV believes it is important that companies, particularly those listed on the stock market, set public policy on: administering good governance benefits social responsibility and the environment.
The pension fund Gildi, which has the largest funds in the country, has a “policy of responsible investment” and there are provisions of a similar nature.
This is all recalled here as an introduction to the Icelandic fashion word ‘shadow management’.
Since the word is new to the matter, there is no hope that it has been fully defined, but it now seems to me that the following definition is 'most taken': shadow management is when a leading member of a trade union says in the media that he intends to send the company representatives to the pension fund management board a recommendation or order on how they should take a position in a particular case.
If they do not follow the recommendations, they will be allowed to leave the board at the earliest convenience.
If the leader does not take this to the media and does not talk about dismissal, however, it is not “shadow management,” as such is the kind of human-to-human interaction, of course, a frequent occurrence in the financial world as elsewhere.
I leave the reader to ponder which way he feels “shallower.”
There are two men in particular who have tried to formulate this definition at the time of writing, on the morning of Saturday 25 July 2020.
They are Hörður Ægisson, a journalist at Fréttablaðið, and Ásgeir Jónsson, the governor of the central bank.
The occasion with both arose after Icelandair CEO Bogi Nils Bogason had announced his intention to terminate the company’s contracts with flight attendants and flight attendants (dismiss them), and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairman of the Reykjavík Chamber of Commerce sent out the recommendation to the company’s representatives on the board of the Pension Fund of Trade Unions not to support the fund’s possible purchase of shares in the company, or they might be let go.
Some time later Bogi Nils withdrew his decision and afterwards Ragnar Þór went the same way with his recommendation, which of course centered on Boga’s decision.
Nevertheless, Hörður and Ásgeir saw reason to expand on the matter in Friday’s edition of Fréttablaðið with big words about shadow management, lawbreaking and a strong need for a change in the law.
There was a little thong indeed to roll a heavy load, though the blessed thong had been in a state of disconnection and besides had been quickly wiped out.
Since the matter is important, let us consider the substance itself at the end.
I attributed these to the issues in the Pension Funds Act pertaining to this matter.
They imply that fund managers should represent the interests of members and have ethical investment criteria, and these issues are further elaborated in the statutes of both the Values and Pensions Commissioners, as I mentioned.
However, pension funds should NOT be looking only at short-term returns on their investments.
This would be exactly a very dangerous policy and need not look for long for examples of this in the past, where large bank and fund lending has gone to immoral adventurers and environmentalists, with disastrous consequences.
The CEO of Icelandair was obviously on slippery ground when he thought about wiping out an entire group of employees, thus significantly reducing the welcome the company has enjoyed in the Icelandic market and weakening its position in relation to investors.
Fortunately, he saw and withdrew this.
Time will tell whether it will be enough to enable pension funds' investment in the company to be deemed liable to members in the end.

One of the infected did not use repatriation therapy
One of the three people diagnosed with Covid-19 in the country yesterday arrived in the country from a Baltic state on the 15th of July, about a week and a half ago.
However, he is an Icelander who is not a regular resident and therefore did not receive clear instructions to use the repatriation surveillance after arrival and to undergo another sampling a few days after arrival.
He got negative from screening at the border.
“But he is in Icelandic society and really should go to that resort,” Kamilla Jósepsdóttir, a quarantine specialist at the Directorate of Health and a surrogate quarantine officer while on summer vacation, tells Fréttabladid today.
“He used the English registration form and there is no obligation to register the identification number and if the identification number is not registered then you are not automatically invited to the second sample.”
She says that the man was able to use the English registration form because he actually resides abroad, but because of his network of contacts in the country as an Icelander, he should have used it more Icelandic.
At least he didn't realize this.
“When the kennitala is not registered then you have to seek it yourself to come for the second sampling.
Neither he nor his employer seem to have realised that was the right move, says Kamilla.
“So it is clear that we need to step up the disclosure of this while we find some way to do an automated messaging system even if Icelanders don’t register their ID.
Or then to make it somehow more obvious who is a member of Icelandic society in the registration system,” she explains.
Fortunately, few of the people in question came to Iceland, although they are defined as members of the Icelandic community, a defending Icelander.
Only six have been sent to quarantine after he was diagnosed yesterday, and these six were all in sync with him.
They are yet to undergo sampling, however, two of them are beginning to show signs of Covid-19 infection.
The man received a negative from his sampling at the border on July 15.
Kamilla says it's likely he was so recently infected with the virus that she couldn't yet be detected in him when the sample was taken at the border.
However, she does not want to rule out that the man has been infected here in Iceland but not brought the virus with her to the country.
“It can’t quite be argued that this is definitely an imported infection because it’s been a long time since he came to the country that he might have been exposed here like these two who have caused a little war in relation to the sports tournaments.”
That, she says, is very unlikely because of the small number of people around here.
“It’s really very unlikely,” Kamilla says, but states that it can’t be ruled out until Icelandic genetic analysis has sequenced the virus in man.
“If we get a viral type that hasn’t been seen here before, it’s almost certain that he carried it to the country.”
Pepper Springs and Bombs Deployed Against Protesters
There were clashes between police and protesters in Seattle overnight.
Police used pepper grenades and non-lethal hand grenades, while demonstrators broke windows and set fire.
45 protesters were arrested and 21 police officers were injured.
Police violence and racism were protested across the US last night, while the Seattle protest was in support of protesters in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one protester was shot dead.
As the BBC reports, the attacker has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands gathered in peaceful protests.
A group of people then set fire to a construction site and smashed windows in the city's courthouse.
Afterward, police said the protest was a riot and clashes between groups of protesters and police.
Demanding justice In Aurora, Colorado, Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old black male killed by police in August of last year, was remembered by protesters.
A car drove through a crowd of protesters in the city, but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of black National Guard troops gathered demanding justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was killed by police at her home last March.
The group carried firearms and walked in formation to a closed intersection where police separated the group from a group of people protesting the protest and also carried firearms.
Then there were 75 arrests in Omaha, Nebraska, where protesters remembered James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man who was killed by a white bar owner in May.
Solskjær: Not the game that defines our season
Manchester United's Ole Gunnar Solskjaer does not want to overstate the importance of today's game at Leicester in the final of the Premier League.
If United lose the game, and Chelsea do not lose against Wolves, Solskjaer and his men will end up in 5th place, thus missing out on a Champions League place.
Then, though, they should still hope to reach the Champions League by winning the Europa League next month.
“We’re not at the end of the road.
If we get a point against Leicester I think people will say we haven't had a bad season now,' said Solskjaer.
“But whatever happens, this is not the end of our journey because we still have a significant way to go to catch the two teams above us,” Solskjaer said.
Clearly, the nerves will be muddled at 15 today, but Solskjaer tried to act as if it were any other game.
“If you want to belong to Manchester United, you have to get used to being under pressure in the last game of the season.
This is nothing new, and this is what the company is based on.
We have created a great opportunity to end the season well and now it is our job to take advantage of that," said Solskjaer.
“This is not the most important game of the season, this is just the next game.
You can ask anyone in football, the next game is always the most important one.
The finish does not define our season, we have already had many hours defining this season.
“The arrival of Bruno Fernandes changed a lot for us and I believe that whole we are in better shape and much stronger mentally than last season,” Solskjaer said.
65,000 infections a day
65,490 new infections of the coronavirus were detected in the US yesterday according to John Hopkins University.
A total of 4,178,021 infections have been confirmed westwards since the start of the outbreak in that country.
There were 900 deaths from the virus yesterday, but the last four days until then deaths due to the virus were more than 1,000 a day.
A total of 146,460 deaths due to the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
CNN reports that according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's prediction model, the number of deaths from the virus will reach 175,000 by August 15.
Fears second wave of the epidemic
Spain’s government is now trying weakly to rein in the increased spread of COVID — 19 in the country.
Spanish health authorities reported more than 920 new cases of COVID — 19, both on Thursday and Friday.
There have been no more one-day detections since the beginning of May, and the reports come at the same time as Spain begins lifting one of the strictest curfews in Europe.
The backlash led to British authorities now obliging passengers arriving from Spain to quarantine on return.
A week before, Spain was on the British list of safe states.
The situation is at its worst in Catalonia in northeastern Spain, where the government has taken broader restrictions to try to stem the growth.
In the capital city of Barselóna, entertainment venues will be closed for the next two weeks and waves will be required to close at midnight.
Then there is a curfew now in place for 200 thousand residents in Segria county in western Catalonia.
It is believed that the British decision will have a negative impact on the Spanish economy which relies heavily on the arrival of foreign tourists and is badly affected after the outbreak.
Tui, the UK's largest travel agency, cancelled all flights planned for today to Spain and the Canary Islands.
Governments around the world are reportedly preparing for the second wave of the outbreak, but there appears to be little interest in reining in a massive curfew that has widened the economy.
For example, Boris Johnson, the British Prime Minister, has taken a very bad look at that and likened it to nuclear weapons that he doesn't want to use.
Meanwhile, French Prime Minister Jean Castex has said that the nation “would not survive, economically or socially,” if a nationwide curfew were reinstated.
Many councils hope the local resources reaching residents of individual towns, cities or regions will be enough to hold back the virus in the next round if it comes to pass.
Five New Infections in Iceland - Three Nationally
Three domestic infections were detected yesterday, along with two more at the border.
Thus, five people were diagnosed with positive Covid-19 infection yesterday in Iceland.
The Civil Protection notice states that one of the infections is related to the infection reported yesterday at the ReyCUP soccer tournament.
Has the one been sent to isolation and sixteen who were in close contact with him quarantined?
The infected person was a participant in the social activities of a sports club in Reykjavík and is, according to the announcement, “only part of the sports team” in quarantine.
Others sent to quarantine relate to the man in a different way.
The source of this infection is missing and full-on infection by the state police's infection team.
The ReyCUP tournament hosts have followed the guidelines and regulations of the CDC and Civil Protection that are still in effect and have taken appropriate measures.
However, footage of the tournament yesterday highlighted the sight of a very close match celebrating his team's success out on the field.
Just before 11am today, motorists made the following announcement on their Facebook page.
It reads “ATH: Parents please respect the rules that contestants pick up their own stuff at school.
Parents are NOT allowed to do so.
Thank you for your demonstrated understanding.”
Another infection was detected yesterday, but is linked to the one reported earlier.
Announces: “Icelandic genetic analysis has sequenced the infection and a new type of virus has been discovered that has not been detected here before.”
Infectious infection is under way in that case as well, and the infected person is in isolation and 12 in quarantine due to the infection.
The third infestation in question is from a man who arrived in Iceland 11 days ago, July 15.
He was identified in the southwest corner of the country.
That person is now in isolation and six who were in close contact with him in quarantine.
Two of those are already showing signs of viral transmission.
In addition, two were detected at the border and are awaiting the results of further investigations as provided for by the cross-border procedure.
Finally, the announcement: The Department of Public Safety and the Directorate of Health are urging people to be cautious and mindful of individual infection control.
If there is at least some doubt as to whether the symptoms of the Covid-19 virus are present, the same person is asked to take a sample at the nearest clinic.
Patreksfjörður says campsite booked for shopping spree - Direct visitors elsewhere
The campground in Patreksfjörður is fully booked for the weekend, as announced by Vesturbyggð.
Visitors are advised to look at other accommodation options.
Names Vesturbyggð Bíldudalur, Tálknafjörður, Melanes on Rauðasandi, Hótel Flókalund and Hótel Breiðavík as alternatives.
There’s plenty to be in Patreksfjörður this weekend, as in previous years, Skjaldborg, a festival of Icelandic documentaries will be held in town.
It has been held since 2007, so it has become a strong tradition in the town.
Judging by the on-campus appeal, this year’s attendance is expected to be good, if the weather doesn’t put a damper on it, but DV said earlier today of the secondary forecast.
However, expect the worst weather in the south, and hope for Patrese.
The site bb.is first reported, saying that all other accommodation in town was already fully booked.
Whole condominium pores down to best spot in city
Romanian workers live free at Dunhaga 18–20.
In the meantime, owners are seeking building permits for improvements, but their business has been successful in the scheme for a third year.
In one of Reykjavík City’s oldest, busiest and most expensive neighbourhoods, a glorious condominium stands on three floors.
The ground floor of the building has about 600 square feet of commercial space.
Behind the house are the doors of two stairwells, each holding four somewhat weighted apartments.
They range from 93–130 square meters, though most exceed 100.
The house has a significant history.
It was built in 1959 and has housed, among other things, a video store, the Shoe Office, Dairy Milk Shop, Joe the Gunsmith, a fish seller, and most recently a University Print.
The house has, to put it mildly, remembered its elephant beauty.
The house is now severely damaged, as can be seen in the photos provided.
The owner of the building is D18 ehf.
The owners of D18 ehf. are according to company records amongst other Magnússon and Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir.
Magnús headed the ownership group of Borgunar and was the head of the holding company Borgunar.
In the group of owners of the holding company Borgunar is Stálskip ehf.
Stálskip ehf. is the investment company of Gudrún Helga Lárusdóttir and her children.
Guðrún is also the owner of a third part of D18 ehf.
Guðrún and her husband, Ágúst Guðmundur Sigurðsson, once ran the operator Stálskip.
D18 ehf. bought the house in the summer of 2009, so little or nothing has been maintained since then.
Tell neighbours that the condition of the house has deteriorated constantly since, though most recently.
On a neighbourhood resident’s Facebook page, one resident says that the house has “not been particularly lively in the last year.”
It may play a part because owners have been seeking to modify the house and land for several years.
Other neighbors say the house hasn't been OK for a long time.
“It’s long overdue to do something decent with this spot and boring that it has dragged on like this.”
He also says that he is furious with the owners of the house for not getting driven to finish it, finding some common ground with the house’s neighbours and stopping this “legal gimmick”.
“Just do this in consultation with the surrounding community so it can be rushed and finished.”
The "legal app," the resident refers to, is the planning process for the plot that has been going on at least since 2017.
The then Dunhaga 18 and 20 owners sought permission to build a floor on top of the existing condominium and behind the house, a new elevator and one-story extension as well as a basement.
The building permit granted for that project was appealed to the Committee on the Environment and Natural Resources, and the committee cancelled it as the project did not have a subdivision support and local representation was not adequate.
The City of Reykjavík then started with divisional work and ended it with an announcement in the Official Journal last July.
That structure was also appealed and repealed by the committee in March 2020.
At this point, therefore, nearly three years had passed since the original application for a building permit and the building's owners at the beginning.
At this time the house had been knocked down considerably and neighbours began to tire.
When DV asked the house’s neighbors about the situation and neighbors’ reactions, the answers were in several ways.
Some had an understanding of the building's intended owners, others not at all.
Others directed their anger at the city, others did not.
Others were just angry, but nothing necessarily out of anyone.
Still others said the parking lot was thwarted, while neighbors have occupied Dunhaga’s unused parking lot 18–20 under their vehicles.
One complainant in the case said he grew tired of the administration:
“For us to have to go through the process on three occasions is absolutely incredible.
It’s as if the City of Reykjavík didn’t know how to read.”
Today the house stands empty, abandoned and is neglected.
A monument to the dizzying administration of the city and the noble intentions of the owner and their many years of work now at the beginning.
When a reporter arrived at Dunhaga 18, he was whipped open doors and piles of rubbish.
A Playstation computer and a recent TV lay amid other trash on Earth — victims of Icelandic summer soaking
It was open into the old office of University Printing, and there was a significant amount of cats of the smell of urine to judge.
It is clear that someone has nestled in one corner, but no one is visible.
Stacks of sofas and beds and a few pallets of geological pages, which were sure to become a book, were blacked out.
The residential stairwells were also open and alive in both.
A journalist was lucky enough to run into the residents of one of them.
Were there, Romanians boiled a potato dish for dinner and invited a reporter in.
The Romanians work for the temporary work agency Ztrongforce ehf.
They have been there for some time, and DV’s sources state that the company has paid nothing for the premises except for heat and electricity.
Due to the condition of the house, it is not considered presumptive to collect rent.
Judging by the stash of mail in the lobby of the building, it is clear that there have been some numbers of foreign workers living there last season.
The temporary agency business has not been affected by the Covid-19 situation, as the decline in tourism has led to a decline in the construction sector, and these two businesses have been the most effective in using temporary agency services.
Nonetheless, the Dunhaga 18 householders seemed to have plenty of work to do, and the work suits and mittens in the joint remained to dry after a long day's work in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the miserable state of the house, the apartment the boys shared seemed to be nicely maintained.
When a reporter said goodbye to the boys Romanian, the irony suddenly became clear to him: In the best place in Reykjavík, a 1,500 square metre property stands demolished.
Owners want to change the house for the better and neighbours want an improved condition but dispute the definition of 'improved'.
Between then sits the city's early planning sector, the victim of endless appeals and appeal possibilities in the planning process and the dizzying resolution of the Environment and Resources Review Board.
In the house, so do Romanian workers, perhaps the very ones who go to improve the situation, when the Icelanders stop fighting.
The article originally appeared in DV’s July 17 weekend issue.
Campaign against overweight following coronavirus outbreak
Britain's prime minister, Boris Johnson, will give £10 million to an overweight campaign, which will include a ban on fast food advertising, following his severe illness, partly due to his weight.
Johnson is to present the campaign, which has been entitled Better Health, tomorrow, Monday, with the campaign urging doctors to prescribe cycling for their overweight clients, and will also be undertaken to campaign for an increase in cycling.
The advertising of fast food outlets on television will then be banned by 21 at night, according to British media sources.
“COVID — 19 has awakened us to the short- and long-term risks of being overweight, and the Prime Minister is determined that we must use the time to become healthier, more active and eat a healthier diet,” a government spokesperson stated.
Johnson himself has had weight problems, but he was admitted to intensive care when he contracted the coronavirus in the spring, and it is partly his weight because he is thought to have been so severely ill.
Women better suited to lead change
She said the new constitution was the biggest step the nation can take towards greater distribution of power, transparency and in countering corruption and in the interests of the whole.
“We need to start changing gears a little bit now and who is better suited to lead that kind of change than the group of society that is easier to be in these values.
There are women,” Helga said.
“Women in Iceland are famous for their women’s solidarity.
To stand together and be together to lead change.
So now it’s just our turn to lead these changes.”
Said she was a little anxious about the focus on Iceland as “best in the world” in both gender equality and human rights.
“Then we’re not as ready to look at what needs to be done.
As Germans are very aware of their history and look at everything that needs to be done.
That's a lot of money.
We have to know where we're coming from and know the story and listen.
Listen to the voices of marginalized groups.
We don’t live with the same rules all here,” Helga said.
The questioner said women are in many ways in good shape in Iceland, but added that, as in many other places, Icelanders are living with awesomely male values.
She said that politics was about self-interest, control and power that were the forces that perpetuated inequality in all communities.
“Women have now started this group and come together and have just gotten a little annoyed that Alþingi is going to overlook this referendum from 2012,” she said.
“It’s these female-centric values that we’re thinking this out.
From human rights and nature protection, cooperation and that we all actually sit at the same table,” she said, adding that the aforementioned values are the core values in the new constitution.
“We are a very rich country of natural resources and it is ridiculous that there are people living in poverty here.
It’s ridiculous, we can switch differently,” Helga said.
“It’s ridiculous that it’s something of a natural law that women’s work is always lower paid.
It’s ridiculous that flight attendants and nurses have to indefinitely stand in a bargain just to get a decent wage.”
The signature list for a new constitution can be signed here via e-Iceland.
Attempted to rob downtown pedestrian
A man was arrested downtown last night after he threatened pedestrians and tried to get money from him.
The police also stopped the production of drugs in Árbær, where two people were arrested over the case.
Then the police stopped the driver of a motorcycle in the Gates where its driver was travelling at 146 kmh with a maximum speed of 60 km/h.
In addition, he had previously been suspended.
The capital area police had enough to turn up overnight, with more than 80 cases recorded in the police diary from five yesterday to five this morning.
That was particularly high in noise reports for parties.
On Saturday night, there were reports of eleven noisy parties, and that was much deemed in the police log.
Overnight, however, 22 noise issues rattled police.
Six were kept in a jail cell overnight.
In the Arctic, police were called overnight when parties launched fireworks.
However, they were already out of the way when officers arrived at the park.
Then nine drivers were stopped for drunken and or drug-driving.
Four people were arrested over a fight downtown last night, one of whom was kept in a jail cell.
Then two people were taken to an emergency room after they fell on their faces, one in Midtown and the other in West.
One person was taken to the emergency room after he was injured jumping on a trampoline in Kópavogur.
In addition, police officers stopped a driver pulling a caravan in Kjalarnes yesterday.
The caravan's wheelie bin was, according to police log, in a 'very bad condition' and it was detained
You can stay in Monet's house for the shopping season
The house, in which the impressionist Claude Monet spent the last forty years of his practice, is now for rent on the Airbnb site.
The next available nights in the house are in the mall.
The house is small and cute, located in the town of Givenry, Normandie, France.
The world-famous painter lived in the house from 1883 until his death in 1926.
The house has three bedrooms, two sitting rooms and three bathrooms.
Monet was first inspired to paint his famous gardens in this house.
If someone plans to rent the house, they must rent at least two nights.
Based on Airbnb's site, it's next available in a week, on Sunday of the holiday shopping season, so it might be perfect for some holiday shoppers to get on with booking the painter's house.
The two nights over shopping malls cost no more than US$964 or just 130 thousand Icelandic krónur as Fréttablaðið finds out.
Dozens in quarantine and some of them beginning to show signs of the disease caused by the coronavirus
Five have been diagnosed with the coronavirus domestically in the last three days, with most of the infected unrelated.
Dozens have entered quarantine for this, and some of them have begun to show signs of the disease caused by the virus.
Three were diagnosed with the coronavirus domestically yesterday and two at border screening.
An expert at the Directorate of Health says that the growing number of domestic infections does not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading across the community.
“The previous domestic infection has been sequenced and there is a virus that hasn’t been seen here before so we have no particular reason to think it has been hidden in society for some time.
This is probably something that has just arrived in the country, but of course we need to be very vigilant now,” said Kamilla Sigríður Jósefsdóttir, an expert on quarantine at the Directorate of Health.
Most of the infected have been linked to individuals who came from abroad.
Further sampling is taking place in the near future, but some, who were in sync with the infected ones, are beginning to show symptoms of the coronavirus.
“Currently there is no flu going on and less about other respiratory infections so we can be quite liberal with doing these tests on individuals who in flu season would have found a reason to do something else first,” Kamilla said.
Smiling is largely over, but there is no way more people will have to go into quarantine.
Two of the infected were diagnosed after attending sporting events.
Has it raised questions whether it is presumptive to hold such events?
The Civil Protection Communications Director says that is well possible as long as people follow the criteria and rules.
Kamilla says it's almost impossible that the infected people were infected at the sporting events.
“If there are no more people going into isolation from these individuals after hanging out with them at these sporting events, then we can claim that our quarantine at the tournaments has worked.
But it's not revealed,' Kamilla said.
The civil defence department's procedures are kept under review.
"We need to be ready to intervene with further advice or restrictions if it seems warranted," Kamilla said.
In the space of a week, the mass restrictions stand to be extended to a thousand people.
This new position could affect relaxation.
“Certain Thoughts to Cook” - Check out Eliza Viðar’s menu
Elísa Viðarsdóttir is an accomplished footballer who plays with Valur.
She is also a master nutritionist, mother, and works as a food scientist.
She needs a lot of energy for the rest of the day and usually makes time to cook good, nutritious food.
My normal day starts with attending work from eight,” Elísa says.
“After work, I go to the store to be able to prepare dinner before I pick up my girl at the kindergarten by three o’clock.”
Eliza finds it very nourishing to pick up her daughter early in kindergarten.
“It’s good to have time with her before I go to practice the second time.
After practice, it's good to come home and just have to warm up the food.
At night, when the girl is asleep, we like to watch one show to empty our minds.”
Elisha does not follow any particular diet.
She is putting the finishing touches on a master's in nutrition, so she knows what is right for her to eat to have enough energy to do work, school, family and exercise.
“What suits me is to eat a wide variety of foods well composed of proteins, carbohydrates and fat.
However, I think the most important thing is to have a healthy relationship with food and not to classify food into bad or good, rather nutritious or nutritious.
Well, it’s okay to eat everything, just not all of a sudden and not always.”
Elisha is very interested in cooking.
“I think there’s a certain amount of meditation in standing in the kitchen cooking, so I get very much into it.
I have to say my confidence is with me in the kitchen and I really believe I am a fine cook.
Breakfast: Oats, chia seeds, hemp seeds, salt, a little lemon juice, left in almond milk overnight.
Then top this meal with what's there every time.
Most of the time it's bananas and brittle muesli & COFFEE.
I'm a big coffee lady.
Intermediate: Incredibly different, but fruit or vegetables, flat cakes, clean skyr with banana and muesli, bread with toppings, and then I could eat hummus with a spoon out of a box if that's the case.
Lunchtime: I often make all kinds of foodie salads out of what exists in the fridge, quinoa or barley, falafels, rocket, oven-baked vegetables with a good dressing is a bit of what I'm working with.
If the planning gets completely out of hand (which happens often), the egg machine at work has come to my rescue quite often, and then it's 2 slices of bread with butter, cheese and boiled egg, don't put any more on you.
Intermediate: Get me something carbohydrate-rich for exercise, bread with toppings, breakfast cereal or fruit.
Dinner: Fish is very often chosen in my home, otherwise some delicious vegetarian dishes.
Outrage between Seattle police and protesters
The city of Seattle, Washington, has declared a state of rebellion following numerous protests in the city centre.
Police yesterday seized flash bombs and pepper spray to try to clear a large area seized by protesters, stretching across many blocks in the vicinity of the city's parliament.
The police announced on Twitter that at least eleven protesters had been arrested and that an investigation was ongoing into vandalism carried out at a police station in the city yesterday, possibly with some kind of bomb.
City and police officials say protesters stoned police with stones, bottles, detonators and other loose-fitting, and one officer was taken to a hospital where his injuries were done.
However, the Seattle protest was peaceful for a long time to come.
They were blasted to show solidarity to protesters in Portland, Oregon, where a city has repeatedly come under intense clashes between protesters and heavily armed federal troops.
There, as in other U.S. cities, people gather under Black Lives Matter, remembers Georges Floyd, who was killed by a Minneapolis police officer on May 25, protests systematic antisemitism in American society and demands improvements.
Not withdrawn until after vote
It is not yet known whether the cancellations of those Icelandair flight attendants, which are due to take effect next month, will be revoked.
An electronic vote on the collective bargaining agreement between the Icelandic Cabin Crew Association on behalf of flight attendants at Icelandair ends at noon tomorrow.
The company’s chairman Guðlaug Líney Jóhannsdóttir says she is confident that Icelandair will not make a decision on the layoffs until the outcome of the vote is known.
“It definitely hangs together,” says Guðlaug Líney.
“There have been no cancellations revoked, this must start to be available so that the machines can be manned.
Then, of course, people are unwilling to know if they will have a job after the month.”
A contract signed a week ago, on the night of July 19, is chosen.
It is expected to run until the end of September 2025, building on a deal previously put to a vote by stewards.
On July 17, the board of directors and the confidential council of the Icelandic Airline Association agreed to announce a full military work stoppage at Icelandair, members agreed in a vote.
It never came to pass, but this was decided following Icelandair’s decision to stop talks with the airline, dismiss all of its flight attendants and seek agreements with another union.
The company's pilots were then to take on the duties of on-board security personnel temporarily.
Asked how she thinks the vote will go, Golden Liney says it's hard to tell.
“People are hurting after this Icelandair encounter, when all of the company’s flight attendants were made redundant and informed that a deal would be made with another union.
Now we'll find out if it has an impact," she says.
940 flight attendants were employed by Icelandair at the end of April, with 900 of them, about 95%, made redundant.
Their notice periods vary in length, with those with the shortest working lives being three months and ending in the month of July-August.
That group includes about 90% of Icelandair flight attendants.
What will it take if the deal is not approved?
“Then we request continued dialogue with our attendees.
With this agreement, we are meeting Icelandair’s demands.
If rejected, it’s clear that flight attendants think they’ve been too far.”
Voting on Collective Bargaining Agreement Ends and Icelandair Presents Second Quarter Settlement Tomorrow
The airline's vote on a new collective bargaining agreement ends at 12 noon tomorrow.
Icelandair’s accounts for the second quarter will also be published tomorrow, with preliminary operating results indicating that the company’s revenue dropped 85 percent from the same period last year.
The electronic vote on the collective bargaining agreement between the Icelandic Cabin Crew Association and the Icelandic Confederation of Labour began on Wednesday, July 22, and ends tomorrow, Monday, July 27, at 12 noon.
Those who may vote for the contract are Icelandair employees who pay social charges to the airline.
Icelandair and FFÍ signed a new collective bargaining agreement on Sunday, July 19, but the Friday before Icelandair had ended talks with the company after flight attendants cancelled the previous agreement in a vote in early July.
Meanwhile, Icelandair had told all of the company’s flight attendants and flight crew on Friday, but they were withdrawn after a new collective bargaining agreement was signed.
Under a new collective bargaining agreement, flight attendants must fly five hours more a month for the same basic pay.
The charter runs until 2025, which has integrated pilot and flight attendant provisions for how long you can fly on a single shift.
The contract was presented to FFÍ members at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica hotel last Monday, and many flight attendants who were spoken to by the agency expressed disappointment about the contract.
Most, however, seemed to agree that the deal must be approved to keep FFÍ alive.
Icelandair’s accounts for the second quarter will be announced tomorrow, but the company’s EBIT, its operating results before capital items and taxes, is according to preliminary operating results negative by USD 100 to 110 million or approximately ISK 15 billion.
Icelandair sent preliminary calculations to the stock exchange last Wednesday, which said that the company’s revenue was approximately $60 million in the quarter or about $8.3 billion.
Cash and cash equivalents were approximately US$154 million at the end of the quarter, around US$21 billion.
Icelandair, meanwhile, aims to offer the company’s share capital in August.
Icelandair aims to complete agreements with fifteen creditors, the government and Boeing the aircraft manufacturer by the end of the month before going to a stock offering.
New variant rather than new type of virus
“A new virus just means that this has been a person who came from abroad.
This is not something that has been grinding here nationally,” stated Már Kristjánsson, head of the National Hospital’s Infectious Diseases Department, of the reports that “a new type of virus” has been detected here.
Three domestic infections were detected yesterday and two at the border.
One person who was diagnosed had participated in a sports club's social activities at the Rey Cup football tournament, but the source of the infection is missing and an infection is ongoing.
An infection was also detected in a person who arrived in the country on July 15, and two people who were in contact with him have begun showing symptoms of COVID — 19.
Yesterday’s infection was identified as related to an infection reported the previous day, and after sequencing at Icelandic Genetics, “a new type of virus that hasn’t been identified here before was discovered.”
Transmission is complete in relation to that infection.
Már states that it is not a new virus but is the same virus that has spread worldwide, i.e. the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
It is more accurate to talk about a new variant of that virus than about a new type of virus.
Asked what that means and if it could say anything about the start of a second wave of outbreaks, Már says that there is currently a single case and it could go on to become nothing more.
“But on the other hand, if there are going to be domestic cases that don’t have ties from abroad and have the same genotype as this particular variant, then it would be possible to conclude [about the second wave] but it is premature at this time,” Már explains.
Happiness in the hot tub
Is the secret to Icelanders’ happiness hidden in the hot tubs?
BBC programme makers are leading the odds in an entertaining video that highlights the country's pool and jacuzzi culture.
The Icelandic bathing culture is unique on a global scale and it is claimed that there are nowhere in the world as many bathing places per inhabitant.
The natural geothermal energy is its base, but it is also the traditional method of swimming.
Children's swimming lessons were mandatory in 1940, but senior citizens are no less able to use the hot water for health benefits.
Swimming is described as a fixed part of the general welfare of the country.
In the pot, everyone is equal, regardless of class and status.
Free from the cellphones, people converse in personal terms about worlds and spaces or enjoy the euphoric power of water: meditating and charging the batteries of soul and body.
On the brink of a hundred days in elections
It is a hundred days before Americans go to vote and choose their president for four years.
Donald Trump is seeking re-election, but at least he has a steep climb.
Joe Biden, the presumed Democratic nominee, has a large lead over Trump nationwide, taking into account the polls.
According to a new AP poll, a record number of Americans believe the nation is on the wrong track.
Trump's response to the new coronavirus pandemic is likewise highly unpopular, and in addition, more Americans than in the past believe the president has kept a poor economic record.
Specifically, only two in ten Americans say America is on the right track.
32 percent say they support Trump's response to the outbreak, and 48 percent say he has held up well on economic issues.
In March, that rate was 56 percent, and in January it was 67 percent.
According to the FiveThirtyEight average, Biden is at 49.9 percent nationwide, while Trump is at 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has tried to shift attention from his performance toward the epidemic to Biden, pushing so-called cultural divides and advocating policies meant to address law and order.
Biden's bid, though, is making great efforts to keep the attention on Trump, believing it's highly likely to be victorious if the election is really about how Trump has performed in the last four years.
Trump's unpopularity also appears to be coming down to Republican House members, fearing progressives that Democrats could even capture a majority in the U.S. Senate, which so far has been very high.
Politico reported on the day that remaining a party and a candidate comparable to what it is now, the Republican Party would have its biggest turnout in decades.
The suburbs have proved particularly bad for the party in the 2016 parliamentary elections and it now looks like that trend will continue.
In recent days, Trump has tried to intimidate suburban residents into following him, including saying that if President Biden becomes president, he will destroy America's suburbs and promote racial divisions.
Among other things, Trump has repealed a regulation from Barack Obama's time in the White House that was designed to increase suburban diversity.
Then he urged the "mistresses" of suburban America to read an article by the former New York lieutenant governor, in which she claimed Biden would destroy suburban America and took Trump under it.
“Biden will destroy your neighborhoods and the American dream.
I will preserve it, and even make it even better!" the president said.
America's suburban population is an ever-expanding group of voters.
According to NPR, they make up about half of all voters in the United States.
Ever since George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the candidate who has received the majority of this group's votes has become president.
Except in 2012, when Mitt Romney received a majority of the vote from this group but lost to Barack Obama.
Opinion polls have shown that although Trump secured a slim majority in the 2016 suburbs, his favorability ratings there have plummeted significantly.
Though there are differences between polls, Biden has polled about fifteen percentage points ahead of Trump in the recent outings.
Regis Philbin is dead
American TV host Regis Philbin has died, aged 88.
Philbin worked as an actor, showrunner, presenter and singer for about six decades.
He is the only known person to lead the popular talk show Live! with Regis between 1988 and 2011 along with Kathie Lee Gifford and later Kelly Ripa.
He has then managed shows such as Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and America's Got Talent.
According to Guinness World Records, Philbin is the person who has been on most hours of American television and has been recognized to that effect.
He received six Emmy Awards during his tenure and was overall nominated 37 times.
A statement from his family states that Philbin died of natural orchids.
A number of colleagues, friends and fans have remembered him on social media over the last day.
Will the Olympics be the light at the end of the tunnel?
After a final decision had been made to postpone the Olympics, an event that only world wars have streamlined until now, the president of the International Olympic Committee said that the famous Olympic flame would be “the light at the end of the tunnel,” referring presumably to a pandemic coronavirus that the world is now following through together.
Affluent people have another year to prepare, and authorities in Japan are adding to the cost of the delay.
Everyone keeps their heads down, though, with a lot at stake.
When it was announced that Tokyo, Japan, would be the venue for this year's Olympics, the celebrations of the Japanese representatives were genuine.
They wept and laughed in turn, as Tokyo had applied to hold the 2016 Games but bowed out of the time to Rio in Brazil.
This time, Tokyo City and Japan should bathe in the world's attention.
The games were due to take place from July 24 to August 9, but have been postponed for a year, starting instead on July 23, 2021 and ending on August 8.
If the Games cannot be held then, if the coronavirus still becomes too much of a threat, the Games will be cancelled.
No one quite wants to think that thought through, though.
Olympics are no ordinary sporting competition.
Nothing is saved, the show should always be amazing and seek to top the last few games.
The selection of a city for the Olympics is based on the selection committee's assessment of the cities' presentations.
The more spectacular the publicity — the more likely to get booed.
Tokyo spent $150 million trying to hold the 2016 Olympics, or roughly $20 billion.
The second time, when the 2020 Games were applied for, $75 million, about ten billion euros, was put into the presentation.
In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo got the Games this year, Japanese authorities had thus already spent as much as ISK 30 billion on the project.
But at least that amount is just a drop in the ocean compared to how much it costs to build Olympic villages, stadiums and generally to strengthen the country's infrastructure to handle this kind of tournament, prepare it and hold the Games themselves.
Organizers in Japan have said the Tokyo Olympics, which should have been running these days but have been postponed for one year because of the coronavirus, would have cost $12.6 billion.
However, a report from Japan's auditor general released at the end of last year found that the cost was nearly double that figure.
It probably won't be possible to fully estimate the cost of postponing the games, but it has been estimated that it may cost between two and six billion dollars in addition to the original cost.
The total cost to the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could therefore run between $15 billion and $30 billion.
There are such large numbers that all of the Icelandic state’s tax revenues would only cover about half of the Olympics, given the lowest possible cost.
Olympics are an event of such magnitude that they have often become the subject of discussion by economists, who try to review numbers and examine the benefits and benefits of the Games.
In the shortest, it seems quite a lot of people have concluded that the impact of the Olympics is less than positive for the economy of the cities that hold them.
Short-term impacts are some, for example, jobs are growing very much in the short term, while longer-term cities tend to be stuck with debt tailwinds and the threatened running costs of little-used infrastructure.
Rio in Brazil is sitting on substantial debt for the 2016 Games and has been troubled by costly maintenance of all the major sports facilities built for the Games.
Figures have been analysed after the London 2012 Games, which have found that only 10 per cent of those who had jobs linked to the Olympics in the city were unemployed before.
This means that there were no new jobs except a small amount.
In general, cities have not been particularly well off financially holding Olympic Games because of the hefty costs associated with the structures built for the Games.
However, benefits are often thought to include an increase in tourist traffic who want to visit the Olympic cities following the Games, which is still highly uncertain regarding the 2021 Games.
It is also unclear whether the full number of spectators who usually attend the Games will be able to be accepted.
The central issue, though, is the honour afforded to the cities, which is hard to value for money.
Because despite the huge cost, you can also say that the joy the games bring is not the kind of thing that you can put on it a price tag.
But while the show tends to be grand and there's nowhere to save, of course it's not just about money.
It's the sporting heroes that are at the forefront.
For some accomplished people, inadvertently postponing the Games is just appealing.
For example, Australian five-time medallist and gold medallist in her pageant Olympics, Chloe Esposito, is casual and would have been away for the summer but is hoping to be in competitive shape for the 2021 Games.
So she's among the athletes who are just rather happy with the postponement, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who planned to retire after this year's Games, had they been held on time, the postponement of the Games in some cases means they retire before the Games take place.
Simply don't trust your body in order to go through another year of rigorous exercise.
Few athletes established themselves as thoroughly in the hearts of spectators at the 2016 Rio Olympics as gymnastics star Simone Biles.
She came home with four golds around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has attended several interviews in his native United States in the past to discuss the Olympics.
She is planning for the 2021 Games, but she is not necessarily sure she will still be able to stay at the top of the Games next year, by which time she will be 24.
Although it is not generally considered advanced age, it is higher for a top-ranked gymnast.
"It's a sensitive issue," Biles says, while smiling at another in an interview posted on the Olympic Committee's Instagram page asked if she intends to reach as far in the 2021 Games as she did in Rio 2016.
“I honestly don’t know if I’ll still be at the top after another year of practice,” says Biles.
She has previously spoken about how her body can't stand the stress of gymnastics training for much longer.
Nevertheless, she is training hard for the 2021 Olympics.
Biles admits it was an uncomfortable feeling having to suddenly stop practicing when the pandemic stalled and the gym was closed.
There were no exemptions for Biles rather than others while all sports facilities were closed for seven weeks.
All her Olympics couldn't buy any access beyond the others, she had to find several ways to stay in shape like anyone else.
The basic form certainly is a little better than most people.
“We have a rigid plan now.
It was hard to start training first again after the gym opened.
We started slowly, but we're back to full speed and I'll be steadily increasing the workouts as the year goes on.
Of course, we don't know exactly how these games will be played or if they will be held, but we still train considering they will be, can't help.
I've worked too hard to leave the sport now," says Biles.
With it, like others, slumbers doubtful or perhaps rather conscious that there may be a situation in which the Games will not be held at all in 2021, either.
Predicting it, though, is hopeless.
No one can know what the status of the coronavirus pandemic will be like in July 2021 and nothing else to do but prepare for the Olympics, considering they will be held a year.
Maybe the Olympic flame will be the light at the end of the Covid tunnel.
Postponed wedding due to outbreak
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding due to the coronavirus.
She was due to marry former Bachelorette contestant Wells Adams this summer.
“I think there are other more important things to think about right now,” the actress told People.
“We really want to get married someday and then have the dream wedding and have everyone present who is dear to us.
But we decided to suspend it and focus on what's important right now, and that's to help share information about the importance of wearing masks and staying home.
I look more at world affairs than wedding affairs these days.
There is a lot going on and we should turn our attention to what is happening in the world.
