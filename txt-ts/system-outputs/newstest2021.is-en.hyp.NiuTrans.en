Shout at the world
The marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland has gone well and shouts and cries in the wild are beginning to draw people all over the world.
"You own the coal mine, I need Iceland," says a woman in the wider world in comments to an advertisement from the marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland on the content provider YouTube.
Another viewer says that she will keep Iceland in her heart forever, and a young woman says that she must get to Iceland as soon as possible, as her fiancee lives there.
Unfortunately, she is in the United States and therefore expects to have to wait some more months.
Another viewer asks if the trail to Iceland is passable, because there are no planes.
It does not follow the story whether it comes from a different time zone.
Egill Þórðarson of the advertising agency Peel, who was involved in the advertising along with the international advertising agency M&C Saatchi, says the reception has been hoped for.
"I came to many Inspired By Iceland campaigns that have gone very well, but this new campaign is already beginning to beat the record.
Basically, it's about creating PR value, it's getting foreign media to cover the campaign, and it's been going incredibly well.
In a relatively short time, we have received coverage in about seven hundred media outlets around the world, totaling more than two billion people.
The value of this consideration is priced at ISK 1.8 billion.
It's not amusing."
The main market is usually the United States, and the campaign has gone very well there, although Americans are not heading to the country soon.
According to Egill, known market areas such as Denmark, Britain and Germany have also received well, like Russia, which is conveniently surprising.
There was also feedback from exotic areas, such as India, which was not specifically suggested.
"These ads have travelled beyond what we expected," says Egill, noting that over four million people have watched the content on YouTube.
"We could not have wished for a better start."
Árni Sæberg, photographer of Morgunblaðið, filmed a commercial entitled "Let It Out" in the middle of last month.
The filming took place far and wide, such as at Skólavörðustígur in Reykjavík, at Reynisfjara, at Skógarfoss, at Sólheimajökull and in a cave at Hjörleifshöfði.
The directors were Samuel Bjarki Pétursson and Gunnar Páll Ólafsson at Skoti Productions and Ottar Guðnason.
The films in question included Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, who are from Cuba and Hungary.
Dozens of Icelanders were involved in the advertising, but at the same time as filming took place in South Iceland, there was another group in West Iceland and the Westfjords.
According to Egill," Let It Out" is only the first part of the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, which is aimed at a winter campaign in collaboration with M&C Saatchi.
"This is just the first phase of this work for Íslandsstofa," says Egill, adding that the collaboration with M&C Saatchi has gone awfully well.
"It's great to work with them.
In projects like this, it's important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the markets we're talking to."
Sprengisandur: Discuss the situation in the labour market, pension funds and much more
Ásmundur Einar Daðason, Minister of Social Affairs and Children, arrives in Sprengisandur, starting at 10: 00 Bylgjan today.
He is also the Minister of Labour and discusses the situation in the labour market as such, the Icelandair case and other issues.
He also discusses rural issues and the relocation of jobs to the country, which has been difficult and controversial in recent years and decades.
VR Chairman Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson will also attend the show, but he will discuss his criticisms regarding pension fund investments and propose that the labor movement and employers withdraw from the board of the funds to reduce the risk of conflict of interest.
Ívar Ingimarsson, tourism manager in East Iceland, and Árnheiði Jóhannsdóttir, director of the North Iceland Marketing Office, will talk about the situation in tourism in the rural areas.
They will look into the autumn and wonder whether the success of the summer is a deceptive foreword to what is to come.
You can listen to the show below, starting at 10: 00.
This is how she looks today 25 years later
Actress Elisa Donovan had a successful career in youth shows of all kinds.
However, she received worldwide fame for her portrayal of Amber in the film Clueless 25 years ago.
She also starred in Sabrina: The Teenage Witch with Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury and Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married with one child.
Little has happened recently, but she was able to look across the road and comment on Clueless on Australian television in the days.
She talks beautifully about Brittany Murphy, who died unexpectedly in 2009, and says she was a great person.
"I have to admit that I based the character mainly on girls I met at school who were not nice to me.
As soon as I read the script, I knew who this character was," Donovan said of his play in Clueless.
Didn't want to leave the police station after overnight accommodation
About fifty cases were brought to the police board in the capital area today, and the police diary says that the cases were varied.
The day at the police station at Hverfisgata began with police having to intervene with a man who had recently been released from a holding cell after staying there for drunk driving.
The man did not want to leave after he was released and did not follow police orders that told him to leave.
The man earned himself a continued stay at the police station because of his progress.
A man was arrested in the morning on suspicion of burglary in a company in Kópavogur.
Police also had to intervene with two men in Breiðholt due to reports of assault.
It also happened that a woman who was eating at a shopping mall in Kópavogur could not pay for the bill after the meal and was therefore called to the police.
There were also reports of theft of a car in the town centre this morning.
The driver of a white Renault van looked at her for a moment and she was taken aback.
The car has not been found.
Curse of the Glee Band - The Terrible Destiny of the Glee
The theory has spread on the Internet that the season about the band is cursed, but actress Naya Rivera drowned in California in the days before, becoming the third main actor to die far in advance.
The series about the band Glee is a popular series about singing, dancing and joy.
The series revolved around the so-called happy band of teenagers in high school, their love and their fate.
It wasn't always taken out with pleasure to be in the band, but through singing and dancing, the characters of the show seemed to overcome whatever circumstances arose in their lives.
But outside the set, the show's actors and staff have been suffering so much that theories have arisen that there is a curse on the show.
Naya Marie Rivera played Santana Lopez on the show, a cheerleader who didn't call everything her grandmother.
After the season had passed, Rivera married actor Ryan Dorsey and had his first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and subsequently divorced.
However, Dorsey refused to file an appeal and the domestic violence case was dropped.
On July 8, Rivera was reported missing after her four-year-old son was found alone drifting in a boat on Lake Piru, California.
The boy was found asleep in a life jacket on board the boat, and he was able to tell police that he and his mother had plunged into the water, and Rivera had brought him back to the boat, but never returned there herself.
Beginning an extensive search for Rivera.
The day after the search began, the police chief in the area reported that a search had concluded that Rivera had drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found and officially pronounced dead.
She is believed to have been caught in a heavy current in the water and used her last claim to save the son.
The cause of death was recorded drowned by accident.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith played Finn Hudson on the show, the American footballer with the angel voice who played a key role in bringing the band to glory and glory.
Outside the show, however, Moneith wrestled with personal demons.
From the age of 13, he had struggled with addiction and found it difficult to escape.
In 2013, his colleagues on the show felt enough, intervened and urged him to seek help.
Moneith then underwent treatment and seemed to be looking for a better way.
Just two months after he finished treatment, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after going out to have fun with friends.
Banamein was found to be a lethal combination of drugs and alcohol.
It was not thought that this was the case.
Moneith had undergone treatment and his tolerance to drugs had been reduced so much that a dose he had previously tolerated proved fatal.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
His death was heavy on his colleagues, but at the behest of his opponent, Lea Michele, it was decided to continue filming and dedicate a whole episode to the memory of Moneith and his character Finn.
Mark Wayne Salling played Noah "Puck" Puckerman on the show, Puck was an American football player, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellow members of the band, until he got the courage to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested in his Los Angeles home on suspicion of child pornography possession.
A search of his home found a large amount of child pornography and the case soon became public.
It was clear that Salling was finished.
He was subsequently charged and convicted of his crimes.
He was sentenced to four to seven years in prison as well as having to be on the sex offenders register and seek treatment for child pornography.
Before the judge had determined the punishment, Salling, who was then out on bail, was found dead near his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
It wasn't just the actors of the show who fell from a long time ago.
Jim Fuller was the show's assistant director.
He died suddenly in his sleep in 2013 at the age of 41.
The show also featured a woman named Nancy Motes.
She was the younger sister of superstar Julia Roberts and did not bear the beautiful story to her sister, but she accused Roberts of extreme control and disrespectful behaviour.
Motes took her own life in 2014, but she suffered from severe depression.
She left a letter to her fiancee, saying that her mother and sister were responsible for how she was treated.
"My mother and my so-called siblings get nothing from me except the memory that it was them that caused my worst depression."
Lea Michel was the star of the show.
She has recently been accused of bullying and bullying her co-stars on the set and being an overbearing star.
Jesse Luken made a guest appearance on the show in 2012.
He was arrested and charged with drunk driving in 2019, which was a huge scandal.
Actress Heather Morris played a major role in the show.
In 2010, she suffered from unscrupulous hackers getting naked pictures of her and posting on the Internet.
Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both appeared on the show and had an affair outside the show.
Benoist later reported that Jenner had sexually assaulted her in the relationship.
You can put flowers on almost everything
It increases the development of children when they get to play in the garden with their parents to grow flowers and watch them grow and thrive.
It is also endlessly possible to do with flowers, as Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Just having a moment with the children in the garden is something that is never forgotten.
They will remember the flowers, the fragrance and, of course, the precious time they had with their parents.
Bought a boat after the tenth grade
"I don't think there are many fishermen who work in the country's kindergartens," says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, who studies coastal fishing in the summer but studies psychology at the University of Iceland during the winter."
Coastal fishing is a very convenient summer job when you are studying.
If you fish well, you can have a good income and I think it's great to be able to skip taking student loans.
The income is also good for me into the winter," says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, a 25-year-old psychologist, who practices coastal fishing in the summer as in recent summers.
Axel was recently docked at Tálknafjörður when a reporter spoke of him late in the evening at the start of the week."
"The winter I was in the tenth grade, I took command rights for boats that are under twelve meters long, and I bought my boat the summer after I finished elementary school.
I've been fishing on my boat all summer since.
I bought the boat used by my acquaintance, Hartmann Jónsson, and I called the boat his name.
Hartmann was an adult when I bought the boat and stopped being at sea, and he was very happy when he saw that the boat bore his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took over the boat," says Axel, adding that he bought the boat for three million.
"I made a deal with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of the summer and the other half at the end of the summer when I was done fishing.
So I had the boat indebted at the end of this first summer of mine on it."
But how could a boy have a million and a half to pay out on a boat when he just finished elementary school?
"I had set up and collected money, I had been working with my dad at sea when I was a boy, I spent all summer fishing with him and got my share.
I also put my confirmation money in my boat fund."
Axel was born in Ísafjörður, from where all his mother's people are, but he has lived in Kópavogur since he was a boy.
"I can fish here in the West because I have a legal domicile with my grandmother in Ísafjörður.
I learned in this area in the west from paddling with my dad.
I move between the fjords as I feel, because this fishing area covers the entire Westfjords.
While I find it best to be in the west, I have also fished around Snæfellsnes and elsewhere.
I have also hunted in the south, but mostly grey-free," says Axel, who always roars one day early in the morning and says that he sometimes talks to the seagulls and sings to the sky, in solitude for hours outside the ballroom.
"The offshore internet connection is good, so I can call, listen to podcasts and music.
I don't mind being alone on a boat.
Of course, I try to avoid getting into danger, but there has occasionally been something wrong with the weather, but never much danger," says Axel, who is lucky that he is never seasick.
He says the length of the day's work depends on how the fishing goes.
"I never spend more than 14 hours fishing at a time, but I've also been fishing in other systems, for example in the rental quota, in which case I've been continuously fishing for 24 hours and a half."
The beach fishing arrangement he says is such that he can catch 770 kilos a day, which he finds prohibitive.
"Other restrictions are that I can't catch Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and I can only catch twelve days a month, during the four months of coastal fishing, in May, June, July and August.
In my opinion, fishermen should choose their fishing days according to the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure on people is to row instead of having 48 days over the whole summer and be able to choose according to their own head.
Then the division could also go for me, and the fishing grounds that are well located by the fishing grounds should be allowed to enjoy it," says Axel, who mainly draws cod from the salt sea during his coastal fishing, but also only saffron and some other species float along.
Axel works during the winter with the university program Núpi in Kópavogur.
"I don't think there are many sailors working in the country's kindergartens," Axel says proudly, adding that he only intended to work temporarily in the kindergartens.
"I'm stuck there because I think it's a great job.
I hope the psychology degree will be useful to me at the preschool level in the future," says Axel, who is also a long time business student.
Registration error prevented homeschooling
An error in the registration form that people fill out when they come to the country caused a person resident in this country to not be called back for sampling.
It is not a requirement to register a social security number if the person fills in the form in English, as is when it is done in Icelandic.
"This will be examined this week," says an expert at the Directorate of Health's Disease Prevention Department.
Three domestic infections were diagnosed at the virology department of Landspítali Hospital yesterday.
One of those who tested positive came to the country on 15 July, two days after the entry into force of the so-called home quarantine rules.
Those who were resident in Iceland are screened on arrival in the country and returned for sampling four to five days later.
However, RÚV's lunch news reported that the person in question had followed the old system.
The sampling at the border was negative and he was not called back for screening for the virus.
Kamilla Ruth Sigfúsdóttir, expert at the Directorate of Health's Disease Prevention Department, says in a conversation with the news agency that this can be attributed to an error in the electronic registration form.
If people fill out the registration form in English, it is not a requirement to enter an ID number, as is in the Icelandic version.
As a result, it was primarily intended for foreign tourists.
Therefore, the person did not receive an automatic invitation to take a sample.
However, Kamilla says that many people have followed the rules on the return portal although they have filled the registration form in English, and in some cases employers have also been vigilant about sending people for sampling again after they came to the country.
"This week, we will look at how to make it easier for people to draw their attention to the process."
The man is in solitary confinement and six have been quarantined.
They all had a biopsy, but two had begun to show symptoms.
Infection is now underway with the three infections diagnosed yesterday, but it is mostly complete due to two infections reported on Friday.
In both cases, sequencing of the Icelandic genetic analysis has revealed that there are variants of the coronavirus that have not been found here before.
In one case, the ties have focused on Israel, although it is known that the person who brought the virus to the country had also traveled to other European countries.
Kamilla says it should be known tomorrow where the other virus was coming from.
A total of 15 are now in isolation, according to the website COVID is.
135 are in quarantine.
Four out of five infections unrelated
Five domestic infections have been diagnosed in Iceland in recent days.
Of these, four are completely unrelated and, for example, the origin of the infection that occurred at the Rey Cup sports tournament yesterday has not been determined.
Infection is still ongoing.
In the early 1920s, they were exceptionally sent to quarantine, but they were reduced to sixteen.
A total of 34 are in quarantine because of the new infections diagnosed yesterday.
This is the second time in a short time that infection is detected at a sporting event and has raised questions about whether to hold such events.
Jóhann K. Jóhannsson, Director of Communications at the National Commissioner's Civil Protection Department, says it's possible to do so as long as people follow the norms and rules.
"We are constantly urging all those who live here that there has to be an individual level of infection prevention.
We also need to urge people who are hosting events that there are certain rules that need to be followed.
Then you can hold events," says Jóhann.
He says that infections can be prevented by maintaining an individual level of infection control.
The rules and criteria are also under constant review.
"What has to be done, and what the Civil Protection Department and the National Medical Association are constantly pressing people, is to consider these individual infectious diseases.
Both at home and also at service companies.
That people wash their hands and use alcohol.
It prevents transmission from continuing," says Johann.
"We need to urge people to continue on the good road we were on, in order to sustain the results we have so far achieved."
40% of COVID-19 victims had diabetes 2
Devon Brumfield heard through the phone how difficult her father was to breathe.
Her father had diabetes, so she encouraged him to seek medical help.
The next day, he was dead.
The death was attributed to sudden breathing difficulties due to coronavirus infection.
Diabetes was listed on the death certificate as an underlying problem and Brumfield, who also has diabetes, is terrified that it will only happen.
Reuters news agency says Brumfield's fears are not unfounded.
Figures from a new study commissioned by the US government show that almost 40% of those dead had diabetes 2 as their underlying disease.
When examining the proportion of those who had not reached the age of 65, the proportion rises to half.
The US CDC's study included more than 10,000 people in 15 states who died from the coronavirus between February and May.
Jonathan Wortham, a specialist in infectious diseases at CDC, says the results are striking, not least for those diagnosed with diabetes 2 and their loved ones.
Reuters reported that Reuters had conducted a survey, pointing out the 12 states that responded to similar proportions.
10 states, including California, Arizona and Colombia, are not yet reporting underlying diseases.
"Diabetes was already an epidemic in slow growth.
Now COVID-19 has broken through like a powerful wave," says Reuters by Elbert Huang, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago.
Diabetes is more common among blacks and people of South American origin, which has also gone worse from the coronavirus.
One of the best protection for those with diabetes 2 is to control the disease through exercise, a healthy diet and the help of health care professionals.
However, the coronavirus pandemic has made it difficult for many to maintain routine.
The high price of insulin has forced some people to continue to work and thus risk being exposed to the virus.
Reuters points out that the US authorities may have been aware of the risk that people with diabetes 2 could pose to the virus.
When the SARS coronavirus passed in 2003, more than 20% of them had the disease and during the swine flu epidemic in 2009, this group was at three times the risk of having to be hospitalized.
When MERS did so in 2012, one study showed that 60% of those who died or were admitted to intensive care had diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz of Yale University says that because the effects of the COVID-19 virus could last longer, the epidemic has exposed a number of previously unknown complications.
"I fear we will see a tidal wave of problems when this is over," says Andrew Bolton chair of the International Diabetes Association.
Doctors have warned that the coronavirus epidemic may indirectly lead to an increase in complications related to diabetes, including kidney disease and kidney dialysis.
Similarly, new research suggests that the coronavirus may lead to an increase in diabetes cases.
Reuters says scientists are trying to understand the link between coronavirus and diabetes 2.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs and kidneys, organs that are already sick in many people with diabetes.
In addition, high glucose and lipid ratios in diabetics can produce a true "cytokine storm," as it's called when the immune system overreacts and attacks the body.
Damaged endothelial cells can also lead to inflammation, which in turn can lead to fatal blood clots.
"This is all one big puzzle," says Dela Cruz.
"It's all interrelated."
The news has been corrected.
"We were offered champagne, then they left the room"
The couple Ásrún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason received an unusual request from artist Ragnar Kjartansson to have sex in front of a camera for a work the artist was putting up in Paris.
"We loved each other so it wasn't complicated."
Atli Bollason never forgets when he met his wife and mother, Ásrún Magnúsdóttir, for the first time.
"I became very fascinated with her.
It was naturally just the emission, but then I thought it was also quite unheard of.
And still it seems," he says.
Ásrún also remembers this, as the husband regularly recalls the first meeting.
"I'm always hearing this story.
Last just this weekend," she says, who was also attracted to her husband at first encounter.
"I felt and feel so much excitement around Atli, which I like.
There's a lot going on and a lot going on and I was fascinated by it."
Atli says that the couple have focused on their relationship to go their own ways.
"We don't tie our bales to the same knots as fellow travelers.
We avoid the routine we see around us."
That's possibly why they took the talk from artist Ragnar Kjartansson, although it was rather unusual.
"Our mutual friend Kristín Anna contacts us and asks if we can come to dinner with her, Ragga and Ingibjörg Ragnar's wife, at Snaps."
They accepted the invitation, met the trio at Snaps and had a deserter and a dessert.
They listened to Ragnar, who led them through his plans for an art exhibition he planned to put up in Palais de Tokyo in Paris in the autumn.
"He had a marvelous video work called Scenes from western culture.
He described it in a simple way."
Ásrún says that he described the work as banal and decadent scenes from the everyday life of Westerners.
"He had sketches of all the scenes he was going to shoot and last he told us about what he wanted to know if we were interested in participating in."
The scene that Ragnar asked the couple to participate in was supposed to show a young middle-class couple making love in a minimalist room.
"This is sex with beginning and end," says Atli.
The couple didn't know Ragnar much if they knew about him and him about them," but they knew us and thought we fit into this.
They had a saying that they did not want to advertise for people.
Maybe they thought that they would not get the right people but people who would get sexual masturbation from performing for others."
They called Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it didn't take long.
"When we walked out of Snaps, we said: Aren't we ready for this?
It was just that way.
I trust Ragnar as an artist and his whole team," says Ásrún and Atli.
"It's about love and intimacy"
The scene was filmed in a fine apartment on Mýrarvegur.
There was a very small film crew; the cameraman, Ragnar and the sound man and the couple.
After the recording was turned on, everyone left the room to wait outside in the car except Atli and Ásrún.
"We hadn't decided anything how we should be.
We had some little instructions, but we tried to forget the moment and the place.
To be unaware of what we were doing and for whom.
There was nothing played, we just loved each other so it wasn't complicated," says Ásrún.
But was it romantic?
"Yes, it was a little romantic," says Atli, and Ásrún agrees.
"We were offered champagne before they left the room.
It was a little like being on vacation at a fancy hotel in Paris."
The team was pleased with the couple's performance in the work that moved them.
"When Tommi watched it, he cried, he thought it was so beautiful," says Atli.
"This is as much about love and intimacy as the intercourse itself," says Ásrún.
The couple's parents have seen the work, and Atli says that his mother heard the son's voice at the Reykjavík Art Museum and then realised that he was part of the work.
"Then she turned around and began to think about it," says Atli.
"Mom and dad saw this in Paris.
We hadn't told anyone this way, but then dad sent me a message and said: Nice to meet the little family in Palais de Tokyo," Ásrún recalls.
And I wonder if the subject of the work has deepened Ásrún's relationship with Atli?
"At least we're still together, so maybe it deepened something.
At least this deepened my relationship with my family-in-law," says Ásrún, laughing.
Ásrún herself saw the work in Copenhagen with her colleague.
"I found it a little difficult not to be with you but someone else," she says, turning to her husband.
"But it was nice to see this because it's just one scene in a much bigger work and when you saw it with the other pieces, it's really cool.
I could a little tear myself away from this and was just proud.
And there was the little bean in my stomach," says Ásrún, who was pregnant with one of the couple's children when the scene was filmed.
"It was just beautiful."
Anna Marsibil Clausen talked to Ásrún and Atli in Love Stories on Rás 1.
Swansea with a win in the first semi-final
Swansea won a 1-0 victory over Brentford in a dramatic match.
This was the team's first game in the semi-final to qualify for the Premier League.
The match took place at Swansea's home stadium in Wales.
The score in the half was 0-0.
Swansea's home side received a penalty in the 64th minute, but Andre Ayew reacted furiously to the penalty and allowed a penalty.
Just two minutes later, Brentford player Rico Henry received a red card.
Brentford therefore played the rest of the game fewer and in the 82nd minute Swansea players took advantage of the team difference.
Andre Ayew then added up the penalty kick by scoring a great goal and securing Swansea a 1-0 victory.
Swansea therefore leads 1-0 in the duel, with the second match taking place next Wednesday at Brentford's home stadium.
Ambassador for five years from 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the US ambassador to Iceland, is in the spotlight after CBS reported this morning that he wanted an armed bodyguard as he feared for his life.
However, it has not been easy for the President of the United States to appoint an ambassador in Iceland.
Since Carol Van Voorst's resignation at the end of April 2009, there has been a total of 62 ambassadors in the country for more than five years.
Van Voorst resigned under strange circumstances, but Kastljós reported in 2009 that she should have received the falcon.
On the way to a farewell meeting with the President of Iceland, she received a call from the President of Iceland that she would not be honored.
After leaving Iceland, she taught international relations at the Army War College.
Sixteen months passed until Van Voorst's successor came to office in September 2010.
It is partly due to the fact that Robert S. Connan had been appointed as ambassador, but then resigned.
At last Loius Ariega had worked in the foreign service for decades.
He retired in 2013 and served as ambassador to Guatemala.
Then another ambassador-free period took place.
Robert Barber received approval from the United States Congress in January 2015 and came to work shortly thereafter, when no ambassador had been there for 13 months.
Barber was a political appointee, not a diplomat, but had worked as an attorney and supported Barack Obama's campaign fund.
He resigned as soon as Donald Trump assumed the presidency on 20 January 2017, as is customary with politically appointed ambassadors.
The Trump administration was unusual in appointing both ambassadors and high-ranking officials to the Washington administration.
It took two years before the United States Congress invited Jeffrey Ross Gunter to his meeting to question him and confirm him as ambassador to Iceland.
In his testimony in parliament, he said he had never been to Iceland, but often to Western Europe, but his wife, who is dead, had been of Dutch descent.
Gunter is politically appointed, was formerly a dermatologist in California and has been a prominent member of the Republican Jewish Coalition.
Casino owner Sheldon Adelson founded the organization, while Adelson is an enthusiastic supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to work in Iceland in May 2019, when no ambassador had been in Iceland since early 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest example in Iceland.
The reason is both how long Trump's administration was nominating people for key positions as well as the fact that the work of the United States Congress has been greatly delayed, including the confirmation of an ambassador to office.
Since 2009, it has been a diplomatic mission in Iceland for over five years.
However, this has not prevented the construction of the embassy, which recently opened its headquarters at Engjatseig.
The construction is believed to have cost around 6.5 billion, with thick security walls surrounding the building and bulletproof glass in all windows.
However, it does not seem to have enough to fill the current ambassador with security because he is said to be fearful for his life and has asked for an armed bodyguard.
Former ÍBV player suffered racism in Iceland - "It was a mistake to come to Iceland"
Former IBV player Tonny Mawejje says he suffered racism when he was in Iceland and that he regrets coming to the country.
This is reflected in an interview with Tonny published on the Ugandan newspaper Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined Uganda Police FC, which plays in Uganda's top league.
In the interview with Daily Monitor, Tonny talks about many things, including his time in Iceland, playing with ÍBV, Val and Þrutti in Iceland.
"When I came to Iceland, I didn't play in the middle as I used to play.
The captain of the team was in that position, but he also had the jersey number that I wanted to have so I didn't get any of what I wanted," says Tonny, who played on the right flank during the season with ÍBV.
Among the things that Tonny talks about is racism that he suffered in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players are exposed to when playing in Europe.
"This happened to me once, but as I didn't understand the language, I just ignored what was said to me.
Later, I heard about the case and then I asked my friend what the case was about.
He then told me that my opponent dropped a racist comment on me after I tackled him."
In 2014, Tonny left Iceland for Norway, where he joined Haugesund.
He says he made the mistakes he sees most.
Tonny hadn't managed to qualify for Haugesund's starting lineup, but he wanted to play more to qualify for the national team.
He then asked to return to Iceland on loan, but he then joined Val.
"It was a mistake to come back to Iceland on loan.
I think if I had been in Norway longer, I would have had the opportunity I wanted," says Tonny, but he hoped that if he would play well in Norway, he would probably get further.
He wants to mean that the loan to Iceland has ruined his dreams of joining a major European club.
Found a worm in a woman's throat
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8 cm long black worm in a woman's tonsils.
The doctors managed to pull the worm out with forceps.
Investigation revealed that it was a parasite.
CNN is reporting this.
The woman had a few days before eaten sashimi, which are thin slices of meat.
The female recovered quickly after the worm was removed, but parasites such as this are often found in raw meat or fish.
After the outbreak of Sushi in the West, the number of parasitic infections has increased, according to CNN.
Fear of a second wave starting in Europe
Spain is now at the forefront of concerns over the second wave of the coronavirus in Europe, where the government has taken action to restrain the spread of the coronavirus.
In Catalonia, the entire entertainment life has been put on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelonas where infections are rising.
Other European countries have also taken action to increase the number of infections in Spain, but in the UK everyone has to be quarantined on return from Spain, like in Norway, and France has been warned about travel to Spain.
Infections are also rising again in France and Germany, as governments try to find a balance between curbing the spread of the virus and restarting the economy.
However, the situation in Europe is good compared to the rest of the world, with the global incidence approaching 300,000 a day, with the highest number of infections in the Americas and South Asia.
There are 16 million confirmed infections worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University, with 644 deaths confirmed to be related to the virus.
Gerður's mosaics are finally allowed to enjoy themselves to the fullest
In front of the Tollhúsið in Reykjavík is a large and deep pit.
On top of it are men with orange helmets.
There is also a large dig.
And more smaller trucks.
The street is closed to traffic.
But the corridor is passable, and now many people stop and respect the artwork from millions of mosaics - as if they've never seen it before.
Maybe they've never seen it before.
At least not respected it.
The work has so far been somewhat hidden, directly in front of it were parking spaces that were always occupied.
People parked there, locked the car in a hurry and then jumped off to do their business in the city center.
"Living and varied public spaces" and "attractive city tastes" are the guiding light for the restoration of Tryggvagata.
The goal is to beautify the area and allow Gerður Helgadóttir's mosaics at Tollhúsið to enjoy the view better.
In front of the work there will be a square and as the area is well suited to the sun, it is considered suitable for pedestrians.
The artwork will be illuminated and the materials will now enjoy themselves better than before on this 142 square meter surface.
There will also be small "fog sprays," a kind of water sculptures that offer play and give the area a certain mystery.
In this way, the improvements are described by the city of Reykjavík, which is undergoing construction along with Veitur.
The pipes of the water, heating and electricity supply will be renewed.
Many of them have come to their years, but the sewage pipes and cold water data date back to 1925 and have served residents and businesses in the town centre for almost a century.
When the street is reopened after construction, cars can drive through it again.
However, it becomes a non-directional street and at the same time creates a quieter and more accessible space for pedestrians.
According to the website of the Directorate of Customs, the house was put into use in 1971, and its architect was Gísli Halldórsson.
Because of the damage to the building, a 250 square meter window-free wall was created on the street.
The building committee and the architect agreed that such a surface would adversely affect the overall street image if no special measures were taken to adorn the appearance of the building.
The parties agreed to expect to have a permanent artwork installed there.
At this time, a lot of words came from artist Gerður Helgadóttir, according to the summary.
She had worked extensively on mosaics in Germany and elsewhere.
It was decided to contact her first before deciding whether to conduct a competition for the work.
It had often been said that the work needed to reflect life at the harbour, as the harbour had been the lifeblood of Reykjavík since it was built.
When talking to the artist, she had to trax the idea of such a work.
It was agreed that she would receive drawings and other assistance before leaving the country, where she would work on the proposals abroad.
Gerður got the time she decided she needed, and when she returned home, she submitted several proposals for discussion.
It was agreed without delay to ask her to do the work.
At the same time, she and the famous art company in Germany, Breiðarna Oidtmann, who had long worked with them on the installation of famous works of art around Europe.
Contracts were reached and Gerður worked on the artwork for the installation of the workshop of the brothers, who then arranged the installation of the Tollhúsið.
All the work was exceptionally well done, both by Gerður Helgadóttir and Oidtmannbrothers, according to the summary.
It has ever since endured an unbearable Icelandic weather.
It took about two years to do the work, which was done and installed in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after the completion of the Tollhouse work at the age of 47.
Prepares to relocate more institutions to the country
Minister of Social Affairs Ásmundur Einar Daðason calls for more government agencies to be moved to the country in the near future.
The Minister said this in the episode Sprengisandur on Bylgjan at noon.
Recently, it was announced that the fire department of the Housing and Construction Authority will be moved north to Sauðárkrókur in the autumn.
Six fire experts work at the agency, but none of them intends to follow the agency north, and the National Association of Firefighters and Ambulance Workers has criticised the transfer of residence.
"I think we should take further steps in this direction.
I'm preparing further steps in this direction.
Further transport," said Ásmundur.
He says he is convinced that the vast majority of the nation wants to see more distribution of government agencies around the country.
"I think there have to be further political decisions to relocate government jobs to the country, like I was doing with the Housing and Construction Authority," said Ásmundur, who also took examples of other institutions that have been relocated to the country and were important to communities in the country, such as the relocation of the Food and Veterinary Authority to Selfoss, the National Land Survey of Iceland to Akranes and unemployment insurance to Skagaströnd.
All the main things from the second day of the Champions League
The 94th Icelandic freestyle championships ended at Þórsvöllur in Akureyri today.
A number of tournament records were set on the second day of competition.
Vigdís Jónsdóttir from FH set the Icelandic record for a ventricular ejection in 2014, which lasted until Elísabet Rut Rúnarsdóttir from ÍR improved the record in May last year.
Vigdís won the Icelandic record back earlier this summer and has been in great shape lately, but she has tripled the Icelandic record for the rest of the summer.
Elísabet Ruth has been struggling with injuries and did not recover today.
She had only one valid throw out of five, throwing 25.69 yards, which is far from her best.
Vigdís threw the longest of all today, 60.08 meters in her last attempt and set a tournament record.
Her Icelandic record she set earlier in July is 62.69 meters, so she was somewhat away from it.
Guðrún Karitas Hallgrímsdóttir from ÍR had the second best throw of the day, but she improved her best performance with a throw of 50.18 meters.
In the men's category, Hilmar Örn Jónsson, the Icelandic record holder in a fight, won a safe victory, but he threw 73.84 metres in his second last throw and set a tournament record.
His record in the industry is 75.26 meters.
Guðni Valur Guðnason, Olympic gymnast and Icelandic record holder in a round throw, won a competition in a ball throw at Þórsvöllur yesterday, but today he competed in a round throw, which is his main article.
Guðni Valur's record is 65.53 meters, but he threw the longest 59.13 meters today and secured the victory.
Valdimar Hjalti Erlendsson threw for the second time today, but he had one valid throw that lasted for 49.43 meters.
Hafdís Sigurðardóttir, the Icelandic record holder in the long jump, won the long jump competition with dominance, but Hafdís jumped the longest 6.25 meters today, which is less than 40 cm from her Icelandic taste.
In the women's 200-meter race, Guðbjörg Jóna Bjarnadóttir was the fastest sprinter, finishing in 24.04 seconds, while her Icelandic record is 23.45 seconds.
Guðbjörg Jóna was victorious in Akureyri, where she won two gold medals yesterday, in the 100 meters and in the 4 x 100 meters relay and also in the 4 x 400 meters relay today.
In the men's category, Kolbeinn Höður Gunnarsson of FH was first in the 200-metre race in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of Óliver Mána Samúelsson of Ármann.
Like Guðbjörg Jóna, Kolbeinn Höður won gold in the 100 meters yesterday as well as in the 400 meters.
Does not get a fine for a $27 million Bitcoin harvest
The Board of Internal Revenue has rejected the claim of a tax investigation director who claimed a fine on a man for understating his capital gains arising from the sale of Bitcoin.
The committee concludes that the tax investigation director had not provided a clear justification for why it was necessary to fine the man.
The committee's ruling states that the tax investigation director considered the man to have had substantially incorrect tax returns for the income years 2016 and 2017.
He would have underestimated his capital gains arising from the sale of Bitcoin of 27 million, either intentionally or unintentionally.
The man should be punished for his conduct.
The man declined in a letter to the committee.
However, he admitted that in 2016 he sold $27 million.
It would have been acquired by excavation in 2009 and 2010 when it would have been easy and unpleasant with a normal household computer.
He pointed out that when he sold the coins, the tax practice for such a sale was significantly unclear and unforeseeable.
It could almost have been expected that citizens would be aware of such measures in a tax return.
He would not have intended to avoid paying tax on the harvest and would have accounted for his property in the tax return as a deposit on the foreign exchange account.
He had asked both the connoisseurs and the governor about how this was done, but was unsuccessful.
He believed that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he began digging for Bitcoin.
He would therefore have been in a worse position than others to study complex rules that the tax authorities would not have formed a clear opinion on.
The man therefore considered it appropriate that his taxes for the two income years should be redetermined and the burden applied, but otherwise no penalty should be imposed.
He reiterated that he worked in Iceland and had paid taxes in Iceland since 2012.
He would never have intended to get out of his duties improperly.
The claim of guilt would be out of all proportion and would plunge him into debt.
Brynjólfur stirs mention: "This man understands about what football is"
Brynjólfur Andersen Willumsson has been quite a bit between the teeth of people but has also been impressed by his progress for the remainder of the season with Breiðablik in the Pepsi Max League.
Breiðablik will be in the line of fire tonight when they host ÍA live on Channel 2 Sport.
Brynjólfur then cancels the game because of four reminders during the season and therefore does not show up with a new haircut like in the summer games so far.
He had written "blah, blah, blah" on his head before the game with HK last Thursday, which HK won 1-0.
"I don't know who exactly he was answering with the payment, but speaking of character, this one was rather better to try in the game.
He didn't hide.
He wants the ball every time and if there was anyone going to equalise this game, I thought he would do it or create it," said Guðmundur Benediktsson of Pepsi Max stands, when the talk came to Brynjólfur.
"I'm supposed to be here for the people."
"It's difficult sometimes to realize what position he is in.
He looks a little bit out on the left as the game goes on, but he has a very free run in the team," said Hjörvar Hafliðason.
Thorkel Máni Pétursson says Brynjólfur is a real entertainer and celebrates having such a colorful man in the league: "No one disputes that this is a character.
This is a fun type and I love this with my hair, and to always be ready to meet and answer in interviews.
There are incredibly many people occupied by him, who tell me that this man understands about what football is.
"I'm an entertainer.
I'm supposed to be here for the people and enjoy it."
People are reading Brynjólfur's interviews, people are paying in and watching what's next on his hair.
This man is just a genius," said Máni.
KR player says he wants to leave the club - "I have been in touch with several B-League teams"
Tobias Thomsen, a KR player in the Pepsi Max League, seems to be leaving the team.
According to the Danish newspaper Bold, Tobias is ready to return to Denmark.
Football.net also reported the matter.
Tobias wants to achieve the start of the season in his home country, but to do so he has to cancel his contract at KR where the Danish league starts before the Icelandic Championship.
The club knows that I miss Denmark and have shown me great understanding," Tobias said in a conversation with Bold.
"I have been in touch with several teams in the B League and will probably switch over before the Icelandic season ends.
There are not many teams in Denmark that can afford to pay up my contract at KR."
He says that he probably has to take on a salary cut in Denmark.
"Companies in Denmark have probably felt more the economic impact of the virus than in Iceland."
Biker whisperer Bjartmar has recovered bikes for millions - now answers for himself after DV review
For over a year, Bjartmar Leósson has had a hobby unlike most others.
He sniffs and saves lost and stolen bicycles, electric bikes and scooters.
Bjartmar has earned the name "the wheel whisperer" as a result.
Yesterday, there was a considerable stir when a man published a story about his dealings with Bjartmar.
DV then referred to a discussion on Facebook group Vesturbæðinga where it was stated that Bjartmar had taken the man to talk in Austurvöllur and said the scooter was possibly stolen.
It was not possible to read from the original writings of the electric harpoon but that Bjartmar had stolen it.
That text has now been changed on Facebook and the headline of the original DV news updated accordingly.
Bjartmar says the initial news of the case is not at all representative of what really went on yesterday in Austurvöllur.
Bjartmar said he received information from a victim of an electric harpoon that it was truly his electric harpoon.
The information received the alleged owner from others, but the information proved false, says Bjartmar.
"I saw the guy and I looked at the shuttle, providing information that there was an electric shuttle that had been missing for a long time and was searched for.
I certainly hesitated at first, but when I saw him preparing to drive off the shuttle, I decided to talk to the man.
The owner was sure of his fault, so I decided to have a conversation with the man.
In general, I'm very fine in such a case, but before I managed to finish what I had to say, the man had taken the word from me."
Bjartmar says that the man on the electric shuttle immediately invited him to show him the receipt for the bike and himself called the police.
"Yes, cool," said Bjartmar," let's just get this straight."
Then the owner of the electric shuttle proved ownership of his electric shuttle and drove off.
Later, the rightful owner of the electric shuttle told her story on Facebook, as reported in a previous story.
In the year that Bjartmar has been doing this, he says he can count the times that he got caught up with people on the fingers of one hand.
"I have had peaceful relations with the hardest people in Reykjavík," said Bjartmar, pointing out that bicycle thieves are by far the smallest brothers and sisters in society, addicts, mentally ill people and other people who for some reason are on the street.
"Addiction is a hard master and somehow the next dose has to be financed, unfortunately theft of such liquidity is an easy path to the goal," says Bjartmar.
"My relations with these people are really so good that I have brought a lot of the good people with me.
There are examples of people being treated and taken care of and then looking to me and helping me with what I'm doing," he says.
In general, Bjartmars communicates with cyclists on a polite basis.
Some people know about him and what he's doing and offer him a peaceful offer to show him receipts, bike number and so on.
Bike theft is a big problem that has not been addressed.
According to Bjartmar, the police are even beginning to point out to people to talk to him about stolen bicycles.
Bjartmar disagrees with DV's previous reporting and says he is not some kind of self-appointed police officer in a personal quest for justice.
When asked if he is still not on thin ice with his actions, and if this is not primarily the role of the police, Bjartmar says that he certainly is.
"Of course the police should do this, but the fact is that the police are simply not doing this.
I have, for example, watched police officers drive away from a large pile of stolen bikes.
She is absolutely powerless in this matter."
"When the police are not doing anything about this, and it's just in front of your nose, and experience has shown that I can succeed in this area, then why not?" asks Bjartmar.
He says he has made so much progress in tracking down stolen bikes that sometimes he bumps into his "clients" on the street that they have just the brightest bikes they had ever gotten.
The time that Bjartmar has called for police assistance has come for her to simply not show up.
"It's just not working with the police, and it's not my fault and it's not the owners of the bikes," Bjartmar said," and it's sorry that the victims of bike thefts have to feel the emptiness of the police in this area.
The success of Bjartmars is not disputed.
There are many stories of people thanking Bjartmari for getting their belongings back to them.
Bjartmar himself says that he has lost his number on the number of bicycles he has delivered, but the amount probably runs on millions, if not millions.
Electric scooters, electric bikes and electric scooters weigh heavily, but an electric bike can cost up to half a million.
Bjartmar works in kindergarten every day and every other weekend he works in a community.
His bike search is therefore unpaid work that he does in his spare time.
Pension funds and long shadows
2019 was a great anniversary year in the history of pension funds in Iceland.
Officials had reportedly received pensions from the Danish king all the way since the 19th century, but in 1919 a pension fund of officials was established, which eventually became the pension fund of all civil servants.
The basis for the current employee pension funds was then laid down by a comprehensive collective bargaining agreement in 1969, which provided for occupational pension funds with compulsory membership and full fund collection from the beginning of 1970.
In 1974, laws were enacted on the basis of these agreements, and the pension system continued to expand thereafter.
The workers' pension system was not the only radical change that the 20th century labor movement brought about with its wage struggles.
Unemployment insurance had been similar in the history of the strike in 1955, and the organization gradually implemented its requirements for sickness and sickness funds, significant leave rights, reduced working hours, improvements in housing and more as a matter of urgency.
All these rights were a great and difficult struggle but, in retrospect, proved to be a much greater and more lasting benefit than the increase in the pay gap, which disappeared as hard as the inflation that characterised the period after the war and until 1990, as many remember.
The process of establishing a general pension fund in 1969 was long and complicated.
While people eventually agreed that the funds would be the property of fund members, the union movement had to agree that their boards should be composed of representatives of employers and fund members equally.
In the years following the foundation of the funds, the requirement for a majority of workers on the board of the funds was often discussed in the employees' association, but it never materialised, so we are still stuck with the abnormal arrangement that members of the fund members are not a majority on the board of the funds.
Article 36 of Act No. 129 / 1997 on compulsory insurance of pension rights and operations of pension funds deals with the investment policy of the funds.
Point 1 states that "a pension fund should be guided by the interests of members."
Section 5 also says: "The Pension Fund shall establish ethical criteria in investments."
The general policy of the Pension Fund of Traders includes the following provisions, following the above legal provisions:
The Pension Fund is a member of the UN PRI on Responsible Investment, along with many of the largest pension funds and institutional investors in the West and Europe.
The rules address how focus on environmental and social issues as well as good corporate governance can contribute to improving the investment performance of portfolios.
This brings together the interests of investors and the goals of society in a wider context.
LV believes it's important for companies, particularly those listed on the stock market, to have a public policy on: to maintain good governance of employee benefits, social responsibility and the environment.
The Pension Fund Valdi, which has the largest funds in the country, has established a "policy on responsible investment" and there are provisions of a similar nature.
This is all recalled here as an introduction to the latest Icelandic fashion word," shadow management."
As the word is used in the case, it is not expected to have been fully defined, but it seems to me that the following definition is now "most accepted": Shadow Management is when a union leader says in the media that he intends to send members of the union to the Board of Pension Funds a recommendation or an instruction on how to take a position in a particular case.
If they do not follow the recommendation, they will be removed from the Board at the earliest opportunity.
If the leader does not take this to the media and does not talk about resignation, however, it is not "shadow management" as the kind of interaction between people is of course always in the financial world as elsewhere.
I leave the reader to ponder which way he feels "shadowy."
There are in particular two people who have tried to formulate this definition when writing this, on the morning of Saturday 25 July 2020.
They are journalist Hörður Ægisson of Fréttablaðið and Governor Ásgeir Jónsson.
The proposal was made after Icelandair CEO Bogi Nils Bogason had stated his intention to terminate the company's contracts with flight attendants and flight attendants (terminate them), and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairman of the Reykjavík Chamber of Commerce, then issued a recommendation to members of the company on the Board of the Pension Fund of Traders not to support the fund's potential acquisition of shares in the company, otherwise they could be dismissed.
Some time later, Bogi Nils withdrew his decision, and then Ragnar Þór went the same way with his recommendation, which was of course based on Bogi's decision.
Nevertheless, Hörður and Ásgeir saw reason to talk about the case in the Friday newspaper Fréttablaðið with big words about shadow management, law violations and the rich need for changes to the law.
A small thump was indeed supposed to roll a heavy load, although the blessed thump had been in an interconnectedness and was also rapidly erased.
As the issue is important, let's consider the topic itself at the end.
I referred to above the points in the Pension Fund Act pertaining to this matter.
This means that fund managers should protect the interests of fund members and have ethical criteria in investments, and these issues are further elaborated in the statutes of both Gildi and the Pension Fund of Traders as I mentioned.
However, pension funds should NOT look only at short-term profit margins in their investments.
This would be a highly dangerous policy and you don't have to look long for examples of this in the past, where large loans from banks and funds have flowed to immoral adventurers and environmental wasters, with disastrous consequences.
The CEO of Icelandair was obviously on slippery ice when he thought of wiping out a whole group of employees, thereby drastically reducing the benefits the company has enjoyed in the Icelandic market and weakening its position towards investors.
Fortunately, he saw that and pulled it back.
Time shows whether it is sufficient for pension fund investment in the company to be held accountable to members at the time.

One of the infected did not take home care
One of the three people diagnosed with Covid-19 in the country yesterday came to the country from the Baltic Sea on 15 July, about a week and a half ago.
He is an Icelander who does not live here permanently and therefore did not receive clear instructions to use the so-called "return check" after arriving in Iceland and undergo another sampling a few days after arriving.
He got negative from a screening at the border.
"But he is in Icelandic society and really should go to that resort," says Kamilla Jósepsdóttir, expert at the Directorate of Health's Disease Prevention Department and deputy of the Disease Prevention Department during his summer vacation, in a conversation with Fréttablaðið today.
"He used the English registration form and there is no obligation to register the ID number and if the ID number is not registered you are not automatically invited to the second sample."
She says that the man was able to use the English registration form because he actually lives abroad, but because of his network in the country as an Icelander, he should have used it in Icelandic.
He did not realize this, however.
"When the ID number is not registered, you have to apply yourself for the second sampling.
Neither he nor his employer seem to have realised that it was the right way," says Kamilla.
"So it's clear that we need to strengthen the information on this while we find some way to automate the reporting system even though Icelanders do not register their ID number.
Or to make it somehow more obvious who are the participants in Icelandic society in the registration system," she explains.
Fortunately, however, the person in question did not enter the country, although he is identified as a participant in Icelandic society, being an Icelander.
Only six have been sent to quarantine since he was diagnosed yesterday, and these six were all in contact with him.
They are due to be tested, but two of them are beginning to show symptoms of Covid-19 infection.
The man received a negative from his sampling at the border on 15 July.
Kamilla says it's likely that he was so recently infected with the virus that it could not yet be detected in him when the sample was taken at the border.
However, she does not want to rule out that the man was infected here in Iceland but did not carry the virus with him to the country.
"It's not entirely possible to claim that this is indeed an imported infection because it's been so long since he came to the country that he may have been exposed here like these two that have caused a little shortening in relation to the sporting year."
However, she says that is very unlikely because of the few people around here.
"It's really very unlikely," says Kamilla, but notes that it cannot be ruled out until the Icelandic genetic analysis has sequenced the virus in man.
"If we get a virus that hasn't been seen here before, it's almost safe that he brought it to the country."
Pepper spray and bombs deployed against protesters
There was a confrontation between police and protesters in Seattle last night.
Police used pepper spray and non-lethal grenades, but protesters broke windows and set fire to them.
45 protesters were arrested and 21 police officers were injured.
Police brutality and racism were protested across the United States last night, while the protests in Seattle were in support of protesters in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one protester was fatally shot.
According to the BBC, the assailant has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands gathered in peaceful protests.
A group of people then set fire to a construction site and broke windows in the city's courthouse.
Subsequently, the police said the protest was a riot and there was a struggle between groups of protesters and the police.
In Aurora, Colorado, Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old black man who was murdered by police in August last year, was remembered by protesters.
A car drove through a group of protesters in the city, but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of members of the Black National Guard gathered to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was murdered by police in her home last March.
The group carried firearms and marched to a closed intersection where police separated the group from a group of people who protested against the protests and also carried firearms.
There were 75 arrests in Omaha, Nebraska, where protesters remembered James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man who was murdered by a white bartender in May.
Solskjaer: Not the game that defines our season
Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer does not want to make too much of the importance of the game with Leicester today in the final round of the Premier League.
If United lose the game, and Chelsea do not lose against Wolves, Solskjaer and his men end up in 5th place, thereby losing the Champions League place.
However, they still have hope of qualifying for the Champions League by winning the Europa League next month.
"We are not at the end.
If we score against Leicester, I think people will say that we have not had a bad season," said Solskjaer.
"But whatever happens, this is not the end of our journey because we still have quite a bit of land to get the two teams above us," Solskjaer said.
It is clear that people's nerves will be stretched at 15 today, but Solskjaer tried to pretend that it was a different game.
"If you want to belong to Manchester United, you have to get used to being under pressure in the last game of the season.
This is nothing new, and on this the club builds.
We have created a great opportunity to end the season well and now it's ours to take advantage of it," said Solskjaer.
"This is not the most important game of the season, it's just the next game.
You can ask anyone in football, the next game is always the most important.
The results do not define our season, we have already had many moments to define this season."
"Bruno Fernandes's arrival changed a lot for us and I believe that overall we are in better shape and much stronger mentally than last season," Solskjaer said.
65,000 infections per day
65,490 new coronavirus infections were diagnosed in the United States yesterday, according to John Hopkins University.
A total of 4,178,021 infections have been confirmed in the West since the start of the epidemic in this country.
There were 900 deaths from the virus yesterday, with more than 1,000 deaths in the last four days so far.
A total of 146,460 deaths due to the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
According to CNN's report, the number of deaths due to the virus will reach 175,000 on August 15.
Fear of the second wave of the epidemic
Spain's government is now trying to restrain the increased spread of COVID-19 in the country.
Spanish health authorities reported over 920 new cases of COVID-19, both Thursday and Friday.
No more people have been diagnosed in a day since early May, and the news comes as Spain begins to lift one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe.
The backlog led to British authorities now requiring passengers arriving from Spain to be quarantined upon arrival.
A week earlier, Spain was on Britain's list of safe countries.
The situation is worst in Catalonia in northeastern Spain, where the government has taken more extensive restrictions to try to stem the growth.
In the capital Barcelona, entertainment venues will be closed for the next two weeks and salons will be allowed to close at midnight.
A curfew is now in effect for 200 thousand people in Segria County in western Catalonia.
It is believed that Britain's decision will have a negative effect on the Spanish economy, which relies heavily on the arrival of foreign tourists and is badly affected by the epidemic.
Tui, the UK's largest travel agency, cancelled all flights planned today to Spain and the Canary Islands.
Governments around the world are said to be preparing for the second wave of the epidemic, but there seems to be little interest in reintroducing a large curfew that has devastated the economy in many places.
For example, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has taken great care of this, likening it to a nuclear weapon he does not want to use.
France's Prime Minister Jean Castex has said that the nation "would not survive, economically or socially," if a nationwide curfew was reimposed.
Many governors hope that local resources that reach residents of individual towns, cities or regions will be sufficient to restrain the virus in the next round if it occurs.
Five new infections in Iceland - Three domestic
Three domestic infections were diagnosed yesterday, plus two more at the border.
Five people with positive Covid-19 were diagnosed yesterday in Iceland.
The civil protection notice says that one of the infections is related to the infection reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football tournament.
He has been sent to solitary confinement and sixteen who were in close contact with him in quarantine.
The infected person was involved in the social work of the sports club in Reykjavík and according to the report," only part of the sports team" is in quarantine.
Others sent to quarantine have a different connection with the man.
The origin of this infection is unknown and the infection is in full swing with the National Commissioner's infectious disease team.
The holders of the ReyCUP tournament have complied with the remaining guidelines and rules of quarantine and civil protection and appropriate measures have been taken.
However, pictures of the tournament yesterday drew attention as they could be seen in very close communion celebrating the good progress of their team in the field.
Just before 11 pm today, the organisers posted the following notice on their Facebook page.
It says "NOTE: Parents please respect the rules that competitors attend their own stuff at school.
Parents are NOT allowed to do so.
Thanks for your understanding."
Another infection was diagnosed yesterday, which is related to the infection reported the previous day.
The report states: "An Icelandic genetic analysis has sequenced the infection and found a new type of virus that has not been diagnosed here before."
The infected person is in isolation and 12 in quarantine because of the infection.
The third infection in question is from a man who arrived in Iceland 11 days ago, 15 July.
It was detected in the southwest corner of the country.
He is now in solitary confinement and six people who were in close contact with him in quarantine.
Two of them are already exhibiting symptoms of viral infection.
In addition, two were diagnosed at the border, pending the outcome of further investigations as provided for in the cross-border infection curve.
Finally, the report states: The National Commissioner's Civil Protection Department and the National Commissioner's Office urge people to exercise caution and pay attention to individual infectious diseases.
If there is any doubt as to whether the symptoms of the Covid-19 virus are present, the same person is asked to have a biopsy at the nearest clinic.
Patreksfjörður says the camp site is booked for the weekend of shopping - Direct visitors elsewhere
The camp site in Patreksfjörður is fully booked for the weekend, according to the report by Vesturbyggð.
Guests are advised to look at other accommodation options.
Named Vesturbyggð Bíldudalur, Tálknafjörður, Melanes in Rauðasandur, Hótel Flokalundur and Hótel Breiðavík as other options.
It's enough to be in Patreksfjörður this weekend, because, like previous years, Skjaldborg, a festival of Icelandic documentaries, will be held in the town.
It has been held since 2007 and has become a strong tradition in the town.
Judging from the attack on the camp site, you can expect a good attendance this year, if the weather does not put a dash in your account, but DV said earlier today about a bad forecast.
However, the worst weather in the south is expected, and hope for Patreksfjörður.
The website bb.is first reported, saying that all other accommodation in the town was already fully booked.
Whole apartment building goes down to the best place in the city
Romanian workers live for free at Dunhaga 18-20.
Meanwhile, owners are seeking a building permit for improvement, but their business has been successful in the system for the third year.
In one of the oldest, healthiest and most expensive neighbourhoods in the city of Reykjavík stands a beautiful apartment building on three floors.
On the ground floor of the building is about 600 square meters of commercial space.
Behind the house are the doors of two stairways, each containing four fairly impressive apartments.
They range from 93-130 square meters, although most are over 100.
The building has a considerable history.
It was built in 1959 and has hosted video rental, the school shop, milk shop, Jóa Gunnarsmiðið, fish sales and most recently Háskólaprent.
The house has, to put it mildly, remembered its beautiful fool.
The building is now undergoing extensive damage, as can be seen in the accompanying pictures.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
The owners of D18 ehf. are according to the corporate register among others Magnús Magnússon and Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir.
Magnús headed the ownership group of Borgar and served as chairman of the holding company Borgar.
One of the owners of the holding company Borgar is Stálsskip ehf.
Stálsskip ehf. is the investment company of Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir and her children.
Guðrún also owns a third share in D18 ehf.
Guðrún and her husband, Ágúst Guðmundur Sigurðsson, once operated the fishing vessel Stálsskip.
D18 ehf. bought the house in the summer of 2009, so little has been maintained since then.
Neighbors say the condition of the house has deteriorated steadily since, although most in recent years.
On the website of a local resident, one resident says that the house has "not been particularly lively in recent years."
It may play into the fact that the owners have for several years sought to change the house and the plot.
Other neighbors say the house for a long time has not been OK.
"It's long overdue to do something decent about this place and sad that it has dragged on like this."
He also says that he is annoyed at the owners of the house for failing to finish this, finding some common ground with the neighbors of the house and stopping this "lawyer app."
"Just do this in consultation with the surrounding community so you can hurry up and finish it."
The "legal app" to which the resident refers is the organisational process of the field that has been going on at least since 2017.
The owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 sought permission to build a floor on top of the existing apartment building and behind the building, a new elevator and extension on one floor as well as a basement.
The construction permit granted for that project was appealed to the Board of Appeals for the Environment and Natural Resources and the Board of Appeals cancelled it because the project was not supported by a municipal plan and the local presentation was not satisfactory.
The city of Reykjavík began with the municipal planning work and ended it with a notice in the Official Journal in July last year.
That plan was also reviewed and the committee repealed it in March 2020.
At this point, nearly three years had passed since the initial application for a building permit and the owners of the building started.
At this time, the house had dwindled considerably and neighbors began to tire.
When DV asked the neighbors of the house about the situation and the neighbors' reaction, the answers were in various ways.
Some understood the intentions of the owners of the house, others did not at all.
Others focused their anger on the city, others did not.
Others were just angry, but not necessarily at anyone.
Still others said the parking lot was a hassle, but neighbors have used unused parking Dunhaga 18-20 under their vehicles.
One of the complainants in the case said he was very tired of the administration:
"That we should have to go through the process in three ways is absolutely amazing.
It's like the city of Reykjavík didn't know how to read."
Today, the house is empty, abandoned and neglected.
A memorial to the plankton administration of the city and the noble intentions of the owner and the years of their work that are now in the beginning.
When a journalist came to a park on Dunhaga 18, he was faced with a wide open door and a pile of rubbish.
A Playstation computer and a recent television lay among other debris on Earth - victims of the Icelandic summer wet.
The old office of the University of Iceland was open and there were quite a lot of cats to judge.
It is clear that someone has lodged in one corner, but no one can see.
Stacks of sofas and beds and a few pallets of geological papers, which were probably to become a book, were added.
The staircases of the apartment building were also open and life in both of them.
A journalist was lucky enough to come across the residents of one of them.
There, Romanians cooked a potato dish for dinner and invited a journalist in.
The Romanians work for Ztrongforce ehf.
They have been there for some time, and DV sources say that the company has paid nothing for the house except heating and electricity.
Due to the condition of the house, it is not feasible to collect rent.
Judging from the post in the lobby of the building, it is clear that there have been a lot of foreign workers there in the last few years.
The operation of temporary agency has not been a part of the Covid-19 situation, as the decline in tourism has led to a decline in the construction sector and these two industries have been the most efficient at using temporary agency services.
Nevertheless, the household members at Dunhaga 18 seemed to have enough to do and hung the work suits and mittens in the joint to dry after a long day of work in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the poor condition of the house, the apartment that the boys shared seemed to be well maintained.
When a reporter called the boys Romanian, the irony suddenly became clear: In the best place in Reykjavík, 1,500 square meters of real estate is demolished.
The owners want to change the house for improvement and the neighbors want an improved condition but dispute the definition of "improved."
In between, the city's planning area sits on a starting point, a victim of endless appeals and appeals in the planning process and the ongoing resolution of the Board of Appeals for the Environment and Natural Resources.
In the house are Romanian workers, perhaps just those who are going to improve the situation, when the Icelanders stop fighting.
The article originally appeared in the weekend newspaper DV on 17 July.
In the fight against overweight following the coronavirus epidemic
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will donate £10 million to a campaign against overweight, which will include a ban on fast food advertising, following his severe illness, partly due to his weight.
Johnson is scheduled to present the Better Health campaign tomorrow, Monday, but the campaign will encourage doctors to prescribe cycling for their overweight clients, as well as efforts to increase the number of cycling paths.
The advertising of fast food places on television will be banned before 9 pm, according to UK media sources.
"COVID-19 has awakened us to the short and long-term risks of being overweight, and the prime minister is determined that we must use time to become healthier, more active and eat healthier foods," a government spokesman is quoted.
Johnson himself has had weight problems, but he was admitted to intensive care when he was infected with the coronavirus last spring, partly because of his weight that he is believed to have been so severely ill.
Women better suited to lead the changes
She said the new constitution was the biggest step that the nation can take towards greater decentralization, transparency and combating corruption and the interests of the whole.
"We need to start changing gears a little bit now and who is better suited to lead such changes than the group of society that is easier to be in these values.
There are women," said Helga.
"Women in Iceland are famous for their women's solidarity.
To stick together and be together in leading change.
So now it's just our turn to lead these changes."
She said she was a little alarmed by the focus on Iceland as the "best in the world" in both gender equality and human rights.
"Then we are not as willing to look at what has to be done.
As Germans are very aware of their history and look at everything that has to be done.
There are lots.
We have to know where we are coming from and know the history and listen.
Listen to the voices of marginalized groups.
We don't have the same rules all here," said Helga.
When asked, she said that women are in many respects in good cases in Iceland, but added that as in many other places, Icelanders have incredibly masculine values.
She said that politics was about their own interests, dominance and power, which were the forces that upheld inequality in all societies.
"Women have now formed this group and come together and are just getting a little irritated that Parliament is going to overlook this 2012 referendum," she said.
"It's these feminine values that we're thinking about.
From human rights and the protection of nature, cooperation and that we all really sit at the same table," she said, adding that the above values were the core values of the new constitution.
"We are a very rich country of nature-rich people and it is absurd that there are people living in poverty here.
It's ridiculous, we can switch differently," said Helga.
"It is absurd that there is any natural law that women's jobs are always lower paid.
It is absurd that flight attendants and nurses have to endure endless wage struggles just to get decent wages."
The petition for a new constitution can be signed here via electronic Iceland.
Tried to kidnap a pedestrian in the town centre
A man was arrested in the town centre last night after he threatened pedestrians and tried to get money from him.
The police also stopped the production of drugs in Árbær, where two people were arrested in connection with the case.
The police stopped the driver of a motorcycle in Hlíðar, where its driver was at 146 km / h with a maximum speed of 60 km / h.
In addition, he had previously been deprived of his driving licence.
The police in the capital area had enough to turn around last night and more than 80 cases were recorded in the police diary from five yesterday to five this morning.
There was also a lot of noise reporting due to compatibility.
On the night of Saturday, reports of eleven noisy parties were received and it was widely reported in the police diary.
Last night, however, 22 noise issues were reported on the police board.
Six were detained in a holding cell last night.
In Árbær, police were called in last night when parties fired fireworks at the air.
However, they had fled when police officers came to the park.
Nine drivers were stopped for drunk or drug driving.
Four people were arrested in the town centre last night, one of whom was detained in a holding cell.
Two people were taken to the emergency room after they fell on their faces, one in the town centre and the other in the town centre.
One was taken to an emergency room after he was injured while jumping on a trampoline in Kópavogur.
In addition, police officers stopped a driver who pulled a caravan in Kjalarnes yesterday.
The trailer's trailer was, according to the police diary, in a "very poor condition" and was detained.
You can stay at Monet's house on the shopping weekend
The house, which Claude Monet spent the last forty years of his life in, is now for rent on Airbnb.
The next available nights in the house are on the shopping weekend.
The house is small and adorable, located in the town of Givenry in Normandie, France.
The famous painter lived in the house from 1883 until his death in 1926.
The house has three bedrooms, two lounges and three bathrooms.
Monet was first inspired to paint his famous gardens in this house.
If someone intends to rent the house, they must rent at least two nights.
Based on Airbnb's site, it is next available in a week, on Sunday of the shopping weekend, so it might be ideal for some shoppers on vacation to hurry to book the painter's house.
The two nights over the weekend of trading cost only US $964 or just over ISK 130 thousand as Fréttablaðið comes closest.
Dozens in quarantine and some of them beginning to show symptoms of the disease caused by the coronavirus
Five people have been diagnosed with the domestic coronavirus in the last three days, with most of the infected unrelated.
Dozens are in quarantine because of this, and some of them are beginning to show symptoms of the disease caused by the virus.
Three were diagnosed with the domestic coronavirus yesterday and two at border screening.
An expert at the National Institutes of Health says that the increasing number of domestic infections does not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading beyond the community.
"It has been sequenced from the previous domestic infection and it is a virus that has not been seen here before so we have no particular reason to think it has been hidden in society for some time.
This is probably something that has just arrived in Iceland, but of course we need to be very vigilant right now," said Kamilla Sigríður Jósefsdóttir, expert in the field of quarantine of the Directorate of Health.
Most of those infected have been in connection with persons who came from abroad.
Further sampling will take place in the near future, but several people who were in contact with the infected have begun to show symptoms of the coronavirus.
"Now there is no influenza and less of other respiratory infections so we can be somewhat liberal with doing these tests on people who during the influenza season would have found a reason to do something else first," Kamilla said.
Infection is mostly complete, but it is not impossible for more people to be quarantined.
Two of the infected were diagnosed after attending a sports event.
It has raised questions whether it is feasible to hold such events.
The Civil Protection Commissioner says it's possible as long as people follow criteria and rules.
Kamilla says it's almost impossible for the infected to have been infected at the sporting events.
"If there are no more people in isolation from these individuals after having been around them at these sporting events, we can claim that our quarantine in the tournaments has worked.
But it is not revealed," Kamilla said.
The Civil Protection Department's procedures are under constant review.
"We need to be ready to intervene with further advice or restrictions if that seems warranted," Kamilla said.
In more than a week, the number of restrictions will be extended to a thousand people.
This new position could affect relaxations.
"A certain meditation to cook" - See Elisa Wood's menu
Elisa Viðarsdóttir is a professional footballer and plays with Val.
She is also a master of nutrition, a mother, and works as a food scientist.
She needs a lot of energy for most of the day and usually gives herself time to cook good and nutritious food.
My usual day starts at eight," says Elisha.
"After work, I go to the store to be able to prepare dinner before I pick up my girl at the nursery around three o'clock."
Elisa feels very nourishing to pick up her daughter early in the nursery.
"It's good to have time with her before I go to practice the second part.
After exercise, it's good to come home and just have to warm up the food.
At night, when the girl is asleep, we like to watch one episode to drain the mind."
Elisa does not follow any particular diet.
She is finishing her master's thesis in nutrition and therefore knows well what's right for her to eat to have enough energy to do work, school, family and exercise.
"What suits me is to eat a variety of foods that are well composed of proteins, carbohydrates and fats.
However, I think it's important to have a healthy relationship with food and not classify food as bad or good, rather nutritious or poor.
You see, it's OK to eat everything, just not all at once and not always."
Elisa is very interested in cooking.
"I find a certain meditation in standing in the kitchen cooking and take a lot of it into it.
I have to say that my confidence is with me in the kitchen and I sincerely believe that I'm a decent cook."
Breakfast: Oats, chia seeds, hemp seeds, salt, a little lemon juice, leave in almond milk overnight.
Then top this meal with what's available.
Most often it's banana and crispy muesli & COFFEE.
I'm a great coffee lady.
Intermediate: Incredibly different, but fruit or vegetables, cakes, pure skyr with bananas and muesli, bread with toppings and then I could eat hummus with a spoon out of a box if that's the case.
Lunch: I often make all kinds of delicious salads from what's in the fridge, quinoa or barley, falafel buns, rucola, oven-baked vegetables with good dressing is a little bit what I'm working with.
If the plan goes completely out of hand (which often happens), the egg machine at work has come to my rescue quite often and it's 2 slices of bread with butter, cheese and boiled egg, put no more on you.
Intermediate: Get some carbohydrate for exercise, bread with toppings, cereal or fruit.
Dinner: Fish are very often chosen in my home, otherwise some delicious vegetarian dishes.
Conflict between police and protesters in Seattle
Seattle, Washington, has declared a state of rebellion following large protests in the city center.
Police yesterday resorted to flash bangs and pepper spray to try to clear a large area occupied by protesters and stretched across many blocks in the vicinity of the city's parliament building.
The police announced on Twitter that at least eleven protesters had been arrested and an investigation was ongoing into a vandalism carried out at a police station in the city yesterday, possibly with some kind of bomb.
City and police authorities say protesters stabbed police with stones, bottles, detonators and other loose items, and one police officer was taken to a hospital where he was injured.
However, the Seattle protests were peaceful for a long time.
They were invited to demonstrate solidarity with protesters in Portland, Oregon, where there have been repeated violent confrontations between protesters and heavily armed federal agents.
There, as in other American cities, people gather under the banner of Black Lives Matter, recalling Georges Floyd, who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis on May 25, protesting systemic racism in American society and demanding redress.
Not cancelled until after the vote
It is not yet clear whether the cancellations of Icelandair's flight attendants, which are due to take effect next month, will be cancelled.
The electronic voting on the Icelandic Cabin Crew Association's collective bargaining agreement on behalf of flight attendants at Icelandair ends at noon tomorrow.
The company's chairman Guðlaug Líley Jóhannsdóttir says he is confident that Icelandair will not make a decision on the layoffs until the outcome of the vote is known.
"This definitely hangs together," says Guðlaug Líley.
"There have been no cancellations, this has to be done so that the engines can be manned.
Then, of course, people are anxious to know if they will have a job after the end of the month."
The agreement was signed a week ago, on the night of 19 July.
It is expected to be valid until the end of September 2025 and is based on an agreement previously rejected by flight attendants.
On 17 July, the Board of Directors and the Council of Representatives of Flugfreyjufélag Íslands agreed to call a full-time work stoppage at Icelandair, the members agreed to do so in a vote.
It never came to her, but this was decided following Icelandair's decision to cancel negotiations with the Cabin Crew Association, terminate all its flight attendants and seek a deal with another union.
The company's pilots were to take on the duties of security personnel on board temporarily.
When asked how she believes the vote will go, Guðlaug Líley says it's hard to say.
"People are devastated by this attack by Icelandair, when all the airline hostesses of the company were laid off and informed that a deal would be made with another union.
Now it turns out whether it has an effect," she says.
940 flight attendants worked at Icelandair in late April, when 900 of them, about 95%, were laid off.
Their period of notice is variable, for those with the shortest working life it is three months and ends at the end of July-August.
That group includes about 90% of Icelandair's flight attendants.
What will take place if the contract is not approved?
"Then we request continued dialogue with our negotiators.
With this agreement, we are meeting Icelandair's requirements.
If rejected, it is clear that the flight attendants have gone too far."
Voting on collective bargaining ends and Icelandair launches second quarter results tomorrow
The flight attendant's vote on a new collective bargaining agreement ends at 12 noon tomorrow.
Icelandair's second quarter results will also be published tomorrow, but preliminary results indicate that the company's revenue has decreased by 85 per cent from the same period last year.
The electronic voting on the collective bargaining agreement between the Icelandic Cabin Crew Association and the Icelandic Confederation of Icelandic Employers began on Wednesday, 22 July, and ends tomorrow, Monday 27 July, at 12 noon.
Those who are eligible to vote on the agreement are Icelandair employees who pay membership fees to the Cabin Crew Association.
Icelandair and FFÍ signed a new collective bargaining agreement on the night of Sunday 19 July, but the previous Friday Icelandair had terminated negotiations with the company after the flight attendants voted on the previous agreement in a vote in early July.
By then, Icelandair had cancelled all flight attendants and flight crew on Friday, but they were withdrawn after a new collective bargaining agreement was signed.
According to a new collective bargaining agreement, flight attendants have to fly five hours more a month for the same basic salary.
The core agreement is valid until 2025, which has integrated the provisions of pilots and flight attendants on how long one shift can be flown.
The agreement was presented to FFI members at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica Hotel last Monday, and many flight attendants spoke to them about dissatisfaction with the agreement.
However, most seemed to agree that the deal had to be agreed to keep the FFI alive.
Icelandair's second quarter results will be presented tomorrow. EBIT, its operating results for capital and taxes, is negative according to preliminary operating results of US $100 to 110 million or ISK 15 billion.
Icelandair sent preliminary calculations to OMX ICE last Wednesday, which said that the company's revenue amounted to about $60 million in the quarter, or about ISK 8.3 billion.
Cash and cash equivalents were around US $154 million at the end of the quarter, around ISK 21 billion.
Icelandair also plans to auction the company's shares in August.
Icelandair plans to finalize agreements with fifteen creditors, the government and Boeing aircraft manufacturer by the end of the month before the stock offering.
A new variant rather than a new type of virus
"A new virus just means that this has been an individual who came from overseas.
This is not something that has been brewing in Iceland," says Már Kristjánsson, head physician at the infectious diseases department of Landspítali Hospital, about the news that a" new type of virus "has been diagnosed in Iceland.
Three domestic infections were diagnosed yesterday and two at the border.
One who was diagnosed had been involved in the social work of a sports club in the football club Rey Cup, but the origin of the infection is unknown and the infection is ongoing.
An infection was also detected in a person who entered the country on 15 July and two people who were in contact with him started exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19.
An infection related to an infection reported the previous day was diagnosed yesterday and a sequence analysis by the Icelandic genetic analysis revealed "a new type of virus that has not been diagnosed here before."
Infection is complete in connection with that infection.
Már notes that it is not a new virus, but it is the same virus that has spread around the world, namely the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
It's better to talk about a new variant of that virus than about a new type of virus.
When asked what it means and if it could say anything about the second wave of the epidemic, Már says that there is currently a single case and it could go so that nothing more will happen.
"However, if there are domestic cases that do not have connections from abroad and have the same genotype as this particular variant, that conclusion could be drawn [about the second wave], but it is premature at this time," explains Már.
Happiness in the hot tub
Is the secret to Icelandic happiness hidden in the hot tubs?
The BBC's programme makers lead to this in a wonderful video that highlights the country's swimming pool and hot tub culture.
The Icelandic bathing culture is unique worldwide and it is claimed that there are no equal number of bathing places in the world per capita.
The natural geothermal energy is the foundation of it, but also the tradition of swimming that exists here.
Children's swimming lessons were mandatory in 1940, but senior citizens are no less able to use the hot water for health benefits.
Swimming is described as a fixed part of the general welfare of the country.
In the pot, everyone is equal, regardless of caste and position.
Free of mobile phones, people talk on personal terms about worlds and space or enjoy the palliative power of water: meditate and recharge the batteries of soul and body.
On the brink of attending a hundred days of elections
There are hundreds of days until Americans go to elections and choose a president for four years.
Donald Trump is seeking re-election, but he is still in trouble.
Joe Biden, the Democratic candidate, has a huge advantage over Trump nationally, considering polls.
According to a new poll by AP News, a record number of Americans believe that the nation is on the wrong path.
Trump's response to the pandemic of the new coronavirus is also very unpopular, and more Americans than before believe that the president has had a bad economic policy.
More specifically, only two out of ten Americans say that the United States is on the right track.
32 percent say they support Trump's response to the epidemic and 48 percent say he has kept a good economic record.
In March it was 56 per cent and in January it was 67 per cent.
According to the FiveThirtyEight average, Biden's lead is 49.9 percent nationally while Trump's lead is 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has tried to shift attention from his performance towards the epidemic to Biden, promoting so-called cultural strife and promulgating policies aimed at law and order.
However, Biden's candidacy makes a great effort to keep attention on Trump and consider it a high probability of winning if the election is really about how Trump has done his job in the last four years.
Trump's unpopularity also seems to bring down the Republican Party's members, fearing that Democrats might even gain a majority in the United States Senate, which so far has been very slow.
Politico reported recently that if the party and candidate were to remain in the same position as it is now, the Republican Party would have its greatest success in decades.
The suburbs have been particularly bad for the party in the 2016 general election and it is now clear that this trend will continue.
In recent days, Trump has tried to intimidate suburban residents to follow him, including by saying that if Biden becomes president, he will destroy the suburban United States and push racial divides.
Among other things, Trump has abrogated a regulation from Barack Obama's time in the White House aimed at diversifying the suburbs.
He then urged the "housewives" of the suburbs of the United States to read an article by the former New York governor, in which she claimed that Biden would destroy the suburbs of the United States and endorsed Trump.
"Biden will destroy your neighborhoods and the American dream.
I will preserve it, and make it even better! "said the president.
The population of the suburban United States is an increasing number of voters.
According to NPR, they represent about half of all voters in the United States.
Ever since George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the candidate who has received the majority of the votes of this group has become president.
Except in 2012 when Mitt Romney received the majority of votes from this group but lost to Barack Obama.
Polls have shown that despite Trump securing a narrow majority in the suburbs in 2016, his following there has been significantly reduced.
While there are differences between the surveys, Biden has measured a 15 percent point advantage over Trump in the outside polls recently.
Regis Philbin is dead
American television presenter Regis Philbin is dead at the age of 88.
Philbin worked as an actor, show host, presenter and singer for about six decades.
He is best known for directing the popular talk show Live! with Regis from 1988 to 2011 along with Kathie Lee Gifford and later Kelly Ripa.
He has directed shows such as Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and America's Got Talent.
According to Guinness World Records, Philbin is the person who has been on American television for most hours and has been recognized.
He won six Emmy Awards in his career and was nominated 37 times in total.
According to a statement from his family, Philbin died of natural causes.
A number of colleagues, friends and fans have mentioned him on social media in the last 24 hours.
Will the Olympic flame be the light at the end of the tunnel?
After making a final decision to postpone the Olympic Games, an event that only world wars have fought so far, the president of the International Olympic Committee said the famous Olympic flame would be "the light at the end of the tunnel," referring to the coronavirus pandemic that the world is now undergoing in unison.
Refugees have another year to prepare and the Japanese authorities are compensating for the delay.
All, however, hold headers end up a lot at stake.
When it was announced that Tokyo in Japan would be the venue for this year's Olympic Games, the cheers of the Japanese representatives were genuine.
They wept and laughed alternately, as Tokyo had applied to host the 2016 Games, but this time it was cancelled for Rio in Brazil.
This time Tokyo and Japan should bathe in the attention of the world.
The games were scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August but have been postponed for a year, starting on 23 July 2021 and ending on 8 August.
If the Games are not successful, if the coronavirus becomes too much of a threat, the Games will be canceled.
No one, however, wants to completely think that thought to the end.
Olympic Games are no ordinary sports competition.
Nothing is saved, the show should always be magnificent and strive to top the last play.
The selection of a city for the Olympic Games is based on the selection committee's assessment of the city's presentations.
The more spectacular the presentation - the more chance of getting the nod.
Tokyo spent $150 million trying to host the 2016 Olympic Games, amounting to more than $20 billion.
The second time, when applying for the 2020 Games, $75 million, about $10 billion, was put into the presentation.
In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo would receive this year's Games, the Japanese authorities had already spent $30 billion on the project.
But that amount is just a drop in the ocean compared to what it costs to build Olympic villages, stadiums and generally strengthen the country's infrastructure to handle such a tournament, prepare it and host the games themselves.
Organizers in Japan have said the Tokyo Olympics, which should have been running these days but have been postponed for a year because of the coronavirus, would have cost $12.6 billion.
However, a report from the State Auditor of Japan published at the end of last year stated that the cost was almost double that figure.
It is likely that the cost of postponing the games will not be fully estimated, but it has been estimated to cost between two and six billion dollars in addition to the initial cost.
The total cost for the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could therefore run between $15 and $30 billion.
The figures are so high that all the tax revenues of the Icelandic state would only cover about half of the Olympic Games, at the lowest possible cost.
Olympic Games are events of such magnitude that they have often become a topic of discussion for economists, who try to look at numbers and look at the benefits and benefits of the Games.
As a matter of fact, an awful lot of people seem to have concluded that the effects of the Olympic Games are less than positive for the economy of the cities that hold them.
There are some short-term effects, for example, large numbers of jobs in the short-term, but in the long-term, cities tend to suffer from debt burdens and enormous operating costs of little used infrastructure.
Rio in Brazil is facing significant debt due to the 2016 Games and has been struggling to cost the maintenance of all the big sports facilities built for the Games.
Figures have been looked at after the 2012 London Games, but it has become clear that only 10 per cent of those who received employment related to the city's Olympic Games were unemployed before.
That means that there were no new jobs except to a small extent.
In general, cities have not been particularly successful in hosting the Olympic Games because of the low cost of the infrastructure built for the Games.
However, there is often thought to be an increased traffic of tourists who want to visit the Olympic cities following the Games, although there is considerable uncertainty about the 2021 Games.
It is also uncertain whether all the number of spectators who usually attend the games will be accepted.
However, the main issue is the credit that the cities have to be selected, which is difficult to estimate for money.
Because despite the enormous cost, it can also be said that the joy that the Games bring is not such that it can be put on a price tag.
But although the exhibition is often grand and there is no saving, it is of course not just about money.
It's the sports halls that are in the foreground.
For some achievement people, postponing the games is surprising.
Australian fifth and gold medallist Chloe Esposito, for example, is a boxer and would have been far from a good sport this summer, but is hoping to be in shape for the 2021 Games.
She is therefore among those athletes who are just rather happy with the postponement, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who planned to retire after this year's Games, if they had been held on time, the postponement of the Games in some cases means that they will retire before the Games take place.
Trust their body simply not to go through years of rigorous exercise.
Few athletes came to the hearts of spectators at the Rio Olympics in 2016 as well as gymnast Simone Biles.
She came home with four gold around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has attended several interviews in his native United States recently to discuss the Olympic Games.
She is going to the 2021 Games, but she is not necessarily sure that she will still be at the top of the Games next year, as she will be 24 years old.
Although it is generally not considered a high age, it is higher for a leading gymnast.
"This is a delicate issue," says Biles, but smiles for a second in an interview published on the Olympic Committee's Instagram page asked if she intends to make the same progress in the 2021 Games as she did in Rio 2016.
"I honestly don't know if I'll still be at the top after another year of training," says Biles.
She has previously said that her body cannot withstand the stress of gymnastics training much longer.
Nevertheless, she trains diligently for the 2021 Olympic Games.
Biles admits that it was an unpleasant feeling to have to stop exercising suddenly during the pandemic and the gymnasium was closed.
There were no exemptions for Biles rather than others while all sports facilities were closed for seven weeks.
All her Olympic gymnasts could not buy any access beyond the others, she had to find various ways to stay in shape like others.
The basic form is certainly a little better than most people.
"We have a rigid schedule now.
It was difficult to start practicing first again after the gymnasium opened.
We started slowly, but we are back on track and I will increase the training steadily as the year progresses.
Of course, we don't quite know how these games will be or if they will be held, but we still practice assuming they will be, can't help it.
I've put too much effort into leaving the sport now," says Biles.
With it, like other slumbers, doubt or perhaps rather awareness that the situation may arise that the Games will not be held in 2021 at all.
Predicting it is hopeless, however.
No one can know how the situation of the coronavirus pandemic will be in July 2021 and nothing else to do but prepare for the Olympic Games given that they will be held this year.
Perhaps the Olympic flame will be the light at the end of the Covid tunnel.
Delayed weddings due to epidemic
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding due to the coronavirus.
She was due to marry former Bachelorette contestant Wells Adams this summer.
"I think there are other important things to think about right now," the actress said in a conversation with People.
"We really want to get married sometime and have the dream wedding and have everyone who cares about us.
But we decided to postpone it and focus on what's important right now, which is to help share information on the importance of wearing masks and staying at home.
I look more at the world than at weddings these days.
There are many things going on and we should focus our attention on what's happening in the world."
