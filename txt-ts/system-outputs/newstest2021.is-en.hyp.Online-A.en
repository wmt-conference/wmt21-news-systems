Shouting at the world
The Marketing Campaign Looks Like You Need Ireland is well under way, and shouting and calls in the wild are starting to pull people far and wide around the world.
"You have the collar, I need Iceland," says a woman some outside the big world in comments on an ad from the Marketing Campaign Looks Like You Need Ireland on content provider YouTube.
Another observer says she will preserve Iceland in her heart forever, and a young woman says she must get as soon as possible to Iceland, as her fiancé resides there.
Unfortunately, however, she is in the United States, so she expects to have to wait some more months.
Another spectator asks if the hiking trail to Iceland is capable, because none are the aircraft.
It doesn't follow the story of whether he comes from another time zone.
Egill Þórðarson of the advertising agency Peel, which was involved in the making of the advertisements along with international agency M&amp;C Saatchi, says the target has been hoped again.
"I came to many Inspired By Iceland campaigns that have gone very well, but this new campaign is already starting to beat the record.
Basically, it's about creating PR values, it's getting foreign media to cover the campaign, and it's been incredibly successful.
In a relatively short period of time, we have received coverage in about seven hundred media outlets around the world, covering more than two billion people.
The value of that review is priced at $1.8 billion.
It's not amicable.'
The main market is normally United States, and the campaign has been very successful there, although Americans are not heading to the country anytime soon.
In the case of Egil, well-known market places such as Denmark, United Kingdom and Germany have also been successful, such as Russia, which are comfortably surprising.
There has been a reaction from exotic areas, such as India, which was not specifically proposed.
"These ads have travelled beyond what we expected," said Egill, but it may be that over four million people have watched the content on YouTube.
"We couldn't have requested a better start."
The photographs here at the opening took Árni Sæberg, the photographer for Morgunblaðið, during the filming of advertisements entitled "Let It Out" in the middle of last month.
The filming took place far and wide, such as the Reykjavik School Guard Lane, in Reynisfjördur, at Skógarfoss, on sólheimajökull and in a cave at Hjörleifshöfði.
Directors were Samúel Bjarki Pétursson and Gunnar Páll Ólafsson of Scots Productions and cameraman Fear Gudnason.
Roles in the shooting included the Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, who is from Cuba and Hungary.
Dozens of Icelanders came to the making of the advertisements, but at the same time recordings took place in the South iceland there was another group in the West iceland and the Westfjords.
In the case of Egil, "Let It Out" is only the first part of the Looks Like You Need Ireland campaign, but it is aimed at a winter campaign in collaboration with M&amp;C Saatchi.
"This is just the first phase of this work for The Icelandic Lab," said Egill, adding that the collaboration with M&amp;C Saatchi went fantastically well.
"It's great to work with them.
In these kinds of projects, it's important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the markets we're talking to."
Explosive sand: Discussing the situation in the labour market, pension funds and much more
Ásmundur Einar Daðason, Minister for Social Affairs and Children, attends Sprengisand, starting at 10:00 p.m. on The Wave today.
He is also minister of labour and discusses the situation in the labour market as such, the Icelandair case and other issues.
He also discusses GDP issues and the transfer of jobs out to land that have been unsuccessful and been controversial in recent years and decades.
Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairman of VR, will also attend the show, which will discuss its criticism regarding pension fund investments and proposes ideas for a union and employers to withdraw from the boards of funds to reduce the risk of conflicts of interest.
This will be discussed with Ívar Ingimarsson, tourism operator in East Iceland, and Árnheiði Jóhannsdóttir, managing director of marketing agency North Iceland, about the status of the Countryside Tourism Authority.
They will look ahead to autumn wondering if this summer's success is a misleading premonition of what's to come.
You can listen to the episode below, starting at 10 p.m.
Here's what she looks like today 25 years later
Actress Elisa Donovan had a successful career in teen shows of any kind.
World fame, however, was awarded for her acting as Amber in the film Clueless 25 years ago.
She also starred on the show Sabrina: The Teenage Witch with Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury and in Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49, married with one child.
There's been little worn on her lately, but at least she got to look across the road and comment on Clueless on Australian TV on the day.
She talks nicely about Brittany Murphy, who died unexpectedly in 2009, saying she was a great person.
"I have to admit, I built the character mostly on girls I met in schools that weren't nice to me.
As soon as I read the script, I knew who this character was," Donovan said of his game in Clueless.
Wouldn't leave the police station after a night's stay
About fifty cases arrived at the police desk in the capital area today, telling the police diary that the cases were diverse.
The day at The District Police Station began with police having to interfere with a man who had then been recently released from a prison cell after staying there for drunk driving.
The man did not want to go away after he was released and did not obey police orders that told him to evacuate.
The man earned an ongoing stay at the police station because of his progress.
Then a man was arrested in the morning on suspicion of burglary at a company in Kopavogur.
Police also had to interfere with two men in Broadholt for reports of an assault.
It also came as a woman who was sitting at a dining mall in Kopavogur was unable to pay for the bill after a meal, so it was called to the police.
A stunt on a downtown vehicle was also reported this morning.
The driver of a white Renault van looked after her temporarily and she was then taken freely.
The car has not been found.
The Curse of the Happy Band - The Terrible Fate of the Glee stars
The theory has caught internet flights to a curse resting over the season of the Happy Band, while actress Naya Rivera drowned in California on the day, becoming the show's third lead actor to die far before her age.
Glee is a popular series about singing, dancing and joy.
The show covered the so-called teenagers' joyous country of high school, their love and destiny.
It wasn't always taken out with the bliss to be in the band of joy, but through singing and dancing, the show's characters seemed to manage to overcome whatever circumstances that arose in their lives.
But outside the shooting scene, a major disaster has soared across the show's players and employees, so highly that theories have been raised that curses rest on the show.
Naya Marie Rivera took on the role of Santana Lopez on the show, a cheerleader who didn't call her whole grandmother.
After the series had slipped, Rivera joined actor Ryan Dorsey and had his first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband, leaving them behind.
However, Dorsey refused to file charges and the domestic violence case was dropped.
On July 8, it was reported that Riveru was missing after her four-year-old son was found alone drifting in a boat on Lake Piru, California.
The boy was found asleep in a life jacket aboard the boat, and he was able to tell police authorities that he and his mother had taken a dip and so Rivera had brought him back up to the boat but never returned there himself.
An extensive search for Rivera began.
The day after the search began, the local sheriff's office reported that during a search, Rivera had drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found and was officially pronounced dead.
She is believed to have been caught up in heavy streaming in the water, taking advantage of her last claim to save the son.
The cause of death was recorded drunk by accident.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith took on the role of Finn Hudson on the show, the American footballplayer with the angelic voice who played a key role in bringing the Happy Squad to the road and respect.
Outside the show, though, Moneith wrestled with personal demons.
Since he was 13, he had had an addiction and proved difficult to escape.
In 2013, his colleagues on the show felt enough, intervened and encouraged him to seek help.
Moneith then went to rehab and seemed to be all looking for better.
Just two months after he finished treatment, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after going out partying with friends.
Banamein proved to be a fatal combination of intoxication and alcohol.
It was not believed to be an intentional act.
Moneith had been treated and his tolerance for intoxication had decreased so much that the dose he had previously endured well, proved fatal.
He was only 31 when he died.
His death was heavily imposed on his colleagues, but to the conclusion of his counterpart, Lea Michele, it was decided to continue filming the show and devoted them to an entire episode of memory of Moneith and his character Finn.
Mark Wayne Salling took the role of Noah "Puck" Puckerman on the show, Puck was an American football player, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellow students in the Happy Squad, or up until he gained the courage to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his Los Angeles home on suspicion of possession of child pornography.
During a search of his home, an enormous amount of child pornography was found, and the case soon spurred publicly.
It was clear that Salling was finished.
He was subsequently charged and convicted of his offenses.
He had four to seven years in prison as well as having to be on the sex offenders register and seek treatment for child lust.
Before a judge had determined the punishment, Salling, who was then out on bail, was found dead near his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
It wasn't just the actors of the show who fell from far before their age.
Jim Fuller was the show's assistant director.
He became acutely aware of his sleep in 2013, at just 41 years of age.
The show also featured a woman named Nancy Motes.
She was the younger sister of superstar Julia Roberts and didn't bore her sister the beautiful story, but she accused Roberts of intense control and degrading conduct.
Motes took her own life in 2014, but she had severe depression.
She left a letter to her fiancé saying her mother and sister were responsible for, among other things, how she was placed.
'My mother and my so-called siblings get nothing after me except the memory that it was the ones that caused my worst depression.'
Lea Michel was the star of the show.
She has recently been blamed for using her co-stars bullying and abandonment on the set and having a condescending stellar attitude.
Jesse Luken took a guest role on the show in 2012.
He was arrested and charged with drunk driving in 2019, which was deemed a huge scandal.
Actress Heather Morris took a big role on the show.
She suffered in 2010 that opioid hackers accessed nude photos of her and appeared on the Internet.
Actors Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both starred on the show and had an affair outside the show.
Benoist later reported that Jenner used her violence in the relationship.
Flowers can be placed on almost everything
It increases children's development when they get to play outside in the garden with the parents growing flowers and getting to watch them grow and thrive.
It can also be done endlessly with flowers as Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Just having a moment with the kids in the park is something that's never forgotten.
They will remember the flowers, the fragrance, and of course the precious time they received with their parents.
Bought a boat after 10th grade
"I don't think we are many sailors working in local kindergartens," said Axel Örn Guðmundsson, who conducts coastal fishing in the summer but studied psychology at the University of Iceland during the winter season."
Coastal fishing is a very comfortable summer job when you're studying.
If you fish well, you can have a good income and I think it's great to be able to skip taking student loans.
My income is also good for me into the winter," said Axel Örn Guðmundsson, a 25-year-old psychology student, who is conducting coastal fishing this summer as in recent summers.
Axel had just docked at Gillfirth when a reporter caught up with him late at the beginning of the week."
"In the winter I was in tenth grade, I took captaincy rights for boats that are under 12 metres long and I bought my boat the summer after I finished primary school.
I've been fishing in my boat every summer ever since.
I bought the boat used by my acquaintance, Hartmann Jónsson, and I gave the boat his name.
Hartmann was grown up when I bought the boat and stopped being to sea and he was very satisfied when he saw that the boat had his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took over the boat," said Axel, adding that he bought the boat at three million.
"I made a deal with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of the summer, but the other half at the end of the summer when I'd been fishing.
So I had the boat debt-free at the end of this first summer of mine on it."
But how could a kid have one and a half million to pay out in a boat when he had just finished elementary school?
'I'd been putting in a bet and raising money, I'd been working with my dad to sea when I was a boy, I spent all summers fishing with him and got my share.
I also put my ferry money into my boat fund."
Axel was born in Ísafjörður, where all his mother's mothers are from, but he has lived in Kópavogur since he was a boy.
"I can fish here in the western region because I have a domicile with my grandmother in Ísafjörður.
I learned in these areas west of rowing with my dad.
I move between the beaches depending on how I feel, because this fishing area covers the entire Westfjords.
Although I think it's best to stay west, I've also provided around the Snæfellsnes peninsula and beyond.
I've also provided for the south, but then I stay weeded," said Axel, who always shrugs one fire early in the morning and says he sometimes talks to seagulls and sings to the sky, in solitude for hours out on the ballpark.
"The internet connection at sea is good, so I can call, listen to podcasts and music.
I don't think it's a problem being alone on a boat.
Of course, I try to avoid getting into danger, but certainly occasionally something has been wrong with the weather, but never a great danger," said Axel, who is lucky that he is never seasick.
He says the length of the workday depends on how the hunt goes at any given time.
"In the coastal fishing industry, I'm never more than 14 hours fishing at a time, but I've also been fishing in other systems, for example in the rental quota, but then I've been continuous for a day and a half grazing out at sea fishing."
The coastal arrangement, he says, is such that he can catch 770 kilograms a day, which he finds inhibiting.
"Other restrictions are that I am not allowed to hunt Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and I may only hunt twelve days a month, the four months of coastal fishing, in May, June, July and August.
In my opinion, fishermen should choose their fishing days depending on the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is on men to paddle instead of having 48 days over the whole summer and can choose to their heads.
So the regional divide could also go for me, and sea space that is well positioned at the fishery should be allowed to enjoy it," said Axel, who mostly pulls cod from salty waters on its coastal fishing, but also only leaves and occasional other species float along.
Axel works during the winter season with the university at Núpi Kindergarten in Kópavogur.
"I don't think we're many sailors working in local kindergartens," axel says proudly, adding that he only intended to work temporarily at the nursery.
"I get stuck there because I think it's an awesome job.
I hope the psychology program will be useful to me at the preschool level in the future," said Axel, who is also a long-time student in business.
An error logging prevented homecoming hypothesis
An error in the registration sheet filled out by people when they arrive in the country resulted in a person living in this country, not being called back to a biopsy.
There is no requirement to register an identification number if the person fills in the form on the English, as is when it is done on the Icelandic.
"This will be examined this week," said an expert in the national quarantine division.
Three domestic infections were detected at the National Virology Department yesterday.
One of those who proved positive arrived in the country on July 15, two days after the so-called homecoming guidelines came into force.
Those who resided in Iceland are then screened upon arrival in iceland and re-summoned for sampling four to five days later.
Until noon news, however, the person had absurdly followed the old system.
The sampling at the border was negative and he was not called back for screening for the virus.
Kamilla Rut Sigfúsdóttir, an expert in the national quarantine division, said in a conversation with the news agency that this can be attributed to an error in the electronic registration sheet.
If people fill out the registration form on English, it is not a condition to insert a social security number as is in the Icelandic version.
In the end, it was primarily considered for foreign tourists.
Therefore, if the person has not received an automatic invitation to place a biopsy.
However, Kamilla says many people have followed the rules on homecoming infestations even though they have filled the registration form on English and in some cases employers have also been vigilant about sending people to biopsy again after they arrived in the country.
"This will be examined this week how people's access to this can be facilitated to draw their attention to the process."
The man is in solitary confinement and six have been quarantined.
They all go for a biopsy, but two had begun to show symptoms.
Infectious tracing is currently underway with the three infections diagnosed yesterday, but it is mostly completed due to two infections reported on Friday.
In both cases, a sequencing of Icelandic genetic analysis has revealed that there are varieties of the coronavirus that have not been found here before.
In the second instance, the bonds have focused on Israel although it is known that the person who transported the virus to the country had also travelled to other European countries.
Kamilla says it should be available tomorrow where the other virus was coming from.
A total of 15 are currently in isolation, according to the website COVID. I'm not going to do it
135 are quarantined.
Four out of five infections offline
Five domestic infections have been detected in iceland in recent days.
Of these, four are entirely disconnected and, for example, the origins of the infection surfaced at yesterday's Rey Cup sports tournament.
Infectious tracing remains ongoing.
The original was in the third tier uniquely sent into quarantine, but they were reduced to sixteen.
Overall, 34 are quarantined for these new infections diagnosed yesterday.
This is the second time in a short period of time that an infection is detected at a sporting event, and it has raised questions about whether to hold such events.
Jóhann K. Jóhannsson, communications director for the Public Defender's Office, says it's well possible, as long as people follow norms and regulations.
"We are constantly urgent lying to all those who live here that individual contaminants need to be held up.
We also need to urgently provide for people who are holding events that there are certain rules going on that need to be followed.
Then you can hold events," says John.
He says infection can be prevented by holding aloft individual contaminants.
Additionally, rules and norms are under constant review.
"What needs to be done, and what the Department of Public Safety and the National Institutes of Health are constantly urgently working for people, is to consider these individual contaminants.
Both at home and so on at service companies.
That people wash their hands and use alcohol.
It prevents infection from going forward," says John.
"We need to urgently encourage people to continue on the good journey we were on, in order to maintain the success we have come to achieve."
40% of COVID-19 victims had diabetes 2
Devon Brumfield heard the gang phone how difficult her father had to catch his breath.
Her father had diabetes, so she encouraged him to seek medical attention.
The next day, he was dead.
The death was attributed to sudden breathing difficulties due to a coronavirus infection.
Diabetes was specified on the death certificate as an underlying problem, and Brumfield, who also has diabetes, is terrified that it is only going to happen.
A Reuters reporter says Brumfield's fears are not a reason.
The figures for a new study conducted by US authorities show that nearly 40% of those dead had diabetes 2 as an underlying disease.
When the proportion of people who had not reached the age of 65 is examined, the rate rises to half.
An investigation by the U.S. CDC involved more than 10,000 people in 15 states that died from the coronavirus in the period from February to May.
Jonathan Wortham, an infectious disease specialist at the CDC, says the findings are striking, not least for those diagnosed with diabetes 2 and their loved ones.
Was a feud in slow growth Reuters had a survey done, pointing to the responses from the 12 states that responded to comparable rates.
10 states, which include California, Arizona and Colombia, are not yet beginning to report underlying diseases.
"Diabetes was already an epidemic of slow growth.
Right now, COVID—19 has broken through like a powerful wave," has Reuters by Elbert Huang, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago.
Diabetes is more common among blacks and people of Latin American descent, which has also fared worse out of the corona.
One of the best protections for those with diabetes 2 is to keep the disease at bay with fitness, a healthy diet and the help of healthcare professionals.
The coronavirus outbreak, however, has made it difficult for many to keep a bus.
Furthermore, the high price of insulin has forced some to continue showing up for work, thereby risking being exposed to the virus.
Reuters notes that U.S. authorities may have been aware of the risk that those with diabetes 2 could pose to the virus.
As the SARS coroner progressed in 2003, more than 20% of them had the disease, and in the swine flu epidemic in 2009, this group was at three times higher risk of having to be hospitalized.
When MERS did so in 2012, one study demonstrated that 60% of those who died or were hospitalized in intensive care had diabetes.
Researcher Charles S. Dela Cruz of Yale University says that because the effects of the COVID-19 virus could longer, the outbreak deprived the veil of a number of previously naughty complications.
"I fear we will see a tidal wave of problems when this is over," said Andrew Bolton chairman of the International Association of Diabetics.
Doctors have warned that the coronavirus epidemic may indirectly lead to an increase in diabetes-related complications, including kidney disease and kidney dialysis.
Similarly, new research suggests that the coroner may lead to an increase in diabetes cases.
Reuters reports scientists are trying to understand the link between coronavirus and diabetes 2.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs and kidneys, organs already sick for many people who have diabetes.
Then a high proportion of glucose and lipids in diabetics can induce a true "cell messaging storm," as it is called when the immune system overreacts and attacks the body.
Damaged epithelial cells can also lead to inflammation which in turn can cause fatal blood clots.
"It's all one big jigsaw puzzle," says Dela Cruz.
"It all has to do with each other."
The story has been corrected.
"We were offered champagne, then they left the room"
Ásrún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason received the unusual request from artist Ragnar Kjartansson to have sex in front of a camera for a work the artist was installing in Paris.
"We loved each other so it wasn't complicated."
Atli Bollason will never forget when he met his wife and infant daughter, Ásrún Magnúsdóttir, for the first time.
"I was very fascinated by her.
It was naturally just the radiance, but then I thought it was also quite unheard of.
And still thinks," he says.
Ásrún remembers this, too, as the husband recalls the first meeting regularly.
"I'm always hearing this story.
Last just this weekend," said she, who was also attracted to the husband during the first encounter.
"I felt and feel so much excitement around Atli, which I like.
There's a lot going on and a lot going on and I was fascinated by it.'
Atli says he and his wife focused on their relationship going their separate ways.
"We don't tie our bagpipes to the same knots as fellow travellers.
We avoid the buses we detect around us."
It is possible why they took the appointment from Artist Ragnar Kjartansson just rejoicing, though it was mildly unusual.
"Our mutual friend Kristín Anna contacts us and asks if we can come eat desert with her, Rage and Ingibjörg, Ragnar's wife, on Snaps."
They accepted the invitation, met the triad at Snaps and had desert wine and their own dessert.
They listened to Ragnar, who led them through their plans at an art exhibition he planned to set up in the Palais de Tokyo in Paris in the autumn.
"He had a multichannel video project called Scenes from western culture.
He simply described it."
Ásrún says that he described the work as banal and dekadent scenes from the everyday lives of westerners.
"He had sketches of all the scenes he was going to shoot, and last time he told us about what he wanted to know if we were interested in getting involved."
The scene that Ragnar asked the pair to join was supposed to show young middle-class couples making love in a minimalist room.
"These are intercourse with the beginning and the end," says Atli.
The pair didn't know much, even though they knew about him and him of them "but they knew us and felt we fit in.
They had a word that they didn't want to advertise for people.
Maybe they thought they wouldn't get the right people, but people who would get sexual masturbation from performing for others.""
They said goodbye to Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it didn't take long.
"When we walked out of Snaps, we said, aren't we just up for this?
It was just like that.
I trust Ragnar as an artist and his entire team," says Ásrún, and Atli takes over.
"It's about love and intimat"
The scene was filmed in a fancy apartment on The Mýrargata.
There was a very rare film team; cameraman, Ragnar and the sound man and the pair.
After the recording had been turned on, all left the room to wait in the car except Atli and Ásrún.
'We hadn't decided anything what we should be like.
We had some little instructions, but we tried to forget a moment and a place.
To be unaware of what we were doing and for whom.
There was nothing played, we just loved each other so it wasn't complicated," says Asrún.
But was it romantic?
"Yes, it was a little romantic," says Atli, and Asrún agrees.
"We were offered champagne before they left the room.
It was a little bit like being on vacation in a fancy paris hotel."
The team was pleased with the pair's performance in the work that moved them.
"When Cameraman Tom watched this, he cried, he thought it was so beautiful," says Atli.
"It's as much about love and intimacence as the actual intercourse," says Asrún.
The pair's parents have seen the work, and Atli says that his mother heard the voice in the son at the Reykjavík Art Museum and realized he was part of the piece.
"Then she turns around and starts thinking about this," says Atli.
"Mom and Dad saw it in Paris.
We hadn't told anyone like that, but then my dad just texts me and says, "Nice to bump into the little family in the Palais de Tokyo," Recalls Asrún.
And I wonder if the participation in the project deepened the relationship between Ásrún and Atli.
'At least we're still together so maybe it deepened something.
At least this deepened my relationship with my in-laws," says Asrún, laughing.
Ásrún herself saw the work in Copenhagen with her colleague.
"I found it a little difficult not to be with you but someone else," she says, turning to her husband.
'But it was nice to see this because it's just one scene in a much bigger piece and when you saw this with the other pieces it's really cool.
I was a little bit able to tear myself away from it and I was just proud.
And there was the little bean in my stomach," says Asrún, who was pregnant with the couple's second child when the scene was filmed.
"It was just beautiful."
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke to Ásrún and Atli in The Love Stories on Channel 1.
Swansea with victory in previous semi-final
Swansea earned a 1—0 win over Brentford in a dramatic game.
It was the teams' previous game in the semi-finals of the umpires to reach the English Premier League.
The game took place at Swansea's home ground in Wales.
The score at half-time was 0–0.
Swansea's home side got a penalty in the 64th minute, but Andre Ayew failed the arc from the penalty spot and had his defence defended.
Just two minutes later, Rico Henry, the Brentford player, received the red card.
Brentford therefore played the rest of the game a man fewer and in the 82nd minute the Swansea players took advantage of the team difference.
Andre Ayew then compensated for the penalty area by scoring a great goal and securing Swansea a 1-0 win.
Swansea lead it 1-0 in the singles, with the second game taking place next Wednesday at Brentford's home ground.
Ambassadorless for five years since 2009
U.S. Ambassador to Iceland Jeffrey Gunter Ross is in the media spotlight after CBS reported this morning that he wanted an armed bodyguard as he feared for his life.
However, it has not gone thrashing for the President of the United States to appoint an ambassador in this country.
Since Carol Van Voorst's resignation from the U.S. ambassador to the United States at the end of April 2009, the total has been ambassadorless in the country for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst resigned in peculiar circumstances, but Spotlight reported in 2009 that she should have received the Falcons.
On her way to a farewell meeting with the President of Iceland, she received a call from the Oval Office saying she would not be honoured with the Medal.
After disappearing from Iceland, she taught international relations at Army War College.
Sixteen months passed until Van Voorst's successor came to work, in September 2010.
It can be attributed to the fact that Robert S. Connan had been appointed as ambassador, but then dropped out.
The job finally took Loius Ariega had worked in the Foreign Service for decades.
He then retired in the fall of 2013 and took over as ambassador to Guatemala.
Then we took another ambassadorless period.
Robert Barber was approved by the US Congress in January 2015 and came to work shortly afterwards, at which point no ambassador had been on site for 13 months.
Barber was politically appointed but not a diplomat, but had served as attorney general and supported Barack Obama's campaign fund.
He retired as soon as Donald Trump took over the Oval Office, January 20, 2017, as is customary with politically appointed ambassadors.
The Trump administration spent an extraordinary time appointing both ambassadors and high-ranking officials in the Washington administration.
It would be two years before the U.S. Congress summoned Jeffrey Ross Gunter to ask him the spurs and confirm it after that as ambassador to Iceland.
In his testimony in parliament, he said he had never been to Iceland but often to Western Europe, but his wife, who is dead, had been of Dutch echo.
Gunter is a political appointee, formerly a dermatologist in California and has been a prominent figure in the Jewish Jewish Jewish Coalition.
Casino owner Sheldon Adelson founded that organization, but Adelson is an enthusiastic supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to work in Iceland in May 2019, at which point there had been no ambassador in the country since early 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest example in iceland.
The reason is both how long the Trumps administration was nominating people in key office as well as that in recent years, the work of the US Congress has dragged on greatly, including confirming ambassadors to office.
Since 2009, it has been ambassadorless in Iceland for over five years.
However, it has not prevented construction on behalf of the embassy, which recently opened its headquarters at the No.
The construction is thought to have cost about $6.5 billion, but globe-trotting security walls surround the building and bulletproof glass is in all windows.
However, that doesn't seem to have enough to fill the current ambassador's security system because he is said to fear for his life and has requested an armed bodyguard.
Former IBV player suffered racism in Iceland - "It was a mistake to come to Iceland"
Tonny Mawejje, a former IBV player, says he suffered racism when he was in Iceland and that he regrets coming to the country.
This is reflected in an interview with Tonny that appeared on the Ugandan media daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined Uganda Police FC, which plays in Uganda's top division.
In the interview with the Daily Monitor, Tonny discusses many things, including his time in Iceland, playing with IBV, Val and Thunder in Iceland.
"When I got to Iceland, I didn't play in the middle the way I used to play.
The captain of the team was in that position, but besides, he also had the jersey number I wanted to have so I didn't get either of the things I wanted," said Tonny, who played on the right side of the season with the IBV.
Among the things Tonny discusses is racism he suffered in Iceland.
He says this is a problem many black players suffer when they play in Europe.
'It happened to me once but since I didn't understand the language, I just ignored what was said to me.
Later I heard about the case and then I asked my friend what it was all about.
He then told me that my opponent made racist remarks about me after I tackled him."
In 2014, Tonny left Iceland for Norway, where he joined Haugesund.
There, he says, he made the mistakes he regrets the most.
Tonny hadn't made it to the starting line-up at Haugesund, but he wanted to play more to make the national team.
Then he asked to go back to Iceland on loan, but he joined Val.
"It was a mistake to come back to Iceland on loan.
I think if I'd been in Norway longer, I would have had the opportunity I wanted to get," says Tonny, but he was hoping that if he were to play well in Norway, he'd probably get further.
He wants to mean that the loan to Iceland has made a point of his dreams of qualifying for a major league team in Europe.
Found a worm in a woman's throat
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8 cm long black worm in the throat of a woman who was there searching.
Doctors were able to pull the worm out with pliers.
An investigation revealed that there was a parasite.
CNN reports.
The woman had a few days before eating sashimi, which are thin meat slices.
The woman recovered quickly after the worm was removed, but parasites such as these are often in raw meat or fish.
Since sushi ruptured in the West, cases where parasites have arrived in people have increased, CNN reported.
Fears another wave is starting in Europe
Spain is now the focus associated with concerns about another wave of coronavirus in Europe, where the government has taken action to stifle the spread of the coronavirus epidemic again.
In Catalonia, all entertainment life has been put on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona where infections are increasing.
Other European countries have also taken action on increasing the number of infections in Spain, while the UK all have to quarantine upon returning from Spain, as in Norway, and the French have been warned to travel to Spain.
Contagion is also increasing again in France and Germany, as the government tries to find the balance of stabilizing the spread of the virus and bringing the economy back.
However, the situation in Europe is good compared to the other parts of the world, with the incidence of infection globally approaching 300,000 a day, which counts the most infections in America and South Asia.
Confirmed infections have reached 16 million globally, according to a Johns Hopkins University count, and the death toll confirmed to be linked to the virus is 644,000.
Mosaics Made finally gets to enjoy itself to the fullest
In front of Reykjavik Customs House there is a large and deep hole.
On top of it are men wearing orange helmets.
There's also a big dig.
And more smaller machines.
The street is closed to traffic.
But the pavement is capable, and many now pause and observe works of art from millions of mosaic tiles — as if they've never seen it before.
Maybe they've never seen it before.
At least don't respect that.
The work has so far been somewhat hidden, right in front of it were parking spaces that were always surrounded.
People parked there, locked the car in a hurry and then jumped off doing their business in the city centre.
"Vibrant and diverse public spaces" and "attractive urban steeplechases" are guided by the remake of Terry Street, which is currently underway.
The aim is to beautify the area and allow the mosaics of Gerð Helgadóttir at Customs House to enjoy a vision better.
In front of the project there will be a square and as the area lies well with the sun, it is considered suitable as a residence area for passers-by.
The artwork will be illuminated and now the materials will be able to enjoy themselves better than before on these 142 square metre surfaces.
The area will also have small "fog sprayers," a kind of water sculpture, that offer a game and provide a certain mystique to the area.
In this way, the renovations are described by the City of Reykjavík, which is currently under construction along with Veitur.
Water supply pipes, heating and electricity will be renewed.
Many of them have come to their years, but the sewage pipes and cold water pipes date back to 1925 and have therefore served residents and businesses downtown for nearly a century.
When the street is reopened after construction, cars can drive around it again.
But at least it becomes a one-way street, and at the same time creates a calmer and more accessible space for walking.
The customs office's website says the house was in use in 1971, but its architect was Gisli Halldórsson.
Because a harbor scheme reached through the house, there was a 250-square-metre windowless wall surface formed into the street.
The building committee and the architect agreed that such a surface would have a disastrous impact on the overall street sculpture, if no special measures were taken to adorn the appearance of the building.
The parties therefore agreed to calculate by having a permanent work of art installed there.
At that time, a great word went by Gerði Helgadóttir, an artist, says in the summary.
She had worked extensively on mosaic art in Germany and beyond.
It was decided first to contact her before deciding whether there would be competition for the project.
It had often been discussed that the work had to mirror life at the harbour, and the harbour had been Reykjavik's lifeblood since it was made.
When discussing the artist, she became obsessed with such a work.
It came to an agreement that she received drawings and other assistance before returning from shore, where she would work on the proposals abroad.
Gerður got the time she decided herself needed, and when she returned home, she made some suggestions for discussion.
It was agreed immediately to ask her to do the job.
At the same time, it was requested to enter into an overall agreement with her and the famous german art company, Brothers Oidtmann, who had long worked with them to set up famous artworks across Europe.
The work succeeded and Gerður worked the artwork under the installation of the brothers' workshop, which then oversaw the installation of Customs House.
The whole work was extraordinarily successful, both by Gerð Helgadóttir and the Oidtmann brothers, the summary says.
It has since resisted unblemished Icelandic weather.
It took Gerði about two years to do the work, which was done and set up in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after customs work was completed, aged just 47.
Preparing to move more agencies out to shore
Social Affairs Minister Ásmundur Einar Daðason is called for more public institutions to be exported to the country in the future.
That's what a minister on the "Explosive" show said at the Waves at lunchtime.
It was recently announced that the Department of Housing and Human Services will be moved north to Sauðárkrókur in the autumn.
Six specialists in the field of fire work at the agency, none of whom intend to accompany the agency north, and the National Union of Fire and Ambulance Service has criticised the migration.
"I think we should take further steps in this creature.
I'm preparing for further steps to this creature.
Further transport," said Asmund.
He says he's convinced that the vast majority of the population wants to see more distribution of government agencies around the country.
"I think there needs to be further political decisions on the transfer of public sector jobs to the country, as I was doing with the Housing and Human Services Agency," said Ásmundur, who also took examples of other institutions being exported to the country and made a big difference to communities outside the country, such as the Food Standards Agency's move to Selfoss. , NLSI to Akraness and unemployment insurance in Skagaströnd.
All the main things from the second day of the Championship
The 94th Championship of Iceland in Freestyle ended at Þórsvellir in Akureyri today.
Several tournament records were set on the second day of competition.
An exciting women's sledgehammer was calculated at Þórsvellir, while Vigdís Jónsdóttir from FH set an Iceland record in a sledgehammer in 2014, which lasted up until Elizabeth Rut Rúnarsdóttir of the Irish improved the record in May last year.
Vigdís won the Icelandic record earlier this summer and has been in fantasy form of late, having trived the Iceland record for the rest of the summer.
Elizabeth Rut has been dealing with injuries and couldn't recover today.
She had only one valid throw out of five, throwing 25.69 yards, which is far from her best.
Vigdís threw the longest of all today, or 60.08 meters at her last attempt, setting a tournament record.
Her iceland record set earlier in July is 62.69 meters, so she was somewhat from it.
Guðrún Karítas Hallgrímsdóttir of the Irish had the second-best throw of the day, but she improved her best performance with a throw of 50.18 meters.
In the men's draw, FH's Hilmar Örn Jónsson, iceland record holder in a sledgehammer, won, but he threw 73.84 yards in his next last pitch and set a tournament record.
His national record in the industry is 75.26 meters.
Guðni Valur Guðnason, an Olympian and Iceland record holder in the round, won a race in the ball park at Thorsvellir yesterday, but today he competed in a round-robin match that is his main discipline.
Guðna Vals's Iceland record is 65.53 meters, but he threw for the longest 59.13 meters today, securing the victory.
Valdimar Hjalti Erlendsson threw the second-longest today, but he had one valid throw that was enough for 2nd place, 49.43 yards.
Hafdís Sigurðardóttir, iceland record holder in the long jump, won the long jump race with an advantage, while Hafdís jumped the longest 6.25 meters today, which is less than 40 cm from her Iceland record.
In the women's 200 meters, it was Irish man Guðbjörg Jóna Bjarnadóttir who was the most sprinting, but she came in at 24.04 seconds, while her Iceland record in the industry is 23.45 seconds.
Guðbjörg Jóna was victorious in Akureyri, winning two gold medals yesterday, in the 100 meters and in the 4 x 100 meters invitational race, and also in today's 4 x 400 meters invitational race.
In the men's draw, Kolbeinn Höður Gunnarsson of FH was first in goal in the 200 meters in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of Óliver Mána Samúelsson of Ármann.
Like Guðbjörg Jóna, Kolbeinn Höður won gold in the 100 meters yesterday as well as in the 400 meters.
Not getting fined for $27 million Bitcoin crop
A superannuation tax committee has rejected a tax inspector's claim that claimed guilty to a person for underperforming his capital gains that were due to the sale of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
The committee finds that the IRS had not made clear why it was necessary to fine the man.
The committee's ruling shows that the IRS believed the man had places to submit materially incorrect tax returns for the income years of 2016 and 2017.
He would have understated his capital gains, which would be due to the sale of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin of $27 million, either intentionally or out of spectacular sloppiness.
The man was fined for his conduct.
The man rejected it in a letter to the committee.
However, he underwent a cryptocurrency sold for $27 million.
He would have acquired it with burials in 2009 and 2010 when it would have been both easy and undoorable with a standard household computer.
Then he pointed out that when he sold the cryptocurrency, tax implementation for such a sale had been significantly vague and unpredictable.
It might have been less than expected that civilians were aware of such measures on tax returns.
He would not have intended to avoid paying tax on the crop and would have outlined his property on a tax return as a deposit in a currency account.
He would have inquired from both savvy and IRS about how this was handled but without success.
Then he believed that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he began digging for Bitcoin.
He would therefore have been in a worse position than others to study complex rules that the IRS would not have formed a clear opinion about.
The man believed it was right that his taxes for these two income years would be rede determined and stress applied but otherwise not punished.
Then he reiterated that he worked in Iceland and had paid taxes in Iceland since 2012.
He would never have intended to evade his duties in an unwarranted manner.
The requirement for a fine would be out of all moderation and would plunge him into debt.
Sue provokes publicity: "This man understands what football is"
Brynjólfur Andersen Willumsson has been considerably between people's teeth but also impressed because of his progression for the rest of the season with Broad in the Pepsi Max league.
Blinkers will be in the line of fire tonight when they take on the Irish live on Channel 2 Sport.
Brynjólfur then takes out the playoffs due to four reminders of the season and therefore does not meet with a new haircut as in this summer's games so far.
He had had "blah, blah, blah" on his head before last Thursday's game at HK, which HK won 1–0.
"I don't know who exactly he was responding to with the payment, but speaking of character, this one was better trying in the game.
He didn't go into hiding.
He wants the ball every single time and if there was someone going to level this game, I thought he would do it or make it," gudmundur Benediktsson said in the Pepsi Max shed, when the talk came to Sue.
"I'm supposed to be here for the people."
'It's hard sometimes to figure out what position he is in.
He looks a little bit on the left when it starts to pass on the games, but he has a very free ruck in the team," said Hjörvar Hafliðason.
Thorkell Máni Pétursson tells Brynjólf a real entertainer and celebrates getting such a colorful man in the league: "Nobody disputes that this is a character.
It's a fun type and I love this with my hair, and to always be ready to show up and answer in interviews.
There are an incredible amount of people busy with him, who tell me that this man understands what football is about.
"I'm an entertainer.
I'm supposed to be here for the people and I'm enjoying it.""
The people are reading the interviews with Brynjólfur, people are paying their way in and watching what's next on his hair.
This man is just a genius," Moon said.
KR player says he wants to leave the club - "I've been in touch with some teams in the B-League"
Tobias Thomsen, the KR player in the Pepsi Max league, appears to be leaving the team.
According to Danish media Bold, Tobias is ready to return home to Denmark.
Fótbolti.net also reported the case.
Tobias wants to get the start of the season in his homecountry, but to do so he must first terminate his contract at KR as the Danish league starts before that Icelandic odds.
The club knows I miss Denmark and have shown me a lot of understanding," Tobias said in a conversation with Bold.
"I've been in touch with a few teams in the B-League and will probably switch over before the Icelandic season ends.
There aren't many teams in Denmark that can allow themselves to pay up my contract at KR.'
Then he says that he arguably needs to take a pay cut in Denmark.
"Associations in Denmark have probably felt more about the economic impact of the virus than in Iceland."
Bike whisperer Bjartmar has regained wheels for millions - Now responding individually after DV coverage
For over a year, Bjartmar Leósson has had interests unlike most others.
He sniffs up and rescues lost and stolen bicycles, electric bikes and scooters.
Bjartmar has earned the name "the bike whisperer" as a result.
Yesterday, there was a considerable amount of feathers when you published a story about his relationship with Bjartmar.
The DV then referred to a discussion on the West Bank Facebook group stating that Bright took the man to speak in the East and said the scooter may be stolen.
There was no other way to read from the electric shuttleman's original writings than that Bjartmar thieved him.
That text has now been edited on Facebook and the headline of the original DV story updated accordingly.
Bjartmar says initial news of the case is by no means a catalyst for what really went on yesterday in the East.
Bjartmar said he received information from the victim of an electric shuttle stunt that these were truly their own.
That information was obtained by the alleged owner from others, but the information proved false, Bjartmar says.
"I saw the guy and I recognized the shuttle, albeit with information that there was an electric shuttle that had been missing for a very long time and searched for.
I certainly hesitated first, but when I saw him getting ready to drive off on the shuttle, I decide to punch to talk to the man.
The owner was sure of his fault, so I decided to have a conversation with the man.
Generally, I'm going to be very nice on this kind of thing, but before I got to finish what I had to say, the man had taken away my word."
Bjartmar says the man on the electric shuttle immediately invited him to show him the receipt for the bike and himself called police.
"yes, cool," Said Bright, "let's just get this straight."
Then the owner of the electric shuttle proved ownership of his electric shuttle and drove off.
Later, the right owner of the electric shuttle told of his story on Facebook, as reported in an earlier story.
In the space of a year that Bjartmar has studied for this practice, he says he can count the exchanges he encountered with people on one hand's fingers.
"I have had peaceful relations with Reykjavik's hardest men," said Bjartmar, pointing out that bike thieves are by far the smallest brothers and sisters of society, addicts, mentally disabled people and other people for some reason on the street.
"The addiction is a tough master and somehow the next dose needs to be financed, unfortunately the theft of such liquidity is an easy way to that goal," said Bright.
'My dealings with these people are really so good that I've brought a lot of the good people with me to join.
There are examples of people having treatment and taking care of themselves and then looking to me and helping me with what I'm doing," he says.
In general, Bright March's interactions with bike riders are on a polite note.
Some people know about him and what he's doing and offer peacefully to show him receipts, bike stealth numbers and so on.
Bike theft is a major problem that has not been covered by much.
Furthermore, Bjartmar says the police are even starting to point people out to talk to him about stolen bicycles.
Bjartmar is inundated with previous DV news reports and says he is not some kind of self-appointed police in a personal search for justice.
Asked if he is now still not on slippery ice with his activity, and whether this is not primarily the role of the police, Bright says so certainly is.
'Of course the cops are supposed to do this, but the fact of the matter is the cops are just not doing this.
For example, I've watched officers drive away from a large pile of stolen bikes.
She's absolutely gruesuesful in these matters."
"When the cops aren't doing anything about this, and this is just in front of your nose, and the experience has shown that I can succeed in this litigation, then why not?" asks Bright.
He says he had so much success in tracking down stolen bikes, that sometimes he encountered his "clients" on the street that then they just just got the brighter wheels they had previously picked up.
The times Bright has called for police assistance has happened that she cleaned up.
"It's just not working with the police, and it's not my fault and it's not the owners of the bicycles to blame," Said Bright, sorry that victims of bike theft need to feel the emptiness of police in this case category.
Bjartmar's success is not shared.
In many places you can find stories of people thanking Bright for having recovered their belongings to them.
Bjartmar himself says he has long lost the number of bicycles he has returned, but the amounts will probably run into millions, if not millions of dollars.
Weighing there electric scooters, electric bikes and electric shuttles heavily, but electric bikes can cost up to half a million.
Bjartmar works during the day at kindergarten and every other weekend he works in a cohort.
His bike search is therefore unpaid work he does in his spare time.
Pension funds and long shadows
2019 was a major anniversary year in the history of pension funds in Iceland.
Officials had received a pension from the King of Denmark throughout the 19th century streets, but in 1919 a pension fund was established by pension fund officials who eventually became a pension fund for all public servants.
The basis for the current pension fund for general salaried employees was subsequently proposed by a full collective bargaining agreement in the labour market in 1969, which provided for employment-related pension funds with compulsory membership and a full fund collection since the beginning of 1970.
In 1974, laws were passed on the basis of these agreements and the pension scheme continued to intensify thereafter.
The workers' pension scheme was not the only radical change driven by a 20th-century union with its bargaining power.
Unemployment insurance had been obtained in a similar manner in a historic strike in 1955, and the organisation also gradually advanced its demands for sick leave and health funds, significant vacation rights, shortening the working hours, housing reform and more of that as much as anything.
All of these rights cost great and rigorous struggles but turned out, afterwards, much greater and more permanent scrutiny than the increase in the number of pennies in the wage envelope, which disappeared as hard in the hiacity of inflation that characterized the period after the war and until 1990 as many remember.
The prelude to the creation of general pension funds in 1969 was both long and complex.
Although the men eventually agreed that the funds would be in fact the property of the Treasury, the union had to agree that their boards should be appointed representatives of employers and treasury members equally.
In the coming years after the creation of the funds, the requirement for the majority of workers on the Board of Directors of the Treasury often came into discussion in workers' organisations, but it never reached its point, so we still sit down with the abnormal arrangement that representatives of the Treasury are not in the majority on the boards of the funds.
Article 36 of the Act No. 129/1997 on the compulsory guarantee of pension entitlements and the activities of pension funds deals with the investment strategy of the funds.
It states in Paragraph 1 that "pension funds shall have the interests of the Treasury as a guide."
It also states in Paragraph 5: "Pension funds should set ethical standards for investment."
The pension fund's shareholder policies include the following provisions, as a result of the aforementioned legal provisions:
The pension fund is a member of the United Nations (UN PRI) Rules on Responsible Investments, along with many of the largest pension funds and professional investors in the west and in Europe.
The rules discuss how focusing on environmental and societal issues as well as good corporate governance can contribute to improved investment performance of securities portfolios.
Thus, the interests of investors and the objectives of society go into a broader context.
LV believes it is important that companies, particularly those listed on the stock market, set a public policy on: maintaining good governance terms of social responsibility and environmental issues.
Pension fund Gildi, which has the largest funds in the country, has a "policy of responsible investment" and there are provisions of a similar type.
It's all recalled here as an introduction to Icelandic latest fashion word, "shadow management."
Since the word is new in the case, it is not hoped that it has been defined to comply, but it seems to me the following definition now is "most taken": Shadow management is when a union leader says in the media that he intends to send the company's representatives to the board of pension fund recommendations or instructions on how to take sides in a particular case.
If they do not comply with the recommendations, they will be deported from the board at the earliest convenience.
If the leadership doesn't take this to the press and doesn't talk about resignation, however, it's not "shadow management" provided that kind of interaction between men is of course frequent in the financial world as elsewhere.
I'll leave it to the reader to reflect on which way he feels "scarier."
In particular, there are two men who have tried to shape this definition at the time of writing, on the morning of Saturday, July 25, 2020.
They are Hörður Ægisson, journalist at The News and Asgeir Jonsson, the Governor of the Central Bank.
The occasion for both was created after Archer Nils Bogason, CEO of Icelandair, had dismissed his intention to terminate the company's contracts with flight attendants and flight attendants (terminate them), and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairman of the Reykjavik Traders Association, then issued the recommendation to the company's representatives on the board of the Pension Fund traders not to support the potential acquisition of the fund. "or they might be extended.
Some time later, Archer Nils withdrew his decision, and subsequently Ragnar Thor took the same path with his recommendation, which, of course, was aimed at Archer's decision.
Nevertheless, Hörður and Ásgeir saw reason to reproduce the issue in Friday's newspaper, with big words on shadow management, offence and a rich need for changes to the law.
There, a small chopper was truly supposed to roll out a heavy load, although the blessed chopper had been in a connected manner and also been swiftly wiped out.
Since the issue is important, let's consider the topic itself at the end.
I traced here before the issues in the Pension Protection Act pertaining to this matter.
These include that the Treasury boards should take care of the interests of the Treasury and have ethical standards in investment, and these considerations are implemented in detail in the approvals of both Value and pension fund traders as I mentioned.
Pension funds, however, should NOT look solely at short-term profitability considerations in their investments.
This would be precisely a dangerous strategy and does not have to look for long-lasting examples of such things in the past, as large lending banks and funds have slipped to uncontested adventurers and environmental messes, with disastrous consequences.
Icelandair's CEO was obviously on slippery ice when he thought about wiping out an entire group of employees, thus significantly reducing the goodwill the company has enjoyed in the Icelandic market and weakening its position towards investors.
Fortunately, he saw himself and pulled it back.
Time will reveal whether it will be enough for the investment of pension funds in the company to be considered liable to the Treasury at the end of the day.

One of the infected did not maintain homecoming aseptic techniques
One of the three people diagnosed with Covid-19 in the country yesterday arrived in the country from the Baltic State on July 15, about a week and a half ago.
However, he is an Icelander who does not reside here as a standard and therefore did not receive clear instructions to maintain so-called homecoming hypothesis after arriving in the country and going to another biopsy a few days after arriving.
He got negative from screening at the border.
"But he is in Icelandic community and really should go to that resort," said Kamilla Jósepsdóttir, an antiseptic specialist with the National Institute of Health and a deputy dissident during his summer vacation, in a conversation with The News Today.
"He used English the registration form and there is no obligation to register the social security number, and if the social security number is not registered, you are not invited automatically to the second view."
She says the man could have used English registration form because he is actually living abroad but because of his network of land that Icelander should rather have used it Icelandic.
At least he didn't realize it.
"When the social security number is not registered, you need to pursue yourself to come to the second biopsy.
Neither he nor his employer seem to have realized that was the right way," kamilla says.
"So it is clear that we need to strengthen the disclosure of this while we find some way to automate the messaging system even if Icelanders do not register their identity.
Or then to somehow make it more obvious who are involved in Icelandic community in the registration system," she explains.
Fortunately, however, the person surrounded few on arrival in the country, although it is identified as a participant in Icelandic society, being an Icelander.
Only six have been quarantined after he was diagnosed yesterday, and these six were all in communion with him.
They're going to have a biopsy, but two of them are starting to show symptoms of Covid-19 infection.
The man got negative from his biopsy at the border on July 15.
Kamilla says it's likely he was recently infected with the virus that she was not yet able to be detected in it when the sample was taken at the border.
However, she does not want to rule out that the man was infected here in Iceland but did not carry the virus with him to the country.
'You can't quite claim that this is definitely an imported infection because it's been a long time since he arrived in the country that he might have been exposed here like these two that have caused a bit of war in relation to the sporting tournaments.'
However, she says that is highly unlikely because of how few people surrounded here.
"It is actually highly unlikely," said Kamilla, noting that it cannot be excluded until The Icelandic Genetic Analysis has sequenced the virus in man.
'If we get a viral type that hasn't been seen here before, it's almost certain he's carried it to the country.'
Pepper spray and bombs used against protesters
The confrontation came between police and protesters in Seattle last night.
Police used protesters peppersprays and non-fatal grenades, while protesters smashed windows and set fire.
45 protesters were arrested and 21 police officers were injured.
Police brutality and racism were protested across the United States last night, while the protests in Seattle were in support of protesters in Portland, Oregon State.
In Austin, Texas, one protester was shot dead.
As stated on the BBC, the assailant has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands gathered in peaceful protest.
A group of people then set fire to a construction site and smashed windows in the city's courthouse.
Subsequently, police said the protest was a riot and there was a confrontation between groups of protesters and police.
Demanding justice in Aurora, Colorado, was Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old black male who was killed by police in August last year, mentioned by protesters.
A car drove through a group of protesters in the city, but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of Black Guard officers gathered and demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was killed by police at her home last March.
The group carried firearms and marched in states to a closed intersection where police separated the group from a group of people protesting the protest and also carried firearms.
There were 75 arrests in Omaha, Nebraska, where protesters remembered James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man who was killed by a white bar owner in May.
Solskjær: Not the game that defines our season
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, Manchester United's football manager, does not want to overreact to the importance of the game with Leicester today in the final round of the English Premier League.
If United lose the game, and Chelsea do not lose against Wolves, Solskjær and his men end up in 5th place, thereby missing out on a Champions League place.
Then, however, they should still hope of qualifying for the Champions League by winning the Europa League next month.
"We haven't reached the endpoint yet.
If we pick up points against Leicester, I think people will say we have now not had a bad season," Solskjær said.
"But whatever happens, this is not the end of our journey because we still have a considerable amount of land with getting the two teams above us," Solskjær said.
It is clear that human nerves will be whipping at 15 today, but Solskjær tried to pretend that every other game was involved.
"If you want to belong to Manchester United, you have to get used to being under pressure in the last game of the season.
This is nothing new, and this is based on the company.
We've created a great opportunity to end the season well and now it's ours to take advantage of that," Solskjær said.
'It's not the most important game of the season, it's just the next game.
You can ask anyone in football, the next game is always the most important one.
The results don't define our season, we've already had many hours to define this season.'
"The arrival of Bruno Fernandes changed a lot for us and I believe overall we are in better shape and much stronger mentally than last season," Solskjær said.
65,000 infections in 24 hours
65,490 new coronavirus infections were detected in the United States yesterday, according to John Hopkins University.
A total of 4,178,021 infections have been confirmed west since the start of the outbreak in the country.
900 died of the virus yesterday, but in the last four days until then, deaths from the virus were more than 1,000 in 24 hours.
A total of 146,460 deaths from the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
CNN reports that according to the US Quarantine Prediction Model, the number of deaths from the virus will be 175,000 by August 15.
Fears of another wave of the epidemic
The government of Spain is now trying weakly to resume the increased spread of COVID—19 in the country.
The Spanish health authorities identified over 920 new cases of COVID—19, both on Thursday and Friday.
No more people have been diagnosed in one day since the beginning of May, and the frenzy comes at the same time as Spain begins to lift one of the strictest curfews in Europe.
The backlash led to British authorities now obliging passengers arriving from Spain to quarantine upon returning home.
A week earlier, Spain was on britain's list of safe countries.
The situation is the worst in Catalonia in northeastern Spain, where the government has taken broader restrictions to try to stem the growth.
In the capital Barcelona, entertainment venues will be closed for the next two weeks and veterans' houses will be made to close at midnight.
A curfew is now in effect for 200,000 residents in Segria County, western Catalonia.
It is thought that the British decision will have a negative impact on the Spanish economy which relies heavily on the arrival of foreign tourists and is poorly played after the outbreak.
Tui, the UK's largest travel agency, cancelled all flights planned today to Spain and the Canary Islands.
Governments around the world are said to be preparing for the second wave of the epidemic, but there appears to be little interest in seizing back a major curfew that has widely destroyed the economy.
For example, Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, has taken a very bad look at such things and likened it to nuclear weapons that he does not want to use.
Then-French Prime Minister Jean Castex has said that the country "would not survive, chemically or socially," if again a nationwide curfew was taken.
Many controllers hope that local resources reaching residents of individual towns, cities or areas will be enough to resume the virus in the next round in the event of it.
Five new infections in Iceland - Three domestic
Three domestic infections were detected yesterday as well as two more at the border.
Thus, five people were diagnosed with positive Covid-19 infection yesterday in Iceland.
The public defender's announcement says one of the infections is related to the infection reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football tournament.
He has been sent to solitary confinement and sixteen who were in close contact with him in quarantine.
The infected person was a participant in the social activities of a sports club in Reykjavik and is, according to the announcement, "only part of the sports team" quarantined.
Others who were quarantined are otherwise connected to the man.
The origin of this infection is undetected and infected in full with the Governor's Infectious Diseases Team.
The tournament hosts of the ReyCUP tournament have followed the instructions and regulations of the CDC and the public defenders who are still in force and the appropriate measures have been taken.
However, pictures of yesterday's tournament attracted attention as you could see in very close communion celebrating the good luck of their team outside the stadium.
Just before 11am today, the protesters posted the following notice on their Facebook page.
It says "NOTE: Parents please respect the rules that the contestants themselves pick up their stuff at school.
Parents are NOT allowed to do so.
Thank you for your understanding."
Another infection was detected yesterday but is linked to the infection reported in the morning.
The announcement reads: "Icelandic genetic analysis has serialised the infection and has revealed a new type of virus that has not been detected here before."
There is also an infectious tracing operation and the infected person is in isolation and 12 quarantined for the infection.
The third infection in question is from a man who arrived in Iceland 11 days ago, July 15.
He was diagnosed in the southwest corner of the country.
He is currently in solitary confinement and six who were in close contact with him in quarantine.
Two of them have already begun to show symptoms of viral transmission.
In addition, two people were diagnosed at the border and are waiting for the outcome of further research as the procedure in transmission at the border stipulates.
Finally, the announcement reads: The Public Prosecution Service and the National Institute of Health urgently urged people to exercise caution and take care of individual contaminants.
If there is the slightest doubt about whether the symptoms of the Covid-19 virus are present, the same person is asked to have a biopsy at the nearest clinic.
Patreksfjörður says the campsite is booked for a shopping spree - Directing visitors otherwise
The camp site in Patreksfjordur is fully booked this weekend, according to the West Side announcement.
Guests are advised to explore other accommodation options.
West-built Bíldudalur, Tálknafjörður, Melanes in Rauðasandi, Hotel Flókalund and Hotel Breiðavík as other options in the position.
There is plenty to be had in Patreksfjörður this weekend, because like previous years, Skjaldborg, a celebration of Icelandic documentaries will be held in the town.
It has been held since 2007, making it a strong tradition in the town.
Judging by the aspirations of the campsite, expect good attendance this year, if the weather doesn't put a stride to account, but the DV said earlier today of a consequential forecast.
However, expect the worst weather in the south, and hope for the Patreksfjords.
The website bb.is first reported, saying that all other accommodation in the town was already fully booked.
An entire urban area grinds down to the best place in the city
Romanian workers live for free at Dunhaga 18–20.
In the meantime, owners are seeking construction permits for renovations, but their appointment has been welcomed by the system for a third year.
One of Reykjavik's oldest, roughest and most expensive neighbourhoods stands a rich urban area over three floors.
The ground floor of the building has about 600 square meters of retail space.
At the back of the house is the door of two stairwells, each holding four fairly weighty apartments.
They range from 93–130 square meters, most of them over 100.
The house has a considerable history.
It was built in 1959 and has hosted video rentals, the Shoe Lab, the Dairy Dairy Dairy, Joe Gunmaker, fish sales and, most recently, University Print.
The house has, to say mildly, remembered its elephant more beautiful.
The house is now under extensive damage, as seen in the accompanying images.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
Owners of D18 Ltd. according to the corporate registry among others Magnús Magnússon and Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir.
Magnús went before the owners group Borgunar and was the custodian of the holding company Borgunar.
The group of owners of Borgunar's holding company is Stálskip ehf.
Steelship Ltd. Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir and her children are the investment firms of Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir.
Guðrún is also the owner of a third share in D18 ehf.
Guðrún and her husband, August Guðmundur Sigurdsson, once ran the steel ship exit.
D18 Ltd. bought the house in the summer of 2009, so little to nothing has been maintained since then.
Neighbors say the condition of the building has deteriorated steadily since, although the most in recent years.
On the neighborhood resident's Facebook page, one resident says the house has 'not been particularly vibrant for the last year'.
It may play into the fact that owners have for several years sought to change the house and grounds.
Other neighbors say the house has long not been ok.
'It's long overdue to do something proper about this spot and sad that it was drawn like this.'
He also says that he is furious with the owners of the house for failing to drive himself into finishing this, finding some common surface with the house's neighbours and stopping this "legal stopper."
"Just do this in consultation with the surrounding community so you can get on with it and finish it."
The "legal staple" referred to by the resident is the planning process of the field that has been running a.m.k. since 2017.
The owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 were then authorized to build a hill on top of the existing urban area and behind the house, a new lift house and an annex on one floor as well as a basement.
The construction permit granted for that practice was appealed to the Ruling Committee on Environment and Natural Resources, and the committee repealed it because the construction did not have an adequate shareholding and the neighbourhood presentation was insufficient.
The city of Reykjavík then started sharing work and completed it with an advertisement in the Board of Directors in July last year.
That structure was also sued and the committee repealed it in March 2020.
At this point, it was nearly three years since the initial application for a building permit and the owners of the building to the starting point.
The house had at this time drab down considerably and neighbours managed to get tired.
When the DV asked the neighbours of the house about the situation and the response from neighbours, the answers were in a number of ways.
Some had an understanding of the intentions of the owners of the building, others not at all.
Others directed the anger at the city, others did not.
Others were just angry, but nothing necessarily out to anyone.
Still others said the parking hassle, but neighbors have utilized Dunhaga's unused parking lot 18–20 under their vehicles.
One of the defendants in the case said he was languishing in the administration:
'That let's have to go through the process of threesomes is absolutely amazing.
It's like the city of Reykjavík didn't know how to read."
Today, the house stands empty, abandoned and neglected.
A monument to the city's deprived administration and the noble intentions of the owner and their many years of work currently at the starting point.
When a reporter came to a park on Dunhaga 18, we blared at him wide open doors and piles of garbage.
A Playstation computer and a recent TV lay amid other debris on earth — victims Icelandic summer wet.
The old University Print office was open and there was a significant number of cats from the smell to judge.
It is clear that someone has nested in one corner, but no one can be seen.
Stacks of sofas and beds and a few pallets of geological paper pages, which were no doubt supposed to become a book, blared.
The stairwells of the residential building were also open and lives in both of them.
A reporter was lucky enough to bump into one of them's residents.
There were Romanians boiling themselves potato dishes for dinner and invited the reporter in.
The Romanians work for the employee lease Ztrongforce Ehf.
They have been there for some time, and DV sources say the company has paid nothing for the premises except heating and electricity.
Because of the condition of the house, it is not premeditated to collect rent.
Judging by the reasons for mail in the lobby of the building, it is clear that there have been a number of foreign workers living in the last few years.
The operation of employee rentals has not been part of the Covid-19 situation, the end of the recession in tourism led to a contraction in the construction sector, and these two businesses have been the most efficient at taking advantage of employee rental services.
Nevertheless, householders at Dunhaga 18 seemed to have plenty of work to do, hung the work defects and mittens in the common area to dry after a long day of work in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the miserable condition of the house, the apartment the boys shared seemed to be finely maintained.
When a reporter said goodbye to the boys in Romanian, he suddenly became clear: In the best place in Reykjavik, a 1,500-square-foot estate stands depressed.
Owners want to change the house for improvement and neighbours want an improved condition while disputing the definition of 'improved'.
In between, the city's planning division sits at the starting point, a victim of endless appeals and appeals in the planning process, and the dizzying resolution of the Environment and Natural Resources Committee.
In the house, there are romanian workers, perhaps precisely those who go on to improve the situation, when the Icelanders stop arguing.
The article originally appeared in the Weekend DV on July 17.
In an effort against excess in the wake of a coronavirus outbreak
Uk Prime Minister Boris Johnson will award £10 million in a campaign against excess, which will include a ban on fast food advertising, as a result of his seriously ill, partly because of his weight.
Johnson is expected to launch the campaign, which has been named Better Health, tomorrow, Monday, but with the campaign, doctors will be encouraged to prescribe cycling for their clients overweight and will also be undertaken in an effort to increase the number of cycling paths.
Fast food advertising will then be banned by 11pm at night, according to British media sources.
"COVID—19 has attracted us towards the short- and long-term risks of being overweight, and the Prime Minister is determined that we must use the time to become healthier, more active and eat healthier foods," a government spokesman is quoted as saying.
Johnson himself has had weight problems, but he was hospitalized in intensive care when he became infected with the coroner in the spring, and it is partly his weight because he is believed to have fallen so seriously ill.
Women better suited to leading the changes
She said the new constitution was the biggest step the country can take towards greater distribution of power, transparency and in countering corruption and to the interests of the total.
"We need to start changing gears a little bit now and who is better suited to leading that kind of change than the group of society that is easier to be in these values.
It's women," Helga said.
"Women in Iceland are famous for their female consensus.
Sticking together and being together in leading change.
So now it's just our turn to lead these changes.""
She said she was a little disturbed by the emphasis on Iceland as "the best in the world" in both gender equality and human rights.
'Then we're not as ready to look at what needs to be done.
As Germans are very aware of their history and look at everything that needs to be done.
That's a lot.
We need to know where we're coming from and know the story and listen.
Listen to the voices of marginalized groups.
We do not live with the same rules all here," Helga said.
She said women were in many ways good in Iceland, but added that, as in many other places, Icelanders lived in really male-dominated values.
She said that politics was about their own interests, dominance and power, which was the forces that sustained abuses in all societies.
"Women have now started this group and come together and are just getting a little frustrated that Parliament is going to reluctantly overlook this referendum from 2012," she said.
'It's these female values that we're thinking this out of.
Based on human rights and conservation, cooperation and that we all really sit at the same table," she said, adding that the aforementioned values were the core values of the new constitution.
'We're a very rich country of natural resources and it's ridiculous that there are people living in poverty here.
It's ridiculous, we can switch differently," Helga said.
'It's ridiculous that there's some natural law that women's jobs are always lower paid.
It's absurd that flight attendants and nurses have to stand down indefinitely just to achieve decent wages.""

Tried to rob a pedestrian downtown
A man was arrested downtown last night after he threatened pedestrians and tried to get money off him.
Police also halted the production of drugs in Árbær, where two people were arrested over the case.
Then police stopped the driver of a motorcycle in the Hills where its driver was at 146 mph with a speed limit of 60 km/h.
Moreover, he had previously been stripped of his driving rights.
Police in the capital area had enough to spin through the night and more than 80 cases were recorded in the police diary from 5 a.m. to 5 a.m.
There was a particularly high level of noise reporting for parties.
On the eve of Saturday, there were reports of 11 noisy parties, and it was deemed extensively in the police diary.
Overnight, however, 22 noise issues rallied on the police board.
Six people were saved in a jail cell last night.
In Árbær, police were called last night when the parties opened fire.
However, they were already out of the way when officers carried to the park.
Then nine drivers were stopped for drunk and or drug-driving.
Four people were arrested over a fight downtown last night, one of which was saved in a prison cell.
Then two people were taken to the emergency room after they fell on their faces, one downtown and the other in the West Bank.
One person was taken to the emergency room after he was injured jumping on a trampoline in Kopavogur.
In addition, officers stopped a driver who pulled a caravan at Kjalarnes yesterday.
The caravan's bike gear was, according to the police diary, in "very bad condition" and it was stationary.
You can stay at Monet's house for the mall
The house, which impressionist Claude Monet spent the last forty years practicing in, is now being rented on the Airbnb site.
The next available nights in the house are on the mall.
The house is small and cute, located in the town of Givenry in Normandie, France.
The world famous painter lived in the house from 1883 until his death in 1926.
The house has three bedrooms, two lounges and three bathrooms.
Monet was first inspired to paint his famous gardens in this house.
If anyone plans to rent the house, they must rent at least two nights.
Judging by Airbnb's page, it's next available in a week, on Sunday shopping weekend, so it might be ideal for some shopkeepers on vacation to move on to book the painter's house.
The two nights over a mall cost no more than US$964, or just over $130,000 Icelandic as News Corp gets closest.
Dozens quarantined and several of them beginning to show symptoms of the disease caused by the coroner
Five people have been diagnosed with the domestic coronavirus in the last three days, and most of the infected are offline.
Dozens have been quarantined for this and several of them have begun to show symptoms of the disease caused by the virus.
Three people were diagnosed with the domestic coroner yesterday and two during border screening.
An expert at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence says the increasing number of domestic infections does not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading more broadly into society.
'It's been serialised from the previous domestic infection and it's a virus that hasn't been seen here before so we have no particular reason to think it has gone cryptic in society for some time.
This is probably something that has just arrived in the country, but of course we need to be very careful now," said Kamilla Sigríður Jósefsdóttir, an expert in the national quarantine division.
Most of the infected have been associated with individuals who came from abroad.
Further biopsies will take place in the future, but several people who were communicating with the infected have begun to show symptoms of the coronavirus.
"Right now, there's no influenza going on and less about other respiratory infections so we can be pretty liberal with doing these tests on individuals who at infusion time would have found reason to do something else first," Kamilla said.
Infectious tracing is mostly complete, but there is no way more people need to be quarantined.
Two of the infected were diagnosed after attending sporting events.
It has raised questions whether it is premeditated to hold such an event.
The Public Prosecution Service's communications director says it's well possible as long as people follow norms and regulations.
Kamilla says it's almost impossible for the infected to have been infected at the sports tournaments.
"If there are no more people in isolation based on these individuals after surrounded by them at these sporting tournaments then we can argue that our disinfectant at the tournaments has worked.
But it's not revealed," Kamilla said.
The Department of Public Safety's procedures are under constant review.
"We need to be ready to intervene with additional advice or restrictions if it seems an occasion," Kamilla said.
In just over a week, mass restrictions will be evacuated to a thousand people.
This new position could affect the order.
"Certain meditations to cook" - See Eliza Wood's menu
Elísa Viðarsdóttir is an accomplished footballer and plays with Val.
She is also a master's student in nutrition, mother, and works as a food scientist.
She needs a lot of energy for the amiable day and usually takes the time to cook good and nutritious food.
My normal day starts by showing up for work out of eight," says Eliza.
"After work, I go to the store to be able to prepare dinner before picking up my girl at kindergarten around 3:00."
Eliza finds it very nourishing to pick up her daughter early in kindergarten.
'It's good to have time with her before I go to practice this afternoon.
After exercise, it's good to come home and just have to warm up the food.
At night, when the girl is asleep, we like to watch one episode to drain her mind."
Eliza doesn't follow any particular diet.
She is putting an end to a master's thesis in nutrition, so she knows well what's right for her to eat to have enough energy to do work, school, family and exercise.
"What suits me is to eat a variety of foods that are well composed of protein, carbohydrates and fats.
However, I think it's most important to have a healthy relationship with food and not sort food into bad or good, rather nutritious or nutritious.
It's ok to eat everything, just not all of a sudden and not always.'
Eliza is very interested in cooking.
"I think there's a certain meditation in standing in the kitchen cooking and getting it very much into it.
I have to say my confidence is with me in the kitchen and I really believe I'm a decent cook.""
Breakfast: Oats, chia seeds, hamper seeds, salt, a little lemon juice, leave to lie in almond milk overnight.
Top this meal so with what ever is available.
Most of the time it's banana and crispy muesli &amp; COFFEE.
I'm a big coffee woman.
Mezzad: Incredibly different, but fruit or vegetables, flatcakes, clean shoots with bananas and muesli, bread with toppings and so I could eat hummus with a spoonful out of a box if that's the case.
Lunch: I often make all kinds of food-intensive salads from what ever is in the fridge, quinoa or barley, falafel buns, rocket, oven-baked vegetables with good dressing is a bit what I'm working with.
If the structure goes completely out of hand (which happens frequently) then the egg machine at work has come to my rescue quite often and then there are 2 slices of bread with butter, cheese and a boiled egg, no more.
Mezzad: Get me something carbohydrate-rich for exercise, bread with cold cuts, cereals or fruit.
Dinner: Fish will very often be chosen in my home, otherwise some delicious vegetarian dishes.
Conflict between police and protesters in Seattle
City officials in Seattle, Washington state have declared a state of insurgent situation following a crowded protest in the city center.
Police yesterday seized a flared bomb and pepper spray to tempt a large area of protest and stretched across multiple blocks near the city's parliament.
Police announced on Twitter that at least 11 protesters had been arrested and that an investigation is ongoing into vandalism worked at a police station in the city yesterday, possibly with some kind of bomb.
City and police officials say the protesters stoned police with rocks, bottles, detonators and other loose, and one officer was taken to a hospital where his injuries were made.
The protests in Seattle, however, were peaceful for a long time in front.
They were inflated to show solidarity to protesters in Portland, Oregon, where the city has repeatedly come to a tough confrontation between protesters and heavily armed federal forces.
There, as in more US cities, people gather under the auspices of Black Lives Matter, recalling Georges Floyds, who was killed by a Minneapolis police officer on May 25, systematically protests racism in American society and demands improvements.
Not withdrawn until after voting
It is not yet clear whether the withdrawal of icelandair flight attendants, due to take effect in the coming months, will be withdrawn.
An electronic vote on the Icelandic Flight Attendants Association's collective bargaining agreement on behalf of flight attendants at Icelandair ends at noon tomorrow.
The company's chairman Guðlaug Líney Jóhannsdóttir says he is confident Icelandair will not decide on the withdrawal until the outcome of the vote.
"It's hanging out completely," says Gudlaug Liney.
"No layoffs have been revoked, this must be done so that the machines can be manned.
So, of course, people are relentless after getting to know if they'll have a job after the end of the month.""
A contract signed a week ago is voted on on the eve of July 19.
It is expected to remain in force until the end of September 2025 and is based on a deal that flight attendants had previously dropped into voting.
On July 17th the Board of Directors and the Confidential Flight Attendants Association agreed to convene an all-out work stoppage at Icelandair, members agreed in a vote.
It never came to it, but this was decided following Icelandair's decision to cease discussions with the Flight Attendants Association, terminate all its flight attendants and seek agreements with another union.
Then the company's pilots were to temporarily take the jobs of the security personnel on board.
Asked how she thinks the vote will go, Gudlaug tells Liney it's hard to tell.
"People are at pains after this icelandair approach, when all the company's flight attendants were dismissed and announced to negotiate with another union.
Now it turns out if it has an impact," she says.
940 flight attendants worked for Icelandair at the end of April, 900 of whom, about 95%, were dismissed.
Their notice period is varying degrees, with the shortest working life having it three months and ending in the months of July-August.
This group has about 90% of Icelandair's flight attendants.
What will take over if the contract is not approved?
"Then we request ongoing discussions with our negotiators.
With this agreement, we are meeting Icelandair's demands.
If he is rejected, it is clear that flight attendants think they have gone too far."
A vote on collective bargaining ends and Icelandair introduces the second quarter settlement tomorrow
The flight attendant's vote for a new collective bargaining agreement ends at 12:00 noon tomorrow.
Icelandair's statement for the second quarter will also be published tomorrow, but preliminary operating results indicate that the company's revenue fell 85 percent from the same period last year.
An electronic vote on the Icelandic Air Transport Association and the Association for Icelandair began on Wednesday, July 22, and ends tomorrow, Monday, July 27, at 12 noon.
Those allowed to vote on the contract are Icelandair employees who pay membership fees to the Flight Attendants Association.
Icelandair and the FFA signed a new collective bargaining agreement on Sunday, July 19, but on Friday before Icelandair had broken off talks with the company after flight attendants colluded with an earlier agreement in a vote in early July.
By then Icelandair had terminated all flight attendants and airline personnel on Friday, but were withdrawn after a new collective agreement was signed.
Under the new collective bargaining agreement, flight attendants must fly five hours more a month for the same basic salary.
The collective agreement is valid until 2025, which has integrated the provisions of pilots and flight attendants on how long to fly on a single shift.
The agreement was presented to FFA members at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica hotel last Monday and described many flight attendants as news agencies discussed them with over dissatisfaction over the contract.
Most, however, seemed to agree that the deal must be approved to keep the FFA alive.
Icelandair's statement for the second quarter will be presented tomorrow, but the Company's EBIT, its operating performance for financial items and taxes, is according to preliminary operating results negatively of USD 100 to 110 million, or about US$15 billion Icelandic.
Icelandair sent the Stock Exchange preliminary calculations last Wednesday, which said the company's revenue amounted to approximately $60 million in the quarter or about $8.3 billion.
Net cash and equivalents were approximately US$154 million at the end of the quarter, around ISK 21 billion.
Icelandair also aims to offer the company's equity in August.
Icelandair aims to complete contracts with fifteen creditors, the government and the Boeing aircraft carrier by the end of the month before entering into equity offerings.
New variant rather than a new type of virus
"A new virus just means that this has been an individual who came from abroad.
This is not something that has been simmering in iceland," said Már Kristjánsson, chief medical officer at the National Infectious Diseases Department, about the reports that a "new type of virus" has been detected in this country.
Three domestic infections were detected yesterday and two at the border.
One diagnosed had participated in the social activities of a sports club at the Rey Cup football tournament, but the origin of the infection is undetected and infectious.
An infection was also detected in a person who arrived in the country on July 15, and two people who were communicating with him have begun to show symptoms of COVID—19.
The infection was then detected yesterday related to an infection reported in the morning and after a sequencing by the Icelandic Genetic Analysis, "a new type of virus that has not been detected here before."
Infectious tracing is completed in connection with that infection.
Márr stated that there is no new virus, but this is the same virus that has spread worldwide, i.e. the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
It's more appropriate to talk about a new variant of that virus than about a new type of virus.
Asked what that means and whether there might be any indication that another wave of outbreaks has begun, Márr says that there is currently a single case and it could go so that there will be nothing more of it.
"But on the other hand, if there are cases of domestic ones that do not have links from abroad and have the same genotype as this particular variant then that conclusion could be drawn [by a second wave] but it is premature at this time," explains Márr.
Happiness in the hot tub
Is the secret to Icelanders' happiness hidden in the hot tubs?
BBC programme makers lead to the likelihood in an entertaining video highlighting the country's pool and hot tub culture.
The Icelandic bathing culture is special globally and it is asserted that there are as many bathing places per population.
The natural geothermal energy is its foundation, but also the tradition of swimming that prevails here.
Children's swimming lessons were statutory in 1940, but seniors are no less able to make use of the hot water for health benefits.
Swim tours are described as a fixed part of the country's general well-being.
In the pot, everyone is equal, regardless of class and status.
Free of the mobile phones, people talk on a personal note about home and space or enjoy the palliative power of the water: meditating and charging the batteries of soul and body.
Steeped in picking up a hundred days of elections
One hundred days until Americans run for election and choose a president for four years.
Donald Trump is seeking re-election, but at least he's got a steep pick-up.
Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic candidate, has a huge advantage over Trump nationally, being targeted in the polls.
According to a new AP reporter survey, a record number of Americans believe the nation is on the wrong track.
Trump's response to the new coroner's pandemic is likewise deeply unpopular, and more Americans than before believe that the president has held poorly on economic issues.
More specifically, only two in ten Americans say United States are on the right track.
Thirty-two percent say they support Trump's response to the epidemic, and 48 percent say he held well on economic issues.
In March, that rate was 56 percent, and in January it was 67 percent.
According to FiveThirtyEight's average, Biden's banner is 49.9 percent nationally while following Trump 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has tried to shift attention away from his performance toward the epidemic to Biden, pushing so-called cultural disputes and proclaiming policies that are supposed to turn to law and order.
Biden's candidacy, however, is a huge effort to keep attention to Trump and consider a high probability of delivering a victory if the election is really about how Trump has performed in the last four years.
Trump's unpopularity also seems to come down to congressional Republicans, fearing the Front-runners could even gain a majority in the U.S. Senate, which so far has been deeply heeded.
Politico reported on the day that remaining a banner of parties and a candidate would be comparable, and that is now the Republican Party would receive its greatest unravelling in decades.
Suburbs have proved particularly bad for the party in the 2016 parliamentary elections, and it now looks like the trend will continue.
In recent days, Trump has tried to intimidate suburban residents into following, among other things, by saying that becoming President Biden, he will destroy america's suburbs and push for racial divisions.
Among other things, Trump has dropped regulation since Barack Obama's time in the White House designed to diversify the suburbs.
Then he urged the "housewives" of america's suburbs to read an article by a former New York deputy governor, in which she claimed Biden would destroy america's suburbs and take Trump under it.
"Biden will destroy your neighborhoods and your American dream.
I will preserve it, and even make it even better!" the president said.
The population of america's suburbs is an ever-expanding group of voters.
According to NPR, they account for about half of all voters in the United States.
Ever since George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the candidate who has received the majority of this group's votes has become president.
Except in 2012 when Mitt Romney received a majority of the vote from this group but lost to Barack Obama.
Opinion polls have shown that although Trump secured a nearly majority in the 2016 suburbs, his following there has significantly decreased.
Though that differs between the polls, Biden has measured about a fifteen percentage point advantage over Trump in the outing in the past.
Regis Philbin is dead
American TV presenter Regis Philbin has died, aged 88.
Philbin worked as an actor, contributor, presenter and singer for about six decades.
He is best known for running the popular talk show Live! with Regis between 1988 and 2011 with Kathie Lee Gifford and later Kelly Ripa.
He has also managed shows such as Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and America's Got Talent.
In the case of Guinness World Records, Philbin is the person who has spent most of his time on US television, and he has been recognized for that matter.
He received six Emmys in his professional life and was overall nominated 37 times.
A statement from his family stated that Philbin died of natural orcakes.
A number of colleagues, friends and fans have mentioned him on social media in the last 24 hours.
Will the Olympic fire be the light at the end of the tunnel?
After a final decision had been made to postpone the Olympics, an event that only world wars have hailed so far, the president of the International Olympic Committee said the famous Olympic fire would be "the light at the end of the tunnel," presumably referring to the global coronavirus pandemic that the world is now following through.
Achievement has a year more to prepare, and Japan authorities are adding to the cost of the delay.
At least everyone keeps their heads a lot at stake.
When it was announced that Tokyo in Japan would be the venue for this year's Olympicgames, the celebrations of the Japanese representatives were genuine.
They cried and laughed alternately, provided Tokyo had applied to host the 2016 Games, but leaves it the time in a lower hold for Rio in Brazil.
This time, Tokyo City and Japan should bathe in the attention of the world.
The Games were due to take place from 24 July to 9 August but have been postponed for a year, starting instead on 23 July 2021 and ending on 8 August.
If the Games fail to hold them, if the crown becomes still too much of a threat, the Games will be cancelled.
No one, however, quite wants to think that thought through.
Olympic games are no ordinary sporting competition.
Nothing is spared, the show should always be spectacular and strive to top the last few games.
The choice of a city for the Olympic Games is based on the selection committee's assessment of the cities' presentations.
The more magnificent the presentation — the greater the chance of getting the nod.
Tokyo spent $150 million trying to host the 2016 Olympicgames or by a further $20 billion.
The second time, when applying for the 2020 Games, $75 million, about $10 billion, was put into the presentation.
By 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo received this year's Games, japanese authorities had thus already spent as much as $30 billion on the project.
However, that amount is just a drop in the ocean compared to how much it costs to build Olympic villages, stadiums and generally strengthen the country's infrastructure to handle these kinds of tournaments, prepare it and keep the games themselves.
Organizers in Japan have said that the Tokyo Olympics, which should have been running these days but have been postponed for one year because of the coronation, would have cost $12.6 billion.
However, a report from the National Audit Office in Japan published at the end of last year showed that it was closer that the cost was double that number.
It will likely not be possible to fully assess the cost of postponing the Games, but it has been estimated that it can cost between two and six billion dollars in addition to the original cost.
The total cost for the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could therefore run between $15 and $30 billion.
There are such high numbers that all tax revenues Icelandic the state would only account for about half the Olympic games, compared to the lowest possible cost.
Olympic games are an event of the magnitude that they have typically become a topic of economics, trying to review numbers and examine the benefits and gains of the Games.
In the shortest case, an awful lot of people seem to have concluded that the impact of the Olympicgames is less than so positive for the economy of the cities that hold them.
Short-term effects are someone, for example, increasing jobs very much in the short term, but in the long term cities typically sit down with debt tails and the threatened operating costs of little-used structures.
Rio, Brazil, is stuck with significant debts due to the 2016 Games and has been having trouble costing maintenance of all the big sporting structures built for the Games.
Figures have been reviewed after the 2012 London Games, which has found that only 10 per cent of those who received employment related to the city's Olympics were unemployed before.
That means there were no new jobs except to a small extent.
In general, cities have not come particularly well out of financially retaining an Olympics because of the slanting costs associated with the structures built for the Games.
Benefits, however, are typically thought to involve increased traffic of tourists wanting to visit the Olympic cities following the Games, however there is a lot of uncertainty about the 2021 Games.
It is also uncertain whether all the number of spectators who usually attend the games can be accepted.
The main issue, however, is the honor that the cities have to be chosen, but it is hard to value for money.
Because despite the enormous cost, it can also be said that the joy the Games bring is not the fact that it can be put on a price tag.
But although the show is often magnificent and there is nowhere to be saved, of course, it's not just about money.
It's the sports heroes that are in the foreground.
For some accomplished people, it's surprising just dear to postpone the Games.
The Australian five-timer and gold medallist in her article at the site of the Olympic Games, Chloe Esposito, for example, is casually pregnant and would have been far from good fun this summer but raises hope of being in competition form for the 2021 Games.
She is therefore among the athletes who are just rather pleased with the suspension, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who planned to retire after this year's Games, had they been held on time, the suspension of the Games in some cases means they exit the competition before the Games take place.
Simply don't trust their bodies to go through a year more of strict exercises.
Few athletes settled into the hearts of spectators at the 2016 Rio Olympics as gymnastics star Simone Biles.
She came home with four golds around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has been attending several interviews in his native United States recently to discuss the Olympics.
She's going to the Games in 2021, but at least she's not necessarily sure she'll still be at the top of next year's Games, she'll then be 24.
Although it is generally not considered a high age, it is higher for a top-ranked gymnast.
"It's a sensitive issue," biles says, but still smiles at another in an interview posted on the Olympic Committee's Instagram page asked if she expects to reach as far as the 2021 Games as she did in Rio 2016.
"I honestly don't know if I'll still be on top after a year more of rehearsals," biles says.
She has previously spoken of her body not enduring the stress associated with gymnastics training for much longer.
Nevertheless, she practices with enthusiasm for the 2021 Olympics.
Biles admits it was an unpleasant feeling of having to stop suddenly exercising when the pandemic stood at its highest and the gymnasium was closed.
There were no exemptions for Biles rather than others while all athletes were closed for seven weeks.
All her Olympic gold couldn't buy any access beyond the others, she had to find a variety of ways to stay fit like others.
The basic form certainly a little better than most people.
"We have a rigid plan right now.
It was hard to start rehearsing first after the gymnast opened.
We started slowly but we are fully crawling again and I will increase the exercises steadily as the year progresses.
Of course, we don't know exactly what these games will be like or if they will be held, but we still practice considering they will be, can't help.
I've worked too hard to leave the sport now," biles says.
With her like more blunt doubts or perhaps rather awareness that the situation may arise that the Games will not be held in 2021 at all either.
Predicting that, though, is hopeless.
No one can know what the status of the coroner's pandemic will be like in July 2021 and nothing more to do than prepare for the Olympics considering they will be held for a year.
Maybe the Olympic fire will be the light at the end of the Covid Tunnel.
Postponed wedding due to outbreak
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding due to the coroner.
She was due to marry former Bachelorette contestant Wells Adams this summer.
"I think there are other more important things to think about anchoring right now," the actress said in a conversation with People.
'We really want to get married at some point and then have the dream wedding and have everyone present who cares about us.
But we decided to beat it on deadline and focus on what is important anchor now and that is to help share information about the importance of wearing masks and staying at home.
I look more into world affairs than wedding affairs these days.
There's a lot going on and we're supposed to focus our attention on what's going on in the world.'
