Bought a boat after the tenth grade
"I don't think we're many fishermen who work in the kindergartens of the country," says Axel Örn Gudmundsson, who conducts the strandveiðar during the summer than the amount of psychology at the University of Iceland during the winter months.“
Strandveiðar are very comfortable summer job when a person is in education.
If successful fiskast is possible to have a good income and I think it's great to be able not to take student loans.
The income is good enough for me too well into the winter,“ says Axel Örn Gudmundsson, a 25-year sálfræðinemi, which conducts strandveiðar in the summer as in previous summers.
Axel was nýlagstur to the dock of the Term when a reporter caught up with him late one evening in the beginning of the week.“
"The winter that I was in the tenth grade, I took a master's certificate for for boats that are under twelve feet long and I bought my boat in the summer after I finished elementary school.
I've had strandveiðar on my boat all the summers ago.
I bought the boat used by my acquaintance, Hartmanni Jónsson, and I gave the boat the plight of his name.
Hartmann was an adult when I bought the boat and the dangers of being at sea and he was very satisfied when he saw that the boat bore the name of his.
Hartmann died a few years after I took the boat,“ says Axel and adds that he has purchased the boat at three million.
"I made a deal with the Hartmann about to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of the summer but the other half at the end of the summer when I was ready to hunt.
I had the boat skuldlausan at the end of this first summer's on him.“
But how could the guy have one and a half million to pay out in the boat when he had just completed an elementary school?
"I was ready to lay and collect my money, I had been working with my father at sea when I was a kid, I spent all the summers to hunt with him and got my share.
I also put fermingarpeningana my bátasjóðinn my.“
Axel was born in Ísafjörður, from which all his móðurfólk is, but he has lived in Jamaica since he was a boy.
"I can catch here on the vestursvæðinu because I am domiciled with my grandmother in Ísafjörður.
I learned of this area to the west of here by róðrum with my dad.
I sit in between the fjords depending on how I feel, because this fishing grounds closer to the over all Vestfirðina.
Although I think best to be the west I have also provided around the Snæfellsnesið and beyond.
I have also provided for the south but then preferably indices,“ says Axel, of which nuts always one of the first thing in the morning and says he sometimes talk to these seagulls and sing for the sky, in the singularity for hours together outside the ballarhafi.
"Netsambandið out at sea is good, so I can call, listen to hlaðvarpsþætti and music.
I feel like no matter to be on your own.
Of course I try to avoid to land in danger, but certainly has a unique times there something wrong with the weather, but never a high risk,“ says Axel, who is lucky with it that he is never seasick.
He says the length of the working day go depending on how the fishing running each time.
"In strandveiðinni I'm never more than 14 hours of fishing in one, but I've also been to hunt in other systems, for example in the leigukvótanum, but then I've been continuously for one and a half day in beit offshore fishing.“
The arrangement in the strandveiðum he says to be so that he may catch 770 kilograms per day, which he thinks inhibitory.
"Other restrictions are the ones that I can't catch Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and I can only catch the twelve days in the month, this four month strandveiðar stand over, in may, June, July and August.
In my opinion, should sailors to choose their veiðidaga depending on the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure on people to calm in order not to have 48 days over the entire summer, and can choose his own way.
So could svæðisskiptingin go for me, too and fishing village which are well located with the fishing should get to enjoy it,“ says Axel, who draws mostly cod from the sea salts on the strandveiðum, but also only pollock and the occasional other types of float by.
Axel wins over the winter period with háskólanáminu on nursery Núpi in Kópavogur.
"I don't think we're many fishermen who work in the kindergartens of the country," says Axel proud and adds that he was only supposed to work temporarily in the nursery.
"I got stuck there because I like this awesome job.
I hope sálfræðinámið will be useful to me on leikskólastiginu in the future,“ says Axel, who also is a long time with the study in business administration.

Sýnatakan at the border was negative and he was not called back in screening for the virus.
Chamomile & vanilla Rut Hostess, an expert on sóttvarnasviði the directorate of health, says in a conversation with a newsroom that this can be attributed to an error in an electronic record sheet.
Fill people out the registration form in English is not a condition to put into social security number as it is in English version.
The end has it been primarily devised for foreign tourists.
It has affected not receive an automatic invitation to come in sampling.
Chamomile & vanilla says many, however, have followed the rules of heimkomusmitgátt if they have filled skráningaformið in English and in some cases, employers also been awake for sending people in the sampling again after it came to the country.
"This will be viewed in a week how you can facilitate the people's access to this to draw attention to the fact of the process.“
The man is in isolation and six have been placed in quarantine.
They all go in the sampling, but the two were beginning to show symptoms.
Smitrakning is now underway with the three infection who were diagnosed yesterday but it is mostly finished due to the two infected that was reported on Friday.
In both cases, the sequencing of the Icelandic genetic analysis revealed that there is about a variant of the kórónuveirunni who have not been here before.
In another case have ties shifted to Israel although known is that the person who brought the virus to the country had also travel to other European countries.
Chamomile & vanilla says that it should lie for tomorrow, where the virus was coming.
In total, there are now 15 in isolation, according to the web-COVID. en.
135 are in quarantine.
Four of the five smitum unrelated
Five innanlandssmit have been diagnosed in the country in recent days.
Of them are four entirely unrelated, and is to form not created, to find the origin of the smitsins that came up at Rey Cup íþróttamótinu yesterday.
Smitrakning is still current.
The original, there were on the third tug uniquely sent in the quarantine but was reduced to sixteen.
In total, there are 34 in quarantine as a result of these new infected who were diagnosed yesterday.
This is the second time in a short time as the infection is diagnosed at sporting events and has raised questions about whether held no such events.
John K. Johannsson, communications director for the civil rikislögreglustjóra, says it well can, so long as people follow the norms and rules.
"We are constantly honing for all those here who create that it needs to sustain the individual smitvörnum.
We also need to inculcate for the people who are holding events there are certain rules in running the need to go after.
Then it is possible to hold events,“ says John.
He says that it is possible to prevent infection by keeping on the ceiling of the individual smitvörnum.
Rules and norms are moreover under constant review.
"What needs to be done, and what almannavarnadeildin and the directorate of health are constantly honing for the people, is to consider these individual smitvörnum.
Both at home and so likewise with the service companies.
That people wash hands and use spritt.
It prevents the infection can go forward,“ says John.
"We need to inculcate for people to continue on the good path that we were on, to be able to sustain the success that we have so far achieved.“
40% of the victims of COVID-19 were with diabetes 2
Devon Brumfield heard through the phone how hard her father had to catch my breath.
Her father was a diabetic and she urged him to seek medical attention.
The day after he was dead.
The death was attributed to sudden breathing problems due to kórónuveirusýkingar.
Diabetes was specified on the dánarvottorðinu that the underlying problem and is Brumfield, who also is with the diabetes, scared to death about that like not to go for a.
Reuters fréttaveitan says fear Brumfield not is misplaced.
The figures of a new study that u.s. authorities have been doing shows that almost 40% of those who are dead were 2 diabetes as the underlying disease.
When the proportion of those who had not reached the age of 65 is a view raises the ratio up to half.
A study by the american sóttvarnareftirlitsins (CDC) began more than 10,000 people in 15 states who died from kórónuveirunni in the period from February to may.
Jonathan Wortham, a specialist in infectious diseases at the CDC, says the results will be striking, not least for those who have been diagnosed 2 diabetes and their loved ones.
Was hem in the slow growth Reuters had done a survey and suggest the answers from the 12 states who responded to a similar aspect ratios.
10 the state, but among them are California, Arizona, and Colombia, are not yet to be beginning to distinguish from the underlying diseases.
"Diabetes was already an epidemic in slow growth.
Now has COVID—19 broken through as dynamic and ever,“ has the Reuters after Elbert Huang, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at Chicagoháskóla.
Diabetes is more common among blacks and people of south-american origin, which also has been worse out of the kórónuveirunni.
One of the best defense for those with diabetes 2 is to keep the disease in check with a fitness centre, a healthy diet, and the assistance of health professionals.
Kórónuveirufaraldurinn, however, has made many difficult for politicians to keep the routine.
Then a has a high price of insulin forced some to continue to come to work and stop there with to be exposed to the virus.
Reuters notes that the american authorities have the power to be aware of the risk that those with diabetes 2 could be caused by the virus.
Is SARS kórónuveiran walked over in 2003 there were just over 20% of those with the disease and in svínaflensufaraldrinum in 2009 was this group in a three times higher risk of having to lie in a hospital.
When MERS did so manifest themselves in 2012 showed one study demonstrated that 60% of those who died or were admitted to the intensive care unit were with diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz scientist at Yale university, says that due to the impact of COVID-19 virus could be longer then the epidemic deprived of the veil of the number before óþekkra complications.
"I fear that we'll see a tidal wave of problems when this is over," says Andrew Bolton, the chairman of the international federation of diabetics.
Doctors have warned that kórónuveirufaraldurinn may indirectly lead to an increase in complications related to diabetes, m.a. kidney diseases and nýrnaskiljun.
As direct new research to kórónuveiran may lead to the proliferation sykursýkitilfella.
Reuters says the scientists be trying to understand the relationship between kórónuveirunnar and diabetes 2.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs and kidneys, the organs that are already weak for many with diabetes.
Then a high percentage of glucose and lípíðs in diabetic induced sannkallaðan "frumuboðastorm", as it is called when the immune system reacts too hard and attacks the body.
Decayed innþekjufrumur can also lead to bólgumyndunar which in turn can cause fatal blood clots.
"This is all one big puzzle," says Dela Cruz.
"This is related to everything internally.“
The story has been corrected.
"We were offered champagne, so they went out of the room“
The couple Ásrún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason was the unusual request from the illustrator Ragnar Kjartanssyni to have sex in front of the camera for the works which the artist was setting up in Paris.
"We loved each other so this was not complicated.“
Atli Bollason'll never forget when he met his wife and mother, Ásrúnu Magnúsdóttir, for the first time.
"I became very fascinated by it.
It was a natural just útgeislunin but then seemed to me she's also quite óheyrilega cute.
And am still,“ he says.
Ásrún remember this too the end recalls the husband of the first meeting regularly.
"I'm always hearing this story.
Most just for the weekend,“ says she who was attracted also to the husband at first acquaintance.
"I felt and feel so much excitement around Atli, which I like.
There's a lot going on and a lot to happen and I'm fascinated by it.“
Atli tells them the couple have focused on it in his / her relationship to go their own ways.
"We'll bales not the same knots and contemporaries.
We avoid routines that with the branches around us.“
It is possible the reason they took the complaint from Ragnar Kjartanssyni myndlistarmanni just rejoicing, though it was to say the least unusual.
"Kristín Anna shared our friend, contact us and asks if we can come to eat the desert with him, Ragga and Ingibjorg wife of Ragnar, on the Snaps.“
They have accepted, meet the trio presidency of the Snaps and got desertvín and list each dessert.
They obeyed at Ragnar who led them through their plans on an art exhibition which he planned to set up at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris for the fall.
"He was with margrása videóverk which was named Scenes from western culture.
He described it in a simple way.“
Ásrún says that he has described the job as a banal and dekadent scenes from the activities Westerners.
"He was with sketches of all the senunum that he was going to shoot and the last time he told us what he wanted to know if we might be interested to take part in.“
The scene that Ragnar asked the couple to take part in was to show young millistéttarpar to make love in the minimalísku room.
"These are the sexual intercourse with the beginning and the end," says Atli.
The couple knew Ragnar not much though they've known of him and he of them "but they knew us and felt we fit in this.
They had words on it that they did not advertise for people.
Maybe they felt that they would not get the right people but the people who get sexual whacking from the performera for others.“
They've said Ragnar and agreed to think about it but it took not a long time.
"When we löbbuðum out of the Snaps we said: we're not just for this?
This was just so.
I trust Ragnar as the artist and the entire team,“ says Ásrún and Atli takes under.
"It's about love and nándina“
The scene was taken up in a fine apartment on the Mýrargötunni.
There was very understaffed kvikmyndateymi; cameraman, Ragnar and the sound engineer and the couple.
After that the trigger had been at the recording left any room to wait outside in the car except Mr and Ásrún.
"We were not equipped to decide anything, how we should be.
We got some little instructions but we tried to forget time and place.
To be oblivious about what we were doing and for whom.
There was no play, we just loved each other so it was not complicated,“ says Ásrún.
But was this romantic?
"Yes, this was a little bit romantic," says Atli, and Ásrún agree with it.
"We were offered champagne before they went out of the room.
This was a little like being on vacation in a nice hotel in Paris.“
The team was happy with the performance of the couple in the job that moved them.
"When Tom the cameraman looked at this then cried he, him thought it was so beautiful," says Atli.
"It's as much about love and nándina and themselves the sexual experience," says Ásrún.
Parents of the couple have seen the work and says that his mom has heard the voice of the son of the Reykjavík Art museum and then realized that he was part of the job.
"Then she turns around and goes thinking in this," says Atli.
"Mom and dad saw this in Paris.
We had not told anyone this so but then it just sends dad me a message and says: Nice to come across a small family in the Palais de Tokyo,“ recalls Ásrún up.
And I wonder if participation in the work has deepened the relationship Ásrúnar and Atli?
"We are at least still together so maybe dýpkaði this something.
This dýpkaði at least my relationship with tengdafjölskylduna,“ says Ásrún and laughs.
Self sow Ásrún work in Copenhagen with their colleague.
"I felt a little hard to not be with you but someone else," she says and turns to the husband.
"But it was fun to see this because this is just one scene in a much larger work, and when the man saw this with the other works, this is very cool.
I could a little bit to tear myself away from this and was just proud.
And there was the little pea in the stomach,“ says Ásrún who was pregnant of the second child of the couple when the scene was taken up.
"This was just beautiful.“
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke with them Ásrúnu and Atli in the Romances on Channel 1.

The job finally took Loius Ariega then had worked in the diplomatic service for decades.
He was retired in the fall of 2013 and took office the ambassador in Guatemala.
Then we took another sendiherralaust period.
Robert Barber was awarded the approval of the us Congress in January 2015 and came to work shortly later, but then had no ambassador to be on the spot in 13 months.
The Barber was a politically appointed, but not a diplomat, but he had worked as a lawyer and the press, the great campaign contributor Baracks Obama.
He retired as soon as Donald Trump took the presidency, 20. January 2017, as it is usual with political manned ambassador.

Spilavítaeigendinn Sheldon Adelson, they founded the organization, but Adelson is an enthusiastic supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to work in the united kingdom in may 2019, but then had no ambassador been in the country since early 2017, two years and four months, which is the longest of which examples are on the country.
The reason is both how long the control of Trumps was to designate the people in the lykilembætti and in recent years has the work of Congress attracted a very long, including to confirm the ambassador's office.
From 2009 has the aggregate be sendiherralaust in the united kingdom in the space of five years.
It has, however, not prevent the construction of the ministry of the embassy which opened recently the headquarters of the Engjateig.
Construction projects are considered to have cost about 6.5 billion but hnausþykkir öryggisveggir surround the building and bulletproof glass in all the windows.
It does not seem to have been sufficient to fill the current ambassador of security because he is said to fear for his life and has requested to get an armed bodyguard.

In front of the custom house in the Capital is a large and deep cavity.
Above in it are men with orange helmets.
There is also a big dig.
And more memory heavy machinery.
The street is closed for traffic.

Committee and the architect agreed that such a level would have a bad effect on the heildargötumyndina, if not were made special arrangements to adorn the look of the house.
The parties were therefore agree that the figure by having set up a permanent work of art.
At this time went much the words of Did Helgadóttir, artist, says in the summary.
She had worked a lot to mósaíklistaverkum in Germany and beyond.
Decided was to have a first contact with her before but definitely would be if fulfilled would be competition for the work.
Often it had been discussed that the work would have to mirror the life of the harbour, the end had marina been the main artery of Reykjavík since she was made.
When interviewing listakonuna she had to trax amazement of such a deed.
Had an agreement that she would get drawings and other assistance before she would go back from the land away, where she would work with the proposals abroad.
Concluded was that time that she decided for herself that would have, and when she returned home she put some recommendations forward to the discussion.
Was adopted without delay asking her to do the job.
At the same time was requested to do an overall deal with her and the famous listaverkafyrirtæki in Germany, the Brothers Oidtmann, but Concluded had long worked with them to installation of famous works of art around the Europe.
Contracts shook and Concluded won the artwork under the profile of the workshop of the brothers, who saw the turn of the installation of the custom house.
All the work was exceptionally well by hand solved, both on the part of the Made Sections and Oidtmannbræðra, says in the summary.
Has there ever since withstand the harsh icelandic climate.
It took Did about two years to win the work, which was carried and set up in the years 1972 and 1973.
She died two years after Tollhúsverkið was finished, only 47 years old.

Yfirskattanefnd has denied the claim skattrannsóknarstjóra who demanded a fine over a man for vanframtelja capital gains of their own who were descendants due to the sale of rafmyntinni Bitcoin.
The committee comes to the conclusion that skattrannsóknarstjóri had not brought a clear rationale for why it was necessary to impose a fine man.

Scarcely would have been able to expect that the civilians did an article for such measures on the tax return.
He had not intended to evade paying the tax of the crop and would have made an article for the property on the tax return as a deposit in foreign currency account.
He had been asking for in both kunnáttumönnum and the directorate of internal revenue about how this would be the case but without success.
Then thought he to take into account the fact that he was neither born nor raised in the united states and had only lived here for several years when he began to dig for Bitcoin.
He had been in a worse position than others to familiarize themselves with the complex rules that the tax authorities had not formed a clear opinion on.
The man thought it right that taxes for these two tekjuár would be endurákvarðaðir and stress applied but otherwise not a type of punishment.
Then he stressed that he worked in the united states and should pay taxes in this country since 2012.
He had never intended to come in ahead of their duties with ótilhlýðilegum means.
The requirement for a fine would be from all the moderation and would overthrow him in debt.

He went into hiding.
He wants to get the ball every single time and if it was anyone going to equal this game then I thought he would make it or create it,“ said Gudmundur Benediktsson in the Pepsi Max the stands, when the talk turned to Brynjolf.
"I have to be here for the people.“
"It's hard sometimes to realize in what position he is.
He's looking a little bit out on the left side when it starts to feel on the games, but he is with very free role in the team,“ said Received Hafliðason.
Thorkell Moon Pétursson says Brynjolf, a real performer and welcomes it to get so litríkan man in the league: "It shares no one about it that this is the character.
This is a fun character and I love this with the hair, and to be always ready to meet and answer in the interviews.
It is incredibly a lot of people absorbed by him, which tells me that this man understands what football is.

Hjólahvíslarinn Just has a recovery wheels for the million - Corresponding now for themselves after consideration DV
In just over a year has Just King have a hobby unlike most of the others.
He always finds-up and rescue of lost and stolen bicycles, rafhjólum and vespum.
Has Just earned the name "hjólahvíslarinn" for accomplishment.
Yesterday it became so down considerably ado when a man published a narrative of his relations with the Valkyries.
Referred DV them in the discussions on the Facebook group Vesturbæinga where it emerged that the Holiday has taken the man speaking at the Event and told vespuna available to be stolen.
Was not the second can be read from the original writings of rafskutlumannsins but to Just have þjófkennt him.
The text has now been changed on Facebook and the headline of the original news DV updated in accordance with it.
Just says the initial news of the case not at all descriptive of what really went on yesterday at the Event.
Just claimed to have received information from the victim rafskutlustuldar that this was truly their rafskutla.
The information received, the alleged owner of from the others, but the information proved false tells the Valkyries.
"I saw gaursins and I recognized the shuttle, provided with information on that there would be rafskutla who had been missing for a long time and sought has been to.
I hesitated certainly the first, but when I saw him preparing to drive by the place on the shuttle decide I punch in to talk to the man.
The owner was sure his fault and I decided to have a conversation with the man.
In general I'm very nice in this kind of issue, but before I managed to finish what I had to say the man had taken of me.“
Just says to the man on the rafskutlunni was under one invited him to show him the receipt for the bike and was himself called to the police.
"Yeah, cool," said Just, "get this just right.“
So went to the owner of the rafskutlunnar proved ownership of the rafskutlunni and drove off.
Later said the rightful owner rafskutlunnar from history on Facebook, as reported in the previous story.
This over a year that the Holiday has proposed a while of this the practice of his claims, he can be considered the only time he got up on the wrong side of people on the fingers of one hand.
"I've had peaceful relations with the toughest men Reykjavik," said the Valkyries and notes that reiðhjólaþjófar are langoftast the smallest brothers and sisters of the community, addicts, mental disabilities people and other people who for some reason is on the street.
"Fíknin is a hard master and somehow need to finance the next dose, unfortunately, is the theft of such chattels easy way to the goal," says Just.
"My relationships with these people are in fact so good that I'm here with a lot of good people with me in the team.
Examples are that the people have gone in the treatment and take themselves in and approached to me and assist me with what I'm doing,“ he says.
In general are communications That we reiðhjólafólk on kurteisislegum basis.
Some people know of him and what he is doing and offer friðsællega to show him the receipts, stellnúmer cycling and so on.
Reiðhjólaþjófnaður is a big problem which little has been discussed about.
Furthermore, it says Anywhere that the police is more to say beginning to point people to talk to him because of a stolen bicycle.
The valkyries is a problem with the previous reporting DV and claims to not be eitthverskonar sjálfskipuð police in the personal pursuit of justice.
Asked whether he is now still did not come on a limb here with their deeds, and if this is not the first and foremost role of the police, says Its so certainly be.
"Of course the cops to do this, but the fact of the matter is that the police is simply not handle this.
I have to form a look-up on the police officers running away from a large pile of stolen wheels.
She is frankly grútmáttlaus in these matters.“
"When the cops are not doing anything in this, and this is just in front of your nose, and experience has shown that I can succeed in these issues, then why not?“ asks the Valkyries.
He claims to have achieved so much success in the stolen wheels that sometimes come across him on their "clients" on the street that they were just the right Bjartmari the wheels, which they had previously recovered in.
The time the Holiday has called for the assistance of the police has come for that she just won't.
"This is just not working with the police, and it is not my fault and it's not the owners of the reiðhjólanna to blame," said the Valkyries and sorry to the victims reiðhjólaþjófnaða need to feel for the indifference of the police in these issues.
About the performance, That is not shared.
In many places you can find stories of people appreciate Bjartmari to have reached their belongings to them again.
Himself says Just long to be lost numeral on the number of bicycles that he has returned, but upphæðirnir gel quite on millions, if not milljónatugum.
Roads where rafmagnsvespur, rafhjól and rafmagnsskutlur heavily, but rafhjól can cost up under half a million.
The printed works to the day for the kindergarten and every other weekend he works in a residential home.
Reiðhjólaleitin his is the unpaid work that he performs in his spare time.
Pension funds and long shadows
The year 2019 was much the anniversary of a year in the history of the pension funds in the united states.
Officials had admittedly received a pension from the King of all the streets from the 19th. century, but in 1919 was constituted the pension fund officials who eventually became to the pension fund all public sector employees.
The basis of the existing pension funds of ordinary salaried employees was subsequently charged with the hosts collective bargaining in the labor market in 1969 which provides a work pension fund with compulsory membership and fullgildri sjóðsöfnun from the beginning of the 1970s.
In 1974 there were so put the law on the basis of these agreements and pension system continued to grow stronger after it.
Pension system salaried employees was not the only radical change verkalýðshreyfing 20. century knocked out by kjarabaráttu time.
Unemployment insurance had been obtained by similar means in the legendary verkfallsátökum in 1955, and also received the organization gradually they wanted their claims about veikindarétt and your sickness fund, a significant orlofsréttindi, shortening vinnutímans, reform in housing and more such as a great replacement.
All of these rights are cost intensive and strict struggle but proved, in retrospect, much greater, and more permanent kjarabót but propagation auranna in launaumslaginu, which disappeared jafnharðan in hít of inflation that characterized the period after the war and until the early 1990s, as many remember.
The creation of the general pension fund in 1969 was both long and complicated.
Although humans would finally together that the funds would be in practice the property sjóðsfélaga became verkalýðshreyfingin to consent to the boards of their duty of appointed representatives of the employers and sjóðsfélaga to par.
In the next few years after the establishment of the funds came the requirement for a majority of workers in the management of the funds often for discussion in the federation of workers, but she managed, however, never carried out to walk, and, therefore, do we sit still stuck with it, an abnormal arrangement of the representatives of the sjóðsfélaga are not in the majority on the boards of the funds.
In the 36. article of the law no. 129/1997 about the disability pension is covered by the investment strategy of the funds.
It says in 1. paragraph that "the pension fund shall have the interests of the members to the forefront.“
Also says in 5. paragraph: "the pension Fund should be set moral criteria in their investments.“
In hluthafastefnu the Pension fund verslunarmanna include the following provisions, in consequence of the previously mentioned legal provisions:
The pension fund is a party to the rules of the United Nations (UN PRI) for responsible investment, along with many of the largest pension funds and institutional investors vestanhafs and in Europe.
In the rules is about how the emphasis on environmental and social issues as well as the good governance of companies can contribute to the enhancement of fjárfestingarárangri verðbréfasafna.
Thus brought together in the interests of the investors and the goal of the society in a broader context.
LV believes it is important to organizations, especially those listed on the stock market, the posture of a public policy on: to introduce good governance remuneration of corporate social responsibility and environmental issues.
The pension fund Value, which is the largest funds in the country, has set a "strategy for responsible investment" and where are the provisions of a similar nature.
This is all brushed up here as an introduction to the latest tískuorði íslenskunnar, "skuggastjórnun".
Where the word is new in the case is not hope that it has been defined fully, but I think the following definition now be "the most captured": Skuggastjórnun is it already fought in the union says in the media that he is going to send the representatives of the company in the board of the pension fund recommendations or instructions on how they should take a position in a particular case.
If they are not following the recommendation they made to depart from the board at the earliest convenience.
If forystumaðurinn'm not going with this in the press and speaks not of termination, then it is not, however, "skuggastjórnun" the ends are sort of communication between people of course always in the financial world as elsewhere.
I'll leave the reader to contemplate either way, he feels "a more sinister.“
There are in particular two men who have tried to formulate this definition when this is written, the morning of Saturday the 25th. July 2020.
There are those Hordur Ægisson journalist on Fréttablaðið and Ásgeir Jónsson governor.
The occasion provided both became after Bogi Nils Bogason ceo of Icelandair had told of the intention to terminate the contracts of the company with the flight attendants and attendants (tell them up), and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairman of the Verslunarmannafélags Reykjavik sent them out the recommendations to the representative of the company in the board of the Pension fund verslunarmanna that do not support the potential purchase of the fund shares in the company, or should they be made to depart.
Some time later, drew Bogi Nils its decision to back and subsequently went Ragnar Thor the same way with its recommendation that miðuðust of course with the decision of the Bow.
Nevertheless, they saw He and The reason for the world on the issue in föstudagsblaði news paper with large words about skuggastjórnun, felony and rich the need for changes in the law.
There was a small þúfa truly a wonder of the heavy hlassi although blessed of the mounds would have been in the subjunctive any more, either, and in addition be dried out swiftly.
Where the issue is important, let's note that the material itself in the end.
I traced it here before the items in the law on pension funds pertaining to this matter.
In those inherent to sjóðstjórnum should represent the interests of members and have ethical standards in the investment, and these points are elaborated in more detail in the articles of both Value and Pension fund verslunarmanna as I mentioned.
Pension funds have NOT, however, looking solely to the short-term arðsemissjónarmiða in their investments.
Such was precisely the treacherous policy and does not need to search long to examples of such in the past, where a large lending banks and funds have flowed to the immoral ævintýramanna and umhverfissóða, with disastrous consequences.
Ceo of Icelandair was obviously on the slippery ice when he got the idea to wipe out an entire group of employees, thereby reducing significantly from the goodwill that the company has enjoyed in the local market and weaken your position to investors.
Fortunately, he saw, and drew it back.
Time reveals whether it is for investment of pension funds in the company can be considered liable to members in the end.

One of the others got it from his hath spoken not heimkomusmitgát
One of the three who were diagnosed with Covid-19 in the country yesterday came to the country from Eystrasaltsríki on 15. July last year, for about one and a half weeks ago.

"He used the English skráningarformið and there is no obligation to register the number and if a social security number is not registered then you are not called automatically in the second sample.“
She says that the man has been able to use English skráningarformið because he is, in fact, resident abroad, but because of the networks of the country as Iceland, he would rather have to use it English.
He did not, however realized this.
"When a social security number is not registered then you need to seek by the ones that come in the second sýnatökuna.
Neither he nor his employer seem to have realised that it would be the right way,“ says chamomile & vanilla.
"So it is clear that we need to promote upplýsingagjöfina about this while we find some way to make the auto boðunarkerfi while american people do not number their.
Or then make it somehow more obvious who are the participants in the icelandic society in the skráningarkerfinu,“ she explains.

She wants though not exclude the possibility that the man was infected here in Iceland but do not carry the virus with them to the country.
"It is not quite possible to argue that this is indeed an imported infection by the fact that it is that long ago that he came to the country that he could have been útsettur here as these two which have caused a little stir in connection with the íþróttamótin.“
There, she says, though that's very unlikely because of how few man review here.
"It is in fact very unlikely," says chamomile & vanilla but takes place it is not possible to exclude it earlier than the Icelandic company is equipped to raðgreina the virus in man.
"If we get veirutýpu which has not been seen here before, then it is almost safe to he carried her to the country.“

An entire apartment blocks grotnar down in the best place in the city
Romanian workers live for free at Dunhaga 18-20.
While pursuing the owners after the building permit for the renovation but the presentation of them has velkst about in the system in the third year.
In one of the oldest, grónasta and the most expensive district of the City stands a magnificent apartment blocks on three floors.
On the ground floor of the building is about 600 square meters verslunarrými.
Behind the house are the doors of the two stairwells that each holds four fairly veglegar apartments.
They are in the range of 93-130 square meters, although most of the over 100.
The house has some history of the store.
It was built in 1959 and has m.a. hosted vídeóleigu, Skóstofuna, mjólkurbúð Mjólkursamsölunnar, Joe byssusmið, fisksölu and now the last Háskólaprent.
The house has, so mild to say the least, remember the time fífil more beautiful.
The house now lies under a lot of damage, as you can see on the attached images.
The owner of the house is D18 ltd.
Owners D18 ltd. are according to the business directory among other Magnús Magnússon and Gudrun Sacred Choir.
Magnus went for eigendahópi Payable and was forsvarsmaður holding Payable.
In the group of owners of the holding company Payable is Stálskip ltd.
Stálskip ltd. investment company Gudrun Sacred Lárusdóttur and her children.
Gudrun is at the same time the owner of the þriðjungshlutar in D18 ltd.
Gudrun and her husband, August Guðmundur Sigurðsson, drove one time útgerðina Stálskip.
D18 ltd. bought the house in the summer of 2009 and has little to nothing been maintained since then.
Tell the neighbors that the condition of the building has deteriorated steadily since, however, the most recent years.
In an unesco residents in the neighborhood says one resident that the house has "not been particularly lively last year".
Since may play into that the owners have for several years sought to change the house and yard.
Other neighbors say the house a long time have not been in the right.
"It is long overdue to do something good to this piece of land and sad that this has attracted so.“
He says while at the same time he is pissed of the owners of the house for not having the drive to finish this, find some common ground with the neighbors of the house and stopped this "lögfræðistappi".
"Do this only in consultation with the community around so you can get on with it and finish it.“
"Lögfræðistappið" as a resident refers to is the process of planning reitsins which has been running a.m.k. since 2017.
Were then the owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 after the authorization to build the floor on top of the existing apartment blocks and for the rear of the house, a new lyftuhús and annexe on one floor as well as basement.
The permission that was granted for the implementation was referred to the Complaints committee for environmental and resource and the felling of the committee it from the value at which the project had no basis in the zoning plan and grenndarkynning was not adequate.
The city then went along with deiliskipulagsvinnu and ended it with an advertisement in the Official journal in July of last year.
That organization was also cherish and felled the committee it from the force in march 2020.
At this point there were close to three years from the initial application of byggingaleyfi and the owners of the house where we started.
The house had at this time depreciate so down quite a bit and the neighbors begin to tire.
When the DV asked the neighbors of the house out in the situation and the reaction of the neighbors, the answers were in various ways.
Some had understanding of the plans of the owners of the house, others not at all.
Others pointed to the wrath of god to the city, others do not.
Others were just angry but nothing necessarily out of anyone.
Still others said the parking lot þrætuepli, but the neighbors have a new unused parking Dunhaga 18-20 under their vehicles.
One complainant in the case said langþreyttur on the administrative level:
"We need to go through the process in the three sisters is quite amazing.
It's like the City could not read.“
Today the house stands empty, abandoned and neglected.
The memorial of the svifaseina the administration of the city and göfugar ætlanir the owner and the years of their work as now is where we started.
When a reporter pass to park on the Dunhaga 18 saw him wide open door and ruslahrúgur.
Playstation-computer and a recent television low within about other debris on the ground — the victims of the icelandic sumarbleytu.
The opening was into the old office Háskólaprents and where a lot of cats of hlandlyktinni to judge.
It is clear that someone has hreiðað about themselves in one corner, but no-one in sight.
Stacks of sofas and beds and a few pallets of jarðfræðiblaðsíðum, which, no doubt, were to be to the book, saw the.
Stairwells of the farmhouse were also open and life in both of them.
The journalist was so lucky to come across on the population of one of them.
Were there Rúmenar to boil a kartöflurétt for dinner and invited a reporter into.
Rúmenarnir work for starfsmannaleiguna Ztrongforce ltd.
They have been there for some time and the simulated sources DV that the company has nothing paid for the premises except heat and electricity.
Because of the condition of the house'm not forsvaranlegt to collect the rent.
Of the to-do mail in the lobby of the building that the judge is clear that there has created a lot of foreign workers in the recent past.
The operation of the hired-out personnel has not gone untouched by Covid-19-situation, the end of the recession in tourism led to the recession in the construction sector and these two bransar be what duglegastir to take advantage of the services of hired-out personnel.
Nevertheless, seemed to members of the household on the Dunhaga 18 have enough to do and hung vinnugallarnir and vettlingarnir in sameigninni to dry after a long working day in the rain.
It should be noted that, despite the miserable condition of the house seemed to the apartment as the boys share to be pretty well maintained.
When the journalist said goodbye to the boys of the Romanian became him like the suddenly clear: The best place in the Capital stands the 1,500 square meters of real estate niðurnídd.
The owners want to change the house ahead of time and the neighbors will improve the condition but the share of the definition of "improved".
Between sitting so skipulagssvið of the city where we started, a victim of the endless áfrýjunarleiða and kærumöguleika in skipulagsferlinu and svifaseinnar resolution of the Complaints about environmental and resource.
In the house live so the Romanian workers, perhaps precisely those that go in to improve the situation, when The stop to argue.

The new variant rather than a new type of viral
"A new virus just means that it has been a person who came from abroad.
This is not something that has been cooking here domestically," says Gunnar Kristjánsson, the medical superintendent of the tuberculous Landspítalans, about the reports that "a new type virus" has been diagnosed in the country.
Three innanlandssmit diagnosed yesterday and two of the border.
One of which was diagnosed had taken part in the social activities club on knattspyrnumótinu Rey Cup, but the origin of the smitsins missing and smitrakning stands over.
Also diagnosed infection in a person who came to the country 15. July and two of which were in communion with the he started to show symptoms of COVID—19.
Then diagnosed infection in the night that is associated with infection reported was from the day before yesterday and after sequencing provided Icelandic erfðagreiningu came to light "a new type of virus that has not been here before.“
Smitrakningu is completed in relation to that infection.
Már takes place that is not that case of the new virus but is this the same virus and has wide out around the world, including.e. new kórónuveiran SARS-CoV-2.
It is more correct to talk about a new variant of the virus rather than about a new type of virus.
Asked what it means and whether it might say something about the second wave of a pandemic is started it says Már that as is is about a single case and it could go so that will be no more of it.
"But on the other hand, if it go bring up the case of a domestic who are not with ties from abroad and are with the same genotype, and this particular variant then it would be possible to conclude [the second wave] but it is premature for the time being," explains Mar.

On brattan to download one hundred days in the elections
A hundred days until the Americans walk to the elections and choose a president for four years.
Donald Trump seeks re-election, but he on although the odds.
Joe Biden, the prospective candidate of the democratic party, has a huge advantage over Trump on the national level, is central pick of the polls.
According to a new survey AP fréttaveitunnar believes a record number of Americans that the nation is on the wrong way.
The reaction of the Trump due to the pandemic of the new kórónuveirunnar are likewise very unpopular and, in addition, believe more Americans than before that the president was poorly maintained during the economic crisis.
More precisely, say, only two out of every ten Americans that the united States is on the right path.
32 percent say they support the reaction of Trump because of the epidemic, and 48 percent say he kept abreast of the economic crisis.
In march, it was the rate of 56 percent, and in January, it was 67 percent.
According to the average FiveThirtyEight is accompanied by Biden 49,9 percent at the national level but follow Trump 41,9 percent.
Trump himself has tried to move the attention from his performance against the epidemic to Biden, press under the so-called menningardeilur and preach the policies that are supposed to turn to law and order.
Supply Biden proposes, however, a lot of the race to keep the attention on Trump and believe a high probability of delivering a victory to show for it if the referendum is really about how Trump has conducted himself in the work of the last four years.
Óvinsældir Trump also seem'm going to come down on members of the Republican party and the fear Frammámenn that the Democrats could even reach a majority in the us senate, which to date has though very questionable.
Politico said from the in the days that remained accompanied by categories and candidate comparable and it is right now, would the republican party gain its greatest heavy fine for decades.
The suburb has turned out as particularly bad in the parliamentary elections of 2016 and now is looking for that trend will continue.
Trump has in recent days sought to intimidate the inhabitants of the outskirts to follow him, among other things, by saying that the price Biden president, will he destroy the suburbs of the united States and push under the kynþáttadeilur.
Among other things, has Trump cast down regulation from the time Barack Obama in the White house, which aimed to increase diversity in the suburbs.
Then he urged the "housewives" suburbs of the united States to read an article by a former aðstoðarríkisstjóra New York, where she argued that Biden would spend the suburbs of the united States and took Trump under it.
"Biden will destroy neighborhoods and the american dream.
I will preserve it, and even make it even better!“ said the president.
Residents of the suburbs of the united States is increasingly growing group of voters.
According to NPR, they are about half of all voters in the united States.
Everything from the George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004 has the one candidate who has received the majority of votes of this group become president.
Except in 2012 when Mitt Romney received a majority of votes from this group, but lost to Barack Obama.
Opinion polls have shown that despite the fact that Trump secured a short period of majority in the suburbs of 2016 has accompanied him since fallen sharply.
Although it is different between surveys has Biden been measured with about fifteen prósentustiga advantage over Trump in útverfunum recently.

Will Ólympíueldurinn the light at the end of the tunnel?
After the final decision had been taken to postpone the Olympics, events that only world wars have moved forward to this, said the president of the international olympic committee to Ólympíueldurinn infamous would be "the light at the end of the tunnel," and dismissed where, presumably, in a pandemic kórónuveiru that the world're gonna follow this through together.
Achievers have one more year to prepare and authorities in Japan improve on itself costs seinkunarinnar.
All the hold although the header end of the lot at stake.
When it was announced that Tokyo in Japan would be the scene of the olympic games in years were cheered the japanese representatives authentic.
They wept and laughed alternately, the end had a Tokyo apply to keep the games of 2016, but bent it switch in the lower held for Rio in Brazil.
In this time would Tókýóborg and Japan bathing in the attention of the world.
Games were to go forward 24. July to 9. August but has been delayed for years and begin in a place 23. July 2021 and will end on 8. August.
If not manage to keep the games then, if kórónuveiran will be still too much of a threat, will cancel the games.
No one wants though quite think the thought to the end.
The olympic games are no ordinary sports competitions.
Nothing is spared, the exhibition of always being a magnificent and seek in that the spikes of the last play.
Choose a city for the olympic games based on the opinion of the selection committee during the presentations of the cities.
The stórfenglegri that the presentation is — the higher the probability to receive hnossið.
Tokyo spent 150 million dollars in trying to get hold of the olympic games 2016 or the equivalent of more than $ 20 billion.
In later time, when the download was about games 2020, there were 75 million dollars, about ten billion, placed in the presentation.
In 2013, when it was decided that the Tokyo received games in years, had the japanese government has thus already spent the equivalent of 30 billion to the project.
But the amount is however just a drop in the ocean compared to what it costs to build Ólympíuþorp, leikvanga and, in general, to strengthen the country's infrastructure to cope with this kind of tournament, prepare it and keep yourself games.
Organizers in Japan have said that the olympic games in Tokyo, which would have to be running these days but has been postponed for one year due to the kórónuveirunnar, would have a cost of 12.6 billion dollars.
In a report from the ríkisendurskoðanda in Japan which came out end of last year was, however, observed that the closer would be the cost would be double that figure.
Probably will not be able to submit a fully evaluation of the costs to postpone the games than planned has been that it can cost in the range of two to six billion dollars in addition to the original cost.
The total cost for the japanese Ólympíunefndina and japanese taxpayers could run in the range of 15 to 30 billion dollars.
There are such large numbers that all the tax revenue the icelandic state would only for about almost half the Olympics, compared with the lowest possible cost.
The olympic games are the occurrence of the magnitude that they have often become the topic of economists, who try to looked at the numbers and looking at the benefits and gains of the games.
In the long and short of it seem pretty many people have come to the conclusion that the impact of the olympic games are less than so beneficial for the economy of their pay that hold them.
Short-term effects are someone, for example, multiplies the work very much in the short term, but long-term sit cities like upstairs with skuldahala and ógnarháan operating costs little of used structures.
Rio in Brazil sits upstairs with significant debt due to the games 2016 and has been in trouble with the cost of maintenance of all the big devices used for sports that were built for the games.
Peered has been in the figures after the games in London 2012 but there has come to light that only 10 percent of those who received employment related to the Olympic games in the city were unemployed before.
It means that was not the case of new jobs except to a small extent.
In general, cities don't come very well out of the financial holding the olympic games because sligandi cost which included mannvirkjunum as built for the games.
The benefit is however often considered inherent in the increased traffic of tourists who will visit Ólympíuborgirnar in the aftermath of the games, which, however, is the high level of uncertainty about the games 2021.
It is also uncertain whether you can take with all the number of viewers who usually download games.
The main thing is, however, the credit of which cities have the honour to be selected, but he is difficult to assess in monetary terms.
Therefore, despite the enormous costs then can be also to say that the joy that the games will move is not of such a nature that it can be put at her price tag.
But although the show is like a grandiose and nowhere to save them is this course not just about the money.
There are íþróttahetjurnar that are in the foreground.
For some achievers it is surprising just welcome to postpone the games.
Australian fimmþrautarkonan and gold medalist in his article on the síðusu the Olympics, Chloe Esposito, is, for example, kasólétt and had been seething in the summer but can see the hope to be back in the keppnisform for the games to 2021.
She is among the athletes who's just rather happy with the suspension, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who planned to stop after the games in years, they would be held on time, it means the postponement of the games in some cases they quit the competition before the games will take place.
Trust their bodies simply do not have to go through years of rigorous exercises.
Few athletes came as thoroughly in the hearts of the audience at the Olympic games in Rio 2016 and fimleikastjarnan Simone Biles.
She came home with four gold around his neck and one bronze.
Biles has met in several interviews in his home country the united States recently to discuss the Olympics.
She intends on games 2021 than she is, though not necessarily sure that she will still be on the top of the games in the next year, the end will she then become 24 years old.
Although it is generally not considered a high age is the in a higher place for fimleikakonu in the front row.
"This is a sensitive issue," says Biles but smiles while out in the second in an interview which was published on the Instagram page of the olympic committee asked whether she seeks to achieve equidistant on the games 2021 and she did in Rio 2016.
"I just don't know if I'm still on top after an entire year in the addition of exercises," says Biles.
She has previously spoken about her body can't take the strain that accompanies fimleikaþjálfun much longer.
Nevertheless, practices, she of the warrior for the Olympics 2021.
Biles admits that it was an uncomfortable feeling to need to stop suddenly to exercise when heimsfaraldurinn stood as the highest and fimleikasalnum was closed.
No exceptions were for Biles rather than the other while all of the devices used for sports was closed for seven weeks.
All her olympic gold could not buy any access above the other, she had to find various ways to keep in shape like the others.
Grunnformið certainly a little bit better than most people.
"We have a firm plan now.
It was hard to start the first exercise again after fimleikasalurinn opened.
We started slowly but we are here on a full crawl again and I will increase the training steadily during the year.
Of course, we know not quite how these games will be or whether they will be held but we do still considering that they will be, can't another.
I am created to impose too much on me to leave the sport right now,“ says Biles.
With her like the others slumber efi or perhaps rather the consciousness of the post can come up to the games will be absolutely not host the 2021 either.
To predict it is, however, hopeless.
No one can know how the situation of a pandemic kórónuveirunnar will be in July 2021 and nothing else to do but to prepare for the olympic games considering that they will be held to a year.
Maybe it will be Ólympíueldurinn the light at the end of the Covid-tunnel.
Adjourned wedding due to the pandemic
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone the wedding due to kórónuveirunnar.
She was supposed to marry the former Bachelorette keppandanum Wells Adams now in the summer.
"I think there are other more important things to think about right now," said the actress in a conversation with People.
"We want to get married someday and have them draumabrúðkaupið and have all those present who are us cares.
But we decided to beat the time limit and focus on what is important right now and that is to help share information about the importance of being with masks and stay at home.
I'm looking more for a place in the world but brúðkaupsmála these days.
There's a lot going on and we have to direct our attention to what is happening in the world.“
