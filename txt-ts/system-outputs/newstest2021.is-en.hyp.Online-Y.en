Claused at the World
The marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland seems to have gone well, and shouting and outdoors in the wild have begun to pull people across the world.
“You have the look like You Need Iceland,” says a woman in the big world in comments on an advertisement from the marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland on YouTube content provider.
Another observer says he will preserve Iceland in her heart for all eternity, and a young woman says that he must have to get to Iceland as first as her beloved resides there.
Luckily, however, she is in the United States and therefore expects to have to wait some month yet.
One more viewer asks if the hiking route to Iceland is capable, because there are no planes.
The story does not follow whether it comes from a different time zone.
Egill Thórðarson at the agency Peel, who came to the creation of advertising together with the international agency M&C Saatchi, says the reception has been hope more.
“I came to many Inspired By Spa campaigns that have been doing very well but this new campaign is already starting to beat record.
In the foundation, it's about generating PR values, that is, getting foreign media to cover the campaign, and it's been incredibly successful.
In a relatively short period of time, we have received coverage in about seven hundred media worldwide, which in total reach over two billion people.
The value of that consideration is priced at 1.8 billion.
It's not amid.”
The main market is equal to the United States and the campaign has been very successful, although the Americans are not heading to the country in the prey.
According to Egil, known market areas such as Denmark, the United Kingdom and Germany have also welcomed themselves, like Russia, which are comfortably surprised.
Then there was a reaction from exotic regions, such as India, which was not particularly laid out.
“These ads have traveled elsewhere than we expected,” says Egil, but it is worth noting that over four million people have watched the content on YouTube.
“We couldn't have wished for a better start.”
The pictures here at the opening took Árni Sæberg, photographer Morgunblaðið, filmed advertisements entitled “Let It Out” in the middle of last month.
The shooting took place far and wide, such as at Skolavörðustígur in Reynisfjöru, at Skógarfoss, at Sólheimajökull and in a cave at Hjörleifshöfði.
Directors were Samuel Bjarki Pétursson and Gunnar Páll Ólafsson at Skoti productions and collector Óttar Guðnason.
Roles in the said grip were Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, which is from Cuba and Hungary.
Dozens of Icelanders came to the commercials, but at the same time the recordings took place in South Iceland, there was another group in the West Iceland and the Westfjords.
According to Egil, “Let It Out” is just the first part of the Looks Like You Need campaign, while a winter campaign is aimed at partnering with M&C Saatchi.
“This is just the first phase in this work for Íslandsstofa,” Egil says, adding that the cooperation with M&C Saatchi has been very well.
“It's great to work with them.
In such projects, it is important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the markets we are talking to.”

This is how she looks today 25 years later
Actress Elisa Donovan had a successful career in teenage models of any kind.
However, world fame was awarded for her play as Amber in the film Clueless 25 years ago.
Then she also played in the series Sabrina: The Teenage Witch along with Melissu Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury and in Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married with one child.
Little has happened to her recently, but she got to look over the gone road and comment on Clueless on Australian TV in the days.
She talks beautifully about Brittany Murphy who died unexpectedly 2009 and says her have been a great person.
“I must admit that I built the character most of the girls I met at school who were not good to me.
As soon as I read the script, I knew who this character was,” Donovan said about his game in Clueless.
Did not want to leave the police station after overnight stays
About fifty cases came on the board of the police in the metropolitan area today, telling the police's journal that the cases have been varied.
The day at the Police Station in Hverfisgata began with a police had to intervene with a man who had then been released from a prison cell after having stayed there for drunken driving.
The man did not want to go away after he was released and did not obey the instructions of the police who told him to depart.
The man worked in an ongoing stay at the police station for his conduct.
Then a man was arrested in the morning year suspected of burglary into a company in Kópavogur.
Police also had to intervene two people in Breiðholt because of an assault announcement.
Then it also came to the fact that a woman who was sitting in a shopping center in Kópavogur could not pay for the bill after the meal and was therefore called to the police.
A debt on a downtown automobile was also announced this morning.
The driver of a white Renault van looked from her for a while, and she was then taken on hand.
The car has not been found.
The Curse of the Joy Tent - The Terrible Destiny of the Gleesters
That doctrine has reached a flight on the Internet that a curse rests over the season of the Flaudise band, whereas actress Naya Rivera drowned in California in the days, thereby becoming the third main actor of the episodes to give life far before age.
The episodes about the gladness. Glee) are a popular series of songs, dance and joy.
The episodes multilayered about the so-called joyful youth in high school, their love and fate.
It was not always taken out by the bliss of being in the confusion, but through singing and dancing, the characters of the elements seemed to manage to overcome any conditions encountered in their lives.
But outside of the set, a lot of disasters have ridden over the actors and workers of the episodes, so very much that teachings have arisen that curses resting on the elements.
Naya Marie Rivera went with the role of Santana Lopez in the episodes, a cheerleader who did not call all his grandmother.
After the season had run his course, Rivera joined actor Ryan Dorsey and had his first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and subsequently left them.
However, Dorsey refused to submit a complaint, and the domestic violence case was let down.
On July 8, it was announced that Rivera was missing after her four-year-old son was found all alone drifting into a boat on the lake of Piru, California.
The boy felt asleep in a rescue vest aboard the boat, and he was able to report to the police authorities that he and his mother had stabbed for swimming, and then Rivera would have brought him back into the boat but never returned there himself.
Rising an extensive search for Rivera.
The day after the search began, the police commissioner in the area reported that we looked assumed that Rivera had drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found and was officially ruled dead.
It is believed that she had caught a heavy stream in the water and utilized her last demand in saving the son.
The cause of death was recorded drunk by accidents.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith took the role of Finn Hudson in the episodes, American football player with the angel voice playing a key role in bringing the Glory Council to the road and respect.
However, outside of the episodes, Moneith struggled with personal demons.
From the age of 13, he had struggled with addiction and turned out to be difficult to escape her.
In 2013, his colleagues in the episodes found enough, resorted and encouraged him to seek help.
Moneith then went into treatment and seemed all looking to the better hand.
Only two months after finishing the treatment, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after going out having fun with friends.
Banamein turned out to be a fatal mixture of intoxicants and alcohol.
It was not believed that there was a work of willingness.
Moneith had undergone treatment and his tolerance to intoxications had decreased so much that the dose he had previously tolerated was more deadly.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
His death lay heavily on his colleagues, but at the behest of his antagonist Lea Michele, it was decided to keep the taking of the episodes, devoting them a whole part to the memory of Moneith and his character Finns.
Mark Wayne Salling went with the role of Puckerman's Noah “Puck” in the episodes, Puck was an American football player, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellow students in the Troubleshooting, or all until he gained the courage to admit he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at her Los Angeles home suspected of the possession of child pornography.
At home, housekeeping was found an enormous amount of child pornography, and the matter soon asked out publicly.
It was clear that Salling had been.
He was subsequently charged and convicted of his offense.
He had over his head four to seven years in prison as well as he would have to be on the record of sexual offenders and seek treatment for childbirth.
Before the judge had determined the punishment, Salling, which was then free from bail, was found dead close to his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
It was not just the actors of the episodes that fell from far before the age forward.
Jim Fuller was the assistant director of the episodes.
He became urgent during sleep in 2013, only at the age of 41.
At the episode, a woman named Nancy Motes also worked.
She was the younger sister of the superstar Juliu Roberts and did not bore her sister the beautiful story, but she accused Roberts of great governance and disrespectful conduct.
Motes took her own life in 2014 but she struggled with serious depression.
She left a letter to her beloved where she said her mother and sister, among other things, are responsible for how her was arranged.
“My mother and my so-called siblings get nothing left me except for the memory that it was the ones that caused my worst depression.”
Lea Michel was the star of episodes.
She has recently been accused of bullying and aggression to her playground and having an immersive star pump.
Jesse Luken took a guest role in the episodes in 2012.
He was arrested and sued for drunk driving in 2019, who considered a huge scandal.
Actress Heather Morris took a big role in the episodes.
She suffered in 2010 that untouched hackers found nude images of her and published on the Internet.
Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both played in the episodes and had an affair outside the episodes.
Benoist later reported that Jenner applied her violence in the relationship.
It can be put flowers on almost everything
It increases the development of children when they get to play outside in the garden with their parents to grow flowers and grow up and thrive.
It is also endlessly possible to do with flowers as Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Just having a moment with the children in the park is something that never gets forgotten.
They will remember the flowers, the aroma and, of course, the precious time they received with their parents.
Bought a boat after the tenth grade
“I think we are not many fishermen who work in Iceland's kindergartens,” says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, who is engaged in coastal fishing in summer, but amounts to psychology at the University of Iceland during the winter period.”
Coastal fishing is a very convenient summer job when studying.
If well fishes, you can have a good income and I feel great to be able to skip a student loan.
The income is also enough for me in the winter,” says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, a 25-year-old psychologist, who is engaged in coastal fishing this summer as in recent summers.
Axel was just about to pier at Tálknafjörður when a journalist got a talk of him late in the evening at the beginning of the week.”
“The winter I was in tenth grade, I took the shipping rights for boats that are less than twelve meters long and I bought my boat in the summer after I finished the primary school.
I have been doing coastal fishing in my boat all summers ever since.
I bought the boat used by my acquaintance, Hartmann Jónsson, and I called his name.
Hartmann had become an adult when I bought the boat and stopped being to sea and he was very satisfied when he saw that the boat was his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took the boat,” says Axel, adding that he bought the boat at three million.
“I made a contract with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of summer while the other half at the end of summer when I had done fishing.
So I had the boat debt free at the end of my first summer on it.”
But how could a guy have one and a half million to pay out in a boat when he had just finished primary school?
“I had been contributing and collecting money, I had been working with Dad to sea when I was a boy, I was all the summers fishing with him and got my share.
I also put my loading money into my boat fund.”
Axel was born in Ísafjörður, where all his mother's people are, but he has lived in Kópavogur since he was a boy.
“I can fish here in the west area because I have a legal domicile for my grandmother in Ísafjörður.
I studied in these areas here for the west of paddles with dad.
I move between the fjords according to how I feel, because this fishing area covers the entire Westfjords.
Although I find it best to stay on the west, I have also provided around Snæfellsnes and beyond.
I've also provided from the south but it's a grey drop,” says Axel, who always rips one fire early in the morning, and sometimes claims to talk to a seasan and sing for the sky, in loneliness for hours on the bullet sea.
“The outdoor ocean internet connection is good, so I can call, listen to podcasts and music.
I feel no point of being alone on a boat.
Of course, I try to avoid getting stunted, but certainly occasionally something has been wrong with the weather, but never a big danger,” says Axel, who is lucky with the fact that he is never sea sick.
He says the length of the working day depends on how the fishing goes on each occasion.
“In the coastal fishing I'm never more than 14 hours fishing at a time, but I've also been fishing in other systems, for example in the taxi quota, but then I've been continuous for one and a half days grazing out at sea fishing.”
The coastal fishing arrangement says he can catch 770 kilograms per day, which he feels hammering.
“Other restrictions are that I must not catch Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and I can only catch twelve days a month, those four months of coastal fishing, in May, June, July and August.
In my opinion, fishermen should choose their fishing days according to the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary press is on humans to calm instead of having 48 days throughout the summer and being able to choose according to their own head.
So, the regional division could also go mine because, and the marine space that is well located by the fisherman should get to enjoy it,” says Axel, who pulls most of the cod from sea salts on its coastal fishing, but also only bulbs and unique other species float along.
Axel works during the winter period with the university at Núpi Nursery in Kópavogur.
“I don't think we are many sailors working at the country's kindergartens,” Axel proudly says, adding that he only intended to work temporarily in the nursery.
“I get stuck there because I feel this awesome job.
I hope the psychology program will be useful to me at the future pre-school level,” says Axel, who also has advanced business studies.
Registration error prevented homelogging
An error in the registration form that people fill out when they arrive in Iceland caused a person residing in this country to not be called again for sampling.
There is no requirement to register an ID number if the person fills the form in English, as is when it is done in Icelandic.
“This will be examined this week,” says an expert at the quarantine department of the Surgeon General.
Three domestic infections were detected at the National Hospital yesterday's virology department.
One of those who proved to be positive came to the country on July 15, two days after the rules of the so-called returning issue came into effect.
Those residing in Iceland are then screened upon arrival in Iceland and again proclaimed for sampling four to five days later.
It was revealed in the lunch news of RUV that the person had followed the old system.
The sampling on the border was negative and he was not called back in screening for the virus.
Kamilla Rut Sigfúsdóttir, an expert in the quarantine department of the Surgeon General, says in a conversation with a newsroom that this can be attributed to an error in the electronic registration form.
If people fill out the registration form in English is not a requirement to include an ID number as is in the Icelandic version.
Since it was primarily thought for foreign tourists.
Therefore, the person has not received an automatic invitation to enter sampling.
However, Kamilla says many people have followed the return gateway rules although they have filled the registration form in English, and in some cases employers have also been vigilant to send people to sampling again after they arrived in the country.
“This will be examined this week how people's access to this can be facilitated to draw their attention to the process.”
The man is in isolation and six have been quarantined.
They all go for sampling, but the two had begun to show symptoms.
Infection traction is now underway the three infections identified yesterday, but it is largely completed due to two infections reported on Friday.
In both cases, the sequencing of Icelandic genetic analysis has revealed that there are variations of the coronavirus that have not been found here before.
In the second case, the ties have focused on Israel although it is known that the person who moved the virus to the country had also traveled to other European countries.
Kamilla says it should lie tomorrow where the other virus was coming from.
In total there are now 15 in isolation according to COVID's site.
135 are quarantined.
Four of the Five Infections Disconnected
Five domestic infections have been identified in Iceland in recent days.
Of these, four are completely unrelated and have not found the origin of the infection that came up at the Rey Cup sporting event yesterday.
The transmission of infection is still current.
Initially, on the third dog were exceptionally quarantined, which were reduced to sixteen.
Overall, 34 are quarantined for those new infections diagnosed yesterday.
This is the second time in a short time that infection is detected at a sporting event and has raised questions about whether to hold such events.
Johann K. Jóhannsson, Communications Officer at the Ric Police Public Protection Department, says it well slowly, as long as people follow norms and rules.
“We are constantly urgent for all those who live here that individual infection needs to be sustained.
We also need to be urgent for people who are holding events that there are certain rules going on that need to comply.
Then you can hold events,” Johann says.
He says that infection can be prevented by keeping on-air individual infectious protection.
In addition, rules and norms are in constant review.
“What needs to be done, and what the Public Protection Department and Surgeon General are constantly imperative to people, is to consider these individual pathogens.
Both homesfor and also with service companies.
That people wash their hands and use a burst.
It prevents infection from going forward,” Johann says.
“We need to be urgent for people to continue on the good road we were on, in order to be able to sustain the results we have so far achieved.”
40% of COVID-19 victims had diabetes 2
Devon Brumfield heard on walked phone how hard her father had to catch his breath.
Her father had diabetes and she therefore encouraged him to seek medical help.
The next day he was dead.
The death was attributed to sudden breathing difficulties due to coronaviruses infection.
Diabetes was indicated on the death certificate as the underlying difficulty and is Brumfield, who is also diabetic, terrified that the same should go for himself.
The Reuters news provider says Brumfield's fear not without reason.
The figures of a new study made by US authorities show that almost 40% of those who were dead with diabetes 2 as the underlying disease.
When the percentage of those who had not reached the age of 65, the rate rises to half.
A study by the U.S. Quarantine Control (CDC) included more than 10,000 people in 15 states who died from the coronavirus during the period from February to May.
Jonathan Wortham, an infectious disease expert at the CDC, says the results are striking, not what least for those diagnosed with diabetes 2 and their loved ones.
Was hidden in the slow growth Reuters had to conduct a survey and point the answers from the 12 states responding to comparable ratios.
10 states, among which are California, Arizona and Colombia, are not yet to be distinguished from underlying diseases.
“Diabetes was already an epidemic of slow growth.
Right now COVID—19 has come through like a dynamic age,” Reuters by Elbert Huang, CEO of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago.
Diabetes is more common among black and people of South American origin, which has also gone worse out of the coronavirus.
One of the best protections for those with Diabetes 2 is to keep the disease under control with fitness, healthy diet, and healthcare professional assistance.
However, the coronavirus epidemic has made many difficult incidents to keep routine.
Then the high price of insulin has forced some to continue attending their work and thereby stop being exposed to the virus.
Reuters notes that US authorities were allowed to be aware of the dangers that those with diabetes 2 could be caused by the virus.
As the SARS coronavirus progressed in 2003, there were more than 20% of those with the disease and the swine flu epidemic in 2009, this group was at three times higher risk of having to hospitals.
When MERS made this notice in 2012, one study demonstrated that 60% of those who died or were subjected to intensive care were diabetic.
Charles S. Dela Cruz scientist at Yale University says that because the impact of the COVID-19 virus could longer then the epidemic has deprived the veil of a number of unprecedented complications.
“I fear we will see a tsunami of problems when this is done,” says President Andrew Bolton of the International Diabetic Association.
Doctors have warned that the coronavirus epidemic may indirectly lead to an increase in diabetic complications, including kidney disease and kidney chromatography.
Likewise, new studies direct the coronavirus to lead to the increase in the number of diabetic cases.
Reuters says scientists are trying to understand the relationship between the coronavirus and diabetes 2.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs and kidneys, organs that are already sick in many people who have diabetes mellitus.
Then a high percentage of glucose and lipids in diabetics can produce a true “cytolic form”, as it is called when the immune system reacts too hard and attacks the body.
Damaged endothelial cells can also lead to inflammatory proliferation which in turn can cause fatal blood clots.
“It's all one big puzzle,” Dela Cruz says.
“This relates to everything internally.”
The news has been corrected.
“We were invited to champagne, so they left the room”
The couple Ásrún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason had the unusual appeal from artist Ragnari Kjartansson to have sex in front of a camera for works that the artist was setting up in Paris.
“We loved each other so it wasn't complicated.”
Atli Bollason never forgets it when he met his wife and grandmother, Ásrún Magnúsdóttir, for the first time.
“I was very fascinated by her.
It was naturally just the radiance, but it also seemed to me quite inaudibly sweet.
And still feels,” he says.
Ásrún also remembers this, as the husband recalls the first meeting regularly.
“I'm always hearing this story.
Last just this weekend,” she says who was also attracted to her husband at first acquaintance.
“I felt and feel so much excitement around Atla, which I like.
There's a lot going on and a lot going on and I was fascinated by it.”
Atli says that the couple have focused on it in their relationship to go their own ways.
“We don't tie our bales the same knots as fellow travelers.
We avoid the routine that we analyze around us.”
It is possible why they took the talk from Ragnari Kjartansson's visual artist just rejoicing, although it was the least unusual.
“Kristín Anna our shared friend contacts us and asks if we can come to eat a desert with him, Ragga and Ingibjörga's wife, at Snaps.”
They took the invitation, met the triad at Snaps, and received a desertwine and each dessert.
They obeyed Ragnar, which led them through their plans to set up at Palais de Tokyo in Paris in the fall.
“He had a multi-graded video piece called Scenes from western culture.
He described it in a simple way.”
Ásrún says that he described the work as banal and dekadent scenes from the everyday life of Vesturlanders.
“He had sketches of all the scenes he was going to shoot, and most recently he told us about what he wanted to know if we were interested in joining.”
The scene Ragnar asked the couple to participate in was to show young middle class couples to love in a minimalist room.
“These are intercourse with the beginning and the end,” Atli says.
The couple didn't know much even though they knew of him and he of them” but they knew us and felt fit in this.
They had a word that they did not want to advertise by people.
Perhaps they thought they would not get the right people but people who would get sexual masturbation from performating for others.”
They greeted Ragnar and agreed to think the matter, but it did not take long.
“When we got out of Snaps, we said, Don't we just exist for this?
It was just that way.
I trust Ragnari as an artist and his entire team,” says Ásrún and Atli takes hold.
“It's about love and intimacy”
The scene was taken up in a finer apartment on Mýrarstreet.
There was a very polished film team; a shooting artist, Ragnar and a soundman and the couple.
After the recording was switched on, everyone left the room to wait outside in a car except Atli and Ásrún.
“We weren't deciding anything how we should be.
We got some little instructions but we tried to forget about the moment and place.
Being unaware of what we were doing and for whom.
There was nothing played, we just loved each other so it wasn't complicated,” says Ásrún.
But was this romantic?
“Yes, it was a little romantic,” says Atli, and Ásrún agrees with it.
“We were offered champagne before they went out of the room.
It was a little like being on vacation at a fine hotel in Paris.”
The team was satisfied with the performance of the couple in the work that moved with them.
“When Tommi shooting looked at this, he wept, he thought it was so beautiful,” says Atli.
“It's just as much about love as intimacy as the intercourse itself,” says Ásrún.
The couple's parents have seen the work and tells Atli that his mom heard the voice in the son at the Reykjavík Art Museum and then realized that he was part of the work.
“Then she turned her back, and goes to think about this,” says Atli.
“Mom and Dad saw this in Paris.
We had not told anyone this way but then just dad sends me a message and says: It's nice to come across a small family in Palais de Tokyo, “Ásrún recalls.
And would the part of the work have deepened the relationship between Ásrún and Atla?
“We are at least still together so maybe it deepened something.
This at least deepened my relationship with the father-in-law,” says Ásrún and laughs.
Ásrún saw the work in Copenhagen with his colleague.
“I felt a little hard not to be with you but someone else,” she says, turning to the husband.
“But it was nice to see this because it's just one scene in a much bigger piece, and when you saw this with the other pieces, it's really cool.
I could break myself away from this and was just proud.
And there was a little pea in my stomach,” says Ásrún, who was pregnant with another couple's child when the scene was recorded.
“It was just beautiful.”
Anna Marsibil Clausen talked with Ásrún and Atla in Love stories on Ráuna 1.
Swansea with a win in the previous semi-final
Swansea won a 1—0 win at Brentford in a dramatic game.
It was the first game of the teams in the semi-finals of the qualifier to get up to the Premier League.
The game took place at the home of Swansea in Wales.
The position in half was 0—0.
Swansea's locals received a penalty in the 64th minute, while Andre Ayew reacted the arcuate from the penalty point and made a defend.
Only two minutes later, Brentford player Rico Henry received a red card.
Brentford therefore played the rest of the game man fewer, and in the 82nd minute Swansea players took advantage of the team difference.
Andre Ayew then added up the penalty club by scoring a great goal and guaranteed a Swansea 1—0 victory.
Swansea leads 1—0 in the duel, while the second game takes place next Wednesday at Brentford's home.
Ambassador for five years from 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, American ambassador in Iceland, is in the spotlight of media after CBS reported this morning that he wanted an armed bodyguard as he feared for his life.
However, it has not gone without perseverance for the President of the United States to appoint an ambassador in this country.
Since Carol Van Voorst left the office of the United States Ambassador at the end of April 2009, the country has been a total ambassador for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst left office in peculiar conditions, but Spotlight reported in 2009 that she should have been given the Aphal word.
On the way to a farewell meeting with the President of Iceland, she received a call from the Presidential Office that she would not be honoured to the word.
After she disappeared from Iceland, she taught international relations with Army War College.
Sixteen months passed until Van Voorst's successor came to work, in September 2010.
It can to some extent be attributed to the fact that Robert S. Connan had been appointed as an ambassador but so canceled.
During the job, Loius Ariega had then worked in the Foreign Service for the decades.
He then retired in the fall of 2013 and took office ambassador in Guatemala.
Then we took another ambassadors period.
Robert Barber received the approval of the United States Congress in January 2015 and came into operation shortly after which no ambassador had been on site for 13 months.
Barber was politically appointed, not diplomat, but rather he had served as an attorney and a short election fund of Baracks Obama.
He retired as soon as Donald Trump took over the presidency, January 20, 2017, as is customary with a politically appointed ambassador.
Trump administration was unusually appointing both ambassadors and high set officials in the Washington government system.
Therefore, two years passed until the United States Congress invited Jeffrey Ross Gunter to ask him the spears and confirm after the end as an ambassador in Iceland.
In his testimony at the Thing, he said he had never come to Iceland, but often to Western Europe, but his wife, who is dead, had been violated by a Dutch rock.
Gunter is politically appointed, used to be a California dermatologist and has been prominent in the Jewish Republican Party, the Republican Jewish Coalition.
The casino owner Sheldon Adelson created that organization, but Adelson is an enthusiastic supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to work in Iceland in May 2019, but there had been no ambassador in Iceland since early 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest examples of Iceland.
The reason is both how long Trump's command was to appoint people to a key office as well as that in recent years the US Congress's work has been greatly attracted, including confirming the ambassador in office.
Since 2009, the aggregate has been free of ambassadors in Iceland for over five years.
However, it has not prevented construction by the Embassy that recently opened headquarters at Engjateig.
The construction is believed to have cost about 6.5 billion while knee-thick safety walls surround the building, and bulletproof glass is in all windows.
However, it does not seem to have sufficient to fill the current ambassador of security because he is said to fear for his life and has wished to get an armed bodyguard.
Former ÍBV player suffered racism in Iceland - “It was a mistake to come to Iceland”
Tonny Mawejje, former ÍBV player, says he has suffered racism when he was in Iceland and that he regrets his coming to Iceland.
This is stated in an interview with Tonny who appeared on the Uganda medium Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined the team Uganda Police FC who plays in the top division of Uganda.
During the Daily Monitor, Tonny talks about many things, including his time in Iceland, playing with ÍBV, Val and Vigur in Iceland.
“When I came to Iceland, I didn't play in the middle as I used to play.
The team captain was in that position, but in addition he also had the shirt number I wanted so I got neither of what I wanted,” says Tonny, he played on the right side of the season with ÍBV.
Among Tonny's talk is racism he suffered in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players suffer when playing in Europe.
“It once happened to me but since I didn't understand the language, I just ignored what was said to me.
Later, I then heard of the matter and then I asked my friend what the matter was about.
He then told me that my opponent had a racist comment on me after I tackled him.”
In 2014, Tonny went from Iceland to Norway, where he joined Haugesund.
There he says he has made the mistakes he sees the most.
Tonny had not managed to get to the start team at Haugesund, but he wanted to play more to get to the national team.
Then he asked to return to Iceland on a loan, but he joined Val.
“It was a mistake to come to Iceland again on the loan.
I think if I had been longer in Norway I would have had the opportunity I wanted,” says Tonny, but he hoped if he was playing well in Norway, he probably would get further.
He wants to mean that the loan to Iceland has made his dreams of getting into a big team in Europe.
Found a worm in a woman's throat
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3,8 centimeter long black worm in the yoghurl of a woman who searched there.
Doctors managed to pull out the worm with tongs.
A study revealed that parasites were involved.
CNN reports this.
The woman had a few days before eaten sashimi, which are thin slices of meat.
The woman quickly recovered after the worm was removed, but parasites such as this are often found in raw meat or fish.
After sushi paved into the West, cases where parasites have passed into people have increased, according to CNN.
Fear that another wave is starting in Europe
Spain is now in focus on concerns about the second wave of the coronavirus in Europe, where governments have taken action to restrain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.
In Catalonia, all entertainment life has been put on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona where infections are increasing.
Other European countries have also taken action for the increase in infection in Spain, but in the UK everyone has to quarantine on their return from Spain, as in Norway, and French have been warned about traveling to Spain.
Infection is also increasing again in France and Germany, where the government is trying to find a balance of curbing the spread of the virus and launching the economy.
However, the situation in Europe is good compared to the rest of the world, with the global incidence rate approaching 300 thousand per day, which counts the most infections in America and South Asia.
The confirmed infection has reached 16 million globally, according to the count of Johns Hopkins University, and deaths confirmed to relate to the virus have reached 644 thousand.
Mosaic works Performed finally able to enjoy themselves to the fulfillment
In front of the Tollhúsið in Reykjavík there is a large and deep pit.
Above it there are men with orange helmets.
There is also a large digging.
And more smaller heavy machinery.
The street is closed for traffic.
But the pavement is capable, and there many people stop and respect for themselves artworks from millions of mosaic tiles — like they never saw it before.
Perhaps they have never seen it before.
At least did not respect it for themselves.
The work has so far been somewhat hidden, directly in front of there were parking spaces that were always surround.
People parked there, locked the car in a hotfix, and then jumped off to carry out their business in the city center.
“Lively and varied public spaces” and “attractive city braces” are a guiding light during the reproduction of the Tryggvagata.
The goal is to beautify the area and allow the mosaic works of Gðurgadottir at Tollhúsið to enjoy a better view.
In front of the work there will be a square and where the area lies well by the sun, it is considered to be suitable as a resort for pedestrians.
The artwork will be lit up and will now be able to enjoy the material better than before on these 142 square meters surfaces.
In the area there will also be small “fog sprays”, a kind of water sculptures, which offer a game and give the region a certain mystery.
In this way, the improvements are described by the City of Reykjavík which is being implemented together with Veitur.
Piping water supply, hot water supply and electrical supply will be renewed.
Many of them have come to their years, with sewage and cold water pipes since 1925 and have therefore served residents and businesses in the center for almost a century.
Once the street is reopened after construction, cars can drive it back.
However, it becomes a one-way review, and at the same time creates a more quiet and accessible space for walking.
In an information about the Tollhúsið on the Customs website, it says that the house was put into operation in 1971, but its architect was Gísli Halldórsson.
Because the port area reached through the house was formed there 250 square meters of windowless wall area out to the street.
The construction committee and architect agreed that such a facet would adversely affect the overall street image, if no special measures were taken to adorn the appearance of the house.
The parties therefore agreed to expect by having set up a permanent work of art.
At this time, a great word of Gvar Helgadóttir said in the summary.
She had worked extensively on mosaic works in Germany and beyond.
The AID was to first contact it before deciding whether a competition for the work would be created.
It had often been discussed that the work had to mirror life at the harbor, as the harbour had been dead since it was done.
When talking to the artist, she had to trax the intricate of such work.
It was agreed that she would receive drawings and other assistance before leaving her country, where she would work on the proposals abroad.
She got the time she decided for herself, and when she returned home she made some suggestions for discussion.
It was agreed without delay to ask her to do the job.
It was also requested to conclude a complete agreement with her and the famous artwork company in Germany, Brothers Oidtmann, but Svar had long worked with them to set up famous works of art throughout Europe.
Contracts began and Gerda worked on the artwork under the installation of the workshop of the brothers, who then saw the installation at the Tollhúsið.
All of the work was exceptionally well resolved, both by Manti Helgadóttir and Oidtmannbrothers, said in the summary.
It has ever since passed the harsh Icelandic weather conditions.
It took about two years to do the work, which was done and installed in the years 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after the Customs House was completed, only 47 years old.
Prepares the transfer of more agencies to land
Minister Ásmundur Einar Daðason of Social Affairs proclaims that more public institutions will be exported to land in the near future.
This said the minister in the episode of Sprengisandi during the lunch.
Recently, the fire department of the Housing and Civil Engineering Agency was announced to be moved north to Sauðárkrókur in the autumn.
Six fire experts work at the Agency, but none of them intends to follow the Agency north and the National Association of Fire and Ambulance professionals criticize the migrants.
“I think we are to take further steps into this being.
I am preparing further steps to this creature.
Further transport,” said Ásmundur.
He claims convinced that the vast majority of the population want to see a greater distribution of public institutions throughout the country.
“I think it needs to be made further political decisions about the transfer of public jobs to land, as I was doing with the Housing and Civil Works Institute,” said Ásmundur, but he also took the example of other institutions that have been exported and made a great difference to communities outside the country, such as relocation of the Food and Drug Administration to Selfoss, Surveying Iceland to Akranes and unemployment insurance in Skagaströnd.
All the main from the second day of the Championship
94. The Icelandic Championship in Free Sports ended at Þórsvellir in Akureyri today.
A few protests were placed on the second day of competition.
An exciting competition was expected in a women's ventricle throw at Þórsvellir, and Vigdís Jónsdóttir from FH put Íslandsmet in a ventricle throw in 2014, which stood up until Elísabet Rúnarsdóttir from ÍR added the record in May last year.
Vigdís won the Icelandic smet back earlier this summer and has been in a fanciful last, but she has refined the Icelandic smet in the summer.
Elizabeth Rut has been struggling with injuries and not recovered today.
She had only one valid throw of five, threw 25,69 meters, which is far from her best.
Vigdís threw the farthest of all today, or 60,08 meters in her last attempt and at the same time put a protest.
Her Icelandic smet was 62,69 meters in July, and she was still quite a bit from it.
Guðrún Karítas Hallgrímsdóttir from Iceland had the second best throw of the day, but she improved her best performance with a throw of 50,18 meters.
In the male class, FH-man Hilmar Örn Jónsson, Iceland Champion in a ventricle, won a safe victory, but he threw 73,84 meters in his next last throw and set a protest.
His Icelandic smet in the industry is 75.26 meters.
Guðni Valur Guðnason, Olympian and Icelandic Championship in the round throw, won a competition in a ball cast at Þórsvellir yesterday, but today he competed in a round throw which is his main branch.
Guðna Val's Icelandic smet is 65,53 meters, but he threw the longest 59,13 meters today and guaranteed the victory.
Valdimar Hjalti Foreign son threw the second longest today, but he had one valid throw that was sufficient in the 2nd place, 49,43 meters.
Hafdís Sigurðardóttir, Iceland champion in a long jump, won the long jump competition with excellence, while Hafdís jumped for the longest 6,25 meters today, which is less than 40 cm from her foot.
In a 200 meter women's run it was Irin Guðbjörg Jóni Bjarnadóttir, which was the fastest but she came to mark in 24,04 seconds.
Guðbjörg Jóna was victorious in Akureyri, but she won two gold medals yesterday, in a 100 meter race and in 4 x 100 meter race and then also in a 4 x 400 meter race today.
In men's class Kolbeinn Höður Gunnarsson from FH was first in a 200 meter race in 21,57 seconds, 0,3 seconds before Oliver Már Samúelsson from Ármann.
Like Gudbjörg Jóna, Kolbeinn Höður won gold in the 100 meters yesterday, and in the 400 meters race.
Does not receive a fine for ISK 27 million Bitcoin-harvesting
The super-tax committee has rejected the claim of a tax officer who demanded a fine over a person for delinquency of their capital income that was generated as a result of the sale of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
The committee concludes that the tax inspector had not made clear arguments for why it was necessary to fined the person.
The Decree of the Committee states that the tax inspector believed that the person has places of substantively incorrect tax returns for the income years 2016 and 2017.
He would have deducted his financial income resulting from the sale of Bitcoin of 27 million cryptocurrency, either intentionally or from a marvelous lack of regret.
Fines bowed man for his conduct.
The man rejected it in a letter to the committee.
However, he began to have sold cryptocurrency for 27 million.
He would have acquired a burial between 2009 and 2010 when it would have been both easy and unobstructed with a regular home computer.
Then he noted that when he sold the cryptocurrencies, the taxation for such sale would have been significantly ambiguous and unpredictable.
It would have been possible to expect general citizens to realize such measures on tax return.
He would not have intended to avoid paying tax on the harvest and would have accounted for his property on a tax return as a deposit on a foreign exchange account.
He would have inquired at both connoisseurs and Revenue Officers about how this was done but without success.
Then he believed that he had to be taken into account that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he began digging for Bitcoin.
He would therefore have been in a worse position than others to study the complex rules that the tax authorities would not have formed a clear view.
The man therefore considered correct that his taxes for these two years of income would be redetermined and stressed, but otherwise not punished.
Then he reiterated that he worked in Iceland and had paid taxes in Iceland since 2012.
He would never have intended to abstinate his duties with undue means.
The claim for guilt would be out of all moderation and would plunge it into debt.
Brynjólfur raises a mention: “This man understands what football is”
Brynjólfur Andersen Willumsson has been quite a bit between the teeth on people, but also impressed because of its progress with Breiðablik in the Pepsi Max League.
Flashes will be on the fireline tonight as they receive ÍA live on Station 2 Sport.
Brynjólfur then takes out a playban due to four reminders of the season and does not attend play with a new haircut as in summer games so far.
He had written “blah, blah, blah” on his own before the match at HK last Thursday, which HK won 1—0.
“I don't know who exactly he was answering with the payment, but talking about character then this one was rather better trying in the game.
He did not go hiding.
He wants to get the ball every single time and if there was someone going to match this game, I thought he would do it or create it,” said Guðmundur Benediktsson in the Pepsi Max stands, when thought he arrived at Brynjólfur.
“I'm supposed to be here for the people.”
“It is difficult sometimes to realize it in what position he is.
He searches out a little on the left side when it starts to pass the matches, but he has a very free rolle on the team,” Hjörvar Hafliðason said.
Þorkell Már Pétursson tells Brynjólf a real entertainer and welcomes to get such a colorful man in the league: “No one shares that this is a character.
This is a fun typ and I love this with my hair, and to be always ready to meet and answer in interviews.
There is an incredible amount of people occupied by him, who tells me that this man understands about what football is.
“I'm entertained.
I'm supposed to be here for the people and enjoy it.”
People are reading the interviews with Brynjólf, people are paying in and watching what's next on his hair.
This man is just a genius,” Már said.
Player KR says he wants to leave the club - “I have been in contact with several teams in the B League”
Tobias Thomsen, a KR player in the Pepsi Max-league, seems to be on the move from the team.
According to the Danish medium Bold, Tobias is ready to return home to Denmark.
Football.net also reported the case.
Tobias wants to get the start of the period in their country of residence, but for this he must first terminate his agreement with KR, where the Danish league starts before that Icelandic odds.
The company knows I miss Denmark and has shown me a great understanding,” Tobias said in a conversation with Bold.
“I have been in contact with several teams in the B League and will probably switch over before the Icelandic season ends.
There are not many teams in Denmark that can afford to pay up my contract with KR.”
He says he probably needs to take on a pay cut in Denmark.
“Organizations in Denmark have probably felt more of the economic impact of the virus than in Iceland.”
Bicycle Whisper Bjelmar has recovered bikes for millions - now responds for themselves after coverage DV
For over a year Björmar Leósson has had a hobby unlike most others.
He thighs up and saves lost and stolen bicycles, electric bikes and scooters.
Has Bjelmar earned the name “The Bike Whisper” as a result.
Yesterday there was a considerable adage when you published a narrative of his relations with Björmar.
DV then referred to discussions on the Facebook group of Vesturbymen stating that Bjestmar had taken the man to talk at Austurvellir and said the scooter could possibly be stolen.
It was not possible to read from the original writings of the electric shuttle, but that Bjartmar had thieved him.
That text has now been edited to Facebook and the headline of the original news DV updated accordingly.
Bjelmar says the original news of the matter at all not illustrative of what really walked yesterday in Austurvellir.
Bjets said they had information from the victim of an electric shuttle bus stop that these were truly their electric shuttle.
That information received an alleged owner from others, but the information turned out to be false says Bjartmar.
“I saw the guy and I knew the shuttle, provided with information that there was an electric shuttle that had been missing for a very long time and had been searched for.
I certainly hesitated first, but when I saw him preparing to drive off on the shuttle, I decide to punch to talk with the man.
The owner was sure in his fault, so I decided to have a conversation with the man.
In general, I go very fine into such a matter, but before I managed to finish what I had to say, the man had taken away from me the word.”
Bjelmar says that the man on the electric shuttle has also invited him to show him the receipt for the wheel and has called the police himself.
“Yes, cool,” said Brightly, “just get it clean.”
Then the owner of the electric shuttle proved ownership of his electric shuttle and drove off.
Later, the right owner of the electric shuttle told his story on Facebook, as reported in a previous news article.
In this past year Bjelmar has been doing this practice he says he can count the times he hit the edge with people on the fingers of one hand.
“I have had peaceful relations with Reykjavík's most difficult men,” said Bjmar, pointing out that bicycle thieves are by far the least brothers and sisters of society, addicts, mentally disabled people and other people who are in the street.
“Addiction is a hard master and somehow needs to fund the next dose, unfortunately, theft of such liquidity is an easy way to the goal,” Bjestmar says.
“My interaction with these people is really so good that I have brought a lot of good people with me.
There are cases that people have been treated and taken on and then approached me and assisted me with what I'm doing,” he says.
In general, Bjelmars's interaction with bicycles is on polite lines.
Some know of him and what he is doing and offer peacefully to show him receipts, the position number of reels and so on.
Bicycle theft is a major problem with which little has been covered.
Furthermore, Bjams says that the police are even pointing people to talk to him out of stolen bicycles.
Brighmar is unhappy with previous DV news coverage and doesn't claim to be some kind of self-made police in a personal search for justice.
When asked if he is still not slippery ice with his act, and whether this is not the main role of the police, Bjestmar says so certainly.
“Of course, the cops have to do this, but the fact of the matter is that the cop is simply not conducting this.
I have for example watched police officers running away from a large heap of stolen wheels.
She is clean out said turnowless in these matters.”
“When the cop is not doing anything about this, and this is just in front of your nose, and experience has shown that I can succeed in this case category, then why not?” asks optimists.
He says he has made such great success in having on stolen wheels, that sometimes he collides with his “clients” on the street that they just got the brighter wheels they had previously recovered.
The time Bjestmar has called for police assistance has occurred that she simply does not attend.
“This is just not working with the police, and it's not my fault and it's not the owners of the bicycles to blame,” said Brighmar, and it feels sorry that victims of bicycle theft need to suffer the emptiness of the police in this party.
About the success of Bjartmars is not shared.
Many stories of people can be found thanks brighter for recovering their wealth.
Himself says Bjelmar had long lost the number on the number of bicycles he has returned, but the amount won by millions, if not millions.
Weighing there electric platforms, electric bikes and electric shuttles heavily, but electric bikes can cost up under half a million.
Bjartmar works every day in kindergarten and every other weekend he works in a symbiotic building.
His bike search is therefore unpaid work he performs in his spare time.
Pension funds and long shadows
In 2019, there was a great anniversary year in the history of pension funds in Iceland.
Officials had admittedly received retirement from the king of Danak all the streets from the 19th century, but in 1919 the pension fund of officials was formed, which eventually became a pension fund of all public servants.
The basis for the current pension funds of general workers was then laid with the general collective labor agreements in 1969, which provided for employment pension funds with compulsory membership and a full-fledged fund collection from the beginning of 1970.
In 1974, laws were then enacted on the basis of these agreements, and the pension system continued to intensify thereafter.
The wage pension system was not the only radical change that the 20th century labor movement propelled by its core struggle.
Unemployment insurance had been obtained similarly in the historic strike conflict in 1955, and also the organization gradually progressed its sickness and health fund requirements, significant leave rights, shortening of working time, housing reforms and more such as much exchange.
All these rights cost a great and strict struggle but were found in retrospect, a much greater and more lasting nuclear benefit than the increase in the amount of aura in the pay envelope, which disappeared even in the hite inflation which characterised the post-war period until 1990 as many remember.
The anticipation of the creation of general pension funds in 1969 was both long and complicated.
While one would eventually agree that the funds would be in practice the property of a fund member, the labor movement had to agree that their boards should be appointed to representatives of employers and fund members alike.
In the coming years after the founding of the funds, the requirement for the majority of workers in the board of the funds often came to a discussion in the employees' organisations, but it never managed to join, so we still remain up with an unreasonable arrangement that fund representatives are not in the majority on the board of the funds.
Article 36 of the Act No. 129/1997 on the compulsory pension insurance and the activities of pension funds are discussed on the investment policy of the funds.
It states in paragraph 1 that “Pension Fund shall be guided by the interests of fund members.”
Also, paragraph 5 says: “Pension Fund shall set a moral standard in investment.”
The Shareholders' Policy of the Pension Fund of Commerce includes the following provisions, following the aforementioned legal provisions:
The Pension Fund is a member of the UN PRI rules on responsible investments, along with many of the largest pension funds and institutional investors in the west and in Europe.
The Rules discuss how a focus on environmental and social issues as well as good corporate governance can contribute to improved mutual portfolio investment results.
Thus, the interests of investors and the objectives of society are combined in a broader context.
LV considers it important that companies, especially those listed on the stock market, set themselves public policies on: to maintain good governance of remuneration of social responsibility and environmental issues.
The Pension Fund Value, which has the largest funds of the country, has set itself a “policy of responsible investment” and there are provisions of a similar nature.
This is all recalled here as an entrance to the latest Icelandic fashion word, “shadow management”.
Since the word is new in the case, it is not hope that it has been fully defined, but it seems to me that the following definition is now “the most taken”: Shadow management is when a union leader says in the media that he plans to send representatives of the company to the Board of Pension Fund Recommendations or instructed how to take a stand in a particular case.
If they do not follow the recommendations, they will be disfellowshipped from the board at the first suitability.
If the lead does not take this to the media and does not speak of dismissal, however, it is not “shadow management” as such communication between humans is of course past in the financial world as elsewhere.
I let the reader meditating on which way he feels “shady.”
There are, in particular, two people who have tried to formulate this definition at the time of writing, on the morning of Saturday 25 July 2020.
There are those journalist Hörður Ægisson and Governor Ásgeir Jónsson.
The occasion for both arose after Icelandair CEO Bogi Nils Bogason had told about his intention to terminate the company agreements with flight attendants and airline officers (terminate them), and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairman of the Reykjavík Store Association, sent out those recommendations to representatives of the company in the Board of Directors of the Pension Fund of Traders not to support the possible acquisition of the Fund of shares in the Company, otherwise they should be disfellowshipped.
A little later, Bogi Nils withdrew his decision and subsequently Ragnar Thor went the same way with his recommendations, which were of course aimed at Boka's decision.
Nevertheless, they saw Hörður and Ásgeir reason to plurality on the matter in the Friday newspaper of Fréablaðið in big words about shadow management, violations and the rich need for changes in law.
There was a small piece of wood, even though the blessed thiab had been in a way of attachment and was swiftly wiped out.
Since the issue is important, let's consider the material itself in the end.
I stacked above the points in the Pension Fund Act pertaining to this issue.
This means that the fund managers are responsible for the interests of fund members and have ethical standards in investment, and these points are elaborated in more detail in the articles of both Gildis and the Pension Fund of Merchants as I mentioned.
However, pension funds should NOT look solely to short-term dividends considerations in their investments.
This would be a very dangerous policy and do not have to look for examples of such things in the past, as large lending banks and funds have flowed to unethical adventurers and environmental disasters, with disastrous consequences.
The CEO of Icelandair was obviously on slippery ice when he thought to wipe out a whole group of employees, thus significantly reducing the goodwill that the company has enjoyed in the Icelandic market and weakening its position against investors.
Fortunately, he saw and pulled this back.
Time reveals whether it is sufficient for the investment of pension funds in the company to be held liable to the fund members at the time of up.

One of the infected ones did not have a reportage
One of the three diagnosed with Covid-19 in the country yesterday came to the country from the Baltic States on July 15, about one and a half weeks ago.
He is an Icelander who does not live here at a standard and therefore did not receive clear instructions to have the so-called return approach after arriving in Iceland and going for another sampling a few days after arriving.
He got negative from screening with the border.
“But he is in Icelandic society and is really supposed to go to that resort,” says Kamilla Jósepsdóttir, a quarantine expert at the Surgeon and deputy quarantine doctor while he is on summer vacation, in a conversation with today's Fresablaðið.
“He used the English registration form and there is no obligation to register the ID number and if the social security number is not registered, you are not automatically invited to the later sample.”
She says that the man was able to use the English registration form because he actually resides abroad, but because of his network in the country he should have used it in Icelandic.
However, he did not realize this.
“When the social security number is not registered, you need to pursue yourself to arrive in the second sampling.
Neither he nor his employer seem to have realized it was the right way,” Kamilla says.
“Thus, it is clear that we need to promote the information on this while we find some way to make an automatic preaching system even though the Icelanders do not list their ID number.
Or to make it somehow more obvious who are the participants of the Icelandic community in the registration system,” she explains.
Fortunately, however, the person encompassed a few upon arrival in Iceland although he is defined as a participant in the Icelandic community, is Icelander.
Only six have been quarantined after his diagnosis yesterday and these six were all in communion with him.
They are going to sampling, however, two of them have begun to show symptoms of Covid-19 infection.
The man got negative from his sampling at the border on July 15.
Kamilla says likely that he was recently infected with the virus that she had not yet been able to diagnose in him when the sample was taken at the border.
However, she does not want to rule out that the man has been infected here in Iceland, but does not carry the virus to the country.
“It is not quite possible to argue that this is indeed an imported infection because it is it long ago that he came to the country that he might have been exposed here like those two who have caused a little shorter in relation to the sporting event.”
However, she says that it is very unlikely because of the few people enveloped here.
“It's really very unlikely,” says Kamilla, but states that it can not be excluded until Icelandic genetic analysis has been sequencing the virus in man.
“If we get a virus that has not been seen here before, then it is almost safe that it has carried it to the country.”
Pepper spray and bombs applied against Protestants
To the conflict came between the police and protesters in Seattle at night.
Police deployed protesters piparsprey and undeadly grenades, while protesters broke the windows and lit.
45 protesters were arrested and 21 police officers were injured.
Police violence and racism were challenged across the United States last night, while Seattle protests were in support of Portland's Oregon state protesters.
In Austin in State of Texas, one protest was shot to death.
As stated at the BBC, the attacker has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands came together in peaceful protests.
A group of people then turned into a construction site and broke the windows in the city's courthouse.
Subsequently, the police protest said to be riots and to conflicts came between groups of protesters and police.
Claim Justice In Aurora, Colorado, Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old black man murdered by police in August last year, was remembered by protesters.
A car drove through a group of protesters in the city, but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of members of the National Guard came together claiming justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman murdered by police in their home last March.
The group carried firearms and joined camps at a closed intersection where police separated the group from a group of people who protested the protests and also carried firearms.
Then 75 were arrested in Omaha, Nebraska, where protesters remembered James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man murdered by a white bar owner in May.
Solskjær: Not the game that defines our season
Manchester United football manager Ole Gunnar Solskjær doesn't want to overdo the importance of the game to Leicester today during the Premier League final tour.
If United loses the game, and Chelsea do not lose against Wolves, end Solskjær and his men in 5th place and thereby lose the Champions League seat.
However, they should still hope to get to the Champions League by winning the European League next month.
“We have not arrived at the final stage.
If we reach points against Leicester, I think people will say that we have now not had a bad period,” Solskjær said.
“But whatever happens, this is not the end of our journey because we still have a lot to get the two teams above us,” Solskjær said.
It is clear that human nerves will be thawed at 15 pm today, but Solskjær tried to pretend each other game.
“If one wants to belong to Manchester United then one must get used to being under pressure in the last match of the season.
This is nothing new, and on this builds the company.
We have prepared a great opportunity to end the season well and now it is ours to take advantage of it,” said Solskjær.
“It's not the most important game of the season, it's just the next game.
You can ask anyone in football, the next game is always the most important.
The results do not define our period, we have already had many hours in which to define this period.”
“The arrival of Bruno Fernandes changed much for us, and I believe that an entire over we are in better form and much stronger spiritually than last season,” Solskjær said.
65,000 daily infections
65,490 new coronavirus infections were diagnosed in the United States yesterday, according to John Hopkins University.
In total, 4.178.021 infection has been confirmed to the west since the start of the epidemic there in the country.
900 died from the virus yesterday, while the last four days up to the virus were more than 1,000 in a day.
A total of 146.460 deaths from the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
CNN's news states that according to the United States epidemics, the number of deaths from the virus has reached 175,000 August 15.
Fear another wave of the epidemic
Spain governments are now trying weak could be withheld the increased spread of COVID—19 in the country.
Spanish health authorities reported over 920 new COVID—19 cases, both Thursday and Friday.
There, no more have been diagnosed in one day since the beginning of May, bringing the freckles at the same time when the Spaniards begin to lift one of the most stringent curfew in Europe.
The backlash led the British authorities to now oblige passengers coming from Spain to quarantine upon return.
A week before, Spain was on Britain's list of safe states.
The situation is the worst thing in Catalonia in northeastern Spain where governments have taken broader restrictions to try to stem the growth.
In the capital of Barcelona, places of entertainment will be closed for the next two weeks and waves will be made to close at midnight.
Then the curfew is now valid for 200 thousand residents of Segria County in western Catalonia.
It is believed that the British decision will negatively affect the Spanish economy, which relies heavily on the arrival of foreign tourists and is poorly accomplished after the epidemic.
Tui, the UK's largest travel agency, canceled all flights planned today to Spain and the Canary Islands.
Governments around the world are said to prepare for the second wave of the epidemic, but there seems to be little interest in resorting to an extensive curfew that has widely devastated the economy.
For example, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has taken very badly in such a thing and similar to a nuclear weapon he does not want to use.
Then French Prime Minister Jean Castex has said that the nation “would not come to life by, chemically or socially,” if a national curfew would be resorted to a national curfew.
Many councilors hope that local resources that reach residents of unique towns, cities or regions will be sufficient to keep the virus back to the next round if they arrive.
Five New Infections in Iceland - Three Domestic
Three domestic infections were detected yesterday as well as two in addition to the border.
Thus, five people with a positive Covid-19 infection identified yesterday in Iceland.
Public Protection announcement states that one of the infections is related to the infection reported yesterday at the ReyCup football tournament.
The one has been sent into isolation and sixteen who were in close communion with him in quarantine.
The person infected was involved in the social work of the sports club in Reykjavík and is according to the announcement, “only part of the sports team” in quarantine.
Others who were sent in quarantine relate to man differently.
The origin of this infection is undetected and full swing contagion by the National Commissioner's contagion team.
The ReYCup tournament tournament tournament holders have followed the guidelines and rules of the epidemiologist and public protection that are still in force and have appropriate measures taken.
However, yesterday photos of the tournament aroused as one could see in very close communion to celebrate their good exchange in the field.
Just before 11 p.m. today, modem executives published the following announcement on their Facebook page.
“NOTE: Parents please respect the rules for competitors to pick up their stuff for themselves at school.
Parents are NOT allowed to do so.
Thanks for your demonstrated understanding.”
Another infection was detected yesterday, but is associated with the reported infection last day.
The announcement says: “Icelandic genetic analysis has sequencing the infection and a new type of virus has not been identified here before.”
The transmission of contagion is carried out in that matter also and is the person infected in isolation and 12 in quarantine due to the infection.
The third infection in question is from a man who came to Iceland 11 days ago, 15 July.
He was diagnosed on the southwest corner of the country.
The person is now in isolation and six who were in close communion with him in quarantine.
Two of them are already beginning to show symptoms of a virus infection.
In addition, two identified at the border and are asked for the conclusion of further research such as borders procedures stipulate.
Finally, the announcement states: The Public Protection Department of the State Commissioner and the Secretary General of Surgeon's Office urgently for people to exercise caution and pay close attention to individual infectious agents.
If the slightest doubt as to the presence of symptoms of the Covid-19 virus, the same is asked to go sampling at the nearest clinic.
Patreksfjörður says the campsite booked through a shopping weekend - Direct guests
The camp site in Patreksfjörður is fully booked this weekend, according to the announcement of Western-based.
Guests are advised to explore other accommodation options.
Mentions Westerland Bíldudal, Tálknafjörður, Melanes in Rauðasandi, Hotel Fókalund and Hótel Breiðavík as other options in the position.
It is enough to stay in Patreksfjörður this weekend, as Skjaldborg, a festival of Icelandic documentary films will be held in town.
She has been held since 2007 and has become a strong tradition in town.
Of the attendance in the campsite to judge can be expected a good attendance this year, if the weather does not put a dash in account, but the DV said earlier today from a striking prediction.
However, one can expect the worst weather south, and hope for Patreksfjords.
The website bb.is first told, saying that all other accommodations in town were already fully booked.
Entire apartment building grotles down to the best location in the city
Romanian workers live for free at Dunhaga 18—20.
Meanwhile, owners are seeking construction permits for renovation, but their talk has been successful in the system for the third year.
In one of the oldest, graceful and most expensive neighborhoods in Reykjavík, a large apartment building stands on three floors.
On the ground floor of the building is about 600 square meters of commercial space
Behind the house there are doors of two stairwells, each of which holds four fairly glorious apartments.
They range from 93—130 square meters, though most over 100.
The house has a considerable history to store.
It was built in 1959 and has hosted video rental, Skóstuna, Dairy shop, Jóa Gun, Fish sale and last Háskólaprent.
The house has, so mild, remembered his fool more beautiful.
The house now underlies a lot of damage, as can be seen in the accompanying photos.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
Owners of D18 ehf. are according to the Register of Companies among other Magnús Magnússon and Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir.
Magnús went for Borgun's owner group and was the director of the holding company Borgun.
In a group of owners of Borgunar's holding company, Steelskip ehf.
Steelskip ehf. is an investment company Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir and her children.
Guðrún is also the owner of a third part in D18 ehf.
Guðrún and her husband, August Guðmundur Sigurðsson, once drove the ship Skelskip.
D18 ehf. bought the house in the summer of 2009 and therefore has little or nothing been maintained since then.
Neighbors say that the state of the house has deteriorated constantly since, although most in recent years.
On the inhabitants of the neighborhood, one resident says that the house was “not very lively in recent years”.
It may be played into that owners have been waiting for a few years to change the house and the plot.
Other neighbors say the house long not have been okay.
“It's long time to do something decent about this spot and boring that it has attracted like this.”
Furthermore, he says he is willing to the owners of the house for not having driven to finish this, finding some common surface with the house's neighbors and stopping this 'law stup'.
“Just do this in consultation with the surrounding community so that it can be hurry up and finished.”
The “Law App” that the population refers to is the planning process of the field that has been running at least since 2017.
Then the owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 attended after authorization to build a floor above the existing apartment building and behind the house, a new elevator house and an annex on one floor plus a basement.
The building permit granted for that implementation was appealed to the Decision Committee on Environmental and Resource Issues and repealed the Committee as the implementation did not take place in the sharing structure and the site presentation was not satisfactory.
The City of Reykjavík then started with a share planning work and completed it with an advertisement in the Official Gazette in July last year.
That organization was also pleasing and the committee dropping it in March 2020.
At this point, therefore, nearly three years had passed since the initial application for construction permits and the owners of the building at the initial stage.
The house had at this time drank down considerably and neighbors taken to tire.
When the DV asked the house's neighbors into the situation and the feedback of the neighbors, the answers were in various ways.
Some had an understanding of the intentions of the owners of the house, others not at all.
Others turned indignation to the city, others did not.
Others were just angry but nothing necessarily out of anyone.
Still others said the parking lots of hassle apples, but neighbors have utilized Dunhaga's unused parking space 18—20 under their vehicles.
One appellant in the case said he was long-tired of the administration:
“That let's have to go through the process three times is absolutely amazing.
It's as if the City of Reykjavik may not read.”
Today the house stands empty, abandoned and is neglected.
A memorial of the city's divergence and the noble intentions of the owner and the many years of work of those currently on the start stage.
When a journalist came to a garden on Dunhaga 18, it was open to doors and trash gaps.
Playstation computer and recent television were amid other rubbish on Earth — victims of Icelandic summer soak.
The old office of Háskólaprents and there was quite a lot of cats of the good smell to judge.
It is clear that someone has nested about themselves in one corner, but no one is visible.
Stacks of sofas and beds and a few pallets of geological pages, which were undoubtedly to become a book, were faced.
The stairwells of the apartment building were also open and alive in both of them.
The reporter was lucky enough to come across the inhabitants of another of them.
There were Romanians to boil a potato dish for dinner and invited a journalist in.
The Romanians work for the employee rental Ztrongforce ehf.
They have been there for some time and simulated DV sources that the company has nothing paid for the premises except heat and electricity.
Due to the condition of the house, it is not preliminary to charge rent.
From the places of mail in the foyer of the house, it is clear that there have been many foreign workers there in the past.
Employee rental operations have not been unprotected from the COVID-19 situation, as a drop in tourism led to a decline in the construction sector, and these two industries were the most efficient to take advantage of the services of staff rental.
Nevertheless, the members of the members at Dunhaga 18 seemed to have enough to do and hung the workbirds and mitts in the common area to dry after a long working day in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the miserable state of the house, the apartment that the boys shared seemed to be nicely maintained.
When a journalist greeted the boys Romanian, he suddenly became clear: At the best location in Reykjavík, 1,500 square meters of real estate is defiant.
The owners want to change the house to improve, and neighbors want to improve the situation while dispute about the definition of “improved”.
In between, the city's planning area sits at the initial stage, the victim of endless appeals and appeals in the planning process and the suspension of the Resolution Committee on Environmental and Resource Affairs.
In the house, Romanian workers live, perhaps precisely those who go into improving the situation, when the Icelanders cease to argue.
The article originally appeared in the weekend newspaper DV on July 17.
In an anti-overweight effort following the coronavirus epidemic
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson will provide a £10 million in a campaign against overweight, which will include a ban on fast food advertising, following his severely weakening, in part due to his weight.
Currently Johnson introduces the campaign, which has received the name Better Health, tomorrow, Monday, but with the campaign, doctors will be encouraged to prescribe cycling to their clients in overweight and will additionally be undertaken in an effort in the increase of cycling paths.
Then commercials of fast food on television will be banned by 21 a.m. in the evening, according to UK media sources.
“COVID—19 has raised us to the short and long-term risks of being overweight, and the Prime Minister is determined that we must use time to become healthier, more active, and eat healthier food,” is followed by government advocate.
Johnson himself has had weight problems, but he was admitted to intensive care when he was infected with the coronavirus in the spring, and it is partly his weight for which he is believed to have so seriously weakened.
Women better suited to lead the changes
She said the new Constitution is the biggest step the nation can take towards greater decentralization, transparency and in counteracting corruption and to the interests of the whole.
“We need to go changing gear a little now, and which is better suited to lead that kind of change than the group of society that is easier to stay in these values.
There are women,” Helga said.
“Women in Iceland are famous for their women's solidarity.
To stand together and be together in leading change.
So now it's just up to us to lead these changes.”
She said she was a little alarmed about the focus on Iceland as 'the best in the world' in both gender equality and human rights.
“Then we're not as willing to look at what needs to be done.
As the Germans are very aware of their history and examine all that needs to be done.
There is lots.
We need to know where we are coming from and know the story and listening.
Listen to the voices of marginalized groups.
We don't live on the same rules all here,” Helga said.
When asked, she said women are in many respects in Iceland, but added that, like many other places, Icelanders based on a rosy male value.
She said that politics turned to form about their own interests, domination and powers that were the forces that maintained inequalities in all societies.
“Women have now created this group and come together and have just become a little annoyed that Parliament is going to trekking to ignore this 2012 referendum,” she said.
“It's these feminine values that we're thinking this based on.
From human rights and nature protection, cooperation and that we all really sit at the same table,” she said, adding that the aforementioned values are the core values of the new Constitution.
“We are a very rich country of natural resources, and it's ridiculous that here are people living in poverty.
It's ridiculous, we can change differently,” Helga said.
“It is ridiculous that there is some law of nature that women's jobs are always lower paid.
It's ridiculous that flight attendants and nurses have to endlessly stand in a wage struggle just to achieve decent wages.”
The petition can be signed on the New Constitution here through electronic Iceland.
Tried to rob a pedestrian in the center
A man was arrested in the center of the night after threatening pedestrians and tried to catch money from him.
The police also stopped the production of drugs in Árbær, where two were arrested for the case.
Then the police stopped the driver of a motorcycle in the hillside where its driver was at a speed of 146 km, where the speed limit is 60 km/h.
Moreover, he had previously been deprived of driving rights.
Police in the metropolitan area had for enough to spin in the night and just over 80 cases were recorded in the police calendar from five yesterday to five in the morning.
There was particularly a lot of noise announcements due to their conformity.
On the night of Saturday, there were reports of eleven noisy parties and considered it much in the police calendar.
On the night, however, there were 22 noisy issues on the police board.
Six were saved in a prison cell at night.
In Ártown, police were called in the night when the parties shot fireworks on the air.
However, they were left when police officers were to park.
Then nine drivers were stopped for drunkenness and or drug driving.
Four were arrested for a central fights at night, one of them was saved in a prison cell.
Then two were moved to the emergency room after they fell on their face, one in the center of town and the other in Vesturtown.
One was taken to the emergency room after he was injured jumping on trampoline in Kopavogur.
In addition, police officers suspended the driver who pulled a caravan in Kjalarnes yesterday.
The trailer's bicycle gear, according to police diary, was in a “very bad condition”, and it was detained.
You can stay in Monet's House during the Shopping Weekend
The house, which the impressionist Claude Monet spent the last forty years of its practice, is now available for rent on the Airbnb site.
The next available nights in the house are on the shopping weekend.
The house is small and cute, located in the town of Givenry in Normandie, France.
The world-famous painter lived in the house since 1883 until he died in 1926.
The house has three bedrooms, two lounges and three bathrooms.
Monet first received inspiration to paint his famous gardens in this house.
If someone plans to rent the house, he must rent at least two nights.
Based on Airbnb's page, it's next vacant after a week, Sunday of the shopping weekend, so it might be ideal for some shopping malls on vacation to hurry to book the painter's house.
The two nights over the shopping weekend cost only 964 US dollars or just over 130 thousand Icelandic kronor as Fattablaðið gets next.
Dozens of quarantine and several of them have begun to show symptoms of the disease caused by the coronavirus
Five have been diagnosed with domestic coronavirus in the last three days, and most of the infected people are unrelated.
Dozens have been quarantined because of this, and several of them begin to show the symptoms of the disease caused by the virus.
Three were diagnosed with the coronavirus domestic yesterday and two at border screening.
An expert at the Surgeon General says that a growing number of domestic infections does not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading elsewhere to society.
“It has been sequencing from the previous domestic infection, and it is a virus that has not been seen here before, so we have no particular reason to think it has been staying in the community for some time.
This is probably something that has just arrived in the country, but of course we need to be very well alert right now,” said Kamilla Sigríður Jósefsdóttir, expert at the quarantine office of the Surgeon General.
Most of the infected people have been associated with individuals who came from abroad.
Further sampling takes place in the near future, but some people who were in communion with the infected have begun to show symptoms of the coronavirus.
“Right now, influenza is going on and less about other respiratory infections so we can be somewhat liberal about doing those tests on individuals who during the time of influenza would have found reason to do something else first,” Kamilla said.
Infection tracking is largely complete, but more people are not ruled out to quarantine.
Two of the infected were diagnosed after attending sporting events.
Has it raised questions whether it is interesting to hold such an event.
The Communications Officer of Public Protection says it well possible as long as people follow norms and rules.
Kamilla says almost excluded that the infected people have been infected during the sporting events.
“If there are no more people in isolation based on these individuals after dealing with them during these sporting events, we can argue that our quarantine of the tournaments has worked.
But it's not to be revealed,” Kamilla said.
The procedures of the public protection department are in constant revision.
“We need to be ready to intervene with further advice or restrictions if it seems to warrant,” Kamilla said.
Over a week, there is a number of restrictions to be evacuated to a thousand people.
This new position could affect the proposals.
“Certain Cook Meditation” - See Elisha Vidar's menu
Elísa Viðarsdóttir is a football achievement and plays with Val.
She is also a master's student in nutrition, mother, and works as a food expert.
She needs a lot of energy for the days and most often gives herself time to cook good and nutritious food.
My regular day begins with attending work out of eight,” Elisha says.
“After work, I go to the store to be able to prepare the dinner before I pick my girl at the kindergarten around three o'clock.”
Elisha feels very nutritious to pick up his daughter early to kindergarten.
“It's good to have an appointment with her before I go to the second party's practice.
After exercise it is good to come home and just need to warm up the food.
At night, when the girl is asleep, we feel good looking at one element to empty the mind.”
Elisha does not follow any particular diet.
She is a final hand on a master's thesis in Nutrition, and therefore knows well what suits her to eat to have enough energy to do work, school, family and practice.
“What suits me is to eat a wide variety of foods that are well composed of proteins, carbohydrates and fats.
However, I find it most important to have a healthy relationship with food and not sort food into bad or good, rather nutritious or nutritious.
It's okay to eat everything, just not all at once and not always.”
Elisha is very interested in cooking.
“I find certain meditation in standing in the kitchen cooking and getting it very much.
I must say that confidence is with me in the kitchen, and I sincerely believe I am a decent chef.”
Breakfast: oats, chia-seeds, hemp seeds, salt, a little lemon juice, leave in almond milk overnight.
Topping this meal with what is available every time.
Most often it is banana and crispy muesli & COFFEE.
I'm a great coffee woman.
Intermediate languages: Incredibly different, but fruits or vegetables, flatcakes, pure skyr with bananas and muesli, bread with toppings and so could I eat hummus with a spoon out of a box if that is appropriate.
Lunch: I often make all kinds of defiant salads from what exists in the fridge, quinoa or barley, falafelbuns, arugula salad, oven baked vegetables with good dressing is a bit what I'm working with.
If the structure completely goes out of control (which often happens), then the egg machine at work has brought me quite often, and then there are 2 slices of bread with butter, cheese and boiled egg, no more.
Intermediate languages: Bring me something carb for workouts, bread with toppings, cereals or fruits.
Dinner: fish very often becomes for the choice in my home, otherwise some delicious vegetarian dishes.
Conflict between police and protesters in Seattle
Seattle city authorities in Washington state have declared a rebellious situation following numerous protests in the city center.
Police intervened yesterday to flare bombs and pepper spray to tempt to pave a large area that protesters underwent and stretched over many rent bonds around the city of Parliament.
Police announced on Twitter that at least eleven protesters had been arrested and that an investigation was carried out on vandalism done at a police station in the city yesterday, possibly by some kind of bomb.
City and police authorities say protesters have stoned police with stones, bottles, dome bombs and other loose and was one police officer taken to hospital where his injury was done.
However, the Seattle protests were peaceful long in front of.
They were blown to show Portland's Oregon solidarity protesters, but since the city has repeatedly come to a harsh conflict between protesters and heavy-armed rural federal officials.
There, like in more cities of the United States, people gather under the signs of Black Lives Matter, Georges Floyds, who was killed by a Minneapolis police officer on May 25, protests systematic racism in American society and requires remediation.
Not revoked until after voting
There is still no case whether the layoffs of Icelandair's flight attendants, who are supposed to take effect in the next month, will be cancelled.
The Icelandic Flight Attendant Association electronic voting on behalf of Icelandair's flight attendant will end at noon tomorrow.
Guðlaug Líney Jóhannsdóttir chairman of the company says he confident that Icelandair will not make a decision on the layoffs until the conclusion of the ballot is.
“This hangs clearly together,” says Guðlaug Líney.
“There have been no layoffs revoked, these have to go to lie in so that the machines will be able to be human.
So, of course, people are tireless left to know if they will have work after the month.”
A contract signed a week ago, on the eve of July 19.
It is expected to be effective until the end of September 2025 and is based on a contract that the flight attendants had previously embedded in the vote.
On July 17, the Board of Directors and Confidentiality Council of the attendants of Iceland agreed to proclaim a total stoppage with Icelandair, the members accepted it in a vote.
She never came to her, but this was decided following Icelandair's decision to cancel talks with the attendant Society, terminate all their flight attendants and seek agreements with another union.
The company's pilots were supposed to undertake the work of security teams on board temporarily.
Asked how she thinks that the vote will go, says Guðlaug Líney's hard to tell it.
“People are wounded after this approach of Icelandair, when all the company's flight attendants were terminated and informed that another union should be agreed with.
Now it turns out if it is affected,” she says.
940 flight attendants worked with Icelandair at the end of April, 900 of them, about 95%, were terminated.
Their withdrawal deadline is different, for those whose shortest working life he has three months and then ends the month of July-August.
This group includes about 90% of Icelandair flight attendants.
What accepts the price agreement not approved?
“Then we wish for ongoing dialogue with our counterparties.
With this agreement we meet the requirements of Icelandair.
If he is rejected, it is clear that the flight attendants think they have gone too far.”
The Collective-Agreement will end and Icelandair will present results in the second quarter tomorrow
The flight attendant's voting on a new collective agreement will end at 12am noon tomorrow.
Icelandair's financial results for the second quarter will also be published tomorrow, but preliminary operations indicate that the company's income has decreased 85 percent from the same period last year.
Electronic voting on the Icelandic Collective Agreement and the Icelandic Association for Icelandair began on Wednesday, July 22, and ends tomorrow, Monday 27 July, at 12 p.m.
Those who are allowed to vote for this agreement are Icelandair employees who pay membership fees to the attendant company.
Icelandair and FFsigned a new collective agreement on the eve of Sunday 19th of July, but on Friday, Icelandair had terminated negotiations with the company after the flight attendants overcame the previous contract in voting in early July.
Icelandair had then told all the company's flight attendants and airliners on Friday, but they were withdrawn after the new collective agreement was signed.
Under a new collective agreement, flight attendants need to fly five times more per month for the same basic salary.
The collective agreement is valid until 2025, which has integrated the provisions of pilots and flight attendants on how long you can fly on one shift.
The agreement was presented to FFmembers at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica hotel last Monday, voicing many flight attendants that news agencies then spoke to over discontent about the agreement.
However, most seemed to agree that it had to accept the agreement to keep the FFI alive.
Icelandair's financial results for the second quarter will be presented tomorrow, but the EBIT company, its operating results for capital and taxes, is according to preliminary operations negative of ISK 100 to $110 million or about ISK 15 billion.
Icelandair sent a preliminary calculation last Wednesday, which said that the company's revenue has amounted to $60 million in the quarter or by $8.3 billion.
Cash and its equivalent were USD 154 million at the end of the quarter, around ISK 21 billion.
Icelandair also plans to offer out the company's share capital in August.
Icelandair aims to conclude contracts with fifteen lenders, government and Boeing aircraft manufacturer by the end of the month before the end of the month will be entered into a public offering.
New variant rather than a new type of virus
“A new virus just means that this has been a person who came from abroad.
This is not something that has been simmering here in Iceland,” says Már Kristjánsson, chief physician at the National Hospital of Infectious Disease, about reports that “a new type of virus” was detected in Iceland.
Three domestic infections were detected yesterday and two at the border.
One identified had participated in the social work of the sports club at the Rey Cup football match, while the origin of the contagion unencountered and contagious tracing lasts.
An infection was also detected in a person who arrived in Iceland on July 15 and two who were in communion with him began to show symptoms of COVID—19.
Yesterday's infection was detected, which was reported last day and after sequencing in Icelandic genetic analysis, “a new type of virus not detected here before.”
Infection tracking is completed in connection with that infection.
Már notes that it is not a new virus, but this is the same virus that has spread around the world, i.e. the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
It is more correct to talk about a new variant of that virus than about a new type of virus.
Asked what it means and whether it could say something about another wave of an epidemic has started, Már says that there is a single case, and it could go so that there is nothing more.
“But, on the other hand, if there are cases of domestic that do not have connections from abroad and have the same genotype as this particular variant, then that could be concluded [about the second wave], but it is premature at the time,” explains Már.
Happiness in the hot pot
Is the secret to the happiness of Icelanders hidden in the hot tubs?
The BBC programmers lead to that similarity in a fun video that highlights the country's pool and hot pot culture.
The Icelandic bath culture is special on a global scale, and it is claimed that nowhere in the world there are as many bathing places per population.
The natural geothermal is its base, but also the tradition of suntan that prevails here.
Children's swimming education was statutory in 1940, but seniors are no less diligent to take advantage of their hot waters for health benefits.
Swim trips are described as a fixed part of the general welfare of the country.
In the pot, all are equal, regardless of the class and position.
Cell phones, people discuss on a personal basis of the worlds and sectors, or enjoy the similarity of the power of water: meditates and recharges the batteries of soul and body.
On the steep to attend a hundred days in the elections
A hundred days remain until Americans enter into an election and choose a president for four years.
Donald Trump seeks a re-election, but he has the steep to pick up.
Joe Biden, the expected Democratic Party candidate, has a huge advantage over Trump nationwide, being taken into account by polls.
According to a new survey of the AP news provider, a record number of Americans believes that the nation is on the wrong way.
Trump's response to the pandemic of the new coronavirus is likewise very unpopular, and moreover more Americans believe that the president has kept poorly economic.
Specifically, only two out of ten Americans say that the United States is on track.
32 percent claim to support Trump's response for the epidemic and 48 percent say he has kept well on the economic situation.
In March, it was a rate of 56 percent, and in January it was 67 percent.
According to the FiveThirtyEight average, Biden's adherence is 49.9 percent nationally while following Trump 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has tried to divert attention from his performance towards the epidemic to Biden, push for so-called cultural disputes and proclaim policies that are to turn around law and order.
However, Biden's candidacy is making much effort to keep his attention on Trump and consider a high chance of winning out of farms if the election actually revolves around how Trump has been working in the last four years.
Trump's unpopularity also seems to be coming down on the Republican Party MPs, fearing the forward members that the Democrats could even reach the majority in the United States Senate, which so far has greatly ashed.
Politico said in the days that the party and candidate remained comparable to it, and that is, now the Republican Party would receive its greatest delivery for decades.
Suburban has proved the category particularly bad in the 2016 parliamentary elections and now it is looking for that trend to continue.
In recent days, Trump has tried to scare away suburban residents to follow, among other things, by saying that will become President Biden, he will ruin the US suburbs and push racial dispute.
Among other things, Trump has abrogated regulation from Barack Obama's time at the White House designed to diversify suburban areas.
Then he urged the “housewives” of the U.S. suburbs to read an article by former New York deputy director, claiming Biden would spend US suburbs and took Trump for it.
“Biden will ruin your neighborhoods and the American dream.
I will preserve it, and even make it even better!” said the president.
Residents of suburban US is an increasingly expanding group of voters.
According to NPR, they are about half of all voters in the United States.
Ever since George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the candidate who has received the majority of votes of this group has become president.
Except in 2012 when Mitt Romney received a majority vote from this group but lost to Barack Obama.
Polls have shown that although Trump secured a nauman majority in the suburbs of 2016, his adherence has declined significantly.
While different between surveys, Biden has measured about fifteen percent point of advantage over Trump in the exothers' recent times.
Regis Philbin is dead
American television presenter Regis Philbin is dead, at the age of 88.
Philbin worked as an actor, participating manager, introducer and singer for about six decades.
He is one of the best known for managing popular Live chats! with Regis from 1988 to 2011 along with Kathie Lee Gifford and later Kelly Ripa.
He has then led episodes such as Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and America's Got Talent.
According to Guinness World Records, Philbin is the person who has been most hours on American television and has received recognition of that content.
He received six Emmy awards in his working life and was in total nominated 37 times.
It is stated in a statement from his family that Philbin died of natural orchies.
A number of colleagues, friends and fans have mentioned him on social media last clock.
Will the Olympic fire be light at the end of the tunnel?
After a final decision had been made to postpone the Olympics, events that only world wars have shouted until now, the president of the International Olympic Committee said the Olympic Fire infamous would be “the light at the end of the tunnel,” presumably referring to the coronavirus pandemic that the world now passes through jointly.
The achievers have more years to prepare and the Japan authorities compensate for their delayed costs.
Everyone, however, holds the header end much at stake.
When it was announced that Tokyo in Japan would be the scene of this year's Olympic Games, the cheer of the Japanese representatives were authentic.
They cried and laughed alternately, as Tokyo had applied to hold the matches 2016 but bowed that time to lower hold for Rio, Brazil.
This time Tokyo City and Japan should bathe in the attention of the world.
The games were to take place on July 24th to August 9th but have been postponed for a year, starting on July 23, 2021 and ending on August 8th.
If the games fail to be held, if the coronavirus is still too much threat, the games will be cancelled.
However, no one wants to completely think that thought to the end.
Olympic games are no standard sports competition.
Nothing is saved, the show should always be spectacular and strive to top up the last play.
The choice of a city for the Olympics is based on the evaluation of the selection committee on the presentations of the cities.
The more magnificent the presentation — the greater the chance to get rivets.
Tokyo spent $150 million trying to get to hold the 2016 Olympics, or of more than $20 billion.
The second time, when applying for the 2020 matches, $75 million, about ten billion, were put into the presentation.
In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo received the matches this year, the Japanese authorities had already spent an amount of 30 billion ISK to the project.
However, that amount is just a drop in the ocean based on what it costs to build Olympic villages, stadiums and generally strengthen the infrastructure of the country to recruit such tournaments, prepare it and hold the games themselves.
Organizers in Japan have said the Tokyo Olympics, which should have been running these days but have been postponed for a year due to the coronavirus, would have cost $12,6 billion.
However, a report from a Japan government auditor released at the end of last year, it stated that closer to the cost was double that number.
Chances will not be able to fully assess the cost of postponing the games, but it has been estimated to be able to cost in the range of two to six billion dollars in addition to the initial cost.
The total cost for the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could therefore run in the range of $15 to 30 billion.
There are such high numbers that all tax revenues of the Icelandic State only accounted for about almost half the Olympics, based on the lowest possible cost.
Olympics are an event of an order of magnitude that they have often become the subject of economists, who try to look into figures and look at the benefits and benefits of the games.
In the shortest case, quite a lot seem to have come to the conclusion that the impact of the Olympics is less than so positive for the economy of the cities holding them.
Short-term impacts are some, for example, the number of jobs is very much in the short term, but in the long term cities often sit up with debt tails and threatened high operating costs of little used structures.
Brazil's Rio sits up with significant debts due to the 2016 games and has been having trouble cost maintenance on all the big sports facilities built for the games.
Numbers after the London Games 2012 have been reviewed, and it has been found that only 10 percent of those who received employment related to the Olympics in the city were unemployed before.
That means there was no new jobs, except to a small extent.
In general, cities have not come particularly good out of financial keeping Olympics because of the overflowing costs associated with the structures built for the games.
However, benefit is often considered to include an increased traffic of tourists who want to visit the Olympics following the games, which, however, there is a lot of uncertainty about the 2021 matches.
It is also uncertain whether it will be possible to accept all the number of viewers who usually attend the games.
However, the main thing is the honor that the cities have to be chosen, but it is difficult to estimate money.
Therefore, despite the huge cost, it can also be said that the joy that the games bring is not the nature that it can be put on a price tag.
But although the show is often grand and nowhere to save, it's not just about money.
It is the sports heroes that are in the foreground.
For some achievers, it's a surprise just welcome to postpone the games.
The Australian pentathlon lady and gold medalist in their article on late Olympics, Chloe Esposito, for example, is a cassette and would have been removed from good fun this summer but poses hope of being in a competition form for the 2021 matches.
She is therefore among those athletes who are just rather happy with the postponement, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who were planning to quit after the matches this year, they would have been held on time, the postponement of the games in some case means that they quit the competition before the matches take place.
Trust their body simply does not order to go through years in addition to rigorous exercises.
Few athletes were equally thoroughly encountered in the hearts of the audience at Rio 2016 Olympics and gymnastics star Simone Biles.
She came home with four gold around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has attended several interviews in his country of residence of the United States recently to discuss the Olympics.
She is going to be at the 2021 matches, but she is not necessarily sure she will still be at the top of the matches next year, as she will be 24 years old.
Although it is generally not considered a high age, it is a higher layer for a cutting edge gymnastics woman.
“This is a sensitive issue,” says Biles, but smiles into another interview published on the Olympic Committee Instagram page asked if she is going to get as far as the 2021 Games she did in Rio 2016.
“I just don't know if I'll be on top after a whole year of training,” Biles says.
She has previously talked that her body does not tolerate the load accompanying gymnastics training for much longer.
Nevertheless, she is practicing diligently for the 2021 Olympics.
Biles admits that having to suddenly stop practicing when the pandemic stood as its highest and the gymnastics room was closed.
There were no exemptions for Biles rather than others while all sports facilities were closed for seven weeks.
All her Olympian couldn't buy any access beyond the others, she had to find various ways to stay in shape like others.
The basic form certainly particle better than most people.
“We have a stiff plan now.
It was difficult to start practicing first again after the opening of the gymnastics room.
We started slowly but have been fully resumed and I will increase the exercises steadily as the year progresses.
Of course, we do not quite know how these games will be or if they will be held, but we still practice considering that they will be, can't otherwise.
I've put too much to leave the sport right now,” says Biles.
Like more, doubt, or perhaps rather aware that the situation may arise that the games will not be held in 2021 either.
To predict it, however, is hopeless.
No one can know how the situation of the coronavirus pandemic will be in July 2021 and nothing else to do than prepare for the Olympics considering they will be held in a year.
Perhaps the Olympic fire will be light at the end of the COVID-19 tunnel.
Postponed weddings due to epidemic
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding due to the coronavirus.
She was supposed to marry former Bachelorette competitor Wells Adams now this summer.
“I think there are other more important things to think about right now,” said the actress in a conversation with People.
“We want to get married sometime and have that dream purchase and have all those present who are happy to us.
But we decided to beat it on a deadline and focus on what is important right now and it is to assist in sharing information about the importance of wearing masks and staying at home.
I look more to world events than a wedding event these days.
There is a lot going on and we should focus our attention on what is happening in the world.”
