Honoka will have [Tanaka Minami-san style hair]!
A full report on the cut (CanCam.jp) - Yahoo! News
Add a layer to heavy semi-long hair [Minami style] for soft hair
CanCam model Honoka yearns for a hairstyle with movement like Tanaka Minami's, saying, "Of course it's beautiful, but I have so much respect for her professionalism!"
I asked Asa Nikko Teru of the Omotesando hair salon "SUNVALLY," who actually cuts Tanaka Minami's hair, to make it "Minami-style hair."
I will report on the cutting process!
Nogizaka46 Yamashita Mizuki on the cover for the first time with short hair!
First of all, check the hair before cutting.
It's thin, soft, and plentiful.
I have a habit of getting a straight perm, especially during the rainy season, because it makes me look unkempt.
It is a heavy semi-long with flowing bangs.
Finally, the cutting begins!
To make it easier to cut, first wet the whole thing lightly.
After that, the top of the bee (the part above the circumference where the head protrudes the most) is separated and cut from the bottom.
By the way, here are the points of hair that you can get close to Minami!
1 Table Bang By shortening the inside of the bangs just a little, you can enjoy changes depending on the styling, such as slightly thicker when pulled down full, and see-through skin when lightly parted.
2 A cut that makes the most of the habit If a person with a habit of having a lot of hair reduces the amount of hair too much, it may spread to the sides.
While consulting the balance around it, keep a balance that is easy to handle but difficult to spread, so that your own swell will live.
3 Layers around the face and curly hair Layers = a cut that is cut with a step.
If you put a layer around your face, it makes it easier to move, giving it a cute finish.
When curly hair is made in three places, the temple, the front and the back of the topknot, it looks stylish even when it is quickly put together.
When I cut off the hair on the top of the beehive that I had set aside, I put it around my face.
Pull the hair bundle in the upper part around the face forward and cut the tip of the hair.
In this way, when the hair bundle is lowered, there will be a step difference and it will be easier to move (this is the layer cut).

Governor Yoshimura to "partner with Gurunavi" against Corona (Sankei Sports) - Yahoo! News
Osaka Governor Yoshimura Hirofumi (45) appeared remotely from the prefectural office on Osaka ABC TV's "Cast" (Mon-Fri, 3:48) on the 20th and revealed that he is considering a tie-up with the restaurant information website "Gurunavi" as part of measures to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus.
Since the beginning of this month, Osaka Prefecture has been issuing "infection prevention declaration stickers" to businesses that comply with the guidelines in order to promote efforts to prevent the spread of infection and provide peace of mind to the people of the prefecture.
However, stickers have only been issued to 11,000 restaurants in the prefecture, where there are said to be more than 120,000 restaurants alone.
Therefore, Governor Yoshimura said, "I'm thinking of doing it at the end of the month, but I'll partner with "Gurunavi" and issue a declaration sticker when making a reservation, so that it can be seen at the reservation stage," and declared a tag with the Internet reservation site.
"The important thing is not to lump them all together as 'nightlife districts.' There should be a clear distinction between stores that are taking measures against infectious diseases and those that are not. It is also important to make efforts to increase the number of stores that are doing so," he said.

The exhibition "History and Culture of Toyosawa Town" by the Toyosawa Town Promotion Association (chairman: Nakamura Kenji) in Hanamaki will be held at Kenji Square in Kamimachi from the 25th.
A notebook showing that Miyazawa Kenji (1896-1933), a poet and writer of children's stories, sent relief money to areas affected by the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 (Taisho 12) together with residents of Toyosawa-cho, the city where he grew up.
It is a valuable document that shows the connection between Kenji and Toyosawa Town, and is introduced along with the culture and history of the town.
Until August 23rd.
The notebook was found by Ito Yuji (60), a member of the association and a staff member of the organization in Toyosawa-cho, when he was cleaning out a storage room at his home last summer.
It was used by his grandfather-in-law, Takahashi Genzo (1900-1985), who ran a general store in the area.
On September 15th, it was written "Tokyo City Earthquake Donation Wanted (resident military personnel) ," and the names of Kenji and the residents of Toyosawa Town at the time, as well as the amount of the donation, are written along with the symbols " ○ " and " × " .
Taneichi, a fourth-year high school graduate from Lotte, became a professional for the first time!
No. 4 Yasuda hits V, Toritani smashes 2 (Baseball King) - Yahoo! News
● Seibu 0 - 5 Lotte ○ <10th round, MetLife Dome> Lotte's starter, Atsushi Taneichi, threw 136 pitches in the 9th inning alone, and in his 4th year, he was happy to get his first professional shutout.
It was the team's third victory in this season's Pacific League shutout, and stopped the team's losing streak at two.
In the first inning, Taneichi allowed Suzuki Shohei, who was in the lead, to get on base with a double that broke the third base line, but immediately after that, he hit Genda Sosuke with a triple, and Suzuki Masaru, who was trying to get on base during this time, also touched out at third base.
Helped by the calm response of his team's defense, he got through the pinch of getting up with zero, and after the second inning, he tossed around the Seibu batting lineup with a combination of slider and fork, focusing on the straight line he was proud of.
I'm going to work my tail off and put some zeros on the scoreboard.
The batting lineup was struggling to beat the opponent's starter, Honda Keisuke, but Sugano Takeshi, the 3rd batter in the top of the 7th inning, got on base with a four-ball, and the substitute runner, Okaikai, succeeded in stealing two bases.
On this occasion, the 4th batter, Yasuda Hisanori, hit the ball right in front of the plate, finally breaking the equilibrium.
Then, in the next 8th inning, he attacked the third opponent, Miyakawa Tetsu, and scored 4 points in one fell swoop, including 2 points in the left middle, which was the first timely hit after the transfer of Toritani Takashi who was playing in the middle.
He folded like he was pushing the back of the Marines' young ace candidate and decided the game at once.
Taneichi threw more than 100 pitches in the ninth inning after retiring the side in order in the eighth inning.
He said, "I've got a lot of power," and called for a pinch of two dead bases with consecutive walks, but in the end he got the 10th strikeout of the day from Spangenberg with a high straight, and the game was set.
She squeezed in her joy with a smile.
Bye-bye to accidents with a new strategy Tsuruoka Police Station collaborates with related organizations to raise safety awareness |Yamagata Newspaper
A collision test between a car and a bicycle was conducted at a bicycle class held as a kick-off event for the operation: Shoko Gakuen Driving School, Tsuruoka
Tsuruoka Police Station (Chief Sato Keizo) has launched "Operation Bye Bye Accident Zero" in an attempt to eliminate accidents involving bicycles and motorcycles, which have been occurring at a high rate in the area in recent years.
In addition to working with traffic safety organizations in the prefecture to promote awareness of accident prevention, it will also step up enforcement of violations of traffic rules for bicycles.
There have been three fatal traffic accidents in the precinct this year, in which motorcyclists and bicyclists were killed.
Although the number of accidents has been on a downward trend, the rate of accidents involving bicycles was about 11.7% as of June 30, and the rate of accidents involving motorcycles was about 5.8%, both of which were higher than the prefecture average.
In particular, the rate of bicycle accidents has been higher than the prefectural average in many years over the past five years, and we have planned a strategy to overcome this situation.
The name of the operation is a combination of the words "bike" and "bicycle" with the meaning of eliminating accidents.
Related organizations will be called upon more than ever to provide driving instruction to the elderly and utilize luminous reflective materials in traffic safety classes.
In the event of a crackdown, the station will issue a yellow card (guidance warning ticket) to remind people to be careful.
The launch ceremony for the operation was held at the Shoko Gakuen Driving School in Tsuruoka on the 21st.
There were about 30 people in attendance, and Chief Sato said, "I would like to ask for your cooperation in order to reduce the number of tragic accidents."
A representative from the office explained the policy and the activities of each organization.
As a follow-up event to the start of the operation, a bicycle class was held.
A police officer in a car demonstrated the difference in impact between hitting a bicycle with the brakes on and hitting it at about 55km/h without the brakes on.
Kinouchi Koichi, chairman of the Tsuruoka District Community Traffic Safety Promotion Committee, said, "I once again realized the horror of traffic accidents. I would like to call attention to the elderly as well as young people."

Kaminarimon Kisuke (right) performs rakugo with a sharp tongue
On the 25th, a regular vaudeville show was held for the first time in five months at the public vaudeville theater "Owarai Akasakatei" (Shibun, Akaiwa City), which had been closed due to the new coronavirus.
Rakugo storyteller Kaminarimon Kisuke (75), who is based at Akasakatei, and his colleagues elicited laughter from the audience with their professional storytelling.
At the request of a vassal who has been ordered not to drink alcohol by his lord, Kisuke performs "Kinzake Banya," in which a liquor store owner who wants to bring in alcohol engages in a comical exchange with the gatekeeper.
There were plenty of laughs to be had from his sharp-tongued delivery and good-natured approach to drinking.
A 58-year-old office worker from Naka-ku, Okayama, who visited with his wife, said with a smile, "The way they spoke and interacted with each other was exquisite, and I was immediately drawn in."
Kisuke said, "It's been a while since my last performance, and my voice wasn't in the best condition, but it was a fulfilling time."
Guest rakugo performer Katsura Kodome (31) from Osaka and magic group Tsuyama Magic Club also appeared.
Comedy Akasaka-tei opened in 1996 in the former Akasaka-cho as the nation's first publicly owned vaudeville theater.
They had been holding regular monthly vaudeville performances and on-demand performances, but cancelled the last performance in February of this year due to the effects of the coronavirus.

Demonstrators protest against the detention and dismissal of Governor Furgal in the Khabarovsk region of the Russian Far East on the 25th (AP)
[Moscow Kyodo News] A demonstration was held on the 25th to protest against the arrest and dismissal of Governor Furgal in the Khabarovsk region of the Russian Far East.
This is the 15th consecutive day of demonstrations, which is an unusual situation.
The finger of criticism has also been pointed at President Putin.
The security authorities have not resorted to the usual method of arresting people en masse in the capital, Moscow, reflecting the cautious attitude of the government, which is sensitive to the feelings of residents.
Former governor Furgal, who belongs to the far-right Liberal Democratic Party, won a landslide victory over the incumbent candidate of Putin's ruling United Russia party in the gubernatorial election run-off in 2018 with about 70% of the vote.
He was one of the few non-ruling party governors in Russia, but was detained by the security authorities on the 9th of this month.
He was charged with involvement in two murders of businessmen in 2004 and 2005.

Akashi Sho and Nakamori 0 hits in 3 innings, 0 walks, 7 K's!
Both Tora and G highly praised, Hanshin / Wada TA "still top class" (Sankei Sports) - Yahoo! News
At the Hyogo Original High School Baseball Tournament on the 24th, Akashi Sho, a powerhouse in the top 4 of Koshien last spring and summer, faced Takasago in the first game (second round, Takasago Baseball Stadium) and started cold in the 5th inning at 11-0.
Nakamori Shunsuke (3rd year), a 151 kg right-handed pitcher who is a top draft candidate, pitched a no-hitter with 7 strikeouts in the 3rd inning and showed his consistent pitching.
The technical advisor (57) attached to the headquarters of the Hanshin Wada Yutaka Baseball Team, who inspected the facility, was also full of praise.
The start was delayed by 39 minutes for maintenance due to continuous rain.
A muddy mound.
Even so, it was the long-awaited first official game of the year, and I was energized.
He gave up one walk in the bottom of the inning, but pitched a no-hitter.
He struck out seven and contributed to a shutout in the third inning and a win in the fifth inning.
Nakamori's self-assessment was harsh, but he marked the fastest 148 km on the day, and the professional eyes of Hanshin, Giants and Orix behind the net are highly rated.
Hanshin / Wada TA's first visit since the first game of Koshien last summer (2nd round ○ 4-3 Hanasaki Tokuei).
"He is growing. After all, he is in the top class of high school students. Even when he was down, his form did not collapse, and he was able to control it well. I think he will become a top candidate."
Giant Kishi Scout also said, "It was the best I've seen recently.
It's amazing that we've been able to finish it despite the corona crisis," he said.
"I have the feeling that I want to go pro, but I can't decide yet," he said at the end of June when asked if he wanted to go pro or go to college.
Before that, the goal is to win this tournament, which will end in the last eight.
A rule that allows 20 players on the bench to be registered and changed every game.
All 16 third-year players played in this game as well.
They must continue to win their remaining three games in order to have all 39 seniors on the roster.
"This is the last tournament after three years of hard training. If I can face it with all the third-year students, I want to win it all, including Koshien. I myself have always been told by the coach (Hazama) that there will be no shutout, so I can do it." The focus of the last summer for the team and individuals has been set.

Butler again praises young Heat prospect Tyler Herro: 'My mindset is not that of a rookie' (Basket Count) - Yahoo!News
Photo: Getty Images The Heat's first scrimmage (practice game) is against the Kings.
Duncan Robinson scored a team-high 18 points, Tyler Herro followed with 15 and the backcourt shined in the 104-98 victory.
As well as Robinson, who is one of the best shooters in the league, the step-up of rookie Hero, the 13th overall pick in the draft, will be an important factor for the Heat.
The hero missed 15 games between February and March with an ankle injury, with his last appearance coming against the Hornets on 12 March as the season entered a lengthy hiatus.
The hero said, "I had plenty of time, so I was able to get back to 100% condition. It's the best feeling I've ever felt," but the performance in the scrimmage was more convincing than words.
The hero got more playing time due to the late arrival of starting point guard Kendrick Nunn, and he took advantage of the opportunity.
It's worth a lot because it's 15 points after performing well in a different role than usual.
Team leader Jimmy Butler was once again full of praise for The Favourite hero.
"He can handle, he can score, he can defend, he can do everything for the team. He can play any position because he's not thinking like a rookie. He's looking at the film, he's studying it, he's figuring out where and how his teammates are going to get free and what he's going to do about it."
Even before the start of this season, Butler has liked his hero's rookie-like resilience and stoic approach to basketball.
That's why I invited him to individual practice starting at 4 o'clock in the morning, and we have been training together.
Butler once said: "He speaks his mind to everyone and doesn't back down. I can respect that kind of fighting spirit."
That Butler is the type of guy who always says what he thinks, and if he thinks it will benefit the team, he will give a harsh opinion knowing that a conflict will occur.
In the past, his relationship with his teammates has deteriorated as a result.
Butler is probably superimposing his younger self on the hero.
Butler's personality, at times too abrasive for his teammates, is a good guide for those with the guts to follow it.
If the teacher-student relationship between the two who respect each other spreads to the entire team, the Heat should be able to become a team that can aim higher.
Shimasho takes the lead for the first time in the 4th round of the 2020 Summer Shizuoka Prefectural High School Baseball Tournament Shimada Sho - Hamamatsu Castle Kita Kogyo | Shizuoka Newspaper @S
Shimada Sho - Hamamatsu Castle North Works In the first inning, Shimada Sho had the bases loaded with no outs, and Matsuura hit the first pitch = Kusanagi Stadium
4th round (Kusanagi 1st game) Hamamatsu Castle North Works 0000000-0 410000×-5 Shimada Sho Game time 1 hour 26 minutes
[Comment] Shimada Sho took advantage of a good opportunity in the early stages and won a shutout against Hamamatsu Castle North Works.
Shimada Sho took the lead with two timely hits by Matsuura in the first inning with the bases loaded and no outs.
He added two more with an infield grounder and a squeeze.
Starting pitcher Saito pitched well, giving up only one hit and no runs in six innings.
Hamamatsu Jo Hokuto failed to capitalize on an opportunity with the bases loaded and two outs in the final inning.
The fourth round led by three-year-old
Second year at Matsuura, a first strike of gratitude
It was the No. 4 of the second year, who participated for the first time this summer, that defeated the opponent.
Shimada Sho's Matsuura hit a changeup with the bases loaded in the first inning and drove it to left field.
"For three years, if I lost, I would immediately retire. I wanted to hit and win."
The prodigy, who also played No. 4 last fall, held his head high.
The 1st to 3rd rounds were mainly fought in the 3rd year, and the powerful 2nd year was held in reserve.
Coach Ikeda gathered the players in a meeting and told Nine, "Three years have brought us this far. I will go with the best team from now on."
On this day, four of the nine starters solidified their main axis in two years.
It may seem heartless, but it is proof that they are serious about the game.
Matsuura said reassuringly, "From now on, the level of the opposing pitcher will also increase. I will approach with the intention of retiring the runner."
Saito, who pitched back-to-back innings, pitched well in the sixth inning, allowing just one hit and not allowing a runner to reach second base, showing his determination of the past three years.
The number 10 jersey has been well received as a synergistic effect, with people saying, "Having it for two years will inspire me for three years. If it leads to a win."
The team, which is aiming to finish in the top four for the third year in a row, including last year's tournament in Shizuoka, does not intend to make the remaining games memorable.
16 musicians connected to Fukushima Prefecture come together to sing with the people of the prefecture (Fukushima Minpo) - Yahoo!News
I want to deliver the energetic singing voices of Hama, Naka and Aizu to the world.
Sixteen musicians with ties to Fukushima Prefecture came together to create a message song.
The lyrics reflect the single-mindedness of Fukushima Prefecture as it struggles to recover from the Great East Japan Earthquake and the TEPCO Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident, and to combat the novel coronavirus.
The "complete version" will be completed by next summer, the 10th anniversary of the disaster, with the voices of the people of the prefecture singing.
On the 24th, the song was released on the video-sharing site YouTube.
The song is called "Pray from Fukushima."
The positive attitude of the people "I want to convey from Fukushima" is put on a cheerful and energetic melody.
Due to the impact of the new coronavirus, live music venues that serve as hubs for musical activities have been forced to close, and many musicians have lost the opportunity to sing and perform.
It was planned by singer-songwriter Nappo (46), who lives in Minamisoma, and DAZU-O (37), from the Iwaki music group Mexicali Boys, who wanted to believe in the power of music at a time when the future is uncertain.
Nappo will write the lyrics and music, while Dazuo will rap.
When the project started in March during the corona crisis, singer-songwriters MANAMI (28) and Kanno Jun (38) from Fukushima City agreed one after another, and the circle quickly expanded.
Ms. Nappo said with emotion, "This is a gorgeous lineup that would be unthinkable in normal times. I want to enjoy this opportunity to the fullest."
As a countermeasure against infection, there was no opportunity for sixteen people to gather, and each recorded at a live house or at home.

Interstellar Technologies, a space venture in Taiki-cho, Hokkaido, announced on the 25th that it would postpone the launch of its self-developed small rocket MOMO No. 7, which was scheduled for the same day, to the 26th due to strong winds.
The aircraft has a total length of about 10 meters, a diameter of about 50 centimeters and weighs about 1 ton.
The launch was originally scheduled for the 18th, but was postponed due to bad weather.

Two new cases of coronavirus confirmed in Sendai (TBC Tohoku Broadcasting Corporation) - Yahoo! News
Men in their 50s and 60s were newly found to have been infected with the new coronavirus in Sendai.
The confirmed cases are all male office workers in their 50s and 60s living in Sendai.
According to Sendai City, the man in his 60s was a close contact of a female office worker in her 20s who was confirmed to be infected on the 23rd of this month, and worked at the same company.

Instant detection of crisis occurrence from online information, and determination of hoaxes (JBpress) - Yahoo! News
"I want to know as soon as possible where and what kind of disaster or accident occurred!"
This is not limited to news organizations such as television and newspapers, but many companies such as social infrastructure companies and local governments also have strong needs.
A service that responds to this is "Spectee," developed by Spectee, a company that analyzes information using AI.
[Picture] A specialized team determines the authenticity of social media information based on alerts from Specti
Now, the means by which people first learn of the occurrence of disasters and accidents is beginning to shift from television to online information (social media).
Social media such as Twitter have become an important medium for disseminating information immediately after a disaster or accident occurs.
However, the task of constantly monitoring the flood of information and extracting useful information from it is difficult to do manually.
Specti has the ability to detect information related to natural disasters and accidents from information flowing through social media such as Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, analyze the content, determine the authenticity of the information, and then distribute it to the user company.
It is a crisis management support service that visualizes various crises occurring in Japan and abroad, "positioning a wide range of events with a negative impact that stop or stagnate social activities as a "crisis"" (Murakami Kenjiro, CEO).
NHK at the time of the Kumamoto earthquake that occurred in April 2016 was the first major use case of Specti, after which the adoption movement spread rapidly among companies.
It is said that more than 350 companies in Japan are currently using Specti, including not only news organizations such as TV stations and newspapers, but also companies that support social infrastructure such as electricity, gas and transportation, as well as local governments across the country.
■ Analyzing posts to determine the type of "crisis" and where it occurred
Specti distributes information in four steps: "collection of information," "analysis and content classification," "titling" and "verification."
The user company specifies in advance the region (prefecture, city, ward, town, village, etc.) and the category of crisis (disaster, accident, etc.) for which information is to be collected.
Specti collects posts that fall under that designation using APIs provided by the social media companies.
It then analyzes and categorizes the text, images and videos contained in the collected posts.
For example, if a video shows a fire truck, black smoke rising from a building, and orange flames coming out of a room, it is classified as a "fire."
In addition, images of overturned cars are classified as "traffic accidents," while images of water-covered roads are classified as "road flooding."
Specti can also estimate the location of a disaster or accident.
"We often don't know the location from the post, so we estimate it by combining various information," says CEO Murakami.
For example, if a road sign or billboard is reflected in an image or video, place name information is extracted from it and matched with a place name database to identify the location.
The Angels lost their opening game...Ohtani struck out three times with the bases loaded in the 1st and 9th innings of the 5th game (Baseball King) - Yahoo! News
Athletics 7x - 3 Angels ● <Oakland Coliseum, July 24 local time> Ohtani Shohei (26) of the Angels participated in the opening game against the Athletics on the 24th (Japan time 25th) as the 3rd designated hitter.
Although he gave up a hit to Nakamae in the first inning, his first hit of the season, he retired the next four batters and went 1 for 5 with one hit and one strikeout.
Ohtani struck out swinging against Montana again in the third inning with a runner on first base.
In the third at-bat of the fifth inning, with the score tied at 1-1, he faced right-hander Pettitte, who was batting second, at first base and was also knocked out.
In the fourth at-bat of the eighth inning, with a 2-1 lead, he faced Diekman, a left-hander batting fifth, as the leadoff hitter.
He hit the second ball straight back in the opposite direction at a good angle, but it did not go over the fence and fell to the left.
The Angels took a one-run lead into the bottom of the eighth inning, but relief right-hander Buttrey gave up two runs and allowed the comeback, but in the bottom of the ninth, new catcher No. 7 Castro, who will be the team's No. 1 this season, hit a solo shot into the right field seats.
They tied the game at 3-3 in the last minute.
After that, Trout batted second with two outs and a runner on second base.
The Athletics bench declared Trout out at this point and elected to go with Ohtani with the bases loaded.
Ohtani was expected to get the win, but he struck out on three pitches in front of Hendricks, the patron saint of the Athletics.
The game was not decided in the ninth inning, and it went into extra innings, starting with this season's special no-hitter at second base.
Since Ohtani was the last batter of the ninth inning, he was the runner on second base.
In the top of the 10th inning, Walsh, the Angels' leadoff batter, hit a hard grounder to first base, but first baseman Olson caught the ball well and sent it to third base.
Ohtani, who was sandwiched between second and third base, was tagged out.
The Angels then loaded the bases with two outs in the bottom of the inning, but No. 8 Simmons grounded into a double play.
On the other hand, the Angels were pinch-hitting at third base when Robles, who continued to pitch through the inning, gave up a run on a passed ball and a wild pitch.
At this point, new manager Maddon shifted to a five-man infield, but Robles walked No. 4 Davis on four pitches to load the bases.
Milner, the left-hander who replaced him, delivered a bases-loaded walk to Olson in the fifth and the game was decided.

I can't understand "a lot of cheating" or "a lot of cheating" ... ... ?
Interview with residents of Chiba Prefecture: "Words that I seriously thought were not dialect" (Netorabo) - Yahoo! News
I am a resident of Chiba Prefecture, which is close to Tokyo.
I have lived in the prefecture for almost 30 years since I was born.
When I used it in a conversation with my university (Tokyo) friends, the word "zuru-meshimi," which means "sideways entry," was instantly taken as a joke.
They were able to understand the meaning from the flow and tone, but the people of Tokyo and Saitama prefecture told us not to use it.
-- Certainly, "If there's a lot of cheating, do you cheat and get in on the side?"
Since it seems to be connected, it seems that the meaning can be guessed somehow.
And one more thing.
I didn't notice this until it was pointed out to me, but when I looked into it as an adult, I found that the expression "uchinchi," which means "my house," was not used at all, even when reading books, and I didn't hear it from my friends.
- Eh, "Uchinchi" ... ... was that so?
I also use it in my hometown (Gunma Prefecture), but I didn't realize it was because I naturally stopped using it when I became an adult ... ....
Japanese "refrigerated Chinese food" does not appeal to Chinese people ... ?
Why "cold noodle dishes" are unpopular (Contemporary Business) - Yahoo! News
In China, cold Chinese noodles are called "Japanese style cold noodles"
As mentioned at the beginning, hiyashi chuka is a Chinese dish (Japanese-style Chinese) that originated in Japan and was devised based on the Chinese "ryang ban mien" (chilled mixed noodles).
Therefore, it does not exist in China originally, but due to the diversification of food, it has come to be seen in Japanese restaurants in the summer.
Recently, Japanese-style convenience stores have also appeared with "Japanese-style soba noodles / Soba chilled noodles" and "Kawaka chicken silk noodles / Sichuan-style chicken chilled noodles."
On the other hand, the popularity of Japanese-style Chinese is generally not high in China, pushed by trendy punchy Chinese cuisine such as Sichuan cuisine and Hunan cuisine.
Needless to say, the taste of Japanese-style Chinese food is often familiar to Chinese people.
Therefore, if it is not tasteless but lacks impact, it tends to be criticized harshly.
"Chilled Chinese" is no exception, and it is still a minor presence in China.
By the way, the name of chilled Chinese noodles in China is "Japanese-style cold noodles."
It is recognized by the Chinese as one of the Japanese cuisines.
The summer staple is "liangpi."
When it comes to noodle dishes that evoke the feeling of summer in China, "liangpi" probably comes to mind.
Although many people in Japan may not be familiar with it, liangpi is a flat noodle made from wheat flour, rice flour, starch, etc. that originated in Shaanxi Province.
It is said to have a history of 2,000 years.
It is a standard B-grade gourmet that is also sold at street stalls, and the price is very reasonable, around 10 to 20 yuan (150 to 300 yen).
Although it has the word "Ryo" in it, it is not served with ice, as is the case with cold Chinese food in Japan.
Rather, it is based on room temperature.
Top the noodles with your favorite toppings, such as shredded cucumber, carrot, and boiled bean sprouts, and add condiments such as coriander, chili, ginger, and garlic.
Finally, it is finished with a special seasoning mixed with soy sauce, chili oil, vinegar, sesame paste and peanut paste.
The noodles are chewy and chewy, and the refreshing sour and rich spicy sauce goes well with the noodles, so even if you're tired from the summer heat and don't have much of an appetite, the noodles will go down smoothly.
In addition, since it has penetrated all over China, there are various toppings and seasonings, and the rich variety is one of the characteristics of Liangpi and one of the ways to enjoy it.

The benefits of "cold showers" for body and mind (Cosmopolitan) - Yahoo! News
Suppresses inflammation such as muscle pain
A study published in The North American Journal of Medical Sciences examined the effectiveness of hydrotherapy (treatment using water) and found that it can have a positive effect on physical and mental healing.
By soaking in cold water after exercise, muscle pain and other inflammatory effects can be reduced.
According to Professor Douglas Casa, director of the Korey Stringer Institute, which studies sports medicine and teaches at the University of Connecticut, "It is important to exercise and take a cold shower as soon as possible. By lowering the body temperature immediately after exercise, recovery from exercise-induced inflammation and fatigue is faster."
Reduces fatigue
When you exercise in hot weather, your heart, muscles and skin need more blood flow than usual.
"During exercise, there is more blood flow to the heart because the heart rate is higher, there is more blood flow to the muscles because they need energy to contract, and there is more blood flow to the skin to regulate body temperature," Casa said.
"Taking a cold shower reduces the temperature of the skin, which reduces the blood flow to the skin. Instead, the blood flow is sent to the internal organs such as the gastrointestinal tract, making it easier to absorb water and nutrients after exercise. As a result, you can reduce the fatigue you feel after exercise."
Hoping for a hormesis effect
Ms. Drozewski also explains that the "hormesis effect" can be expected to be activated by being exposed to cold water.
The hormesis effect is the idea that a little bit of a substance or stress that is harmful to the body is better than none at all.
"Low-oxygen exercise, intermittent fasting, and cold showers are prime examples of the health benefits of hormesis. Cold showers stimulate hormones and neurotransmitters that promote physical and mental toughness and resilience."

Hanshin / Oyama, 2 rounds in a row No. 7!
Manager Yano: "It's impressive to watch" (Sankei Sports) - Yahoo! News
(Central League, Chunichi 2-5 Hanshin, 7th round, Hanshin 4 wins, 3 losses, 24th, Nagoya D) The momentum of No. 4 does not stop.
The ball soared high and landed in the middle of the left-field seats.
Oyama arches for the second game in a row and goes around the diamond.
When he returned to the bench, he showed his white teeth.
"While I was able to make a good swing, I was able to squeeze the target ball and make a swing."
He came to bat in the top of the fourth inning with the score 0-2.
He swung aggressively from the first pitch, and the second pitch after the foul.
I didn't miss Ohno's sweet 134kg slider.
The batted ball caught at the core was such a perfect hit that I was convinced it was a stand-in at the moment I hit it.
One shot in two consecutive games following the previous day's match against Hiroshima (Koshien) on the 23rd was the start of a counterattack.
It was also a valuable hit from an opponent who was not good at it.
When he played against Ohno at Koshien on the 17th, he had 9 hits and scored 4 runs.
However, as far as the Nagoya Dome is concerned, they have allowed 7 wins, 1 loss and 1 hold in the past 12 games, and have been suffering from 7 consecutive losses with a draw since August 23, 2013.
From such a difficult opponent, he took away the score for the first time in 23 innings at Nagoya Dome (dropped in the middle also counted as one inning) with a spectacular shot and did not give the flow of the game.
Manager Yano also expressed his hopes for further explosions, saying, "It's a high level to be able to shoot a sweet ball well. It's impressive to watch, and there's an atmosphere even if the timing of the shot is a foul. I think he'll continue to shoot."
In the first inning, he hit a home run to right field, marking his sixth consecutive game with a hit and third consecutive game with multiple hits.
It was a late start to the season, but with seven home runs and 16 RBIs, he is already doing a fine job as the team's top hitter and No. 4.
We will continue to deliver results in order to win.

Iwabuchi Kensuke (HC), head coach of the Japan men's rugby sevens team, said in an online interview with the press on the 25th that he was determined to "work together to achieve our goal of winning a medal" at the Tokyo Olympics, which have been postponed until next year.
In response to the postponement of the Olympics, 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympic team captain Kuwazuru Yusuke (Coca-Cola) and Fukuoka Kataki (Panasonic), who also played an active role in the 2019 15-a-side World Cup as a member of the Olympic team, have left the team.
The commander said, "Of course, it will have a big impact, but we will move forward with players who can fight together."
From this day, the team will split into Tokyo and Oita to begin the training camp for national team candidates.
The training camp with accommodation has been held since March and will be held until the 28th, but it is said that there will be no practice with contact as a measure to prevent infection of the new coronavirus.
The representative has been decided to return to the top group that can participate in all matches of the 7-a-side World Series (WS) from next season, but since the holding of the WS itself, which travels around the world, is uncertain, Iwatsuki HC has narrowed down the opponents to countries that allow the representative to enter the country and is negotiating to strengthen the game.

Macau casino supervisory authority inspects the implementation of anti-epidemic measures at casino facilities... New coronavirus negative certificate must be presented at the entrance (Macao Newspaper) - Yahoo! News
Approximately 40 casino facilities in Macau were closed for 15 days from February 5 to 19 due to the outbreak of the new coronavirus infection (COVID-19), but have resumed operations since February 20 after taking strict anti-epidemic measures.
The Macau Casino Regulatory Authority (DICJ) requires operating companies to protect the health of employees and guests as much as possible when reopening, ensuring distance between gaming (casino) tables, allowing adjacent seats to be vacated for table games (for example, three to four people can sit at one table at the same time at a baccarat table), and operating slot machines one or two at a time to reduce the risk of cross infection.
Disinfection of gaming equipment such as chips has also been strengthened.
In addition, guests are required to wear a mask, have their temperature taken, and present a valid health code (generated by entering their recent stay history, whether they have been in contact with coronavirus patients, whether they have symptoms such as fever and cough, and their contact information) upon entry.
From midnight on July 15, the presentation of a negative coronavirus nucleic acid test certificate (within the validity period issued by a licensed facility in Macao or Guangdong) has also been added to the conditions.
The background to the new requirement to present a negative certificate is the relaxation of border measures between Macao and Guangdong Province from 6 a.m. on the 15th (elimination of 14-day isolation and quarantine, subject to various conditions), which is a preventive measure.
On July 18, the DICJ announced that, in response to the change in entry conditions from the 15th of the same month, the director of the department, Adriano Ho, and others inspected the implementation of anti-epidemic measures at casino facilities, and convened a meeting with representatives of the security departments of six casino operators to reiterate their request to protect the health of employees and guests by thoroughly controlling the entry of guests.
The DICJ stated that it will continue to conduct strict patrols of casino facilities and will have the opportunity to meet with the operating company on a regular basis in accordance with the situation and evaluation, and will also adjust the anti-epidemic measures in casinos in accordance with the guidelines of the Government Health Bureau as appropriate.
Hayashimatsu, the director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of the Health Bureau, also accompanied the inspection of the casino facility, and it is said that instructions were given on how to disinfect gaming (casino) chips and how to keep a safe distance between the seats of electronic casino equipment.
In addition, due to the sharp decline in inbound passengers due to anti-epidemic measures including entry restrictions, cumulative casino sales from January to June this year decreased by 77.4% from the same period last year to 33.72 billion Macao patacas (Japanese yen equivalent: approximately 451.9 billion yen).
Light ale from Yuwaku Onsen Message to medical workers in place of Bonbori Festival next month (Hokkoku Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
At Yuwaku Onsen, where the annual "Yuwaku Bonbori Festival" was canceled due to the impact of the new coronavirus, an initiative to put up bonbori with messages of support for medical workers will begin on August 1.
The paper written by fans and local residents from all over the country will be pasted on about 350 bonfires, wrapping the town of hot springs in the light of ale and bringing healing to visitors.
The Bonbori Festival is an event that recreates the festival that appears in the anime "Hanasaku Iroha," which is modeled after Yuwaku Onsen, and is organized by the Yuwaku Onsen Tourism Association.
It started in 2011 when the anime was broadcast, and every year a large number of anime fans from all over the country visit.
Every year, from the lighting ceremony in July until the main festival in October, bonfires are lit on the steps leading to Yuwaku Inari Shrine next to Soyu.
This year, the festival had to be canceled due to the new coronavirus, but the association came up with this plan after hearing from local and national fans that "it's sad that there are no bonbori in the summer of Yuwaku."
It was billed as a "recovery campaign" with the hope of helping the world heal and recover from the hardships caused by the coronavirus.
So far, about 50 students from the local Yuwaku Elementary School and Shibahara Junior High School have each written an illustrated message, and more than 100 applications have been received from all over the country.
Message forms can be purchased from the association's website, filled out, and sent to the association in a self-addressed envelope.
At 6,000 yen per set, applications will be accepted until the total number of bonbori reaches about 350.
The bonfires are scheduled to be lit until the end of November.
Yamashita Shinichiro (48), who has been the chairman of the festival's executive committee since the first festival, said, "Reading the messages encourages us. I want to hold a grand festival next year, which will be the 10th anniversary of the festival."
For the campaign, a blooming Iroha character and a hand-drawn illustration of the Asano River Bridge have also been prepared.
From the 1st, a clear file with an illustration will be given to users of the special accommodation plan at the ryokan in Yuwaku Onsen.
Core 4 supporting Seibu "Moriyama Gaigen" is the soul of cooperation (Higashi Sports Web) - Yahoo! News
"Moriyama Gaigen," the pride of Seibu, showed the spirit of cooperation and produced the second farewell victory this season.
In the ninth inning of the 2-2 game against Lotte (MetLife) on the 24th, the four players, who are still far from their best, showed their determination to win.
Genda led off with a headfirst slide into first base on a safety bunt.
Then, No. 3 Mori, who has been at rock bottom with a batting average of 10.82 in the last six games, hit a bunt single to second base.
Yamakawa, the 4th batter, was declared out, and Tosaki, who replaced Mori and returned to the 5th batter from this day, smashed Masuda's fastball, leading to a 3-2 victory.
Hero Sotozaki said, " (Genda's safety) caught me by surprise even though I was on the bench, and I thought I had no choice but to do something about it. I got the feeling that Tomoya believed in me and connected with me on the back with a bunt. Yamakawa-san gave me a word before going to first base, saying, "Let's be aggressive!," so I was able to get into the mood," and that was the result of the thoughts of the three people who made the farewell flow.
Mori and Yamakawa, who were the first and second picks in the 2013 draft, Tonosaki, who was the third pick in 2014, and Genda, who was the third pick in 2016, are the "core four" of fielders whom team officials call "the heart of our team now."
Both have experience as captains in the amateur era, and their sense of responsibility is second to none.
Sotozaki, who took over the captaincy from Yamakawa when he was a fourth-year student at Fuji University, said, "Yamakawa is a captain who leads the team with his words because he is a good talker. On the other hand, I am not a good talker, so I left the talking to the vice-captain who is a good talker, and I was the type to stand behind him." Each of them supports the new captain, Genda, and the new player president, Mori, while demonstrating their own personalities.
Manager Tsuji praised "Genda's safety? That's not a sign. But I thought "I can go well" with that. Tomoya was also a great bunt. Sotozaki also hit well" "Moriyama Gaigen" soul cooperation.
All four of them are currently struggling with a batting average of 20 percent and 4-5 minutes, but even if they can't hit, they are supporting the team with wisdom and how to win.

Statue of Omura Masujiro as a money changer to convey his achievements as an educator [Yamaguchi] | Ube Nippo Town Media Web
On the 23rd, a bronze statue of Omura Masujiro (1825-69), who is counted as one of the ten heroes of the Meiji Restoration, was unveiled in his birthplace, Yamaguchi City.
The unveiling ceremony was held in the front yard of the newly established Jusenji Community Center, where local residents and government officials celebrated the completion.
Masujiro was a military scholar, Western scholar and doctor at the end of the Edo period and the beginning of the Meiji Restoration.
After teaching at the Shogunate's Western studies research and education institution, "Bansho Shirabesho," he opened a private school, "Kyukyodo," in Edo, where he taught Western studies, military science, and medicine.
Even after returning to the Choshu Domain, he gave lectures on military science at the Yamaguchi Meirinkan.
The statue focused on Masujiro as an educator.
Standing next to a globe and holding a book in his hand, he gave a lecture on Western studies.
The height of the statue, including the pedestal, is about 3 meters (the statue is 1.55 meters), and it is said to have been made from the perspective of a disciple attending a lecture by Masujiro.
The design was created by local designer Marie Takami (27), a descendant of Masujiro's wife, Kotoko.
The Committee for the 150th Anniversary of the Death of Omura Masujiro (chaired by Okamoto Toshi), whose parent organization is the Chusenji Neighborhood Association, raised donations to build the memorial.
About 12.8 million yen in donations were collected from 1,104 people across the country.
The cost of the project, including the installation of the name board, is approximately 12 million yen.
The excess donations will be used for the maintenance and management of the statue.
Chairman Okamoto said, "Masujiro, who continued to have high aspirations and made a great contribution as an educator, is the pride of Kori. The bronze statue will be the hope of children in the area who will be responsible for the future."
Mbappe left the venue on crutches after being substituted with an injury following a vicious tackle (SPORT.es) - Yahoo! News
Paris Saint-Germain beat Saint-Etienne 1-0 in the Coupe de France final at the Stade de France on the 24th local time to win their 13th title in two years.
PSG wins the domestic double
Neymar's last-gasp winner against Saint-Etienne Neymar's first-half goal proved to be the final straw for PSG, who won the domestic double after Ligue 1 but now find themselves in a worrying position heading into the Champions League in August.
Kylian Mbappe, who started in the same match, was substituted due to injury after a vicious sliding tackle by opposing CB Loic Perrin.
The young French star's face contorted in pain as he went down clutching his right ankle in the 30th minute of the first half.
Players from both teams came to blows and a scuffle broke out over the play.
Mbappe, who appeared to have twisted his right ankle, was unable to continue.
Perrin was shown a red card.
After the game, Mbappe left the stadium on crutches with his right leg in a brace.
PSG face Lyon in the Coupe de la Ligue final at 04:10 BST on 1 August and are unlikely to be able to call on Mbappe for that game.
We have to wait for the medical report from the club, but it is possible that he will miss the Champions League in Portugal.
Ms. Ogino (from Hachinohe) launches online art museum "HASARD" (Daily Tohoku Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
There is a museum where anyone can touch art for free, whenever they want.
The selection ranges from famous painters such as Claude Monet and Gustav Klimt to unknown artists from around the country.
Since its "opening" in April 2019, the online art museum "HASARD" has captured the hearts of users due to its convenience and novelty, and the new lifestyle caused by the corona disaster has further increased its attention.
Representative Ogino Shinnosuke (26) from Hachinohe, who launched the site and lives in Tokyo, says, "I wanted to create a service that makes it easy for everyone to enjoy art. I want people to be exposed to art, especially under difficult circumstances."
When you visit Other, you will be surprised by the richness of the exhibits and the beauty of the images.
As of the 24th, a total of 14 exhibitions, both permanent and temporary, are open to the public, attracting viewers with ultra-high resolution works that convey not only color but also the texture of the brush.
Membership registration and admission fees are not required, so not only viewers but also artists who want to hold a solo exhibition do not have to pay.
The unique way it is presented online is also attracting attention.
Moving a picture is one of them.
In Claude Monet's permanent exhibition, "It Begins to Move Again," clouds, flowers and meadows have been digitally manipulated to move.
"We want to make it possible for people with little interest in art to enter" (Representative Ogino), so you can enjoy the feeling of being in a painting.
Representative Ogino first came into contact with art when he was in elementary school.
At that time, when I visited the newly completed Aomori Prefectural Museum of Art with my family, I saw three huge paintings of "Aleko" by Marc Chagall and was shocked by their power.
From the next day, art class turned into a fun time, and even after I moved to Tokyo to go to university, I began to visit galleries.
At the same time, I felt that there are many people who do not have many opportunities to interact with art from various perspectives, such as the fact that there are no museums nearby, major exhibitions are only held in the metropolitan area, and it is difficult to go out with childcare.
So, while working at an IT-related company, he spent about two months setting up a site where people could view art on the Internet.
The number of users reached an average of 10,000 per month in the first 10 months, and increased to about 30,000 after the spread of the new coronavirus.
If you can appreciate art in a free form when you want to see it, anyone can.
Azar's aim was inadvertently accepted by more people due to the corona crisis.
Representative Ogino emphasized the significance of appreciating art, saying that it enriches the imagination.
"When you have a rich imagination, you can reach out to people in need.
I hope that by making art more accessible, we can create a better society."
The simple reason why the era of Chinese quality is over and the era of Japanese quality is coming (Contemporary Business) - Yahoo! News
Pandemic prompts shift in values
There have been various predictions and discussions about the post-pandemic world.
On the business side, there is a possibility that the changes mentioned in the July 8th article, "Actually, 'managerial' jobs are starting to disappear in Japan ...! The cruel reality," and the July 4th article, "Actually, 'Japanese manufacturing' is likely to make a big comeback in the 'post-corona' world ...!," will occur.
[Picture] The true nature of "Japan's strength" that only the Japanese don't know... an unexpected reality seen in Asia
In terms of spirituality, articles such as the one on June 26th, "Complete combustion tips for those who have become aware of the end of their lives due to corona," and the one on June 10th, "Corona, now that it is full of riots, let's review the usefulness of "relying on God in times of distress," are likely to become mainstream.
And it is the big flow of "from Chinese quality to Japanese quality" that seems to become clearly visible to our eyes as a form in which the two "materials (economy and business) " and "spirit" are combined.
For example, if there is a defect or defect in a T-shirt or digital camera, it is annoying, but there is no difference in the life of the person who purchased it.
On the other hand, the sloppy quality of Chinese-made masks and ventilators that have recently become a hot topic... "Chinese quality" in such products that are directly linked to life and safety is fatal.
You can't buy such a product no matter how cheap it is.
They will seek products of "Japanese quality" even if they have to pay a considerable price.
Of course, this trend is not just happening in Japan.
It is also clear from the fact that Western countries, which have found themselves in a difficult situation due to a shortage of masks and medical equipment, have nevertheless "returned" one after another because the "Chinese quality" was so bad.
Safety and security rather than cheapness
In addition, products such as automobiles are also products whose defects can be fatal (death by accident).
No matter how aggressive China, Korea and other countries are in their "cheap is as bad as it gets" discounting strategy, in the end they will not be able to compete with products made in Japan, leading to the situation described in the June 16th article "Will the world's automakers bow down to Toyota after all?" This is because "Japanese quality" is strongly required for products such as automobiles.
And this pandemic has reminded us that many other products also need to be "safe and secure."
In addition, safety and security are important not only for "Japanese quality in manufacturing" but also for "Japanese quality in services such as logistics."
As in the toilet paper scandal, there are times when there is sufficient production capacity, but intermediate distribution is delayed and the product does not reach the customer.
Furthermore, as in the article "Who is the real culprit of the shortage of masks! Don't allow the Chinese Communist regime to steal from the fire scene" on April 17, it made me keenly aware that self-sufficiency in Japan is also an important element of "safety and security."
In the event of an emergency, it is natural for every country to give priority to its own country, and it is very important to be able to procure essential items such as masks (medical equipment) and food within the country.
The number of new coronavirus infections in South Korea has exceeded 100 for the first time in 115 days, with 86 new cases coming from overseas (Yonhap News Agency) - Yahoo! News
Seoul Yonhap News: South Korea's Central Epidemic Prevention Headquarters announced on the 25th that the number of people infected with the new coronavirus as of midnight that day had increased by 113 from the previous day at midnight, bringing the total to 14,092.
The number of new infections per day exceeded 100 for the first time in 115 days since April 1 (101).
In addition to the 32 sailors found to be infected on a Russian ship that entered the port of Busan, it is believed that 32 of the 293 workers who returned from Iraq on the 24th tested positive.
The number of newly infected people in South Korea has been in the 30-60 range except for the 20th (26 people).
Of the new cases announced on the 25th, 86 came from overseas, the highest number since January 20, when the first case was reported in South Korea.
The largest number, 36, came from Iraq, followed by 34 from Russia, five from the Philippines and three from the United States.
On the other hand, 27 people were infected in the city, with 11 cases confirmed in Seoul and Gyeonggi-do and five cases in Busan.
The five people from Busan were employees of a repair company on board the Russian ship.
The death toll remained unchanged from the previous day at 298.
Nagoya's Miyahara tests positive for coronavirus, the first player to do so since the resumption of the J1 soccer league
Nagoya J1 football club announced on the 25th that defender Miyahara Kazuya (24) was confirmed to have tested positive for the new coronavirus.
This is the first time a player has tested positive since the J-League resumed.
He is the third player from the club to be infected, following forward Kanazaki Yumeo (31) and Australian goalkeeper Mitchell Langerak (31), who both contracted the virus in June.
They have already received treatment and returned to the game.
This season's Miyahara was on the bench for the J1 match against Oita at the Showa Denko Dome Oita on the 22nd.
Nagoya held an online press conference on the 25th and revealed that they had conducted PCR tests on 60 players and staff on the same day.

It turns out that white paint derived from Teflon-coated frying pans enhances the cooling effect with heat insulation!
What a great discovery!
This year's rainy season was marked by an unprecedented amount of precipitation, but when the sun rises, the scorching summer will be in full swing.
It's hot, it's hot, and the days are so scorching that even the air conditioning doesn't work well... just imagining it makes you feel like you're going to pass out, right?
Global warming is a major global issue, and mankind has been trying to figure out how to get through the hot midsummer as comfortably as possible.
One way to do this is to wear light, white clothing.
Look, you don't have to wear black to absorb heat in the summer, do you?
And it seems that the same principle is being applied to home construction, with an increasing number of cases in which white paint is used.
Even though white is white, it could not be made into a paint that reflects more light and does not absorb heat, and that was also the latest field of research.
Recently, the Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), in collaboration with researchers from the Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics at Columbia University, announced that they have found a way to formulate white paint that can most efficiently reflect solar heat and increase the cooling effect inside buildings.
It is said to be aimed at early practical application.
Until now, white paint with the highest reflectance of sunlight was made using titanium oxide, which has a reflectance of 85%.
White paint using titanium oxide is already being used on the roofs of buildings in high-temperature environments to block solar heat and increase cooling efficiency.
However, what has been newly discovered is a white paint derived from polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) fluoropolymer, which is used in those Teflon-coated frying pans.
This white paint, which applies the Teflon effect, is said to be able to reflect up to 98% of the sun's rays and significantly reduce heat.
Even in the hot summer, thanks to the white paint that surprisingly uses Teflon, it is easy to spend time indoors without being exposed to extreme heat.
Such an era may be just around the corner, right?
There seems to be a lot of dark colors on the roofs of Japanese houses, but maybe white will become the mainstream from now on?
When is Amazon's big annual sale this year?
CNBC reported on July 21 that Amazon.com had announced the postponement of its annual "Prime Day" sales event.
It is held in July every year, but it was reported that it had to be postponed this year due to the spread of the new coronavirus infection.
"Details will be announced soon," an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement.
"Over the past five years, Prime Day has become a special and celebratory event that we look forward to. This year, we are holding it later than usual while ensuring the safety of our employees and supporting our customers and sellers."
However, he only said that "details will be announced soon," and did not disclose the specific date of the event.
On the other hand, it was decided to hold it in India.
A press release was posted on the country's website.
He explained that it would be implemented for 48 hours from midnight on August 6.
Prime Day has always been held at the same time around the world, but this year it may take an unusual step.
A large-scale event that sells 760 billion yen in two days Amazon started this large-scale sale for members in 2015 as a measure to promote sales in the summer when sales decrease.
Initially, it was a 24-hour event, but it has expanded year by year, and last year it was held for 48 hours from midnight on July 15 in 18 countries including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, India, Japan, China and Australia.
According to the company, last year, the two-day sales exceeded the previous sales results of "Black Friday" (the first day of the year-end sales) and "Cyber Monday" (the following Monday).
This event has also contributed to the acquisition of new subscribers to the paid membership "Prime," and last year the number of applications on the first day was the highest ever for one day, and the number of applications on the next day was second to that.
It also sold 175 million products around the world last year.
Regarding this, Internet Retailer, a magazine specializing in the online shopping industry, reported that the total global sales for the two days were $7.16 billion (about 760 billion yen), an increase of 70% from the previous year.
A strict eye is kept on the transfer of mobile numbers and excessive retention.
What will happen to fees and points?
(News Switch) - Yahoo! News
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications is in the midst of a full-scale review of the Mobile Number Portability Program (MNP), which allows users to keep their existing phone numbers when changing mobile carriers.
At a meeting of experts on the 21st, they announced a plan to revise the MNP guidelines established in 2004.
Specific issues range from the nature of MNP fees to the pros and cons of retaining those who wish to move.
Amid expectations of a backlash from telecommunications companies, attention is focused on whether this will lead to the promotion of healthy competition in the market.
In 2006, when MNP was introduced, the initial user fee was 2,000 yen, but now it is 3,000 yen.
The MNP fee income of the three major mobile telecommunications companies is estimated to be 15.9 billion yen a year.
On the 21st, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications listed the current situation surrounding MNP at the "Working Group (WG) on the Verification of Competition Rules," an expert meeting to discuss the competitive environment of the telecommunications market.
The reception time for issuing MNP reservation numbers, which are required when consumers move to other telecommunications companies, was also cited as a problem.
Major telecommunications companies accept applications online, but due to the operation of their core systems, applications are generally accepted between 9 a.m. and 8 p.m.
In the WG document, it was clearly stated that, in principle, all-day support will be provided as a direction for future consideration.
They also see it as a problem that mobile phone companies are trying to retain people who want to move to MNP by giving them points.
This is based on the judgment that excessive retention could impede fair competition.
Kita Shunichi, a partner at Nomura Research Institute who serves as a member of the WG, suggests that "it is important to thoroughly go through this process first, either by taking the time to explain the provision of economic benefits or by obtaining permission from the user, and then promptly issuing a number to the user who does not give permission and ending it."
However, among a series of issues, there is a structural problem with MNP fees: "The higher they are, the more difficult it is for customers to leave, so it is difficult to motivate them to actively reduce them" (Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications official).
If a business operator takes the initiative to reduce the MNP fee, there is also concern that the outflow of customers from that company will increase and the company's efforts will not be rewarded.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications has also pointed out that many countries overseas do not require user fees for MNP, and it is conceivable that this will also be the case in Japan.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications plans to compile the results of the WG into a report around September or October, and then begin the process of revising the MNP guidelines.
It is expected that the revision will take place after 2021.
Mobile operators are likely to be left scratching their heads, including how to handle sales and customer support.
Chunichi Katsuno can't get the right to be the winning pitcher even after six scoreless innings (Sankei Sports) - Yahoo! News
Chunichi pitcher Katsuno Masayoshi (23) will start in the Hanshin 8th round (Nagoya Dome) on the 25th.
He allowed no runs on four hits in six innings.
"I thought it was my last chance because I had pitched the previous time. There was also a four-ball, but I was able to play with my opponent without worrying too much."
He pitched for the first time this season and in the previous game against Hanshin (Koshien) on the 18th, and both times he started, he struggled to control the ball and was removed by the fourth inning.
He did not play a role as a starter, and this time it was a backwater mound where he was fighting for the survival of the first team.
This time, against a strong Tiger batting line-up, he attacked aggressively with a ball full of feeling.
When he hit a fastball in the upper 140s, he was able to effectively use change-up pitches such as count pitches.
In the sixth inning, he hit a two-out double down the left-center field line against the Suns in the top of the inning, but he got Oyama to fly out to left and Boer to ground into a double play to end the inning.
In the match against Fukudome here, he drove in two pitches, and the last pitch was a fork.
He struck out swinging in a three-pitch at-bat to escape the jam.
Katsuno had 83 pitches after the sixth inning, but at the end of the middle game, manager Yoda came off the bench and announced a pitching change.
Seiyu, who played against the pitcher, had 108 pitches at the same time, but he got off the mound first and could not get the right to win for the first time this season.

The name was changed to "Hare no Megumi Okayama Brand" and a new system was established to praise excellent products.
They tried to strengthen their PR.
The certification was launched in 2004 with the aim of developing sales channels for small businesses.
Since 15 years have passed, it has been renovated.
In March of this year, 22 products, including local sake and hats handmade by artisans, were certified after a review of products recommended by various chambers of commerce and industry.
There are 121 items in total, including 99 items such as confectionery, condiments and cosmetics that have been inherited from the old brand.
We will continue to recruit in the future.
Products with particularly outstanding quality are awarded the "Best Selection Award."
This time, it was given to Hiruzen Jersey Yogurt from Hiruzen Dairy Farming Cooperative (Maniwa City).
For the "Challenge Award" for innovative products, Asahi Tex (Bizen City) 's "Canned Kakioko" was selected.
All products will be introduced with photos, and 10,000 copies of a catalog with prices and sales locations will be produced.
In addition to sending them to buyers across the country and trading companies that handle exports, they are also distributed free of charge at tourist information centers in the prefecture.
A logo combining peach blossoms and fruit has also been created, and certified products can be affixed with a sticker.
The federation said, "All of our products are made using local resources. We want to raise awareness and convey the appeal of our products through the renovation."

Masuda Shrine, located in the Takagushi district of Tano, Hizen-cho, Karatsu, is dedicated to police officer Masuda Keitaro (1869-95), who died in the line of duty while working to combat the cholera epidemic that spread through the region 125 years ago.
The annual grand festival has been held every year in late July, but this year it was canceled due to the impact of the new coronavirus.
On the 26th, only a Shinto ritual will be held by the chairman of the local government.
At the annual festival, the neighborhood association held a parade with a float of Officer Masuda riding a white horse and fireworks were set off.
Every year, nearly 200 people attend, including bereaved families living in Kumamoto Prefecture, police officers, and local residents.
This year, there has been an increase in inquiries from the media due to the corona crisis, and the chairman of the neighborhood association, Takeda Yoshinori (72), says, "The annual festival that has been connected in the community is crowded every year. It is very disappointing that it has been canceled."
The prefectural police have also cancelled this year's memorial service, which is attended by police academy students.
On the 21st, Chief Superintendent Sugiuchi Yumiko and Chief Fukushima Hiroto Karatsu visited Komatsushima Island, which is located off the coast of Takakushi Port, and laid flowers at the monument.
Chief Sugiuchi said, "A brave and dedicated spirit is the origin of the police. I would like to pass it on as the way it should be."
Officer Masuda, who was born in Kumamoto Prefecture, was assigned to Takagushi in July 1895.
He worked tirelessly to implement countermeasures, including disinfecting patients' homes, and later contracted cholera himself.
He said, "I will carry all of Takagushi's cholera on my back," and died at the age of 25 just four days after taking up the post.

Dodgers sign Betts to 12-year deal worth 39.1 billion yen
It is the second largest in history after Angels Trout!
Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder Mookie Betts has signed a new contract.
He was transferred from the Boston Red Sox during the off-season.
Ahead of his first year at the new ground, he has signed a contract until 2032.
U.S. media "CBS Sports" and other companies reported on the 22nd (Japan time 23rd).
Video: R Sox Betts shows off his many talents!
You can do things like this outside of baseball!
Betts made his major league debut in 2014 at the age of 21.
He has contributed to the team as the center of the Boston Red Sox's powerful batting lineup and as a strong-shouldered right fielder.
He is like the pinnacle of middle-distance hitters, recording more than 40 doubles every year from 2015 to last season.
In 2018, when he became the best in the world, he was the top batter and MVP with a batting average of .346.
According to CBS Sports, Betts turned down a 10-year, $300 million offer from the Red Sox last year.
He was traded to the Dodgers along with left-handed ace pitcher David Price in exchange for cash and several players.
His contract for this season is for one year and 27 million dollars (about 2.9 billion yen).
The new contract reported this time is for 12 years from the 2021 season to the 2032 season, with a total value of 365 million dollars (about 39.1 billion yen).
The biggest contract in MLB right now is Los Angeles Angels outfielder Mike Trout's 12-year, $426 million deal.
Betts' deal is the second-largest to date.
With Betts set to become a free agent this offseason, there was bound to be a bidding war when he hit the market.
It will follow the recent trend of signing long-term and expensive contracts before becoming a free agent.
In a tumultuous MLB, Betts has found long-term stability.

Dr. Akio Kinoshita, Director of the Department of Ophthalmology at Hiramatsu Hospital, explains the causes of dry eyes at the Yonezawa Saga flagship store in Saga
Head of the Department of Ophthalmology at Hiramatsu Hospital, Kinoshita Akio, explains dry eyes at the "Hot Seminar" held at Yonezawa Saga flagship store in Saga
On the 25th, a "Healthy Hot Seminar" (hosted by Saga Shimbun and co-hosted by Yonezawa Glasses) was held at the Yonezawa Saga flagship store in Shimoda-cho, Saga, where experts offered advice on various health-related issues.
Kinoshita Akio, Director of the Department of Ophthalmology at Hiramatsu Hospital (Ogi), explained about eye diseases that are closely related to daily life, such as dry eyes and cataracts.
Dry eye is said to be a "disease of tears," explaining that it is a disease in which the quality of tears breaks down and tears do not spread evenly over the surface of the eye.
Ms. Kinoshita said, "People who wear contact lenses are about four times more likely to get it," and cautioned, "Don't use them for a long time or sleep with them on."
They showed countermeasures such as placing the computer screen below eye level and humidifying in air-conditioned rooms.
Ingredients and foods that are effective for dry eyes were also introduced.
"Omega-3, which is found in bluefish, prevents the evaporation of tears, while mucin, which is abundant in natto and okra, improves the quality of tears."
As for cataract surgery, there are single-focus and multi-focus intraocular lenses that are inserted in place of the lens, and he touched on the differences in vision.

[G Osaka] What are the chances of 17-year-old forward Karayama making his J1 debut against Kobe?
Manager Miyamoto: "His scoring ability is outstanding" (Sports Hochi) - Yahoo! News
G Osaka coach Miyamoto Tsuneyasu (43) revealed his expectations for high school junior forward Karayama Shoji (17), who became a member of the first team for the first time in the previous season, in an interview on the 25th ahead of the match against Kobe (Noesta on the 26th), where they will be looking for their fourth consecutive win.
The captain made Karayama, who was promoted to the top flight this season, a member of the bench for the match against Hiroshima on the 22nd.
Although he was not given a chance to play, he ordered the striker, who has scored three goals in five games in J3 so far this season, "There is something outstanding about scoring points. I am 17 years old, but I want you to be more aggressive. I have seen players go abroad at a young age, but I want you to play with high awareness and greed."
Karayama played 10 games and scored 8 goals in J3 last season, where he appeared as a specially designated player.
Although he is slender at 178 cm and 65 kg, he boasts a phenomenal scoring rate of 11 goals in 15 games in J3 with weapons such as the sense to take the back of the defender with instantaneous movement and the calmness to shoot in front of a crowded opponent's goal.
Against Hiroshima, FW Ademiuson and MF Onose were out of the bench due to injury, and although Karayama got a chance, he did not have a chance to play.
Miyamoto explained the condition of Ademiuson and Onose for the match against Kobe, saying, "Both of them are not 100%, but they are highly motivated to prepare for the match."
If they are spared, there is a possibility that they will be benched again in Karayama.
In G Osaka, midfielder Doyasu (currently of PSV) made his J1 debut at the age of 16 years and 11 months, and forward Usami made his debut at the age of 17 years and 0 months, before moving abroad as a teenager.
Karayama, who is currently 17 years and 10 months old and is expected to be the next talent, is also expected to make his J1 debut as a successor to them.
A Ferrari stolen 26 years ago is found at the bottom of a river (octane.jp) - Yahoo! News
In 1994, a Ferrari Mondial was stolen in the Netherlands.
Time passed without the police being able to solve the case, but 26 years later, the Mondial was miraculously found.
The Ferrari found at the bottom of the river (photo 4) The discovery was triggered by the fire department's diving training.
On 8 July, a diver on a training exercise spotted something in the shape of a wedge sinking to the bottom of the river. Police and even the Dutch army were called in to retrieve the object, which turned out to be a Ferrari Mondial.
By matching the VIN number to a database of stolen cars, they were able to link the Ferrari to the 1994 case.
The car was handed over to its legal owner, an insurance company, and has since been sent to a scrap dealer.
Scrap dealer Lowie van DE Ooyevaar said: "There are still a few parts left, but they are for decorative art. We have already received a lot of requests from people who want to make a table out of the dismembered Mondial. We use engine blocks and glass plates."
For the time being, there are no concrete plans to sell it, and it will be stored by a scrap dealer as an object.
Seibu and Tosaki bid farewell for the first time
In his sixth year as a pro, the "man who doesn't have it" finally has it!
(Sankei Sports) - Yahoo! News
(Pa League, Seibu 3x-2 Lotte, 9th round, Seibu 6 wins, 3 losses, 24th, MetLife) It is a white star of obsession ! !
On the 24th, Seibu infielder Sotozaki Shuta (27) hit his first walk-off hit in his sixth year as a pro to left field in the ninth inning of the Lotte 9th round (MetLife), contributing to a 3-2 victory.
He took advantage of the opportunities created by Genda's head sliding and Mori's attack.
The team that won the competition as a whole had a saving of 2.
The voltage of the Leo Party, packed into their home base, the MetLife Dome, reached its climax.
This is the first time in his sixth year as a professional that Tonosaki has had a bye.
It thrilled the crowd of 4,825.
"Minamoto (Genda) and Tomoya (Mori) connected with me, so I went into the at-bat with the feeling that I would do something about it." My colleague's obsession with winning inspired the number 5.
The ninth inning ended in a 2-2 tie.
The leadoff hitter, Genda, attempted a safety bunt and slid headfirst into first base.
When he got on base with an infield hit, Mori, who was the leading hitter last season, scored his second professional hit.
Yamakawa, in 4th place, shied away from declaring.
A senior at Fuji University was made to walk, and Sotozaki's heart was on fire.
"I was thinking, "Damn." Yamakawa-san said to me before I went to first base, "You have to be aggressive," and that made me feel good."
From the first ball, he got stuck on a fastball with a high inside angle, but the batted ball fell in front of the left.
Throughout his amateur days, he said goodbye with the words "I have no memory."
The 27-year-old, who was also inspired by the fact that his alma mater, Aomori Hirosaki Real High School, advanced to the top four of the summer prefectural tournament for the first time in 20 years, took a water shower of joy and said with a smile, "As expected, it felt good."
He was called "the man who didn't have it."
He was selected by Samurai Japan as a versatile player who can defend the infield and outfield, and contributed to the world's best in the "Premier 12" in November last year.
However, at Seibu, he did not have the experience of hitting a walk-off home run, and he was bullied by Manager Tsuji and Coach Baba, who was also the fielding and base running coach, saying, "You don't have it, do you."
They rebounded from a negative reputation to win their second bye this season.
Manager Tsuji praised, "I asked the goddess of victory to do it just for today. She hit it well."
With two saves, they are in third place, one game behind the leader, SoftBank.
With only one home run so far this season, Tozaki, who has a batting average of 252, said, "We still need to hit more. We will work as a team to aim for the next victory."
The stroke that decided the match will be the trigger for a comeback.

What was the difference between life and death?
"It was luck. I was able to dodge the bullet and was completely unharmed."

Chunichi and Takahashi contribute to preemptive strike, "We'll get it back as soon as possible" (Sankei Sports) - Yahoo! News
(Central League, Chunichi 1-0 Hanshin, 8th round, 4 wins, 4 losses, 25th, Nagoya D) On the 25th, Chunichi infielder Takahashi Shuhei (26), who had been out of the lineup with a torn labrum in his left thigh, appeared as a pinch hitter at second base in the seventh inning of the Hanshin 8th round.
The result was two goals.
Fukuda led off the inning with a single to center field, and Ishikawa Takashi (Higashikuni High School), who was in first place in D, laid down a bunt single to put runners on first and second.
This is where the number "3," which was just promoted on this day, comes in.
A big cheer went up from the Chinese and Japanese fans packed into the Nagoya Dome.
The result was a run-scoring double off the bat on Seiyu's first-pitch slider, but the minimum amount of work resulted in a two-out triple, and Iryo followed with a first-pitch infield hit.
"It would be ideal to get a hit, but I'm happy that Iryo-san got a hit and got a point," he said happily.
Originally, it was expected to take three to four weeks to return, but it took a full two weeks to get back up to speed.
Manager Yoda also said, "I think (the condition) is about 70 to 80%. This is my own feeling, so it feels like that in the part I'm looking at, but I think it's enough and faster recovery than expected. I wasn't particularly concerned about the way I ran after hitting, and I think that if I get used to it gradually, the start will be close."
Takahashi himself is determined to "get back what I lost as soon as possible."
A reliable captain will push the team forward.
Torrential rain leaves its mark on "traffic" in the far north: 10km of National Route 152 is closed, and some sections of the JR Iida Line are impassable
On the afternoon of the 22nd, Ryuzan-cho, Tenryu-ku, Hamamatsu, National Route 152 was completely closed to traffic, and a line of cars waited for the detour of one-way alternating traffic. (Some of the photos have been edited.)
In July, torrential rains caused extensive damage in Kyushu and other parts of Japan, and the Tenryu area of Hamamatsu City was severely affected in Shizuoka Prefecture.
The impact of the landslide disaster remains on key roads such as National Route 152 and the JR Iida Line, the "foot of daily life," and there are many areas that will take time to restore.
In addition to the inconvenience of daily life, residents are increasingly worried about the negative impact on economic activities.
At Sejiri Bridge, which spans the Tenryu River in Ryuzan-cho, there is a long line of cars waiting to cross during the day.
The lead car remained stationary for nearly 40 minutes.
National Route 152 will be completely closed for about 10 kilometers, and it will be necessary to detour to the opposite bank of the Tenryu River to move around the town.
However, the road is narrow and all sections are one-way alternating traffic, so the waiting time is unpredictable.
In the town, a landslide occurred on the national highway on the 9th, and the road was closed due to the danger of falling rocks on the nearby slope.
On the 13th, a crack was found in the Akiba Tunnel within the regulated section, and it is not yet clear when traffic will resume.
In 2018, a landslide closed a national highway in the town, disrupting residents' lives and tourism.
Tamamoto Kimie (76), the representative of the Dragon Mama processing plant, which sells specialty products, said, "This is a follow-up to the loss of customers due to the new coronavirus. The number of visitors has dropped significantly."
The JR Iida Line was closed between Mizukubo Station (Mizukubo-cho, Iida Ward) and Hiraoka Station (Nagano Prefecture) due to a slope collapse on the side of the track.
Mr. Ukai (16), who used to go to Hamamatsuko Kita High School Sakuma Branch in Sakuma-cho in the same ward from Daarashi Station (the same town) in the inaccessible section, had to be picked up and dropped off by car, which took about an hour each way.
"If it's a car, it's a big burden on both my parents and myself," he said, hoping for an early recovery.
According to JR Central, it is expected to take about three months to reopen, and from the 27th, a special train will run back and forth between Mizukubo Station and Oarashi Station in the morning and evening on weekdays.
In the town of Mizukubo, landslides frequently occur on forest roads that are also used as residential roads.
In some cases, the detour takes several hours.
Kumagai Keiji (69), the head of the Mizukubo Forestry Association, frowns as he says, "The delivery of logs is also delayed. There are isolated islands of land everywhere. I'm worried about the rain in the future."
Nakajima Shoya's absence from the victory ceremony was his own choice?
Local media reports (Football Channel) - Yahoo! News
Japan midfielder Nakajima Shoya appears to be on his way out of Porto.
Portugal's "ZAP" reported based on information from "Record."
Porto, who won the Portuguese league in the 2019/20 season, held a victory ceremony on the pitch during the last home game on the 20th of this month.
However, the fact that Nakajima was not present at this place was becoming a hot topic.
Nakajima, who refused to join the team practice during the suspension of the league due to the new coronavirus, has been absent since then.
In such circumstances, his absence from the victory ceremony has led to speculation about a transfer this summer.
According to Record, Porto had invited Nakajima to the ceremony.
However, it was just that Nakajima did not show up.
As a result, "Nakajima is increasingly out of Sergio Conceição's plans for next season and will need to leave the club in the next transfer window."
Nakajima, who wore the number 10 shirt at the prestigious Portuguese club, looks set to leave the club after just one year.
They may have already started looking for a new home.
Ring of light and horizontal rainbow co-star Yamagata observes sun halo and annular horizontal arc |Yamagata Newspaper
Horizontal rainbow-colored horizontal arcs appeared simultaneously under the halo surrounding the sun at 8:43 a.m. on the 24th near Takado, Yamagata.
A phenomenon that appears to be a halo of light surrounding the sun and a horizontal arc of rainbow-colored light appeared simultaneously in Yamagata City just before 9 a.m. on the 24th.
According to the Yamagata Regional Meteorological Observatory, both the solar halo and the annular horizontal arc are phenomena caused by the refraction and reflection of sunlight hitting fine ice crystals in clouds.

Sun halos are a relatively common phenomenon, but annular horizontal arcs do not appear as frequently as sun halos.

In 45% of households, the wife holds the purse strings!
Is my husband happy or unhappy?
Do you have a wife who gets excited or angry when her husband says, "I don't have enough pocket money this month..."?
The family in which this conversation takes place is one in which the wife holds the purse strings.
How many families are there in the world where the wife holds the purse strings?
Also, let's take a look at the percentage of "husband and wife wallets" and "jointly managed" together.
Who holds the purse strings in your household?
Matsui Securities Co., Ltd. conducted an Internet survey of 400 men and women in their 20s and 30s (young couples) who have been married for three years or less, and 400 men and women in their 50s and 60s (mature couples) who have been married for 30 years or more, for a total of 800 people.
Who holds the purse strings in your household?
Wives: 45.0% Husbands: 24.8% The number of households where the wife is in charge of the household budget is the highest.
No matter who is in charge, there are twists and turns in household management, but it seems that there are various episodes.
His wife manages the family finances: In Ako's case, Ako is a stay-at-home mother who has a daughter in her third year of high school and a daughter in her first year of high school.
Ako is in full control of the family finances.
With cram school fees piling up ahead of university entrance exams, there were many months when I was in the red, so I negotiated with my husband to lower my allowance, but as expected, he resisted.
At that time, he said, "Let me see what kind of income and expenditure you have," so I showed him my household account book.
I should have listed all my expenses, but when I looked at my household budget, I didn't have enough income to be in the red.
She almost leaned over to her husband and said, "That's enough," but without thinking, Ako said, "I understand, I'm not strong enough to manage the household budget, so please take care of everything for me."
Later, when Ako interviewed her husband, he said, "Although I am dissatisfied with how my allowance is managed, the truth is that I don't have the time or energy to manage various household expenses (for example, school materials and PTA expenses)."
The husband manages the household budget: In the case of Child B. Child B, a stay-at-home mother, is given living expenses by her husband and manages them on a daily basis.
Last spring, the freezer part of the refrigerator broke, so Ms. B asked her husband to buy her a refrigerator.
However, my husband was reluctant to replace it, saying, "The freezer is no good, but I can still use the refrigerated part, so it's okay."
However, in the summer, it seems that her husband wanted to create an environment where he could eat ice cream whenever he wanted, so he turned his palm over and said, "Let's buy a refrigerator after all."
Unexpectedly, Ms. B complained to her friend, "My husband is so stingy that I can't make ends meet."

Japanese international midfielder Kubo Takefusa (19), who played for Mallorca in the Spanish first division this season, seems to be gradually narrowing down his transfer destinations.
Although Mallorca were relegated to the second division, Kubo's performance at the end of the season saw his reputation soar.
However, it is difficult to return to Real Madrid in the first division, which has "ownership rights" due to the non-EU quota, so he plans to play at another club next season.
He has already received offers from around 30 clubs, but Real Madrid want him to train with a club in the country.
The Spanish newspaper "Marca" reported that first division clubs such as Real Sociedad, Villarreal, Granada, Getafe and Betis are likely to be Kubo's transfer destination, and that "five clubs are interested in acquiring Kubo, but R Madrid wants a club above the middle of the league."
Among them, Villarreal and R Sociedad have the right to participate in the European League (EL) next season, and Granada will also participate from the second round of EL qualifying and meet the team conditions required by R Madrid.
What kind of decision will the world's number one big club make on the departure of "Japan's treasure"?

The Ichijodani Asakura Clan Ruins in Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture, on the evening of July 24th, with the Karamon Gate illuminated by the brightly colored fireworks launched in a nationwide event
On the evening of July 24, less than a year before the start of the Tokyo Olympics, which were postponed due to the spread of the new coronavirus, a nationwide fireworks event was held by the Japan Junior Chamber (JC) in an attempt to brighten up society as much as possible.
Unfortunately, the weather in Fukui Prefecture was rainy, but the balloons were launched as scheduled at nine locations, brightening up the summer night sky.
JC called on each block council across the country to overcome the sense of blockage caused by the spread of the infection, hoping that it would be a signal for Japan to be reborn.
It will start at 8 p.m. at 117 locations in 46 prefectures.
At the Ichijodani Asakura Clan Ruins in Fukui City, a total of 53 projectiles from Nos. 2 to 4 were launched over a period of about 2 minutes while the surrounding mountains were shrouded in mist.
The light from the fireworks made the Karamon Gate and other structures appear in the darkness of the night, creating a magical atmosphere.
In the prefecture, it was also held at Matsubara Beach in Tsuruga City and along the Mana River in Ono City.
In order to prevent infection, the launch site was not announced in advance in order to avoid large crowds of onlookers.
