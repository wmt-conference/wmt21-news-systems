Honoka becomes [Tanaka Minami's style hair]!
Report on the full picture of the cut (CanCam.jp) - Yahoo! News
Add a layer to the heavy semi-long to make your hair fluffy
CanCam model Honoka challenged a moving hairstyle like Tanaka Minami, who admires her, saying, "Not only is she beautiful, but she also has a high level of professionalism and I respect her!"
We asked Asahi Mitsuteru of the hair salon "SUNVALLY" in Omotesando, who actually handles Tanaka Minami's haircut, to make her "Minami-style hair".
Here's a report on the cutting process!
Nogizaka 46 Yamashita Mitsuki has short hair for the first time on the cover!
First of all, check the faint hair before cutting.
Thin, soft, and large.
It has a habit, and it gets fluffy, especially during the rainy season, so I sometimes apply a straight perm.
It is a heavy semi-long with flowing bangs combined.
The cut has finally started!
First of all, lightly wet the whole to make it easy to cut.
After that, remove the top of the bee (the part above the most protruding perimeter of the head) and cut it from the bottom.
By the way, here are the key points of hair that will bring you closer to Minami!
1Table bang By making the inside of the bangs slightly shorter, you can enjoy changes depending on the styling, such as slightly thicker when you lower it full, and see-through when you divide it lightly.
A cut that makes use of 2 habits If you reduce the amount of hair too much, it may spread well.
While consulting about the balance around that, it is easy to handle but difficult to spread, and maintains a balance that makes one's own swells live.
3 A layer around the face and a fluffy hair layer = a cut that is cut with steps.
Putting a layer around your face makes it easier to move, giving it a cute finish.
If you make the fluffy hair in three locations: the temple and the front and back of the miage, it will look stylish even when you quickly turn it into hair.
Once you've cut the hair on the bee, it's around your face.
Pull out the upper hair bundles around the face forward and cut the tip of the hair slightly.
This way, when the hair bundle is lowered, there are steps, making it easier to move (this is the layer cut).

"The important thing is not to put it all together as a city at night. It's important to clearly distinguish between restaurants that are taking measures to combat infectious diseases and those that don't. It's also important to make efforts to increase the number of restaurants that will do it."

Taneichi, Lotte's fourth year after graduating from high school, is the first professional to complete!
4th Yasuda V hit, Toritani hit 2-point hit (Baseball King) - Yahoo!News
Seibu 0-5 Lotte ○ <10th round, MetLife Dome< Lotte's starter, Taneichi Atsuki, threw 136 balls in nine innings by himself, and in his fourth year, he was happy to be the first professional to complete.
He scored his third win with the best ride to complete the Pa League this season, stopping the team's consecutive losses at 2.
For the first time, Taneichi allowed the lead Suzuki Shohei to go to base with a double run defeating the third base track, but immediately after that, he defeated Genda Sosuke with three rumbles, and during this time Suzuki Masamasa, who was aiming to advance to the base, also touched out at the third base.
He was also helped by the calm response of his ally defense, and after getting through the pinch of standing up at zero, from the two innings onwards, he was at the mercy of the Seibu batting line with a combination of sliders and forks, centering on his proud straight.
He got his hip up and lined up zeros on the scoreboard.
The batting line was struggling to hit the starting opponent, Honda Keisuke, but Kanno Takeshi, 3rd in the lead seven times, went to base in four balls, and Oka Omi, the substitute, succeeded in stealing two.
Taking this opportunity, 4th Yasuda Naonori hit a right front strike with a value of 1,000 money, finally breaking the equilibrium.
Then, in the next eight innings, he attacked his opponent in 3rd place, Miyagawa Tetsu, and scored four points at once, including a timely 2-point hit in the middle left for the first time since Toritani Takashi, who was competing on the way, was transferred.
They folded up as if pushing the back of Marines' young ace candidate, and decided on the game at once.
After Taneichi cleared up eight times after a three-party retreat, he played nine times in a row, exceeding 100 balls.
He said, "I did my best," which led to a pinch of two-death bases in four balls in a row, but at the end he took the tenth strike of the day with a high straight from Spangenberg and set the game.
He chewed his joy with a smile.
Bye-bye to accident in new operation Tsuruoka Station works with related organizations to raise safety awareness|Yamagata Newspaper
At the bicycle class held as the start of the operation, a collision test between a car and a bicycle was conducted = Shoko Gakuen Automobile School, Tsuruoka City
In recent years, Tsuruoka Police Station (Chief Sato Keizo) has launched "Operation Zero Buy-by Accidents" in an effort to eliminate accidents involving bicycles and motorcycles, which occur at a high rate within the jurisdiction.
In addition to raising awareness of accident prevention together with traffic safety organizations within their jurisdiction, they will also strengthen the crackdown on violations of traffic rules on bicycles.
This year, three traffic fatal accidents occurred within the department's jurisdiction, killing a person who was driving a motorcycle or bicycle.
Although the number of accidents has been on a declining trend, as of June 30th, accidents involving bicycles accounted for about 11.7%, and motorcycles accounted for about 5.8%, all of which are higher than the prefectural average.
In particular, the incidence of bicycle accidents over the past five years has exceeded the prefectural average, and a strategy was planned to overcome this situation.
The name of the operation multiplied "bike" and "bicycle" with the meaning of eradicating accidents.
Affiliated organizations will be called on to provide driving guidance to the elderly and make use of nightlight reflective materials at traffic safety classes more than ever before.
In the event of a crackdown, the department will issue a yellow card (guidance warning form) to encourage caution.
The opening ceremony for the operation was held on the 21st at the Shoko Gakuen Automobile School in Tsuruoka.
Approximately 30 people involved were in attendance, and Chief Sato said, "We would like to ask for your cooperation to reduce tragic accidents as much as possible."
A person in charge of the department presented the policy and the activities of each organization.
A bicycle class will continue to be held as the start of the operation.
They demonstrated how the impact on a bicycle differs between a police officer in a car applying a brake and colliding with a bicycle, and a collision at a speed of about 55 km/h without stepping on the brake.
Kanai Koichi, chairman of the Tsuruoka District Regional Traffic Safety Activity Promotion Committee, said, "I realized once again the horror of traffic accidents. I would like to call attention not only to the elderly but also to young people."

On the 25th, the first regular yose in five months was held at the public yose "Comedy Akasaka-tei" (Sobun, Akaiwa City), which had been closed due to the new coronavirus.
Kaminarimon Kisuke (75), a rakugo storyteller based in Akasaka-tei, and others invited visitors to laughter with their professional storytelling.
At the request of a vassal who has been ordered by the lord to prohibit alcohol, Kisuke performed a "Forbidden Sake Banya" in which a liquor store trying to bring in sake interacts humorously with the gatekeeper.
They laughed over and over again at the crisp way of speaking and the gesture of drinking deliciously.
A male office worker (58) from Naka-ku, Okayama City, who visited with a couple, said with a smile, "The way of speaking and interval were exquisite, and I was immediately drawn in."
Kisuke said, "This was my first performance in a long time and my voice wasn't feeling well, but it was a fulfilling time."
The guest rakugo storyteller, Katsura Kodome (31) from Osaka, and the magic group Tsuyama Magic Club also appeared.
Comedy Akasakatei opened in 1996 in the former Akasaka-cho as the first public yose theater in Japan.
They continued to hold regular yose and delivery yose once a month, but due to the influence of the new corona, the yose was canceled after the last performance in February of this year.

Moscow Kyodo News: A demonstration was held on site on the 25th, protesting the detention and dismissal of Governor Hulgal in the Russian Far East Khabarovsk region.
The demonstration has been held for the 15th consecutive day, making it an unusual situation.
Criticism has also been directed at President Putin.
Security authorities have not always taken measures in the capital city of Moscow, and the administration's cautious stance of giving due consideration to the sentiment of the residents has been blurred.
Former governor Hulgar, who belongs to the far-right Liberal Democratic Party, won an overwhelming victory over the incumbent candidate for Putin's ruling party "United Russia" in the gubernatorial election in 2018, with a voting rate of about 70%.
He was one of the few non-ruling governors in Russia, but was detained by security authorities on the 9th of this month.
The suspicion was announced that he was involved in two murders of a businessman between 2014 and 2005.

Butler once again praises Tyler Hero, a young warrior responsible for the future of heat, "The way of thinking is not that of a rookie" (basket count) - Yahoo!News
Photo by Getty Images Heat scrimmage (practice match) In the first game they played against the Kings.
In this match, which was a great victory in 104-98, Duncan Robinson scored 18 team high goals, followed by Tyler Hero scored 15 goals.
In addition to Robinson, one of the best shooters in the league, stepping up the rookies and heroes who have been nominated for 13th place in the draft will be an important factor for the heat.
The hero missed 15 games from February to March due to an ankle injury, and the season was long suspended after the return match against Hornets on March 12th.
The hero said, "I had plenty of time, so I was able to regain 100% of my condition. I feel the best I've ever felt," but his performance at Scrimage was more convincing than words.
Due to the delay in joining the starting point guard, Kendrick Nang, the hero's play time increased, and he took advantage of that opportunity.
The value is great because he scored 15 points after brilliantly playing a different role than usual.
Team leader Jimmy Butler once again praised his "favorite" hero.
"He's a handler, he can score, he can defend. He's a player who can do everything for the team. The reason he can do anything in any position is because his way of thinking isn't that of a rookie. He's watching the video, researching, and thinking about where and how his teammates move and go freelance, and what he should do about it."
Even before the start of this season, the butler has liked the strength of losing like a hero rookie, as well as his stoic attitude towards playing basketball.
That's why I invited them to individual practice that starts at 4 o'clock in the morning and trained together.
Butler once said, "He expresses his opinion to everyone, and he doesn't back down. I can respect that fighting spirit."
The butler is the type who always says what he thinks, and he is aware that if he thinks it will be good for the team, there will be a clash, so he confronts harsh opinions.
In the past, this has led to a deterioration in his relationship with his teammates.
The butler must be superimposing his young self as a hero.
The character of a butler who is sometimes too intense for his teammates is a good guide for those who have enough guts to follow him.
If the teacher-student relationship between the two who respect each other spreads to the whole team, Heat should be able to become a team that can aim at an even higher level.

Hamamatsu Castle Hokko was unable to take advantage of the opportunity for two-death bases in the final round.
4th round led by 3 years
2nd year, Matsuura, first strike of gratitude
The person who lost his opponent's appearance was 4th in his second year, when he played for the first time this summer.
Shimada merchant Matsuura hit the changing ball with an immortal base for the first time and carried it to the left front.
"If I lost three years, I would retire immediately. I wanted to hit him and let him win."
The great talent, who was in 4th place last fall, was proud.
In the first to third rounds, they fought mainly for three years, with the powerful two years ahead.
Coach Ikeda gathered players at the meeting and told Nine, "Three years have been connected so far. I'm going to be the best member in the future."
On this day, four of the nine stamen players solidified their main axis in two years.
It looks ruthless, but it is proof that he is committed to a serious game.
Matsuura was reassuring, saying, "From now on, the level of the opposing pitcher will also go up. I will face it with the intention of sending the runner home."
Saito, who made consecutive pitches, was a good hit that kept six innings to one hit and didn't even step on second base, showing his stubbornness for the past three years.
His number 10 was accepted favorably as a synergistic effect, saying, "Two years will stimulate me for three years. I hope it will lead to victory."
The team that is aiming to be in the top four for the third consecutive year, including the Shizuoka tournament up until last year, does not intend to make memories of the remaining games.
Sixteen musicians related to Fukushima gather in the world of singing voice with the people of the prefecture (Fukushima Minpo) - Yahoo!News
I want to deliver the cheerful singing voices of Hama, Naka and Aizu all over the world.
Sixteen musicians related to Fukushima Prefecture came together to create a message song.
The lyrics depict Fukushima Prefecture's dedication to fighting the new coronavirus, moving towards recovery from the Great East Japan Earthquake and TEPCO's Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident.
Breathing the singing voices of the people of the prefecture, the "complete version" will be completed by next summer, which marks the 10th anniversary of the earthquake.
On the 24th, the song was released on the video posting site "YouTube".
The title of the song is "Play from Fukushima".
The cheerful and energetic melody expresses the desire to convey people's positive attitude from Fukushima.
Due to the influence of the new corona, the live house, which will be the base for their musical activities, has been forced to be closed, and many musicians have lost their place to sing and perform.
In order to believe in the power of music because it's a time when you can't see the future, it was planned by singer-songwriter nappo (46), who lives in Minamisoma, and DAZU-O (37) of Iwaki's music group Mehikari Boys.
Nappo is in charge of lyrics and composition, while Dazuo is in charge of rap.
When the project started in March after the corona disaster, singer-songwriters Manami (28) and Kanno Jun (38) from Fukushima agreed one after another, and the circle expanded in the blink of an eye.
"It has become a gorgeous lineup that is unthinkable in normal times. I want to fully enjoy this opportunity," Nappo said with emotion.
There was no opportunity for 16 people to gather as a countermeasure against infection, and each of them was recorded at a live house and at home.
In order to support the project, Koa, a painter from Iwaki, drew an image character.
In the shape of Fukushima Prefecture, it expresses the rich natural climate in blue and green.
The completed song will be disseminated to the world on YouTube, and will also be made into a CD.
Next year marks the 10th anniversary of the earthquake, and the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games, which have been postponed, are also scheduled.
Dazuo said, "After overcoming difficulties, we have a lot to shoulder. I'd be happy if releasing a song at a milestone will encourage many people."

Crises are instantly detected from online information, and hoaxes are also determined (JBpress) - Yahoo!News
I want to know as soon as possible where and what kind of disasters and accidents occurred! '
There is a strong need not only for the press such as television and newspapers, but also for many companies such as social infrastructure companies and local governments.
A service that responds to this is "Spectee" developed by Spectee, a company that analyzes information using AI.
Photo: A specialist team determines the authenticity of social media information through alerts from Specti
Today, the first way for people to learn about the occurrence of disasters and accidents is shifting from television to online information (social media).
Social media such as Twitter have become important media to disseminate information immediately after a disaster or accident occurs.
However, it is difficult by hand to constantly watch the overflowing information and extract useful information from it.
Specti has the ability to detect things related to natural disasters and accidents from information flowing through social media such as Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, analyze the contents, determine whether the information is true or not, and then distribute it to users.
"We position a wide range of negative impact events that suspend or stagnate social activities as "crisis" (Murakami Kenjiro, CEO), and it is a crisis management support service that visualizes various crises occurring both in Japan and abroad.
NHK at the time of the Kumamoto earthquake that struck in April 2016 was the first major use case of Specti, and since then the trend of recruitment has spread rapidly among companies.
In addition to the press such as TV stations and newspapers, more than 350 companies in Japan, including companies that support social infrastructure such as electricity, gas and transportation, as well as local governments all over the country, are currently using Specti.
Analyze posts to determine the type of "crisis" and where it occurs
Specti distributes information through four steps: "collecting information", "analysis and content classification", "titleing", and "judging authenticity".
Companies must designate in advance the areas where information will be collected (prefectures, municipalities, etc.) and crisis categories (disasters, accidents, etc.).
Specti collects posts that correspond to that designation using the APIs provided by social media.
Next, the text, images and videos contained in the collected posts will be analyzed and classified.
For example, if there is a video of a fire truck, black smoke rising from the building, and orange flames coming out of the room, it will be classified as "fire".
In addition, images of overturned cars are classified as "traffic accidents", while images of water-covered roads are classified as "road floods".
Specti also estimates where disasters and accidents occur.
"We often don't know the location from posts, so we make an estimate by combining various information," said CEO Murakami.
For example, if a road sign or signboard is reflected in an image or video, information on the place name will be extracted from it, and the location will be identified by comparing it with the place name database.
Angels lose goodbye in the opening game...Otani strikes three balls with full bases in five or nine innings (Baseball King) - Yahoo!News
Athletics 7x-3 Angels <Auckland Coliseum, July 24th local time< Angels player Otani Shohei (26) participated in the stamen as "3rd nominated batter" in the opening match against athletics in enemy territory on the 24th (25th Japan time).
In the first round, he hit a middle-stroke, his first hit of the season, but the subsequent four bats retreated, resulting in one hit for five strokes and one strike.
In three innings, Otani played against Montana again in a one-death first base.
In the 5th 3rd batting with 1-1, he played against his right arm, Petit, in 2nd place at a one-death first base, and collapsed here as well.
In the 8th 4th batting with a 2-1 and one-point lead, he confronted Deakman, his left arm in 5th place, as the lead batter.
He played back the straight of the second ball in the opposite direction at a good angle, but he didn't go over the fence and fell to the left.
Angels reached the bottom of the 8th with a one-point lead, and rescue right arm Batley lost two points and allowed a reversal, but in the 9th table where there is nothing left, new catcher 7th Castro took the team's first solo bullet this season to the right wing seat.
They caught up with a 3-3 tie at the last minute.
After that, he had 2 deaths, 1st and 2nd bases, and the order of batting was 2nd trout.
The athletics bench avoided filing a trout here and chose the Otani game with full two-death bases.
Otani was expected to win, but he struck out three balls in front of Hendrix, the guardian deity of athletics.
The game could not be settled in nine innings, and they entered an extended game starting with this season's special immortal second base.
Otani was the last batter in nine innings, so he became a second base runner.
For the Angels in the 10th table, the lead hit Walsh hit a poignant first base rumbling, but the first base Olson, who captured this batting well, sent the ball to the third base.
Otani, sandwiched between the 2nd and 3rd bases, was touched out.
The Angels then had full two-death bases, but at the end, 8th Simmons fell to Nigoro.
Behind the scenes, Robles, who continued to play across the innings, was in a pinch of one death, second or third bases with dead balls and rash throws.
At this point, new coach Madon made a shift to five in the infield, but Robles walked 4th Davis in four balls and had full bases.
Milner, his left arm, took a full base bullet to the right wing seat to say goodbye to 5th Olson, and the game was decided.
Isolated again... Fear of heavy rain in the southern part of the prefecture on the 26th, when 56 people from 33 households in Takaki village will be washed away due to floods (NBS Nagano Broadcasting) - Yahoo!News
There is a risk of heavy rain in Nagano Prefecture, mainly in the south, until the 26th, and we need to be vigilant about landslides in the central and southern areas.
In Takaki-mura, closed roads on prefectural roads have been washed away, and residents have been isolated again.
Mud and temporary bridges are drunk and washed away by the flooded river.
After 3 a.m., it was captured by a surveillance camera installed by the Prefectural Iida Construction Office in Takaki-mura.
This route was built on the riverbed in place of the prefectural highway that was closed to traffic due to a landslide, and has only been accessible to residents' cars since the 17th.
As a result, 56 people from 33 households in the Oshima area will be isolated again, and the Iida Construction Office hopes that restoration work will begin as soon as the water recedes.
Warm and moist air will flow toward the Baiu front, and it is expected that some parts of the prefecture will experience more than 30 mm of heavy rain per hour until the 26th.
The expected 24-hour precipitation until 6pm on the 26th is 80 mm in the central area and 120 mm in the south, and it is necessary to be vigilant about landslides in the central and southern areas until late at night on the 26th.
The Meteorological Observatory has issued heavy rain warnings to the Saku, Suwa and Kiso regions.
"Crowded cheating" and "Uchinchi" can't communicate...?
"The words I really thought it wasn't a dialect" asked the people of Chiba Prefecture (Netorabo) - Yahoo!News
I am a citizen of Chiba Prefecture close to Tokyo.
I have been living in the prefecture for almost 30 years since I was born.
When I used "crowded cheating", which means "sideways", when I used it in a conversation with a friend at university (Tokyo), it was regarded as Kyoton for a moment.
They understood the meaning through the flow and sense of language, but the residents of Tokyo and Saitama told me that they would not use it.
-- Certainly, "Maybe it's about cheating, cheating and going sideways?"
It seems to be connected, so it seems that the meaning can be guessed somehow.
And one more thing.
I didn't realize this when it was pointed out, but the expression "uchinchi", which means "my house", wasn't used at all even when I was reading books, and I didn't hear it from my friends, so when I looked it up when I grew up, I found out that it was a dialect.
-- Eh, "Uchinchi" ...was that so?
I also use it in my hometown (Gunma Prefecture), but I didn't notice it probably because I naturally stopped using it since I grew up...
Japan's "chilled Chinese food" is not popular with Chinese people...?
The reason why cold noodle dishes are so unpopular (Gendai Business) - Yahoo!News
In China, chilled Chinese is "Japanese-style cold noodles"
As I mentioned at the beginning, chilled Chinese is a Chinese dish (Japanese-style Chinese) that originated in Japan and was devised based on China's "ryang bang mien (chilled mixed soba)."
Therefore, it does not originally exist in China, but due to the diversification of food, it has come to be seen in Japanese restaurants in the summer.
Recently, at Japanese convenience stores, arranged products such as "Nisshiki Soba Ryomen / Soba Chilled Chinese" and "Sichuan-style Chicken Chilled Chinese" have also appeared.
On the other hand, Japanese-style Chinese cuisine is generally not popular in China, pushed by trendy punchy Chinese cuisine such as Sichuan and Hunan cuisine.
Naturally, the seasoning of Japanese-style Chinese is often familiar to Chinese people.
Therefore, although it is not bad, there is a tendency to be harshly criticized for having little impact.
"Chilled Chinese food" is no exception, and it is still a minor presence in China.
By the way, in China, the name of chilled Chinese is "Japanese-style cold noodles".
It is recognized by Chinese people as a form of Japanese cuisine.
The staple of summer is "Ryampi"
In China, when it comes to noodle dishes that feel like summer, it's probably "liampi".
In Japan, I'm sure many people are unfamiliar with it, but cool skin is flat noodles made from flour, rice flour and starch that originated in Shanxi Province.
It is said that it has a history of 2,000 years.
It is a staple of B-class gourmet that is also sold at food stalls, and the price is around 10-20 yuan (150-300 yen), which is very reasonable.
The word "cool" is included, but like chilled Chinese food in Japan, it is not covered with ice.
Rather, it is based on room temperature.
The noodles are topped with favorite ingredients such as shredded cucumbers, carrots and boiled bean sprouts, and add condiments such as coriander, chili pepper, ginger and garlic.
Finally, it is finished by pouring special seasonings mixed with soy sauce, chili oil, vinegar, sesame paste and peanut paste.
The crispy noodles go well through the throat and are well tangled with a refreshing sour, rich and spicy sauce, making it smooth even when you have summer fatigue and don't have an appetite.
In addition, since it has penetrated all over China, there are various toppings and seasonings, and there are many variations, which is one of the characteristics of cool skin, and it is one of the ways to enjoy it.

"Cold water shower" brings benefits to the body and mind (Cosmopolitan) - Yahoo!News
Suppresses inflammation such as muscle pain
A study that investigated the efficacy of hydrotherapy, published in The North American Journal of Medical Sciences, found that it can be expected to have a positive effect on physical and mental healing.
It is said that exposure to cold water after exercise can suppress muscle pain and other inflammatory effects.
According to Professor Douglas Casa, head of the Korea Stringer Institute, which studies sports medicine and teaches at the University of Connecticut, "It's important to exercise and take a cold water shower with as little time as possible. Lowering your body temperature immediately after moving your body will speed up recovery from inflammation and fatigue caused by exercise."
to reduce fatigue
When you exercise in high temperatures, your heart, muscles and skin need more blood flow than usual.
"The higher the heart rate during exercise, the more blood flow to the heart, the more energy it takes to contract the muscles, which increases the muscle blood flow, and when it comes to the skin, a lot of blood flows in to regulate body temperature," says Kasa.
"Taking a cold water shower lowers the temperature of the skin, which reduces the amount of blood flow sent to the skin. Instead, it sends blood flow to internal organs such as the stomach and intestines, making it easier to consume moisture and nutrients even after exercise. As a result, you can reduce the fatigue you feel after exercise."
Expectations for the hormesis effect
Dorosevsky explains that being bathed in cold water can be expected to activate the "hormesis effect".
The hormis effect is the idea that it is better to have a little bit of substances and stress that are harmful to the body rather than not at all.
"Hypoxia exercise, petit fasting, and cold water showers are typical examples of hormesis effects for health. Cold water showers stimulate hormones and neurotransmitters and increase physical and physical resilience and resilience."

Hanshin and Oyama, No. 7 for 2 consecutive races!
Director Yano: "It's stately to watch" (Sankei Sports) - Yahoo!News
(Se League, Chunichi 2-5 Hanshin, 7th round, Hanshin 4 wins and 3 losses, 24th, Nagoya D) The momentum of the 4th can't stop.
The soaring batting landed in the middle of the left wing seat.
Oyama arched for two races in a row and went around the diamonds.
When he returned to the bench, he peeked out his white teeth.
"While I was able to swing well, I was able to narrow down the ball I was aiming for and swing boldly."
He started batting in the lead in four innings, 0-2.
He swung aggressively from the first ball, and it was his second ball after the foul.
I didn't miss Yo Ono's sweet 134km slider.
The hitting captured with the core is so perfect that you are convinced that it will be stand-in the moment you hit it.
One shot in two consecutive games, following the previous day's match against Hiroshima (Koshien) on the 23th, was a counterattack.
It was also a valuable shot that was hit by an opponent he was not good at.
When he played against Ono at Koshien on the 17th, he scored 9 hits and 4 points.
However, only at the Nagoya Dome, they have allowed 7 wins, 1 loss and 1 hold in the past 12 games, and have been suffering from seven consecutive losses after a draw since August 23rd, 2013.
From such a difficult enemy, he scored at Nagoya Dome for the first time in 23 innings (disembarking on the way was also counted as one inning) with a dynamic shot and did not pass the flow of the game.
Manager Yano also said, "Being able to catch a sweet ball firmly is at a high level. It has a personality when you watch it, and the timing of hitting has an atmosphere even if it's a foul. I think they'll still hit it," expressing his hopes for a further explosion.
He hit the right front at one time, marking six consecutive hits and multiple hits for three consecutive games.
The game started just before the start, but with 7 home runs and 16 runs, he has already performed well as the top of the team and 4th.
They will continue to leave results in order to win.

Macau casino supervisory authority inspects the implementation of epidemic prevention measures at casino facilities... new coronavirus negative certificate must be presented at the time of admission (Macau Newspaper) - Yahoo!News
Approximately 40 casino facilities in Macau were closed for 15 days from February 5th to the 19th due to the new coronavirus infection (COVID-19) epidemic, and have resumed operations since the 20th of the same month after strict epidemic prevention measures.
Upon reopening, the Macau Casino Regulatory Authority (DICJ) is calling on operating companies to protect the health of their employees and guests as much as possible, securing distance between gaming (casino) tables, allowing adjacent seats for table games (for example, at a baccarat table, three to four people can be seated at one table at the same time), and slot machines must be operated one or two at a time, thereby reducing the risk of cross-infection.
Disinfection of gaming equipment such as chips has also been strengthened.
Guests are also required to wear a mask, check the temperature, and present a valid health code (the most recent history of stay, history of contact with a new type of corona patient, presence or absence of symptoms such as fever or cough, generated by entering contact information) at the time of admission.
From midnight on July 15th, the presentation of a negative coronavirus nucleic acid test certificate (limited to those within the validity period issued by a licensed facility in Macau or Guangdong Province) was added to the condition.
Behind the new mandatory presentation of negative certificates is the relaxation of waterfront measures between Macau and Guangdong Province from 6am on the 15th (abolition of 14-day quarantine quarantine, subject to various conditions), which will be a precautionary measure associated with this.
DICJ announced on July 18th that in response to changes in admission conditions starting on the 15th of the same month, the bureau's director Adriano Ho and others observed the implementation of epidemic prevention measures at casino facilities, and held a meeting with representatives from the security departments of the six casino management companies, and once again urged them to protect the health of their employees and guests by thoroughly controlling the admission of guests.
DICJ has stated that it will continue strict patrols of casino facilities and hold regular meetings with the operating company according to the situation and evaluation, and that epidemic prevention measures at casinos will be adjusted as appropriate in accordance with the guidelines of the government health department.
The visit to the casino facility was also accompanied by Hayashimatsu, director of the Disease Control and Prevention Center of the Department of Health, who provided guidance on how to disinfect gaming (casino) chips and keep a safe distance between the seats of electronic casino equipment.
Due to the sharp decline in the number of inbound tourists due to epidemic prevention measures, including restrictions on entry to the border, cumulative casino sales in the January-June quarter of this year decreased 77.4% from the same period last year to 33.72 billion Macau patacas (approximately 451.9 billion yen).
A cheer of light from Yuwaku Onsen A message to medical practitioners next month instead of the Bonbori Festival (Hokkoku Shimbun) - Yahoo!News
Efforts to light lanterns with messages of support to medical practitioners will begin on August 1st at Yuwaku Onsen, where the annual Yuwaku Bonbori Festival has been canceled due to the new coronavirus.
Approximately 350 pieces of paper written by fans and local residents from all over the country are pasted to envelop the city of hot water with ale light, bringing healing to visitors.
The Bonbori Festival is an event that recreates the festival that appears in the anime "Hanasaku Iroha" modeled after Yuwaku Onsen, and is organized by the Yuwaku Onsen Tourism Association.
Starting in 2011, when the anime was broadcast, many anime fans from all over the country visit every year.
Every year, every day from the lighting ceremony in July to the main festival in October, bonbori are lit up on the stairs leading to Yuwaku Inari Shrine next to Soyu.
This year, the festival was forced to be canceled due to the new corona, but locals and fans all over the country said one after another, "It's lonely that there is no bonbori in the summer of Yuwaku," and the association came up with this project.
It was named the "Recovery Campaign" to help heal and recover the world, which is in a difficult situation due to the coronal disaster.
Until now, about 50 pupils from local Yuwaku Primary School and Shibahara Junior High School have been asked to write messages with illustrations, and more than 100 applications have been received from all over the country.
If you purchase the message form from the association's website, fill it out, put it in a reply envelope and send it to the association, you can receive a lighted photo by sticking it blankly.
It costs 6,000 yen per set, and applications will be accepted until a total of 350 bonbori are reached.
The lanterns are scheduled to be lit up until the end of November.
Yamashita Shinichiro (48), who has been the chairman of the festival's executive committee since the first edition, said, "We are encouraged when we read the message. Next year we would like to hold a grand festival that marks the 10th milestone."
Illustrations drawn by the blooming Iroha characters and Asanogawa Ohashi Bridge were also prepared for the campaign.
From the 1st, clear files with illustrations will be presented to users of special accommodation plans at ryokan in Yuwaku Hot Springs.
"Moriyama Gogen", the core four that supports Seibu, connects souls (Tospo Web) - Yahoo!News
Seibu's proud "Moriyama Gogen" showed soul cooperation and staged a goodbye victory for the second time this season.
On the 24th, the match against Lotte (MetLife) was held nine times, 2-2, and four players, who were still far from being in good condition, showed their obsession with victory.
Genda, in the lead, went to base headsliding from the safety bunt to the first base.
Then, 3rd Mori, who is at the bottom with a batting rate of 10% 18:2 rin in the last six games, scored a sending bunt, resulting in one death and second base.
4th Yamakawa avoided the declaration, and from this day on, Sotozaki, who returned to 5th after replacing Mori, defeated Masuda's straight ball, leading to a 3-2 victory.
Hero Sotozaki said, "I was surprised even though I was on the bench (for Genda's safety), so I thought I had no choice but to do something about it. I felt that Tomoya also believed in me behind me with a bunt and connected me.Mr. Yamakawa avoided it and gave me a word, 'Be proactive!' before going to the first base, so I was able to get into my feelings," and the result was the thoughts of the three people who created the flow of goodbye.
The four players, Mori and Yamakawa in first place and second place in the draft in 2013, Sotozaki in third place in 2014, and Genda in third place in 2016, are Note's "Core 4" that people related to the baseball team call "the heart of us right now".
All of them had experience as captains when they were amateurs, and they have more responsibility than anyone else.
Sotozaki, who took over as captain from Yamakawa when he was in his fourth year at Fuji University, said, "Yamakawa-san is good at speaking anyway, so he's the captain who leads the team with words. On the other hand, I'm not good at speaking, so I was the type who left the conversation to the vice-captain who was good at speaking and held it behind me," and each of them demonstrates their own personality while supporting the new captain, Genda and the new player chairman, Mori.
Director Tsuji said, "Genda's safety? That's not a sign, but that made me think, 'Okay, I can go.' Tomoya was also a great bunt. Sotozaki also hit me well," praising Moriyama Gogen's soul collaboration.
All four of them are currently struggling with a batting rate of 20% 24-5 minutes, but they support the team with their wisdom on how to win even if they can't hit them.

He stood beside a globe, held a calligraphy in his hand, and gave a lecture on Western studies.
The statue, combined with the pedestal, is about 3 meters high (1.55 meters), and it is said that it was made from the perspective of a disciple attending Masujiro's lecture.
It was designed by Takami Marie (27), a local designer and descendant of Masujiro's wife, Kotoko.
It was built by the project executive committee (Chairman Okamoto Satoshi) 150 years after the death of Omura Masujiro, whose parent organization is the Chusenji Residents' Association, soliciting donations.
Approximately 128 million yen was collected from 104 people from all over the country.
The project cost, including the installation of name boards, is approximately 12 million yen.
The surplus donations will be used to maintain the bronze statue.
Chairman Okamoto said, "Masujiro, who has continued to have high aspirations and made great contributions as an educator, is the pride of his old hometown. A bronze statue that will be the hope of the children of the region who will be responsible for the future."
He leaves the venue wearing Embape crutches after being injured after a malicious tackle (SPORT.es) - Yahoo!News
Paris Saint-Germain, who defeated Saint-Etienne 1-0 in the Coupe de France final held at Stade de France on the 24th local time, won his 13th victory for the first time in two years.
PSG achieves two domestic crowns
Neymar's goal in the first half, defeating Saint-Etienne in Neymar's final point, was the final point, and PSG won two domestic crowns following Ligue Ann, but they are in a situation where they can't help but worry about the Champions League in August.
Killian Embape, who made his first appearance in the same match, was injured after a malicious sliding tackle by his opponent's CB Royke Peran.
In the first 30 minutes, the young French star, who was defeated as if his right ankle was sandwiched, distorted his face in pain.
Players from both teams were touch-and-go and caused a brawl over this play.
Embape, who seems to have twisted his right ankle, will not be able to continue playing.
Peran was presented with a red card.
After the game, Embape, with a fixed right leg, left the stadium with crutches on.
PSG will compete in the Coupe de la League final against Lyon on August 1st at 4:10 (UTC8), but it will undoubtedly be impossible to employ Embape in this match.
They will have to wait for the medical report to be released by the club, but there is also a possibility that they will miss the Champions League in Portugal.
Corona disaster "close to art" online museum "HASARD" Konno (from Hachinohe) launched (Delhi-Tohoku Newspaper) - Yahoo!News
There is an art museum where anyone can come into contact with art for free whenever they want.
The collection ranges from well-known painters such as Claude Monet and Gustav Klimt to unknown artists in Japan.
Since its opening in April 2019, the online museum "HASARD" has grabbed the hearts of users for its convenience and newness, and has gained even more attention with the new lifestyle caused by the corona disaster.
Representative Konno Shinnosuke (26) from Hachinohe, who lives in Tokyo, said, "We wanted to create a service where everyone can easily enjoy art. I want people to come into contact with art in difficult situations."
What surprises you when you visit Another is the abundance of the exhibits and the beauty of the images.
As of the 24th, a total of 14 exhibitions, including permanent and special exhibitions, are on display, and the ultra-high-resolution work that conveys not only the color but also the texture of the brush attracts viewers.
No member registration or admission fee is required, and it is characterized by the fact that there is no cost not only for the viewer but also for artists who want to hold a solo exhibition.
The unique way of showing it online is also attracting attention.
Moving the picture is one of them.
Claude Monet's permanent exhibition "It Starts Moving Again" has been digitally processed so that clouds, flowers and grasslands move.
"I want to make it possible for people who are less interested in art to enter" (Representative Konno), which makes you feel like you're in the picture.
He first encountered art with Konno when he was in elementary school.
At that time, when I visited the newly completed Aomori Museum of Art with my family, I saw three huge paintings of Marc Chagall's "Aleko" and was shocked by their power.
The next day, art classes turned into a fun time, and even after moving to Tokyo after going to university, he began to visit galleries and other places.
At the same time, I also felt that there are many people who do not have many opportunities to come into contact with art from various perspectives, such as the fact that there are no museums nearby and large special exhibitions are only held in the Tokyo metropolitan area, making it difficult to go out due to childcare.
Therefore, while working for an IT company, he spent about two months launching a website where art can be viewed on the Internet.
In the first 10 months, the number of users has reached an average of 10,000 per month, and since the outbreak of the new corona spread, the number has risen to about 30,000.
I wish anyone could appreciate art in a free way when they want to see it.
Ather's aim was unintentionally accepted by more people due to the coronal disaster.
Representative Konno stressed that the significance of art appreciation enriches one's imagination.
"When your imagination becomes richer, you will be able to reach out to people in need.
I hope that as art becomes more familiar, it will become a better society."
The simple reason why the era of Chinese quality is over and the era of Japanese quality is coming (Gendai Business) - Yahoo!News
Changing values through pandemics
Various predictions and discussions are taking place about the world of after-sales pandemics.
On the business front, there may be changes mentioned in the article on July 8th, "Actually, the jobs of "managers" are starting to disappear in Japan...! That cruel reality" and the article on July 4th, "The reason why the Japanese manufacturing industry is actually likely to make a big comeback in the world of "Post-Corona"...!"
Photo: The identity of "Japan's strength" that only Japanese people don't know... Surprising reality seen in Asia
In addition, mentally, it is likely that the trend will become mainstream, such as the article on June 26th, "The Principles of Complete Combustion" given to people who have become aware of the end of their lives in the corona, and the article on June 10th, "Now that the corona is full of riots, it's time to review the benefits of praying for the gods in times of hardship."
And what we can clearly see as a combination of these two "materials (economy and business)" and "spirit" is the major trend "from Chinese quality to Japanese quality".
For example, if there was a defect or defect in a T-shirt or digital camera, it would be annoying, but there is no separate article in the life of the person who bought it.
On the other hand, the sloppy quality of Chinese-made masks and ventilators that have recently become a hot topic... "Chinese quality" in such products that are directly linked to life and safety is fatal.
No matter how cheap it is, you can't buy such a product.
Even if they pay a considerable price, they will be looking for "Japanese quality" products.
Of course, this trend is not happening only in Japan.
This is evident from the fact that Western countries, which have fallen into a difficult situation due to a shortage of masks and medical equipment, still made "returns" one after another due to the severity of "Chinese quality".
Safe and secure than being cheap
Products such as automobiles are also products that can cause fatal defects (death due to accidents).
No matter how much China, Korea and other countries are offensive with the cheap sales strategy of "cheap or bad", they will not be able to compete with those made in Japan in the end, and the situation mentioned in the article on June 16th, "After all, will automakers around the world bow down to Toyota?" is because "Japanese quality" is strongly required for the products of automobiles.
This pandemic also reminded us that "safety and security" is also necessary for many other products.
In addition, security and safety are important not only for "Japanese quality in manufacturing", but also for "Japanese quality in services such as logistics".
Like the toilet paper uproar, even though there is proper production capacity, there are times when intermediate distribution is delayed and it cannot be reached.
Furthermore, the article on April 17th, "Who is the real culprit of the shortage of masks! Don't forgive firefield thieves by the Communist Party of China government", made me keenly aware that self-sufficiency in Japan is also an important element of "security and safety".
In the event of an emergency, it is natural for every country to prioritize their own country, and it is very important to be able to procure necessities such as masks (medical devices) and food within their own country.
Korea's new corona infection exceeds 100 for the first time in 115 days, with overseas inflows high at 86 (Yonhap News) - Yahoo!News
(SEOUL=Yonhap News) Korea's Central Epidemic Prevention Headquarters announced on the 25th that as of midnight, the number of people infected with the new corona virus has increased by 113 from midnight the previous day to a total of 14,092.
It was the first time in 115 days since April 1st (101) that the number of new infections per day exceeded 100.
In addition to the fact that 32 sailors were found to be infected on a Russian ship that arrived at Busan Port, 32 of the 293 workers who returned from Iraq on the 24th were judged positive.
The number of new infections in Korea was in the range of 30 to 60 with the exception of the 20th (26).
Of the new infections announced on the 25th, 86 came from overseas, the highest number since January 20th, when the first person was infected in Korea.
The number of immigrants from Iraq was the highest at 36, with 34 from Russia, 5 from the Philippines and 3 from the US.
Meanwhile, 27 people were infected in the city, 11 were confirmed in Seoul and Gyeonggi-do, respectively, and five in Busan.
The five members from Busan were employees of a repair company aboard a Russian ship.
The death toll has remained unchanged since the previous day to 298.
Nagoya's Miyahara in corona-positive soccer J1 for the first time since league reopened | Shizuoka Newspaper @S
J1 soccer player Nagoya announced on the 25th that defender Miyahara Kazuya (24) has had a positive response to the new corona virus.
This is the first time a player has had a positive response since the reopening of the J league.
He is the third player from the club, following forward Kanasaki Yumeo (31), who was infected in June, and goalkeeper Mitchell Langerac (31) from Australia.
The two have already been treated and returned to the game.
This season, Miyahara was on the bench on the 22nd at the J1 match against Oita at Showa Denko Dome Oita.
Nagoya held a press conference online on the 25th and announced that it had conducted a PCR test on 60 athletes and staff members on the same day.
98% reflection.
It turns out that white paint derived from a Teflon-processed frying pan and heat insulation enhances the cooling effect!
What a big discovery!
This year was a rainy season with an unprecedented amount of precipitation, but at dawn, the extremely hot summer will begin in earnest.
It's hot and hot, and it's so hot that even air conditioning doesn't work... it's going to be sweltering just by imagining it, right?
Global warming is a major global problem, and humankind has focused its wisdom on how to overcome the hot midsummer as comfortably as possible.
One way to do this is to wear thin, white clothes.
See, you don't have to bother to wear black clothes that absorb heat in the summer, right?
And the same principle is applied to the architecture of houses, and there are an increasing number of cases where white paint is used.
Even though white is white, the latest research field was whether it could be made into a paint that reflects more light and does not absorb heat.
Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) recently announced that in collaboration with researchers from Columbia University's Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics, they have found the most efficient way to blend white paint that repels solar heat and improves the cooling effect inside the building.
It is expected to be put into practical use as soon as possible.
Until now, white paint, which has the highest reflectance of sunlight, was made from titanium oxide, which has a reflectance of 85%.
White paint, which uses titanium oxide, has already been applied to the roofs of buildings in high-temperature environments, helping to cut off solar heat and increase cooling efficiency.
However, what was newly discovered is a white paint derived from the fluorine resin of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), which is used in teflon-processed frying pans.
It is a white paint that applies this Teflon effect and reflects sunlight to nearly 98%, making it possible to drastically cut heat.
Even in the hot summer, it is surprisingly easy to spend indoors without being exposed to the extreme heat thanks to the white paint made with Teflon.
Maybe such an era is coming soon, isn't it?
I feel that the roofs of Japanese houses have a lot of dark colors, but from now on, white will become the mainstream?
When will Amazon's annual large-scale sales be held this year?
CNBC reported on July 21st that Amazon.com has announced the postponement of its annual large-scale sale, "Prime Day".
Although it is held in July every year, it was reported that it had to be postponed this year due to the spread of the new corona virus.
A spokeswoman, "Details will be announced soon," an Amazon spokeswoman said in a statement.
"Prime Day has become a special celebration that we look forward to over the past five years. This year it will be held later than usual, ensuring the safety of our employees and supporting our customers and exhibitors."
However, it only stated that "details will be announced soon", and the specific date of the event was not disclosed.
On the other hand, they decided to hold the event in India.
A press release was published on the country's website.
He explained that it will run for 48 hours from midnight on August 6th.
Prime Day has been held at the same time around the world, but this year they may take unprecedented measures.
Amazon, a large-scale event that sells 760 billion yen in two days, launched a large-scale sale for its members in 2015 as a measure to promote sales in the summer when sales are declining.
Initially it was a 24-hour event, but the scale expanded year by year, and last year it was held for 48 hours from midnight on July 15th in 18 countries, including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, India, Japan, China and Australia.
According to the company, last year, two-day sales exceeded previous sales of "Black Friday" (the first day of year-end sales) and "Cyber Monday" (the following Monday).
The event has also contributed to acquiring new subscribers to the paid member "Prime", and last year the number of applications on the first day reached a record high, and the next day was second only to that.
Also, last year, 175 million products were sold worldwide.
Regarding this, Internet Retailer, a magazine specializing in the online shopping industry, reported that over the two days, global sales increased 70% from the previous year to $7.16 billion (approximately 760 billion yen).
A harsh eye for mobile number migration and excessive retention.
What happens to the fees and points awarded?
(New Switch) - Yahoo!News
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications is in full swing considering reviewing the same number transition system (MNP) that allows users to use conventional phone numbers as they are when changing mobile telecommunications companies.
At a meeting of experts on the 21st, they announced that they would revise the MNP guidelines enacted in 2004.
Specific issues cover a wide range of topics, such as how MNP fees should be and the pros and cons of retaining those who wish to move out.
As opposition from telecommunications companies is expected, attention will be paid to whether it will lead to the promotion of healthy market competition.
At the beginning of 2006, when the dark MNP was introduced by telecommunications companies that are far from unlimited mobile phone transfers, the user fee was 2,000 yen, but now it is 3,000 yen.
The MNP fee revenue of the three major mobile telecommunications companies is estimated to be 15.9 billion yen per year.
On the 21st, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications listed the current situation surrounding MNPs at the Working Group on Verifying Competition Rules (WG), a group of experts discussing the competitive environment in the telecommunications market.
The time to issue an MNP reservation number, which is required for consumers to move to another telecommunications company, was also a hit.
Major telecommunications companies accept applications on the web, but due to the operation of the core system, the mainstream acceptance time is from 9:00 to 20:00.
The WG materials clearly stated that, in principle, they should respond all day as the direction of future consideration.
It is also a problem for mobile telecommunications companies to grant points to those who wish to move out as an MNP.
This was because it was judged that excessive retention could impede fair competition.
Kita Shunichi, a partner of Nomura Research Institute, who is a member of the working group, said, "We will promptly issue a number to users who do not grant permission after obtaining permission from the user to give us time to explain the provision of economic benefits. It is important to thoroughly implement this process first."
However, among a series of issues, there is a structural problem that "the higher the MNP fee, the harder it is for customers to leak out, so it is difficult to motivate them to actively lower it" (a representative from the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications).
If some businesses take the initiative in lowering MNP fees, there is also concern that the outflow of customers from the company will increase and corporate efforts will not be rewarded.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications has pointed out that many countries overseas do not require user fees for MNPs, and this may be the case in Japan as well.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications hopes to compile a report on the results of the working group from September to October, and then begin the process for revising the MNP guidelines.
The timing of the amendment is expected to be after 2019.
Mobile telecommunications companies are likely to be worried about how to provide sales and customer support.
Chunichi and Katsuno lose no points six times and don't get the right to be a pitcher (Sankei Sports) - Yahoo!News
Chunichi pitcher Katsuno Masayoshi (23) started in the 8th round of Hanshin (Nagoya Dome) on the 25th.
He had six innings, four hits and no points.
"I also had the last pitch, so I threw it because I thought it was my last chance. There was also a fore ball, but I was able to compete against my opponent without worrying too much about it."
After pitching for the first time this season and the last match against Hanshin (Koshien) on the 18th, they both suffered from ball control and disembarked up to four times.
He was unable to play his role as the start, and this time it was a backwater mound trying to survive the 1st army.
This time, he bullishly attacked the strong fierce tiger batting opponent with an emotional ball.
When he ran a straight ball in the 140 km range, he was able to use changing balls such as counting balls effectively.
In six innings, he hit a double run in the middle left against Sands in the lead, but he flew Oyama to the left and took Boer to Nigoro, resulting in two deaths and third bases.
In the match against Fukudome here, he drove him with two balls, and at the end was a fork.
In a three-ball game, he took an air strike and surpassed the pinch.
Katsuno had 83 balls after finishing six innings, but at the same time as the end of the mid-field game, coach Yoda came out of the bench and announced a change of pitcher.
Saiyu, who played the pitcher, had 108 balls at the same time, but he got off the mound first, so he couldn't get the right to win for the first time this season.

Masuda Shrine, located in the Takagushi district of Tano, Hizen-cho, Karatsu, enshrines policeman Masuda Keitaro (1869-1995), who died after making efforts to combat the epidemic cholera that spread to the area 125 years ago.
The annual festival has been held grandly in late July every year, but this year it was canceled due to the new corona virus.
On the 26th, only a Shinto ritual will be held by the autonomous presidents.
The annual festival has been held by a residents' association, where policeman Masuda has paraded floats on a white horse and launched fireworks.
Nearly 200 people attend the event every year, including bereaved families living in Kumamoto Prefecture, police officials, and local residents.
This year, the number of inquiries from the media has increased due to the corona disaster, and autonomous chairman Takeda Yoshinori (72) said, "It is crowded every year with the annual festival that has been connected by the local community. It is very unfortunate that it will be canceled."
The prefectural police also canceled the memorial service visited by police academy students this year.
On the 21st, General Manager Sugiuchi Yumiko and Karatsu Chief Fukushima Hiroto visited Komatsushima off the coast of Takagushi Port, where it was cremated, and offered flowers at the monument.
General Manager Sugiuchi renewed his desire, "The spirit of bravery and dedication is the origin of the police, and I want to pass it on as it should be."
Policeman Masuda, who is from Kumamoto Prefecture, was assigned to Takagushi in July 1895.
He took measures with no sleep and rest, such as disinfecting the patient's home, and after that, he himself was infected with cholera.
He said, "I will carry all of Takagushi's cholera on my back," and died at the age of 25 just the fourth day after he arrived.

Dodgers Bets sign a contract in 2012 for a total of 39.1 billion yen!
The second largest in history after the Angels Trout!
It has been revealed that Mookie Betz outfielder of the Los Angeles Dodgers has signed a new contract.
He moved off from the Boston Red Sox.
Prior to their first year in the new world, they signed a contract that will last until 2032.
Companies such as the US media, CBS Sports, reported on the 22nd (23rd Japan time).
[Video] R Socks Betz demonstrates his diverse talents!
You can also do this besides baseball!
Betz made his major debut in 2014 at the age of 21.
He has contributed to the team as the center of the strong batting line for the Boston Red Sox and as a right-wing hand with a strong shoulder.
He is like the pinnacle of medium-range batters, with more than 40 double runs every year from 2015 until last season.
In 2018, when he became the best in the world, he won the top batter and MVP with a batting rate of .346.
According to CBS Sports, Betz had rejected a 10-year $300 million (approximately 32.1 billion yen) offer from the Red Sox last year.
During his time off, he traded to the Dodgers in exchange for money and multiple players with left arm ace pitcher David Price.
This season's contract is $27 million (approximately 2.9 billion yen) a year.

Kinoshita Akio, director of ophthalmology at Hiramatsu Hospital, explains dry eyes at Yonezawa Saga flagship store of glasses in Saga City
"Hot Seminar" by Kinoshita Akio, head of ophthalmology at Hiramatsu Hospital, explaining dry eyes = Yonezawa Saga flagship store of glasses in Saga City
The "Health Relaxation Seminar" (sponsored by the Saga Shimbun and co-sponsored by Yonezawa Glasses) was held on the 25th at the Yonezawa Saga flagship store in Shimoda-cho, Saga.
Kinoshita Akio, director of ophthalmology at Hiramatsu Hospital (Ogi) explained eye diseases that are deeply related to daily life, such as dry eyes and cataracts.
Dry eye is said to be a "disease of tears" and explained that it is a disease in which the quality of tears collapses and tears cannot spread evenly to the surface of the eyes.
Kinoshita said, "Contact lens users are about four times more likely," urging them to "don't use it for a long time or sleep while wearing it."
They showed measures such as placing the computer's screen below the height of the eyes and humidifying it in air-conditioned rooms.
Ingredients and foods that are effective for dry eyes were also introduced.
"Omega-3 contained in blue fish prevents the evaporation of tears, while muchin, which is abundant in natto and okra, enhances the quality of tears."
Regarding cataract surgery, there are single-focus and multi-focus intraocular lenses to be inserted instead of crystals, touching on differences in the way they look.
Approximately 40 people participated in the seminar.
As a measure to prevent a new type of coronavirus infection, the event was held in small groups in two parts, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, and the temperature was checked and disinfected before admission, and the venue was fully ventilated.

[G Osaka] What are the chances of 17-year-old forward Karayama making his J1 debut against Kobe?
Director Miyamoto "Scoring skills are outstanding" (Sports Hochi) - Yahoo!News
G Osaka coach Miyamoto Tsuneyasu (43) responded to an interview on the 25th before the match against Kobe (Noesta on the 26th) for four consecutive wins, and revealed his expectations for third-year high school forward Karayama Shoji (17), who became a member of the top team for the first time in the previous section.
The commander took Karayama, who was promoted to the top in this season's flying class, as a bench member in the match against Hiroshima on the 22nd.
Although he didn't give him the opportunity to compete, he also ordered a striker who has scored three goals in five games this season in J3, saying, "There's something that stands out when it comes to scoring points. I'm 17 years old, but I want Gamshara to do more. I've seen players going abroad at a young age, but I want them to play with a high level of awareness and greed."
Karayama scored 8 goals in 10 games in J3, in which he played as a specially designated player last season.
Although he is slender at 178 centimeters and 65 kilograms, he boasts an astonishing scoring rate of 11 goals in 15 games in J3, with his sense of instantly moving behind the defender and his calmness leading up to a shot in front of a dense opponent's goal.
In the match against Hiroshima, forward Ademiouson and midfielder Onose were off the bench due to an injury, and Karayama got a chance, but he has no chance to compete.
Coach Miyamoto explained the condition of Ademiouson and Onose in the run-up to the match against Kobe, saying, "Both of them are not 100%, but they are eager to prepare."
When it comes to preserving the two, there is a possibility that they will be on the bench in Tangshan again.
At G Osaka, midfielder Doan, the current PSV, made his J1 debut at the age of 16 and 11 months, while forward Usami made his J1 debut at the age of 17 and 0 months, shifting his career overseas in his 10s.
Karayama, currently 17 years old and 10 months old, who is expected to be his next talent, is expected to make his J1 debut following them.
A Ferrari stolen 26 years ago is found at the bottom of the river ✨ Go to work without restoration (octane.jp) - Yahoo!News
In 1994, there was an incident in the Netherlands where Ferrari Mondial was stolen.
Time had passed without the police being able to solve it, but 26 years later, the mondial was miraculously discovered.
The discovery of a Ferrari (four photos) found at the bottom of the river was triggered by diving training at the fire department.
On July 8th, a diver in training found something in a wedge shape that was sinking at the bottom of the river, and the police and even the Dutch army were dispatched, and when they pulled something up, it was Ferrari Mondial.
By comparing the VIN number with a database of stolen vehicles, they were able to associate the Ferrari with the 1994 incident.
The car was handed over to its legal owner, the insurance company, and has since been sent to the scrap company.
Scrapper Lowie van DE Ooyevaar said, "We still have a few remaining parts, but they're for the art of decorating. We've already received a lot of requests from people who want to make a table from the torn apart Mondial. We're going to use engine blocks and glass plates."
They are not thinking about specific sales for the time being, and the scrap company will store it as an object.
Seibu and Sotozaki say goodbye for the first time
In his sixth year as a professional, "a man who doesn't have it" is finally!
(Sankei Sports) - Yahoo!News
(Pa League, Seibu 3x-2 Lotte, 9th round, Seibu 6 wins, 3 losses, 24th, MetLife) It's an obsessive white star!
On the 24th, Seibu's Sotozaki Shuta Uchino-te (27) hit nine times in the 9th round of Lotte (MetLife) and his first goodbye strike to the left in his sixth year as a professional, contributing to the 3-2 victory.
He took advantage of the opportunities staged with Genda's headsliding and hitting the forest.
The team, which competed together, set their savings to 2.
The voltage of the Leo party, which crammed into its home base, MetLife Dome, reached its climax.
This is Sotozaki's first goodbye hit in his sixth year as a professional.
It aroused an audience of 4,825 people.
"Gen (Genda) and Tomoya (Mori) connected me, so I entered the batting with the desire to do something about it." My colleague's obsession with victory inspired his number 5.
Celebrated nine times with 2-2.
The lead batter, Genda, tried a safety bunt and made an energetic head slide to the first base.
When he went to base with an infield hit, last season's top batter Mori scored his second professional hit.
Yamakawa, No. 4, avoided the declaration.
A senior at Fuji University walked, and Sotozaki's inner heart was on fire.
"I thought it was damn. Before Yamakawa went to the first base, he said to me, 'Let's be proactive,' so I was really impressed."
He was clogged with a straight ball with a high inner angle from one ball, but the hitting fell to the left front.
Throughout his time as an amateur, he said, "I don't have any memories."
The 27-year-old, who was inspired by his alma mater Aomori and Hirosaki Sanetaka advancing to the top four summer prefectural tournaments for the first time in 20 years, took a joyful water shower and said with a smile, "It was pleasant as I expected."
He was called "a man who didn't have it".
He was selected as Samurai Japan as an all-purpose player who can protect the inside and outfield, and contributed to the best in the world at Premier 12 last November.
However, he had no experience hitting goodbye at Seibu, and coach Tsuji and Baba's strategy, defense and running base coach bullied him, saying, "I don't have it, you."
After repeling his negative reputation, he staged his second goodbye victory this season.
Director Tsuji praised him, saying, "If I only asked for today, I asked the goddess of victory. He hit me well."
With savings 2, he was in third place, one game behind the leader, Softbank.
With only one home run this season, Sotozaki, who has a batting rate of 252, strengthened his speech, saying, "We still have to hit more. We will work together as a team to aim for the next win."
One hit that decided on the game triggered a recovery.

Minoru Pig Farm (represented by Nakanowatari Minoru), which raises about 50,000 pigs annually at farms in Towada City and Rokunohe Town, visited Mayor Oyamada Hisashi at Towada City Hall on the 20th and reported that their farm has obtained JGAP (livestock and livestock products) certification, which shows the safety of agricultural and livestock products.
This is the second case to be acquired by a pig farmer in the prefecture.
The company produces "garlic pork" that uses powdered garlic from the prefecture as a special feed, and "local pig farming" that uses rice from the prefecture.
This time, the Fifth Farm (Rokunohe-cho), which raises about 10,000 of the five farms and produces "local pig farming", has obtained JGAP certification.
The company aimed to obtain certification because they thought that "certification is necessary to get major buyers to choose them" and learned that it was a condition for procuring ingredients to be used in the Athletes' Village for the Tokyo Olympics.
With the support of the Aomori Bank since August last year, preparations have been made together with bank staff who are qualified as JGAP instructors.
On March 3rd of this year, it was reviewed by a certification body and cleared a total of 113 standards, including food safety.
It was certified on the 13th of the same month.
The visit was attended by the company's representative, Nakanowatari Minoru, managing director of Nakanowatari University, Yamada Takeo, manager of the Towada Minami branch of the Aomori Bank, and Ishigo Nobuhiro, business advisor of the bank's corporate support department.
Mayor Oyamada sent a cheer saying, "It's wonderful. I hope they will greatly promote (JGAP certification) and lead to the expansion of sales channels."
Representative Nakanowatari Minoru said with enthusiasm, "I would like to continue to work hard to brand pig farming and contribute to Towada City."
Managing Director Nakanowatari University said, "We also aim to obtain certification for the remaining four farms," expressing his future goal.

What was the separation between life and death?
"It's luck. I was completely unharmed because the bullet was going away."
He visited the island of Perillieu 14 times for a memorial service.

Takahashi himself decided, "I will regain what I had left as soon as possible."

Torrential rains cause scars on "traffic" in Hokuen National Route 152 10 km closed, with some sections of the JR Iida Line closed | Shizuoka Newspaper @S
National Route 152 has been completely closed, and a queue of cars waiting for an alternating detour on one side: On the afternoon of the 22nd, Ryuzan-cho, Tenryu-ku, Hamamatsu (Some of the photos have been processed)
The Tenryu area of Hamamatsu City was severely affected by the torrential rains in July that caused tremendous damage to Kyushu and other parts of Japan.
The impact of landslides remains on the main road, National Route 152, and the JR Iida Line, which is the "foot of daily life", and there are many areas where it takes time to recover.
In addition to the inconvenience of their daily lives, residents are anxious about the adverse effects on economic activity.
There are long convoys waiting for traffic during the day at Sejiri Bridge over the Tenryu River in Ryuzan-cho, the same ward.
The leading car stopped for nearly 40 minutes.
National Route 152 has been completely closed to traffic for about 10 km, and a detour to the opposite bank of the Tenryu River is required to move around the town.
However, the width of the road is narrow and all sections are alternating on one side, so the waiting time cannot be predicted.
In the town, a landslide occurred on a national highway on the 9th, and traffic was closed due to the risk of falling rocks on nearby slopes.
On the 13th, cracks were found in the Akiba Tunnel within the regulated section, and there is still no prospect of when traffic will resume.
In the town, the national highway was closed in 2018 due to collapsed soil, and the lives of residents and tourism were damaged.
Tamamoto Kimie (76), president of the Dragon Mama Processing Plant, which sells specialty products, said, "The new coronavirus hit us as the number of customers is far away. The number of visitors has decreased sharply."
The JR Iida Line was interrupted between Mizukubo Station (Mizukubo-cho, the same ward) and Hiraoka Station (Nagano Prefecture) due to the collapse of a slope beside the track.
Ukai Shiori (16), who was attending Hamamatsu Kohoku High School Sakuma Branch School in Sakuma-cho, the same ward, from Oarashi Station (the same town) in the disconnected section, needed to pick up a car for about an hour one way.
"A car puts a heavy burden on both parents and themselves," he said, hoping for an early recovery.
According to JR Central, it is expected to take about three months to reopen, and from the 27th, there will be one special train going back and forth between Mizukubo Station and Oarashi Station on weekdays in the morning and in the evening.
In Mizukubo Town, landslides occurred frequently on forest roads that also serve as living roads.
In some cases, it takes several hours to take a detour.
Kumagai Keiji (69), chairman of the Mizukubo Town Forestry Association, clouded his expression, saying, "The transport of raw wood has also been delayed. There are isolated islands on land everywhere. I'm worried about future rain."
Nakajima Shoya, is it his own choice to be absent from the winning ceremony?
Local media coverage (Football Channel) - Yahoo!News
Japanese national midfielder Nakajima Shoya appears to be leaving Porto.
Portugal's ZAP reported it based on information from Record.
Porto, who won the Portuguese league in the 2019/20 season, held a winning ceremony on the pitch during the final round of their home on the 20th of this month.
However, the fact that Nakajima was not even in this place has just become a hot topic.
Nakajima, who refused to join the team practice while the league was suspended due to the new coronavirus, has since been missed.
Under such circumstances, he was also absent at the winning ceremony, so his transfer this summer is being discussed.
According to Record, Porto had invited Nakajima to the ceremony.
However, it was just that Nakajima did not show up.
As a result, he wrote, "Nakajima is increasingly out of Sergio Consason's plan for next season. He needs to leave the club in the next transfer market."
Nakajima is a prestigious family in Portugal and carries the 10th on his back, but it seems that he has left the team after a year.
They may have already begun to look for a new world.

45% of families have wives holding their wallets!
Is my husband happy or unhappy?
Isn't there a wife who is thrilled or angry when her husband says, "I don't have enough allowance this month..."?
The family in which this conversation is established is the family in which the wife holds her wallet.
How many families in the world have wives holding their wallets?
Also, let's take a look at the percentage of "wallets by couple" and "jointly managed".
Which one holds the household's wallet?
Matsui Securities Co., Ltd. surveyed a total of 800 people nationwide, including 400 men and women in their 20s and 30s (young couples) who have been married for 3 years or less, and 400 men and women in their 50s and 60s (mature couples) who have been married for 30 years or more, according to the results of the "Survey on the Household Management Situation of Couples" (announced in June 2019).
Who holds the household's wallet?
Wife: 45.0% Husband: 24.8% Families whose wives manage their family finances were the most common result.
Whichever one manages it, household management has twists and turns, but it seems that there are various episodes.
My wife manages household finances: Aako's case Aako is a Warmama from Arafif, who has a daughter in her third year of high school and her first year of high school.
Ms. Aako is in full control of the household budget.
As I was about to take the university entrance exam, there were more months when I was in a deficit due to high cram school fees, so I negotiated with my husband to lower my allowance, but sure enough, they resisted.
At that time, I was told to show me what kind of income and expenditure it was, so I showed them my household accounts.
Even though all expenses should have been listed, when I looked at household accounts, it wasn't enough to be in a deficit.
My husband almost approached me, saying, "It's enough," but Aako unexpectedly said, "Okay, I don't have enough power in household management, so please take care of everything," and if she cuts off the bargain, she is likely to be refunded, saying, "After all, please."
Later, when Aako interviewed her husband, she said, "Although I am dissatisfied with the fact that allowances are managed, the truth is that I don't have the time or energy to manage various household expenses (e.g., school teaching materials and PTA expenses)."
Husband manages household finances: In the case of Ms. B Ms. B, a full-time housewife, is given living expenses by her husband and manages it every day.
Last spring, the freezer part of the refrigerator was broken, so B asked her husband to buy a refrigerator.
However, my husband was reluctant to replace it, saying, "I can't use the freezer, but I can still use the refrigerator, so it's fine."
However, in the summer, she wanted to create an environment where her husband could eat ice cream at any time, and the palm of his hand turned over, saying, "Let's buy a refrigerator after all."
So B-ko unintentionally complained to her friend, "My husband is so stingy."
Kubo Takehide's transfer has been narrowed down to 5 clubs in Spain (Tospo Web) - Yahoo!News
It seems that the transfer destinations of Japanese national team MF Kubo Takehide(19), who played for Spain's first division Mallorca this season, are gradually being narrowed down.
Although Majorca was demoted to the second division, Kubo's reputation skyrocketed due to his success at the end of the season.
However, due to the frame outside the EU, it will be difficult to return to Real Madrid in the first division, which has "ownership", so he plans to play for other clubs next season.
They have already received offers from about 30 clubs, but R Madrid plan to have them train as a warrior at domestic clubs.
The Spanish newspaper "Marca" reported that Real Sociedad, Villarreal, Granada, Getafe and Betis are the dominant destinations for Kubo's transfer, and that "five clubs are interested in winning Kubo, but R Madrid want a club above the middle of the league."
Among them, Villarreal and R Sociedad will qualify for the Europa League (EL) next season, and Granada will also compete from the second round of the EL qualifier, which will meet the team conditions required by R Madrid.
What kind of decision will the world's number one big club make to accomplish the "treasure of Japan"?
A sedative detected from a female body with ALS is not commercially available and administered via gastric wax: Hokkaido Shimbun Newspaper Doshin Digital Edition
An investigator revealed on the 25th that a barbituric acid sedative had been detected in a woman's body when doctors Okubo Yuichi (42) and Yamamoto Naoki (43) were arrested on suspicion of part-time murder after receiving a request from a female patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), an intractable disease.

According to medical personnel, barbituric acid drugs have been used to treat epilepsy and are not commercially available.
A large dose can suppress breathing and lead to death, and in Europe and the United States, it is used by suicide aid organizations.

On the 23rd (local time), Disney announced an indefinite postponement of "Moulin" following Warner.
The film was originally scheduled to be released in the US on March 27th, and the release date has since been changed to July 24th and August 21st.
Disney public relations commented, "In the midst of such a global health crisis over the past few months, it's difficult to determine how the film will be released, so I'd like to suspend the release of Moulin and think about how to effectively get audiences around the world to see the film."
In addition to Moulin, there are other works at Disney that have been postponed.
Avatar, where more than 10 years have already passed since the previous film, is one of them.
Director James Cameron posted a letter on Twitter.
With a preface, "Everything was going well until the outbreak of the new corona virus, and it was scheduled to be released in December 2021," he said that there was a significant delay in the production of the film, and said, "I'm the one who is more disappointed with this delay than anyone else."
The second film of Avatar is expected to be released one year from now in December 2022, the third in 2024, the fourth in 2026, and the fifth in 2028.
The new Star Wars trilogy has also been postponed by one year, with the first in December 2023, the second in 2025 and the third in 2027.
Karamon, illuminated by colorful fireworks and light at nationwide events, remains of the Ichijodani Asakura clan in Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture, on the evening of July 24th
On the evening of July 24th, less than one year before the opening of the Tokyo Olympics, which had been postponed due to the spread of the new corona virus, the Japan Youth Chamber (JC) held a nationwide fireworks event to enliven society as much as possible.
It was unfortunate rainy weather in Fukui Prefecture, but nine locations were launched as planned, coloring the summer night sky.
It was realized by calling on block councils across the country to overcome the sense of stagnation caused by the spread of the infection and serve as a signal for Japan to be reborn.
It all started at 8 p.m. at 117 locations in 46 prefectures.
At the ruins of the Ichijodani Asakura clan in Fukui City, a total of 53 rounds, including the 2nd to 4th balls, were launched for about two minutes while the surrounding mountains were covered with haze.
With the light of the fireworks, the Karamon Gate emerged in the dark night, creating a magical atmosphere.
Within the prefecture, events were also held along the Matsubara Coast in Tsuruga and along the Mana River in Ono.
They did not announce the launch site in advance, hoping to avoid attracting many spectators to prevent infection.
