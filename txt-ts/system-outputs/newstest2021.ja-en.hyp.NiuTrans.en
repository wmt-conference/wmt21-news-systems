Honoka becomes [Tanaka Minami's style hair]!
Report on the full cut (CanCam.jp) - Yahoo! News
Add a layer to the heavy semi-long hair [Minami style] for soft hair
CanCam model Honoka takes on the challenge of creating a hairstyle with movement like Tanaka Minami, whom she admires, saying, "Of course it's beautiful, but it's also very professional and I respect it!"
We asked Asahi Mitsuteru of Omotesando's hair salon "SUNVALLY", who is actually working on Tanaka Minami's haircut, to give her "Minami style hair".
Report on the cutting process!
Nogizaka 46 Yamashita Mitsuki on the cover for the first time with short hair!
First of all, check out the slight hair before cutting.
Thin, soft, and plentiful.
She has a habit, especially during the rainy season, when she gets boisterous, so she sometimes wears a straight perm.
It is a heavy semi-long with nagashi bangs.
The cut is finally starting!
To make it easier to cut, first lightly wet the whole thing.
After that, separate the top of the bee (above the most protruding part of the head) and cut it from the bottom.
By the way, here are some of the key points of hair that brings you closer to Minami!
1 Tablebang By shortening the inside of the bangs slightly, you can enjoy changes depending on the styling, such as slightly thicker when fully lowered, and see-through when lightly separated.
2 Cut that makes use of the habit If you have a habit of having multiple hairs and reduce the amount of hair too much, it can spread even more easily.
While consulting on the balance around that area, it is easy to handle but difficult to spread, and it keeps the balance that makes your own swell live.
(3) Layer around the face and hair layer = cut with steps.
If you put a layer around your face, it will make it easier for you to move around, giving you a cute finish.
If you make the curly hair in three places, the temple, the front and back of the momiage, it will look stylish even when it is quickly put together.
The hair on the bee that had been separated was also cut together, and then it was placed around the face.
Pull the upper part of the hair around the face forward and cut the tip of the hair.
This way, when the hair bundle is lowered, there will be a step difference, making it easier to move (this is the layer cut).

Governor Yoshimura "Partners with Gurunavi" against Corona (Sankei Sports) - Yahoo! News
Osaka Prefecture Governor Yoshimura Hirofumi (45) made a remote appearance from the prefectural office on ABC TV's "Cast" (Monday to Friday, March 48) on the 20th, revealing that he is considering a partnership with restaurant information website Gurunavi as part of measures to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus.
Since the beginning of this month, Osaka Prefecture has issued "Infection Prevention Declaration Stickers" to businesses that comply with the guidelines in order to promote efforts to prevent the spread of the disease and to provide peace of mind to residents of the prefecture.
However, only 11,000 stickers have been issued in the prefecture, which is said to be more than 120,000 restaurants alone.
So Governor Yoshimura said, "We are planning to do it at the end of the month, but we will form a partnership with Gurunavi and other companies so that when you make a reservation, you can put out a store that issues a declaration sticker so that you can see it at the reservation stage." and announced the tag team with the online reservation site.
"The important thing is not to put it all together as a 'night town'. We should clearly separate the shops that are taking measures against infectious diseases from those that are not. It is also important to make efforts to increase the number of shops that are taking measures against infectious diseases." he said.

Seibu 0-5 Lotte (10th round, MetLife Dome) Lotte's starter, Taneichi Atsuki, threw 136 pitches alone in 9 innings, making him a happy first professional shutout in his fourth year.
This season, he won his third victory in the first round of the Pa League shutout, ending the team's two-game losing streak.
In the first inning, Taneichi allowed Suzuki Shohei to start the game with a double that broke the third base line, but immediately after that, he hit Genda Sosuke with a triple, and Suzuki Masaru, who was aiming to advance to the base, also touched out at third base.
Helped by the calm response of his side's defense, he was able to get through the pinch at the start with zero, and after the second inning, he was at the mercy of the Seibu batting line with a combination of sliders and forks, centering on the straight that he was proud of.
He gets up on his back and puts zeros on the scoreboard.
The batting line was struggling to beat the opponent's starter, Honda Keisuke, but Kanno Takeshi, the third in the top of the seventh inning, started the game with a walk, and Oka Oumi, the substitute, stole second.
On this occasion, Yasuda Naonori, the fourth player, hit a right-handed shot with a value of 1,000 gold, finally breaking the balance.
Then, in the eighth inning, he attacked his opponent, Miyagawa Tetsu, who was in third place, and scored four points in a row, including a double in the middle of the left field for the first time since the transfer of Toritani Takashi, who was on the way.
They folded as if pushing the back of a young ace candidate from the Marines, and decided the match at once.
Taneichi was eliminated in the eighth inning with three outs, and then returned in the ninth inning with more than 100 pitches.
"I put a lot of effort into it." he said with consecutive walks, leading to a pinch hit with the bases loaded with two outs, but at the end of the game, Spangenberg struck out his 10th of the day with a high straight and set the game.
With a smile on his face, he was delighted.
Bye Bye Tsuruoka Police Station Collaborates with Affiliated Organizations to Raise Safety Awareness | Yamagata Newspaper
At a bicycle class held as the start of the operation, a collision test between a car and a bicycle was carried out at Shoko Gakuen Automobile Training School in Tsuruoka City
In recent years, the Tsuruoka Police Station (Chief Sato Keizo) has launched "Operation Bye Bye Accident Zero" in an effort to eliminate accidents involving bicycles and motorbikes, which have occurred at a high rate in the area.
In addition to raising awareness of accident prevention in cooperation with traffic safety organizations in the area, the government will also strengthen enforcement of bicycle traffic rules violations.
This year, there have been three fatal traffic accidents within the jurisdiction of the station, and a motorbike or bicycle driver has died.
Although the number of accidents has been on a downward trend, the rate of accidents involving bicycles is about 11.7% as of June 30th, and the rate of accidents involving motorcycles is about 5.8%, both of which are higher than the prefectural average.
In particular, the rate of bicycle accidents in the past five years has often been higher than the prefectural average, so we planned an operation to overcome this situation.
The name of the operation was multiplied by "bike" and "bicycle" to mean the eradication of accidents.
Affiliated organizations will be invited more than ever to teach elderly people how to drive and use night light reflectors in traffic safety classes.
At the station, yellow cards (guidance warning forms) are issued to encourage caution when enforcement is carried out.
The opening ceremony for the operation was held on the 21st at Shoko Gakuen Automobile Training School in Tsuruoka City.
About 30 people attended, and Chief Sato said, "I would like to ask for your cooperation in reducing even one tragic accident."
A person in charge of the department presented the policy and the activities of each organization.
Bicycle classes will continue to be held as a starting event for the operation.
A police officer in a car demonstrated how the impact on a bicycle is different when it hits a bicycle with the brakes applied, and when it hits a bicycle at a speed of about 55km / h without stepping on the brakes.
Kinnai Koichi, chairman of the Tsuruoka Regional Traffic Safety Activities Promotion Committee, said, "I realized once again the horror of traffic accidents. I want to call attention not only to the elderly but also to young people."

On the 25th, the first regular vaudeville in five months was held at the public vaudeville theater "Comedy Akasakatei" (Sobun, Akaiwa City), which had been closed due to the new coronavirus.
Kaminarimon Kisuke (75), a rakugo storyteller based in Akasakatei, and others elicited laughter from the audience with their professional storytelling.
Kisuke performed "Prohibition Banya." in which a liquor store trying to bring in sake engages in a comical exchange with a gatekeeper at the request of a vassal who has been ordered to abstain from alcohol by the lord.
There was a lot of laughter at the sharp speech and the gesture of drinking deliciously.
A company employee (58) from Naka-ku, Okayama, who visited with his wife, said with a smile, "The way they spoke and the way they interacted with each other was exquisite, and I was immediately drawn in."
Kisuke said, "It was my first performance in a long time, and my voice was still in good shape, but it was a fulfilling time."
Guest rakugo storyteller Katsura Kotome (31) from Osaka and magic group Tsuyama Magic Club also made an appearance.
Comedy Akasakatei opened in 1996 in the former town of Akasaka-cho as the first public vaudeville theater in Japan.
They continued to hold regular yose and demae yose once a month, but due to the new corona, the yose was cancelled after the last performance in February of this year.

Demonstrators protest against the detention and dismissal of Governor Furgal in the Khabarovsk region of Russia's Far East on the 25th (AP)
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Demonstrations were held in the Khabarovsk region of Russia's Far East on the 25th to protest the detention and dismissal of Governor Furgal.
This is the 15th consecutive day of demonstrations, and this is an unusual situation.
Criticism has also been directed at Putin.
In the capital city of Moscow, security officials have not taken the usual measures to detain people en masse, and the government's cautious attitude of taking into account the feelings of the residents is evident.
Former governor Furgal, a member of the far-right Liberal Democratic Party, won a landslide victory in the 2018 gubernatorial runoff election against the incumbent candidate of Putin's ruling party, United Russia, with about 70% of the vote.
He was one of the few non-ruling governors in Russia, but was detained by security forces on the 9th of this month.
The charges were announced to be related to two murders of businessmen between 2004 and 2005.

Butler once again praises Tyler Herro, the young warrior who will lead the future of the Heat: "The way of thinking is not that of a rookie" (Basket Count) - Yahoo! News
Photo by Getty ImagesThe Heat's first scrimmage (practice match) will be against the Kings.
In the 104-98 victory, Duncan Robinson scored a team-high 18 points, followed by Tyler Herro with 15 points, and the backcourt was brilliant.
Robinson, one of the best shooters in the league, as well as rookie Hero, the 13th overall pick in the draft, will be an important factor for the Heat.
Hero missed 15 games between February and March due to an ankle injury, and the season was suspended for a long time after his return match against the Hornets on March 12.
Hero said, "I had a lot of time, so I was able to get back to 100% condition. It's the best feeling I've ever felt." but his performance at the scrimmage was more convincing than words.
With starting point guard Kendrick Nunn late to join the team, Hero's playing time increased, and he took advantage of that opportunity.
It's a great value because it's 15 points after playing a different role than usual brilliantly.
Team leader Jimmy Butler once again praised his "favorite" hero.
"He can be a handler, he can score, he can defend. He's a player who can do everything for the team. He can handle any position because his way of thinking is not that of a rookie. He looks at the footage and studies it, and he's trying to figure out where and how his teammates move and become free, and what he should do about it."
Even before the start of the season, Butler has liked the hero's unflinching determination to lose as a rookie, as well as his stoic attitude towards basketball.
That's why I invited him to a private practice session that starts at 4 o'clock in the morning, and we have been training together.
Butler once said, "He gives his opinion to everyone, and he doesn't back down. I respect that fighting spirit."
Butler is the type of person who always says what he thinks, and if he thinks it will be good for the team, he will give harsh opinions, knowing that there will be a clash.
In the past, this has led to a deterioration in his relationship with his teammates.
Butler must have overlaid his young self as a hero.
Butler's personality, which is sometimes too harsh for his teammates, is a good guide for those who have the guts to follow him.
If the teacher-student relationship between the two men, who respect each other, spreads to the team as a whole, the Heat will become a team that can aim even higher.

Round 4 (Kusanagi 1st match) Hamamatsu Johoku Ko 0000000-0 410000 × -5 Shimada Sho match time 1 hour 26 minutes
Review: Shimada Sho took advantage of the opportunity in the early stages and won a shutout against Hamamatsu Johoku Ko.
Shimada Sho opened the scoring with a double by Matsuura with the bases loaded in the first inning.
He added two more points with an infield grounder and a squeeze.
Starting pitcher Saito threw six innings, giving up only one hit and no runs.
Hamamatsu Johoku Takumi was unable to take advantage of the opportunity to complete the bases with two outs in the final inning.
The fourth round led by the third year
Second year Matsuura hits first shot of gratitude
It was the fourth time in his second year that he made his first appearance this summer that he lost his opponent.
Shimada Sho's Matsuura hit a changeover ball with the bases loaded in the first inning and carried it to the left.
"If I lost for three years, I would retire immediately. I wanted to hit it and let it win."
The talented player, who also played No. 4 last fall, was proud.
In the first and third rounds, they fought mainly for three years, and in the second year when they were strong, they were on the sidelines.
Ikeda gathered the players at the meeting and told Nine, "Three years have passed so far. We will go with the best team in the future."
On this day, four of the nine starters solidified their main focus in two years.
It may seem cruel, but it is proof that he is committed to a serious game.
Matsuura is reassuring, saying, "From now on, the level of opposing pitchers will rise. I will go with the intention of returning runners."
Saito, who had been throwing consecutive pitches, threw well in the sixth inning with only one hit, and did not even step on second base, showing his pride for three years.
The number 10 received positive feedback as a synergistic effect, saying, "Two years out will inspire me for three years. I hope it will lead to victory."
The team aiming to reach the top four for the third year in a row, including last year's Shizuoka tournament, has no intention of making memories of the remaining games.
Singing with residents of Fukushima Prefecture 16 musicians associated with Fukushima Prefecture gather around the world (Fukushima Minpo) - Yahoo! News
I want to bring the energetic voices of Hama, Naka and Aizu to the world.
Sixteen musicians associated with Fukushima Prefecture came together to create a message song.
The lyrics depict the earnestness of Fukushima Prefecture as it strives to recover from the Great East Japan Earthquake and TEPCO's Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident, as well as fighting the new coronavirus.
Incorporating the voices of the residents, the "complete version" will be completed by next summer, which marks the 10th anniversary of the earthquake.
On the 24th, the song was released on YouTube, a video posting site.
The title of the song is "Pray from Fukushima".
The positive attitude of the people is expressed in a cheerful and energetic melody, with the desire to "convey it from Fukushima".
Due to the impact of the new corona, live houses that serve as the base for music activities have been forced to close, and many musicians have lost their place to sing and perform.
It was planned by singer / songwriter nappo (46), who lives in Minamisoma City, and DAZU-O (37) of Iwaki City's music group "Mehikari Boys", in order to believe in the power of music at a time when there is no future in sight.
Nappo will be in charge of the lyrics and composition, while Dazuo will be in charge of rap.
When the project started in March during the corona crisis, singer / songwriter Manami (28) and Kanno Jun (38) from Fukushima City agreed one after another, and the circle quickly spread.
Nappo said with an immeasurable face, "We have become a gorgeous lineup that would be unthinkable in normal times. I want to fully enjoy this opportunity."
As a measure against infection, there was no opportunity for sixteen people to gather, and each of them recorded at a live house or at home.
In an effort to support the project, Iwaki City painter Koa drew an image character.

Two new cases of coronavirus confirmed in Sendai (TBC Tohoku Broadcasting System) - Yahoo! News
A man in his 50s and 60s has been found to be infected with the new coronavirus in Sendai.
The confirmed cases are male employees in their 50s and 60s who both live in Sendai.
According to the city of Sendai, one of them, a man in his 60s, was a close contact of a female employee in her 20s who was confirmed to be infected on the 23rd of this month and worked for the same company.
On the 12th of this month, he complained of symptoms such as headache and diarrhea, and on the 25th, the infection was confirmed.
In addition, a man in his 50s complained of headaches and other symptoms on the 19th of this month, and the infection was confirmed on the 25th.

Instantaneous detection of a crisis from online information, false rumors (JBpress) - Yahoo! News
"I want to know where and what kind of disasters and accidents occurred as soon as possible!"
This is not limited to news organizations such as television and newspapers, but there is also a strong need for many companies such as social infrastructure companies and local governments.
A service that responds to this is Spectee, developed by Spectee, an AI-based information analysis company.

Now, the first way people can learn about disasters and accidents is shifting from television to online information (social media).
Social media such as Twitter has become an important medium for disseminating information immediately after a disaster or accident occurs.
However, it is difficult to keep an eye on the overflowing information and extract useful information from it by hand.
Specty has the ability to detect natural disasters and accidents from information that flows through social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, analyze the content, determine the authenticity of the information, and then distribute it to users.
It is a crisis management support service that visualizes various crises occurring both in Japan and overseas, "positioning events that have a negative impact, such as shutting down or stagnating social activities, as a wide range of crises" (CEO Murakami Kenjiro).
NHK was the first major use case of Specty in the wake of the Kumamoto earthquake in April 2016, and since then the recruitment movement has spread rapidly among companies.
In addition to news organizations such as television stations and newspapers, more than 350 companies in Japan are currently using Specty, including companies that support social infrastructure such as electricity, gas and transportation, as well as local governments across the country.
Analyze the posts to determine the type and location of the crisis
Specty distributes information in four steps: "gathering information." "analyzing and classifying content." "titling" and "verifying authenticity."
Users must specify in advance the areas where information will be collected (prefectures, municipalities, etc.) and the categories of crises (disasters, accidents, etc.).
Specty collects posts that fall under that designation using APIs provided by social media.
It then analyzes and classifies the text, images and videos contained in the collected posts.
For example, if a video shows a fire engine, black smoke rising from a building, and orange flames coming out of a room, it would be classified as a "fire."
In addition, images of overturned cars are classified as "traffic accidents" and images of roads covered with water are classified as "road flooding".
Specty also estimates the location of disasters and accidents.
"In many cases, we don't know the location from the post, so we combine various information to estimate it." Murakami said.
For example, if a road sign or sign is reflected in an image or video, the information of the place name is extracted from it, and the location is identified by matching it with the place name database.
Ohtani struck out three with the bases loaded in the first and ninth innings of the fifth inning (Baseball King) - Yahoo! News
Athletics 7x3 Angels (July 24th local time, Oakland Coliseum) Angels player Ohtani Shohei (26) started the opening game against the Athletics in enemy territory on the 24th (25th Japan time) as the third designated hitter.
In the first inning, he hit Nakamae, his first hit of the season, but in the next four at-bats, he retired and went 1 for 5 with one hit and one strikeout.
In the third inning, Ohtani played against Montana again at first base with one out.
In the third inning of the fifth inning, with the score at 1-1, he faced Pettit, the second right-handed pitcher, at first base with one out, and again fell to the ground.
With a 2-1 lead in the fourth inning of the eighth inning, he faced Diekman, the fifth left-hander, as the first batter.
He hit the second straight ball in the opposite direction at a good angle, but it did not go over the fence and he fell to the left.
With the Angels taking a one-point lead in the bottom of the eighth inning, right-handed relief pitcher Batley lost two points and allowed a comeback, but in the ninth inning, new catcher Castro hit his team's first solo shot of the season into the right field seats.
They tied the game at 3-3 in the last minute.
After that, Trout was second in the batting order with a double and a double.
The Athletics bench refused to declare Trout here, and chose to play Ohtani with the bases loaded with two outs.
Ohtani was expected to hit the winning run, but he struck out three pitches in front of Hendricks, the guardian of the Athletics.
The game was not settled in the ninth inning, and the game went into extra time starting at second base, which is a special case this season.
Ohtani was the last batter in the ninth inning, so he became a second baseman.
In the top of the 10th inning for the Angels, Walsh hit a grounder at first base, but Olson caught the ball well and sent it to third base.
Ohtani, who was sandwiched between second and third base, had a touchout.
The Angels then loaded the bases with two outs, but Simmons hit a double in the eighth.
On the other hand, Robles, who returned after an inning for the Angels, was hit by a dead ball and a wild throw at second and third base with one out.
New manager Maddon then shifted the infield to five players, but Robles walked Davis with a walk in the fourth to complete the bases.
Milner, who replaced him on the left arm, carried a bases-loaded single to right field to give Olson a bye in the fifth, and the game was decided.

Can't you get through "cheating crowded" or "home"...?
"Words that I really thought were not dialects" (Netorabo) - Yahoo! News
I am a citizen of Chiba Prefecture, which is close to Tokyo.
I have been living in the prefecture for less than 30 years since I was born.
When I used the word "cheating crowded", which means "sideways", in a conversation with a friend at university (Tokyo), I was instantly taken aback.
They understood the meaning through the flow and sense of language, but residents of Tokyo and Saitama told me not to use it.
It's true, "Do you think it's about cheating and cheating and getting sideways?"
It seems to be connected, so it seems that the meaning can be guessed somehow.
Then there's one more thing.
I didn't realize this when it was pointed out, but the expression "Uchinchi", which means "my house", was not used at all even when I read books, and I didn't even hear it from my friends, so when I looked it up as an adult, it was a dialect.
Eh, "Uchinchi"... was that so?
I also use it in my hometown (Gunma Prefecture), but I didn't realize it because I naturally stopped using it when I was an adult...
Japanese "chilled Chinese food" is not popular among Chinese people...?
Why "cold noodle dishes" are unpopular (modern business) - Yahoo! News
In China, chilled Chinese noodles are called "Japanese-style cold noodles."
As mentioned at the beginning, chilled Chinese cuisine is a Chinese dish (Japanese-style Chinese cuisine) that originated in Japan and was invented based on the Chinese dish "Liang Bang Mien" (chilled mixed soba).
Therefore, although it did not originally exist in China, due to the diversification of food, it has come to be seen in Japanese restaurants in the summer.
Recently, Japanese convenience stores have also introduced arranged products called "Japanese Soba Ryomen / Soba Chilled Chuka" and "Kawako Chicken Ryomen / Sichuan-style Chicken Chilled Chuka".
On the other hand, Japanese-style Chinese cuisine is generally not very popular in China, driven by trendy, punchy Chinese cuisine such as Sichuan and Hunan cuisine.
Of course, Japanese-style Chinese seasonings are often familiar to Chinese people as well.
Therefore, while it is not unpalatable, it tends to be criticized for its lack of impact.
"Chilled Chinese food" is no exception, and it is still a minor presence in China.
By the way, the name of chilled Chinese noodles in China is "Nichiki Reimen."
It is recognized by the Chinese as one of the Japanese dishes.
The summer staple is "Liangpi."
When it comes to noodle dishes that feel like summer in China, "Liangpi" is probably the most popular.
Many people in Japan may not be familiar with it, but the cool skin is a flat noodle made from flour, rice flour, starch and other ingredients that originated in Shanxi Province.
It is said to have a history of 2,000 years.
It is a classic B-grade gourmet that is also sold at food stalls, and the price is around 10 to 20 yuan (150 to 300 yen), which is very reasonable.
Although the word "cool" is included, it is not covered with ice, just like chilled Chinese food in Japan.
Rather, it is based on room temperature.
The noodles are topped with ingredients of your choice, such as shredded cucumbers, carrots and boiled bean sprouts, and condiments such as coriander, chili peppers, ginger and garlic are added.
Finally, it is finished with a special seasoning mixed with soy sauce, chili oil, vinegar, sesame paste and peanut paste.
The noodles, which are smooth and plump, are often intertwined with the refreshing acidity and rich spicy sauce, making them smooth even when they are hot in the summer and have no appetite.
Also, since it has spread all over China, there are various toppings and seasonings, and the wide variety of toppings is one of the characteristics of cool skin, and it is one of the ways to enjoy it.

Advantages of "cold water shower" for body and mind (Cosmopolitan) - Yahoo! News
Reduce inflammation such as muscle pain
A study published in The North American Journal of Medical Sciences examining the effectiveness of hydrotherapy (water treatment) found that it can be expected to be effective for physical and mental healing.
By bathing in cold water after exercise, muscle pain and other inflammatory effects can be suppressed.
According to Douglas Casa, head of the Korey Stringer Institute, which studies sports medicine and teaches at the University of Connecticut, "It's important to exercise and take a cold water shower as little time as possible. By lowering your body temperature immediately after moving your body, you can recover faster from the inflammation and fatigue caused by exercise."
Reduce fatigue
Exercise in high temperatures can cause the heart, muscles and skin to require more blood flow than usual.
"During exercise, the heart rate increases, so blood flow to the heart increases, and muscle blood flow increases because it takes energy to contract the muscles, and when it comes to the skin, a lot of blood flows in to regulate body temperature." says Professor Casa.
"A cold water shower lowers the temperature of the skin, which reduces the flow of blood to the skin. Instead, it sends blood to internal organs such as the gastrointestinal tract, making it easier for water and nutrition to be ingested after exercise. As a result, it reduces the fatigue you feel after exercise."
Expectations for the formis effect
Dorozevsky explains that exposure to cold water can be expected to activate the "Hormisis effect."
The formis effect is the idea that it is better to have a little bit of harmful substances or stress on the body than not at all.
"Hypoxic exercise, petit fasting and cold water showers are typical examples of the formis effects that can be expected for health. Cold water showers stimulate hormones and neurotransmitters, which can increase physical and physical strength and resilience."

Hirano (center) and others receive a plate commissioned by Fujinokuni Sports Supporter in Koyama-cho
On the 24th, Shizuoka Prefecture commissioned two cycling teams from the eastern part of the prefecture as "Fujinokuni Sports Supporter" to help promote sports within the prefecture.
"Team Bridgestone Cycling" based in Mishima and "Levante Fuji Shizuoka" based in Fuji.
Team Bridgestone Cycling athlete Hirano Seiya, who received a commission plate from Governor Kawakatsu Heita at Fuji Speedway in Koyama-cho, expressed his ambition, saying, "We want to work together as a team to enliven cycling together with the people of the prefecture."

Hanshin and Oyama, 2 rounds in a row, No. 7!
Manager Yano: "It's stately to watch" (Sankei Sports) - Yahoo! News
(Se League, Chunichi 2-5 Hanshin, 7th round, Hanshin 4 wins, 3 losses, 24th, Nagoya D) The momentum of No. 4 is unstoppable.
The ball soared high and landed in the middle of the left seat.
Oyama made the arch for the second consecutive race and circled the diamond.
When he returned to the bench, he peeked out his white teeth.
"While I was able to swing well, I was able to narrow down the target ball and take the plunge."
He entered the game in the top of the fourth inning with a 0-2 lead.
He swung aggressively from the first ball, and then the second ball after the foul.
He didn't miss Ono's sweet 134kg slider.
The ball he caught at the core was such a perfect hit that he was convinced he was a stand-in as soon as he hit it.
Following the match against Hiroshima (Koshien) on the 23rd of the previous day, one shot in two consecutive games was a curse on the counterattack.
It was also a valuable shot that he hit from an opponent he was not good at.
When he faced Ono Ono at Koshien on the 17th, he had nine hits and scored four points.
However, as far as Nagoya Dome is concerned, they have allowed seven wins, one loss and one hold in their past 12 games, and since August 23, 2013, they have been suffering from seven consecutive defeats after a draw.
From such a tough opponent, he took the score for the first time in 23 innings at the Nagoya Dome (even if he left the game in the middle, it was counted as one inning) with a powerful single shot, and did not pass the flow of the game.
Manager Yano also expressed his hope for further explosions, saying, "Being able to finish a sweet ball well is a high level. It has a stature to watch, and even if the timing of hitting is a foul, there is an atmosphere. I think they will still hit it."
In the first inning, he hit a right-handed hit, marking his sixth consecutive hit and third consecutive multi-hit game.
The start of the season was just around the corner, but with seven home runs and 16 RBIs, he has already done an impeccable job as the team's top and fourth.
In order to win, we will continue to produce results.

The national team has decided to return to the top group, where they will be able to participate in all matches of the seven-man World Series (WS) starting next season, but since it is uncertain whether the WS itself will be held around the world, Iwabuchi revealed that they are negotiating a strengthening match by focusing on countries that allow the national team to enter the country.
"Medical Worker" Infected First in Nagano Prefecture to conduct PCR tests on all female contacts in their 40s at Suwa Red Cross Hospital (NBS Nagano Broadcasting System) - Yahoo! News
A woman in her 40s from Suwa City, Nagano Prefecture, has been found to be infected with the new coronavirus.

Macao casino supervisory authority inspects implementation of anti-epidemic measures at casino facilities... New coronavirus negative certificate required when entering (Macao News) - Yahoo! News
About 40 casino facilities in Macau were closed for 15 days from February 5th to 19th due to the outbreak of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19), but have reopened since February 20th with strict anti-epidemic measures in place.
The Macao Casino Regulatory Authority (DICJ) requires operators to protect the health of their employees and guests as much as possible when they reopen, ensuring distance between gaming (casino) tables, allowing table games to be played next to each other (for example, at baccarat tables, only three to four people can sit at one table at the same time), and slot machines to be operated every other time, reducing the risk of cross-infection.
Disinfection of gaming equipment such as chips has also been strengthened.
Guests are also required to wear masks, have their temperature checked, and present a valid health code (generated by entering their most recent stay history, contact history with a new corona patient, symptoms such as fever and cough, and contact information) when entering.
From midnight on July 15th, a negative nucleic acid test certificate for the new coronavirus (limited to those within the validity period issued by a licensed facility in Macau or Guangdong Province) was added to the requirement.
The new requirement to present a negative certificate is due to the easing of border measures between Macau and Guangdong Province from 6am on the 15th (the elimination of the 14-day quarantine, subject to various conditions), which is a precautionary measure.
On July 18th, DICJ announced that in response to the change in admission conditions starting on the 15th of the same month, Director General Adriano Ho and others from the agency observed the implementation of anti-epidemic measures at casino facilities, and held a meeting with security department representatives from six casino operators, once again calling for the protection of the health of employees and guests by thoroughly managing the admission of guests.
The DICJ stated that it will continue to conduct strict patrols of casino facilities, and that it will have regular meetings with management companies in line with the situation and evaluation, and that it will also adjust anti-epidemic measures at casinos as appropriate in accordance with the guidelines of the government health department.
The visit to the casino facility was accompanied by Hayashimatsu, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at the Health Bureau, who gave guidance on how to disinfect gaming chips and keep a safe distance between seats on electronic casino equipment.
However, due to a sharp drop in inbound passenger traffic due to anti-epidemic measures including restrictions on entry into the country, total casino sales from January to June this year fell 77.4% from the same period last year to 33.72 billion macaopataka (Japanese yen equivalent: about 451.9 billion yen).
Light cheer from Yuwaku Onsen Message to medical workers in place of Bonbori Festival next month (Hokkoku Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
At Yuwaku Onsen, where the annual Yuwaku Bonbori Festival has been cancelled due to the new coronavirus, efforts to light bonbori with messages of support for medical workers will begin on August 1st.
Paper written by fans and local residents from all over the country is attached to about 350 bonbori, and the town of hot water is enveloped in a light of cheer, bringing healing to visitors.
The Bonbori Festival is an event that recreates the festival that appears in the anime "Hana Saku Iroha", which is modeled after Yuwaku Onsen, and is organized by the Yuwaku Onsen Tourism Association.
It started in 2011, when the anime was broadcast, and attracts many anime fans from all over the country every year.
Every year, from the lighting ceremony in July to the main festival in October, bonbori are lit up on the stairs leading to Yuwaku Inari Shrine next to Soyu.
This year, the festival was forced to be cancelled due to the new corona, but fans from all over the country and the local community said one after another, "It's sad that there are no bonbori in the summer of Yuwaku." and the association came up with the idea for this project.
The campaign was called "Recovery Campaign" in the hope that it would help heal and recover the world that is struggling due to the corona crisis.
So far, about 50 local students from Yuwaku Elementary School and Shibahara Junior High School have been asked to write a message with an illustration, and more than 100 applications have been received from all over the country.
You can purchase the message form from the association's website, fill it out, put it in a reply envelope and send it to the association, where you can receive a photo of it lit up by attaching it to a bonbori.
For a set of 61,000 yen, applications will be accepted until the total number of bonbori is about 350.
The bonbori is scheduled to be lit until the end of November.
Yamashita Shinichiro (48), who has been the chairman of the festival's executive committee since the first time, said, "When we read the message, we are encouraged. Next year will be the 10th anniversary of the festival, and we want to hold a grand festival."
For the campaign, illustrations of blooming Iroha characters and Asanogawa Ohashi Bridge have also been prepared.
From the first day, a clear file with illustrations will be given to users of the special accommodation plan at a ryokan in Yuwaku Onsen.
Core 4 "Moriyama Gaigen" that supports Seibu connects the soul (Taspo Web) - Yahoo! News
Seibu's proud "Moriyama Gaigen" showed the spirit of cooperation and produced the second farewell win of the season.
In the match against Lotte (MetLife) on the 24th, it was 2-2 in the ninth inning, and the four players, who were still far from being in good shape, showed their tenacity to win.
In the first inning, Genda started the game with a head slide from a safety bunt to first base.
Then, in the last six games, Mori, who is at the bottom of the table with a batting average of 10%, 8% and 2%, sent a bunt to second base with one out.
Yamakawa, No. 4, was shunned, and Sotozaki, who had been replaced by Mori since that day and returned to No. 5, smashed Masuda's straight ball, leading to a 3-2 victory.
Hero Sotozaki said, "(Genda's safety) caught me by surprise even when I was on the bench, and I thought I had no choice but to do something about it. I felt that Tomoya believed in me behind him with a bunt and connected with me. Yamakawa was shy and gave me a word before going to first base, saying, 'Be active!', so I was able to get my feelings in quickly." and the result was the thoughts of the three of them who made the flow of farewell.
Mori and Yamakawa, who were first and second in the 2013 draft, Sotozaki, who was third in 2014, and Genda, who was third in 2016, are the "core four" of the field that team officials call "the heart of our current home."
All of them had experience as captains when they were amateurs, and their sense of responsibility is more than anyone else.
Sotozaki, who took over as captain from Yamakawa when he was in his fourth year at Fuji University, said, "Yamakawa-san is a good talker, so he is a captain who leads the team with words. On the other hand, I am not good at speaking, so I left the conversation to the vice-captain who is good at speaking, and I was the type of person who stood behind me."
Director Tsuji praised the spirit of Moriyama Gaigen, saying, "Genda's safety? That's not a sign. But I thought, 'Alright, I can go.' Tomoya was also a great bunt. Sotozaki also hit well."
All four of them are currently struggling with a batting average of 20%, 4 to 5 minutes, but even if they can't hit, they are still supporting the team with the wisdom and wisdom to win.

After teaching at Bansho Shirabesho, the Shogunate's research and educational institution for Western studies, he opened a private school, Kyukyodo, in Edo, where he taught Western studies, military science and medicine.
After returning to the Choshu Domain, he continued to give lectures on military science at Yamaguchi Meirinkan.
The statue focused on Masujiro as an educator.
Standing next to the globe, holding a book in his hand, he gave a lecture on Western studies.
The height of the statue, which is combined with the pedestal, is about 3 (1.55), and it is said that it was made from the perspective of a disciple who was taking a lecture from Masujiro.
The design was done by local designer Takami Marie (27), a descendant of Masujiro's wife, Kotoko.
The 150th anniversary of the death of Omura Masujiro (Chairman Okamoto Satoshi), whose parent organization is the Suzenji Local Government Association, solicited donations to build the building.
About 12.8 million yen was raised from 1,104 people from all over the country.
The cost of the project, including the installation of the nameplate, is about 12 million yen.
The leftover donations will be used for the maintenance and management of the statue.
Chairman Okamoto said, "Masujiro, who continued to have high aspirations and made great contributions as an educator, is the pride of Furusato. A bronze statue that will serve as hope for the children of the region who will be responsible for the future."
Embape leaves the venue wearing crutches after being injured after a vicious tackle (SPORT.es) - Yahoo! News
Paris Saint-Germain won for the 13th time in two years after beating Saint-Etienne 1-0 in the Coupe de France final at the Stade de France on the 24th.
PSG win two domestic titles
Neymar's goal in the first half to beat Saint-Etienne in the final was the final goal for PSG, who have won two domestic titles following Ligue 1, but are now in a situation where they have no choice but to worry about the Champions League in August.
Kylian Mbapp, who started in the same match, was injured after being hit by a vicious sliding tackle by his opponent, CB Loic Peran.
In the first half of the half, the young French star distorted his face in pain after being knocked down with his right ankle sandwiched between him.
Players from both teams got into a scuffle over the play.
Embape, who is believed to have twisted his right ankle, is unable to continue playing.
Peran was shown a red card.
After the match, Embape left the stadium on crutches with his right leg fixed.
PSG will play the Coupe de la Ligue final against Lyon on 1 August at 04: 10 JST, but it will definitely be impossible to use Embape in this match.
He will have to wait for a medical report to be released by the club, but there is a possibility that he will miss the Champions League in Portugal.
Konno (from Hachinohe) launches online museum "HASARD" "close to art" during the corona crisis (Daily Tohoku Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
There is a museum where anyone can experience art for free at any time they like.
They range from famous painters such as Claude Monet and Gustav Klimt to unknown domestic artists.
Since its opening in April 2019, the online museum "HASARD" has captured the hearts of users due to its convenience and novelty, and gained even more attention as a result of the new way of life caused by the corona crisis.
Konno Shinnosuke (26), a representative from Hachinohe who started the site and lives in Tokyo, said, "We wanted to create a service where everyone can easily enjoy art. We want people to come into contact with art in difficult circumstances."
What surprises you when you visit Ather is the abundance of exhibits and the beauty of the images.
As of the 24th, a total of 14 permanent and special exhibitions have been opened to the public, and the ultra-high resolution works that convey not only the color but also the texture of the brush attract visitors.
Membership registration and admission fees are not required, and it is characterized by the fact that not only the viewer but also the artist who wants to hold a solo exhibition do not have to pay.
The way it is shown online is also attracting attention.
Moving the picture is one of them.
In Claude Monet's permanent exhibition, "It Starts Moving Again." clouds, flowers and grasslands are digitally processed to make them move.
"I want people who are not interested in art to be able to enter." Konno said, so you can feel like you are in a painting.
Konno first encountered art when he was in elementary school.
When I visited the newly completed Aomori Prefectural Museum of Art with my family at the time, I saw three huge paintings of Marc Chagall's "Aleko" and was shocked by their power.
The next day, art classes turned into a fun time, and even after moving to Tokyo on the occasion of going to university, he began to visit galleries and other places.
At the same time, I also felt that there were many people who did not have many opportunities to interact with art from various perspectives, such as the lack of museums nearby, large exhibitions being held only in the Tokyo metropolitan area, and the difficulty of going out due to childcare.
So, while working for an IT company, he spent about two months setting up a website where art can be viewed on the internet.
The number of users reached an average of 10,000 per month in the first 10 months, and increased to about 30,000 after the spread of the new coronavirus.
I hope that anyone can appreciate art in a free way when they want to see it.
Azar's aim was unexpectedly accepted by more people due to the corona crisis.
Speaking about the significance of art appreciation, Konno emphasized that it enriches the imagination.
"When you have a lot of imagination, you can reach out to people in need.
I hope that by making art more accessible, we can become a better society. "
The simple reason why the era of Chinese quality is over and the era of Japanese quality is coming (modern business) - Yahoo! News
The pandemic has changed our values
Various predictions and discussions are taking place about the post-pandemic world.
On the business front, there is a possibility that the changes mentioned in the July 8th article, "In fact, 'managerial' jobs are starting to disappear in Japan...! The cruel reality", and the July 4th article, "In the post-corona world, 'Japanese manufacturing' is actually about to make a big comeback...!"
Photo: The true identity of "Japan's strength" that only Japanese people don't know... Unexpected reality seen in Asia
Also, on the mental front, it seems that the trend will become mainstream, such as the June 26th article, "How to burn completely" for people who have become aware of the end of their lives due to corona, and the June 10th article, "Now that corona is full of riots, let's reexamine the utility of 'asking God in times of hardship'".
And what we can clearly see as a combination of these two "materials (economy and business)" and "spirit" is the major trend of "from Chinese quality to Japanese quality".
For example, if a T-shirt or digital camera is defective or defective, it would be exasperating, but there is no difference in the life of the person who bought it.
On the other hand, the sloppy quality of masks and ventilators made in China that have recently become a hot topic... "Chinese quality" in products that are directly linked to life and safety is fatal.
No matter how cheap it is, you can't buy such a product.
They will be looking for products of "Japanese quality" even if they pay a considerable price.
Of course, this trend is not just happening in Japan.
It is clear from the fact that Western countries, which had fallen into a difficult situation due to a shortage of masks and medical equipment, still made "returns" one after another due to the severity of "Chinese quality".
Safe and secure rather than cheap
In addition, products such as automobiles are products where defects can be fatal (death in an accident).
No matter how many countries, including China and Korea, go on the offensive with the cheap selling strategy of "cheap or bad", they will not be able to compete with Japanese products in the end, and the situation that I mentioned in the June 16th article, "Will the world's automakers fall in love with Toyota after all?" is due to the strong demand for "Japanese quality" in automobile products.
And the pandemic has reminded us that many other products also need "safety and security."
In addition, safety and security are important not only for "Japanese quality in manufacturing" but also for "Japanese quality in logistics and other services".
Like the toilet paper scandal, there are times when production capacity is properly available, but intermediate distribution is delayed and cannot be reached.
Furthermore, as in the April 17th article, "Who is the real culprit in the shortage of masks? Don't forgive the Chinese Communist government's fire pit thieves", it made me keenly aware that self-sufficiency in Japan is also an important element of "safety and security."
In the event of an emergency, it is natural for every country to give priority to their own country, and it is very important to be able to procure essential items such as masks (medical equipment) and food within their own country.
South Korea reports over 100 new cases of coronavirus for the first time in 115 days, with 86 new cases coming from overseas (Yonhap News Agency) - Yahoo! News

It was the first time in 115 days that the number of new cases per day exceeded 100 since April 1st (101).
In addition to 32 crew members found to be infected on a Russian ship that entered the port of Busan, 32 of the 293 workers who returned from Iraq on the 24th tested positive.

Nagoya player Miyahara tests positive for corona in J1 football for first time since league resumed | Shizuoka Shimbun @ S
J1 soccer team Nagoya announced on the 25th that defender Miyahara Kazuya (24) has tested positive for the new coronavirus.
This is the first time a player has tested positive since the J-League resumed.
He is the third player from the club to be infected in June, following forward Kanezaki Yumeo (31) and Australian goalkeeper Mitchell Langerak (31).
The two players have already been treated and returned to the game.
This season's Miyahara was on the bench for the J1 match against Oita at Showa Denko Dome Oita on the 22nd.
In an online press conference on the 25th, Nagoya announced that 60 players and staff members had been tested for PCR on the same day.

It turns out that the white paint derived from Teflon-processed frying pans enhances the cooling effect with insulation!
No way, it's a big discovery!
This year, the rainy season was marked by an unprecedented amount of rainfall, but if it becomes clear, the hot summer will be in full swing.
It's hot, it's hot, it's so hot that even the air conditioning doesn't work... just imagining it is going to make you feel bad, right?
Global warming is a major global problem, and we have been focusing our wisdom on how we can overcome the hot summer with even a little comfort.
One way to do this is to wear thin, white clothes.
Look, you don't have to wear black clothes that absorb heat in the summer, do you?
And it seems that the same principle is being applied to the construction of houses, and the use of white paint is increasing.
The latest field of research was whether white could be made into a paint that reflects more light and does not absorb heat, even if it is white.
Recently, Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Approved Science at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), in collaboration with researchers from Columbia University's Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics, announced that they have found a method for blending white paint that can most efficiently bounce back solar heat and improve the cooling effect inside buildings.
It is said that it will be put into practical use as soon as possible.
Up until now, white paint with the highest reflectivity of the sun's rays has been made from titanium oxide, which has a reflectivity of 85%.
White paint made from titanium oxide has already been applied to the roofs of buildings in high temperature environments, helping to block out solar heat and increase air conditioning efficiency.
However, what has been newly discovered is a white paint derived from polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) fluorine resin, which is used in Teflon-processed frying pans.
The Teflon effect is applied to the white paint, which reflects up to 98% of the sun's rays and is said to be able to significantly cut heat.
Even in the hot summer, thanks to the surprisingly Teflon white paint, it is easy to spend time indoors without being exposed to the extreme heat.
Such an era may be coming soon, right?
I feel like the roofs of Japanese houses have a lot of dark colors, but I wonder if white will become the mainstream in the future?
When will Amazon's big annual sale be held this year?
CNBC reported on July 21st that Amazon.com has announced the postponement of its annual Prime Day sale.
It is held every year in July, but this year it was reported that it had to be postponed due to the spread of the new coronavirus.
"Details will be announced soon." an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement.
"Prime Day has become a special celebration that we have been looking forward to over the past five years. This year, we will hold it later than usual, ensuring the safety of our employees and supporting our customers and retailers."
However, he only stated that "details will be announced soon" and did not reveal a specific date for the event.
On the other hand, it was decided that the event would be held in India.
A press release was posted on the country's website.
He explained that it will be held for 48 hours from midnight on August 6th.
Prime Day has been held simultaneously around the world until now, but this year it may be an unusual step.
A large event that will sell 760 billion yen in two days Amazon launched a large sale for its members in 2015 as a measure to promote sales during the summer when sales are declining.
Originally a 24-hour event, it has grown in scale year by year, and last year it was held for 48 hours from midnight on July 15th in 18 countries including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, India, Japan, China and Australia.
According to the company, last year's two-day sales exceeded previous sales on Black Friday (the first day of the year-end sales season) and Cyber Monday (the following Monday).
The event has also contributed to the acquisition of new paid Prime subscribers, and last year the number of applications on the first day reached a record high for a single day, followed by the next day.
Last year, the company sold 175 million products worldwide.
Internet Retailer, a magazine specializing in the online shopping industry, reported that total global sales for the two days were $7.16 billion, up 70% from the previous year.
Mobile number migration and excessive retention are hard to look at.
What happens to fees and points?
(New Switch) - Yahoo! News
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) is in full swing considering revising the MNP system, which allows users to use traditional phone numbers as they are when changing mobile phone companies.
At a panel of experts on the 21st, the government announced plans to revise the MNP guidelines established in 2004.
Specific issues range from the state of MNP fees to the pros and cons of retaining those who wish to move out.
As opposition from telecommunications companies is expected, attention will be focused on whether this will lead to the promotion of healthy market competition.
Darkness of telecommunications companies far from unlimited mobile phone transfers When MNP was introduced in 2006, the user fee was 2,000 yen, but now it is 3,000 yen.
The MNP fee revenue of the three major mobile communications companies is estimated to be 15.9 billion yen per year.
On the 21st, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications listed the current situation surrounding MNP at the meeting of the Working Group on Verification of Competition Rules (WG), a panel of experts that discusses the competitive environment in the telecommunications market.
The time required for consumers to issue MNP reservation numbers when they move to other telecommunications companies was also a jaw-dropping task.
Major telecommunications companies accept applications on the web, but due to the operation of the core system, the reception time is mainly from 9: 00 to 20: 00.
In the WG document, it was clearly stated that the direction of future consideration would be to respond throughout the day in principle.
It is also a problem that mobile phone companies try to keep people who wish to move out of MNP by giving them points.
This was based on the judgment that excessive retention could impede fair competition.
Kita Shunichi, partner at Nomura Research Institute, who is a member of the WG, suggests, "We will get permission from the user to give us time to explain the provision of economic benefits, and if the user does not grant it, we will issue a number as soon as possible to end the process. It is important to thoroughly implement this process first."
However, among a series of issues, there is a structural problem with MNP fees: "The higher the fee, the less likely it will be for customers to spill out, so it is difficult to motivate them to actively lower their fees." said a person in charge of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications.
If some businesses take the lead in lowering MNP fees, there will be an increase in customer outflow from that company, and there is concern that the company's efforts will not be rewarded.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications has also pointed out that many countries overseas do not require user fees for MNP, and this is likely to happen in Japan as well.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications hopes to compile a report on the results of the WG around September and October, after which it will begin the process of revising the MNP guidelines.
If the revision is to be made, it is likely to be after 2021.
Mobile phone companies are likely to be struggling with issues such as sales and customer support.
Chunichi and Katsuno won't get the right to be the winning pitcher after six scoreless innings (Sankei Sports) - Yahoo! News
Chunichi pitcher Katsuno Shokei (23) will start the eighth round of Hanshin (Nagoya Dome) on the 25th.
He gave up four hits and no runs in six innings.
"There was also the last pitch, so I thought it was my last chance to throw. There was also a foreball, but I was able to compete with the opponent without worrying too much."
He made his first appearance of the season and his last start against Hanshin (Koshien) on the 18th, both of which struggled to control the ball and left by the fourth inning.
Unable to fulfill his role as a starter, this time it was a backwater mound where he was fighting for survival in the army.
This time, he attacked the fierce tiger batting line, which was doing well, with a ball full of emotion.
When a straight ball in the latter half of the 140km range ran, it was possible to use a change ball such as a count ball effectively.
In the sixth inning, he was hit by a double in the middle of the left field by the Suns in the first inning, but Oyama was hit by a double in the left field and Bohr was hit by a double in the second inning at third base.
In the match against Fukudome, he drove with two balls, and finally forked.
He struck out swinging in a three-ball game and survived a pinch hit.
Katsuno finished the sixth inning with 83 pitches, but at the end of the middle game, Yoda came off the bench and announced the change of pitcher.
Nishi Isamu, who played in the pitching match, had 108 pitches at the same time, but he got off the mound first and was unable to earn the right to win for the first time this season.

Masuda Shrine, located in the Takagushi area of Tano, Hizen-cho, Karatsu City, enshrines Officer Masuda Keitaro (1869-95), who died in the line of duty after working hard to combat cholera, an infectious disease that spread to the area 125 years ago.
The annual festival has been held in late July every year, but this year it was cancelled due to the new coronavirus.
On the 26th, only Shinto rituals will be held by the chairman of the local government.
The annual festival has been held by the local community association, with a parade of floats of Officer Masuda riding a white horse and fireworks being set off.
Nearly 200 people attend each year, including bereaved families living in Kumamoto Prefecture, police personnel, and local residents.
Takeda Yoshinori (72), the chairman of the local government, said, "It is an annual festival that has been connected to the local community and is crowded every year. It is very regrettable that it has been cancelled."
The prefectural police also cancelled a memorial service for the students of the police academy this year.
On the 21st, Chief Sugiuchi Yumiko and Karatsu Chief Fukushima Hiroto visited Komatsushima, off the coast of Takagushi Port, where they were cremated, and laid flowers at the monument.
Chief Sugiuchi renewed his desire, saying, "Brave and dedicated spirit is the starting point of the police force. I want to pass it on as it should be."
Officer Masuda, a native of Kumamoto Prefecture, was assigned to Takagushi in July 1895.
He took measures without insomnia, such as disinfecting patients' homes, and later contracted cholera himself.
"I will carry all of Takagushi's cholera on my back." he said, and died just four days after taking up his post at the age of 25.

Kinoshita Akio, Director of Ophthalmology at Hiramatsu Hospital, explains dry eyes and other topics at Yonezawa Saga Head Office of Glasses in Saga
Kinoshita Akio, Director of Ophthalmology at Hiramatsu Hospital, explains dry eyes and other topics at "Hotto Seminar" at Yonezawa Saga Head Office of Glasses in Saga
On the 25th, a "Health Hotto Seminar" (sponsored by Saga Shimbun and co-sponsored by Yonezawa of Glasses) was held at Yonezawa Saga Head Office of Glasses in Shimoda-cho, Saga City, where experts give advice on various health issues.
Kinoshita Akio, Director of Ophthalmology at Hiramatsu Hospital (Ogi City), explained about eye diseases that are deeply related to daily life, such as dry eyes and cataracts.
Dry eyes are described as a "disease of tears", a disease in which the quality of tears collapses and tears do not spread evenly to the surface of the eyes.
Kinoshita said, "Contact lens users are about four times more likely to use it." and urged caution, "Do not use it for long periods of time or sleep while wearing it."
Measures such as placing the screen of the computer below eye level and humidifying it in air-conditioned rooms were indicated.
Ingredients and foods that are effective for dry eyes were also introduced.
"The omega-3 contained in blue fish prevents tears from evaporating, while the mucin contained in natto and okra enhances the quality of tears." he said.
As for cataract surgery, there are single-focus and multi-focus intraocular lenses that are inserted instead of the lens, and the difference in appearance was mentioned.
About 40 people participated in the seminar.
As a preventive measure against the spread of the new coronavirus, the event was divided into two parts, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, with small groups of people, and temperature checks and disinfection were carried out before entering, as well as adequate ventilation of the venue.

Kofu City has announced that a man in his 30s in the city has been infected with the new coronavirus.
The new confirmed case is a male employee in his 30s from the South Fire Station of the Kofu District Fire Department.

[G Osaka] What is the possibility of 17-year-old forward Karayama making his J1 debut against Kobe?
Manager Miyamoto: "His scoring ability is outstanding" (Sports News) - Yahoo! News
G Osaka coach Miyamoto Tsuneyasu (43) spoke to reporters on the 25th ahead of their four-game winning streak against Kobe (Noesta on the 26th), revealing his hopes for third-year high school forward Karayama Shoji (17), who joined the first team for the first time in the previous season.
The manager made Karayama, who was promoted to the top of the table this season, a member of the bench for the match against Hiroshima on the 22nd.
Although he did not give him a chance to play, the striker, who has scored three goals in five games for J3 so far this season, said, "There is something outstanding about scoring points. Even though he is 17 years old, I want him to do more and more. I have seen players going abroad at a young age, but I want him to play with a high level of awareness and greed."
Tangshan scored 8 goals in 10 games for J3, where he played as a specially designated player last season.
Although he is slender at 178cm and 65kg, he boasts an incredible scoring rate of 11 goals in 15 games in J3, thanks to his sense of getting behind a defender with instantaneous movement and his composure to shoot in front of a crowded opponent's goal.
In the match against Hiroshima, forward Ademiusson and midfielder Onose came off the bench due to injuries, and Karayama got a chance, but he did not have a chance to play.
In preparation for the match against Kobe, Miyamoto explained the condition of Ademiusson and Onose, saying, "Both of them are not 100%, but they are highly motivated and challenging themselves to prepare."
If they were to be preserved, there would be a possibility that they would be on the bench again in Tangshan.
At G Osaka, midfielder Doan (now PSV) made his J1 debut at the age of 16 years and 11 months, while forward Usami made his J1 debut at the age of 17 years and 0 months, and moved overseas as a teenager.
Tangshan, who is now 17 years and 10 months old and is expected to be the next talent, is also expected to make his J1 debut as a successor to them.
Ferrari stolen 26 years ago is found at the bottom of a river - not restored, but turned into a work (octane.jp) - Yahoo! News
In 1994, a Ferrari Mondial was stolen in the Netherlands.
Time had passed without the police being able to solve it, but after 26 years, the Mondial was miraculously found.
Ferrari found at the bottom of the river (4 photos) The discovery was triggered by the fire department's diving training.
On July 8th, a training diver found something wedge-shaped sinking into the bottom of the river, and the police and even the Dutch army were dispatched to pull it up and it turned out to be a Ferrari Mondial.
By matching the VIN number with a database of stolen cars, the Ferrari was able to be linked to the 1994 incident.
The car was handed over to its legal owner, an insurance company, and then sent to a scrapper.
Lowie van DE Ooyevaar, a scrapper, said, "There are still some remaining parts, but they are for the art of decorating them. We have already received many requests from people who want to make tables out of dismembered mondials. We use engine blocks and glass plates."
For the time being, they are not considering any specific sales, and they will be kept by scrap companies as objects.

Seibu's Sotozaki Osamu (27) gave his first farewell in his sixth year as a pro to the left in the ninth round of the Lotte 9th round (MetLife) on the 24th, contributing to a 3-2 victory.
He took advantage of the opportunities created by Genda's head-sliding and Mori's hitting.
The team that won the competition as a whole had savings of 2.
The voltage of the Leo Party packed into their home base, MetLife Dome, reached its climax.
Sotozaki gave his first farewell in his sixth year as a pro.
The crowd of 4,825 was excited.
"Minamoto (Genda) and Tomoya (Mori) connected with me, so I entered the batting with the desire to do something about it."
The score was 2-2 in the ninth inning.
The first batter, Genda, attempted a safety bunt and made a spirited head slide at first base.
After starting the game with an infield hit, Mori, the top hitter last season, scored his second professional hit.
No. 4, Yamakawa, refuses to declare.
A senior at Fuji University was forced to walk, and Sotozaki's inner heart was on fire.
"I thought." Damn it. "Before Yamakawa went to first base, he said to me." Be active, "which made me feel good."
From the first ball, he got stuck in a straight ball with a high inside angle, but the ball fell to the left.
Throughout his amateur days, he said, "I don't have any memories."
The 27-year-old, who had been inspired by his alma mater, Hirosaki Sanetaka from Aomori, advancing to the top four of the summer prefectural tournament for the first time in 20 years, took a jubilant water shower and said with a smile, "As expected, it felt good."
He was called "the man who didn't have it".
He was selected by Samurai Japan as a versatile player who can protect both inside and outside the field, and contributed to being the best player in the world at the Premier12 last November.
However, at Seibu, he had no experience of saying goodbye, and Tsuji and Baba's strategy, defense and running coach told him, "I don't have it, you."
Reversing his negative reputation, he produced his second farewell win of the season.
Director Tsuji praised him, saying, "I asked the Goddess of Victory to ask for it only today. She hit it well."
With 2 savings, they are in third place, one game behind the leader, Softbank.
Sotozaki, who has only hit one home run this season and is batting .252, said, "We still have to hit. We will work together as a team to win the next one."
The one shot that decided the match will be the trigger for his recovery.

Heavy rain marks "traffic" in Kitato National Route 152 10km closed, some sections of JR Iida Line closed | Shizuoka Shimbun @ S
Ryuzan-cho, Tenryu-ku, Hamamatsu, on the afternoon of the 22nd, as National Route 152 is closed to traffic, cars line up waiting to pass on a detour that alternates traffic on one side (part of the photo has been processed)
The Tenryu area of Hamamatsu City was one of the most affected areas in Shizuoka Prefecture due to heavy rains in July that caused severe damage to Kyushu and other parts of Japan.
The impact of landslides remains on the main road, National Route 152, and the JR Iida Line, which is the foot of daily life, and there are many areas that require time to recover.
In addition to the inconveniences of daily life, residents are increasingly worried about the negative impact on economic activity.
At Sejiri Bridge over the Tenryu River in Ryuzan-cho, the same ward, there is a long line of cars waiting to pass during the day.
The first car remained parked for nearly 40 minutes.
National Route 152 has been closed for about 10 kilometers, and it is necessary to take a detour to the other side of the Tenryu River to get around the town.
However, the width of the road is narrow, and all sections are alternating traffic on one side, so the waiting time cannot be predicted.
In the town, a landslide occurred on the national highway on the 9th, and traffic was closed due to the risk of falling rocks on nearby slopes.
On the 13th, a crack was found in the Akiba Tunnel within the restricted section, and there is no prospect of a resumption of traffic yet.
In 2018, the town's national highway was closed due to the collapse of the soil, which dealt a blow to residents' lives and tourism.
Tamamoto Kimie (76), CEO of Dragon Mama Processing Plant, which sells specialty products, said, "This is a big drop in the number of visitors as the new coronavirus has kept customers away."
The JR Iida Line was closed between Mizukubo Station (Mizukubo Town, Nagano Ward) and Hiraoka Station (Nagano Prefecture) due to a slope collapse on the side of the track.
Ukai Shiori (16), who was attending Hamamatsu Kohoku High School Sakuma Branch School in Sakuma-cho, Sakuma-ku, from Oarashi Station (in the same town), which was closed, had to pick up and drop off by car for about an hour one way.
"If it's a car, it's a heavy burden for both parents and myself." he said, hoping for an early recovery.
According to JR Tokai, it is expected to take about three months to reopen, and from the 27th, special trains will run one round trip between Mizukubo Station and Oarashi Station in the morning and evening on weekdays.
In Mizukubo Town, landslides occur frequently on forest roads that are also used as residential roads.
In some cases, it can take several hours to detour.
Kumagai Keiji (69), head of the Mizukubo Town Forest Association, said with a clouded expression, "The removal of raw wood has also been delayed. There are isolated islands on land everywhere. I am worried about future rain."
Nakajima Shoya: Is it his choice to miss the championship ceremony?
Local media report (Football Channel) - Yahoo! News
Japanese midfielder Nakajima Shoya appears to be on his way to leaving Porto.
It was reported by Portuguese outlet ZAP based on information from Recold.
Porto, who won the Portuguese league for the 2019 / 20 season, held a championship ceremony on the pitch during their final home match on the 20th of this month.
However, the fact that Nakajima was not present at this place was a hot topic.
Nakajima, who refused to join the team training during the suspension of the league due to the new coronavirus, has been sidelined ever since.
However, since he was not present at the championship ceremony, there has been talk of a transfer this summer.
According to Recold, Porto had invited Nakajima to the ceremony.
However, Nakajima just didn't show up.
As a result, it read: "Nakajima is increasingly out of Sergio Conseison's plans for next season. He needs to leave the club in the next transfer window."
Nakajima, who carried the number 10 position at the prestigious Portuguese club, is likely to leave the club after one year.
They may have already begun to look for a new world.

45% of families have their wives holding their wallets!
Is my husband happy? Unhappy?
I wonder if there is a wife who is excited or angry when her husband tells her, "I don't have enough pocket money this month..."
The family in which this conversation is established is the family in which the wife holds the wallet.
How many families in the world have their wives holding their wallets?
Also, let's look at the percentage of "marital wallets" and "jointly managed" together.
Which one holds the household wallet?
Matsui Securities Co., Ltd. conducted an online survey of 800 people nationwide, including 400 men and women in their 20s and 30s (young couples) who have been married for less than three years, and 400 men and women in their 50s and 60s (mature couples) who have been married for more than 30 years, and the following results were obtained from the "Survey on Couples' Household Management Situation" (released in June 2019).
Who holds the household wallet?
Wife: 45.0% Husband: 24.8% The most common result was that the wife managed the household finances.
No matter which one manages it, there are many twists and turns in household management, but it seems that there are various episodes.
My wife manages the household finances: In the case of Ms. Ako Ms. Ako is a mother of Alaphilippe who has a daughter who is in her third year of high school and a first year of high school.
Ms. Ako is in full control of the household finances.
As I was preparing to take the university entrance exam, I had to negotiate with my husband to lower my pocket money, but as expected, he resisted.
At that time, they asked me to show them what kind of income and expenditure I had, so I showed them my household accounts.
It should have included all expenses, but when I looked at the household accounts, it was not enough to make me lose money.
My husband was about to say, "That's enough, isn't it?", but Ms. Ako couldn't help but say, "I understand, I don't have the ability to manage my household finances, so please take care of everything."
Later, when Ms. Ako interviewed her husband, she said, "Although she is dissatisfied with the management of her pocket money, the truth is that she does not have the time or energy to manage various household expenses (for example, school teaching materials and PTA expenses)."
Husband manages household finances: In the case of Ms. B Ms. B, a housewife, is given living expenses by her husband and manages them daily.
Last spring, the freezer part of the refrigerator was broken, so Ms. B asked her husband to buy her a refrigerator.
However, my husband was reluctant to replace it, saying, "I can't use the freezer, but I can still use the refrigerated part, so it's okay."
However, in the summer, it seems that her husband wanted to create an environment where he could eat ice cream at any time, and the palm of his hand turned upside down, saying, "Let's buy a refrigerator after all."
So Ms. B couldn't help but complain to her friend, "My husband is so stingy that he gets upset."
Kubo Takefusa's transfer target has been narrowed down to five clubs in Spain's first division (Taspo Web) - Yahoo! News
Japanese midfielder Kubo Takefusa (19), who played for Majorca in Spain's first division this season, seems to be gradually narrowing down his transfer target.
Although Majorca were relegated to the second division, Kubo's reputation skyrocketed after his success at the end of the season.
However, due to the fact that he is outside the EU, it will be difficult for him to return to Real Madrid in the first division, where he has "ownership rights", so he plans to play for another club next season.
They have already received offers from around 30 clubs, but R Madrid plans to train them as warriors at domestic clubs.
Spanish newspaper Marca reported that Real Sociedad, Villarreal, Granada, Getafe and Betis were among the most likely transfer targets for Kubo, saying: "Five clubs are interested in signing Kubo, but R Madrid want a club in the middle of the league or higher."

At the Ichijodani Asakura Clan Ruins in Fukui City, a total of 53 balls, 2 to 4, were launched for about two minutes while the surrounding mountains were covered with haze.
