Report on the whole picture of the cut (CanCam.jp) --Yahoo! News
Add a layer to the heavy semi-long [everyone's real style] for fluffy hair
CanCam model Honoka challenges a moving hairstyle like Minami Tanaka, who admires, "Of course, it's beautiful, but it's also very professional and I respect it!"
We asked Mr. Teru Asahi of the hair salon "SUNVALLY" in Omotesando, who actually works on Minami Tanaka's haircut, to make "Minami-style hair".
I will report on the cutting process!
Nogizaka46 Mizuki Yamashita's first cover with short hair!
First, check the faint hair before cutting.
Thin, soft and generous.
There is a habit, especially in the rainy season, so you can apply a straight perm because it makes you feel uncomfortable.
A heavy semi-long with a sink bangs.
The cut has finally started!
First, lightly moisten the whole to make it easier to cut.
After that, separate the top of the bee (the part above the most protruding circumference of the head) and cut from the bottom.
By the way, here are the points of hair that you can get closer to Minoru!
1 Table bang By shortening the inside of the bangs a little, you can enjoy changes depending on the styling, such as making it slightly thicker when fully lowered, and see-through when you divide it lightly.
2 Cut that makes the most of the habit If the hairy habit of Ari-san reduces the amount of hair too much, it may spread further.
While discussing the balance around that, it is easy to handle but difficult to spread, and keeps the balance so that your own swell lives.
3 Layer around the face and loose hair layer = A cut that is cut with a step.
Putting a layer around the face makes it easier to move and gives a cute finish.
If you make the bristles in three places, before and after the temples and sideburns, they will look fashionable even when you put them together quickly.
Cut the hair on the bee that you have separated, and put it around your face.
Pull out the upper part of the hair bundle around the face and cut the ends of the hair.
This will create a step when the hair bundle is lowered, making it easier to move (this is a layer cut).

Butler praises Tyler Herro, the young warrior who will bear the future of the heat, again "The way of thinking is not that of a rookie" (basketball count) --Yahoo! News
Photo = Getty Images Heat scrimmage (practice match) The first match is against Kings.
Duncan Robinson scored 18 points for Team High and Tyler Herro scored 15 points for the back court, which was a great victory in 104-98.
The step-up of the hero, the rookie who was nominated 13th overall in the draft, as well as Robinson, who is one of the best shooters in the league, is an important factor for the heat.
The hero missed 15 games from February to March due to an ankle injury, and the season entered a long break after the return match against the Hornets on March 12.
The hero said, "I had plenty of time so I was able to regain 100% of my condition. It feels the best I've ever felt," but the performance at Scrimmage was more compelling than words. ..
The hero's playtime has increased due to the delay in joining the starting point guard Kendrick Nunn, taking advantage of that opportunity.
It's worth it because it's 15 points after playing a different role.
Team leader Jimmy Butler once again praised his "favorite" hero.
"He can be a handler, he can score points, he can defend. He is a player who can do everything for the team. He can handle any position because the way of thinking is not that of a rookie. My teammates are wondering where and how they move and become free, and what they should do about it. "
Even before the start of the season, Butler loves the hero's rookie-like strength and his stoic attitude towards basketball.
That's why I invited them to practice individually starting at 4 am and trained together.
Butler once said, "He gives his opinion to anyone and doesn't withdraw. That kind of fighting spirit can be respected."
That Butler is the type that always says what he thinks, and he knows that a conflict will occur if he thinks it will benefit the team, and gives a harsh opinion.
In the past, this has made my relationship with my teammates worse.
Butler may be a young hero.
Butler's personality, which is sometimes too fierce for his teammates, is a good guide for those who have the guts to follow it.
If the relationship between the two teachers who respect each other spreads throughout the team, Heat should be able to become a team that can aim even higher.

Saito, who had been throwing in a row, made a good throw to keep the 6th inning to 1 hit and didn't even step on the second base.

Instantly detect the occurrence of a crisis from online information and judge hoaxes (JBpress) --Yahoo! News
"I want to know where and what kind of disaster or accident occurred as soon as possible!"
This is not limited to news media such as television and newspapers, but there is a strong need for many companies such as social infrastructure companies and local governments.
The service that responds to this is "Spectee," which was developed by Spectee, which handles information analysis using AI.
[Photo] An alert from Specty determines the authenticity of social media information by a specialized team.
Nowadays, the first means for people to know the occurrence of disasters and accidents is shifting from television to online information (social media).
Social media such as Twitter has become an important medium for disseminating information immediately after a disaster or accident occurs.
However, it is difficult to manually watch the overflowing information and extract useful information from it.
Specty has the function of detecting information related to natural disasters and accidents from information flowing on social media such as Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, analyzing the content, determining the authenticity of the information, and then distributing it to the user company.
"A wide range of events with negative impacts that stop or stagnate social activities are regarded as" crises "" (Kenjiro Murakami, CEO), a crisis management support service that visualizes various crises occurring in Japan and overseas. That's right.
NHK at the time of the Kumamoto earthquake that occurred in April 2016 was the first major use case of Specty, and since then, the movement of recruitment has spread rapidly among companies.
It is said that not only news media such as TV stations and newspapers, but also companies that support social infrastructure such as electricity, gas and transportation, and more than 350 domestic companies such as local governments all over the country are currently using Specty.
■ Analyze posts to determine the type and location of the "crisis"
Specty distributes information in four steps: "collecting information", "analyzing and classifying", "titled", and "authenticity judgment".
The user company specifies in advance the area for collecting information (prefectures, cities, wards, towns and villages, etc.) and the category of crisis (disaster, accident, etc.).
Specty collects posts that meet that designation using an API provided by social media.
Then, the text, images, and videos contained in the collected posts are analyzed and classified.
For example, if there is a video showing a fire engine, black smoke rising from the building, and orange flames coming out of the room, it is classified as "fire".
In addition, images of overturned automobiles are classified as "traffic accidents", and images of flooded roads are classified as "road flooding".
Specty also estimates where disasters and accidents occur.
"I often don't know the location from the posts, so I'm estimating by combining various information," says Murakami.
For example, if a road sign or signboard is reflected in an image or video, the place name information is extracted from it and collated with the place name database to identify the place.

I have lived in the prefecture for less than 30 years since I was born.
When I used it in a conversation with a friend at the university (Tokyo), "Zuru crowd", which means "horizontal entry", was instantly regarded as Kyoton.

Japanese "chilled Chinese" is not popular with Chinese people ...?
"Cold noodle dishes" unpopular reason (modern business) --Yahoo! News
Hiyashi chuka in China is "Japanese cold noodles"
As mentioned at the beginning, chilled Chinese food is a Chinese food (Japanese style Chinese food) that originated in Japan and was devised based on the Chinese "Ryanban Mien / chilled mixed soba noodles".
Therefore, although it does not originally exist in China, it has come to be found in Japanese restaurants in the summer due to the diversification of food.
Recently, at Japanese convenience stores, arranged products called "Japanese-style soba noodles / Soba chilled Chinese noodles" and "Kawaka chicken sardine noodles / Sichuan-style chicken chilled Chinese noodles" have appeared.
On the other hand, Japanese-style Chinese food is generally not very popular in China, pushed by trendy and punchy Chinese food such as Sichuan food and Hunan food.
Naturally, the Japanese-style Chinese seasoning is often familiar to Chinese people.
Therefore, it is not unpleasant, but it tends to be criticized for its poor impact.
"Chilled Chinese" is no exception, and it is still a minor presence in China.
By the way, the name of chilled Chinese in China is "Japanese style cold noodles".
It is recognized by the Chinese as one of the Japanese dishes.
The summer staple is "Liangpi"
In China, the noodle dish that makes you feel summer is "Liangpi".
In Japan, many people may not be familiar with it, but Liangpi is a flat noodle made from wheat flour, rice flour, starch, etc., which originated in Shaanxi Province.
It is said that it has a history of 2000 years.
It is a standard B-class gourmet that is also sold at food stalls, and the price is around 10 to 20 yuan (150 to 300 yen), which is very reasonable.
Although it has the word "Ryo" in it, it is not iced like Japanese Hiyashi chuka.
Rather, it is basically at room temperature.
Top the noodles with your favorite ingredients such as shredded cucumbers, carrots, and boiled bean sprouts, and add spices such as coriander, chili, ginger, and garlic.
Finally, add a special seasoning that is a mixture of soy sauce, chili oil, vinegar, sesame paste, peanut paste, etc.
The noodles are smooth and fluffy, and the spicy sauce with a refreshing acidity is often entwined, and even when you have a bit of summer heat and have no appetite, it slips in.
In addition, because it has penetrated all over China, there are various toppings and seasonings, and the wide variety is also a characteristic of Liangpi, which is one of the ways to enjoy it.

Benefits of "Cold Water Shower" for Body and Mind (Cosmopolitan) --Yahoo! News
Suppresses inflammation such as muscle pain
A study published in The North American Journal of Medical Sciences that examined the effectiveness of hydrotherapy (a treatment using water) found that it could be expected to have a physical and mental healing effect.
By bathing in cold water after exercising, muscle soreness and other inflammatory effects can be suppressed.
According to Professor Douglas Casa, who is in charge of the Korey Stringer Institute, which studies sports medicine, and teaches at the University of Connecticut, "It is important to exercise and take a cold shower as soon as possible. By lowering the body temperature immediately after moving the body, recovery from inflammation and fatigue caused by exercise will be quicker. "
Reduce fatigue
When exercising in high temperatures, the heart, muscles, and skin need more blood flow than usual.
“When exercising, the heart rate is high, which increases blood flow to the heart, and energy is required to contract the muscles, which increases muscle blood flow. For the skin, a lot of blood is used to regulate body temperature. Flows in, "says Professor Casa.
"By taking a cold shower, the temperature of the skin is lowered, so the blood flow to the skin can be suppressed. Instead, the blood flow is sent to the internal organs such as the gastrointestinal tract, so that water and nutrients are kept even after exercise. It's easier to take, and as a result, you can reduce the fatigue you feel after exercising. "
Expectations for hormesis effect
Drozevsky also explains that bathing in cold water can be expected to activate the "hormesis effect."
The hormesis effect is the idea that it is better to have a small amount of substances and stress that are harmful to the body, rather than none at all.
"Hypoxic exercise, petit fasting, and cold showers are typical examples of hormesis effects for health. Cold showers stimulate hormones and neurotransmitters, resulting in physical and physical toughness. And you can improve your resilience. "

Corona Sorrow "Familiar with Art" Online Museum "HASARD" Konno-san (from Hachinohe) Launched (Daily Tohoku Shimbun) --Yahoo! News
There is a museum where anyone can experience art for free whenever they want.
We have a wide range of artists, from famous painters such as Claude Monet and Gustav Klimt to unknown artists in Japan.
Since its opening in April 2019, the online museum "HASARD" has captured the hearts of users due to its convenience and newness, and has gained even more attention with the new lifestyle of Corona. It was.
Shinnosuke Konno (26), a 26-year-old representative from Hachinohe City who launched the site, lives in Tokyo and says, "I wanted to create a service where everyone can easily enjoy art. I want them to come into contact with art in difficult situations."
What surprises me when I visit Other is the abundance of exhibits and the beauty of the images.
As of the 24th, a total of 14 permanent exhibitions and special exhibitions have been released, and the ultra-high resolution works that convey not only the colors but also the texture of the brush attract viewers.
No membership registration or admission fee is required, and the feature is that not only the viewer but also the artist who wants to hold a solo exhibition does not have to pay.
The way of showing only online also attracts attention.
One of them is to move the picture.
In Claude Monet's permanent exhibition, "It Starts Moving Again," digital processing is applied to move clouds, flowers, and meadows.
With the idea that "I want to allow people with low interest in art to enter" (Representative Konno), I can feel as if I were in a painting.
Konno met art when he was in elementary school.
At that time, when I visited the newly completed Aomori Museum of Art with my family, I was shocked to see three huge paintings of Marc Chagall's "Aleko".
From the next day, the art class turned into a fun time, and even after moving to Tokyo when I entered university, I began to visit galleries and other places.
At the same time, I also felt that many people do not have many opportunities to come into contact with art from various perspectives, such as the fact that there is no museum nearby and large exhibitions are held only in the Tokyo metropolitan area, making it difficult to go out due to childcare.
So, while working for an IT-related company, I spent about two months launching a site where I could appreciate art on the Internet.
The average number of users reached 10,000 per month in the first 10 months, and increased to about 30,000 after the spread of the new corona infection.
If anyone can appreciate art in a free form when they want to see it.
The aim of Other was unexpectedly accepted by more people due to the Corona wreck.
Mr. Konno emphasized that the significance of art appreciation will enrich his imagination.
"The more imaginative you are, the more you can reach out to those in need.
I want you to have a better society by getting closer to art. "
The simple reason why the era of Chinese quality is over and the era of Japanese quality is coming (modern business) --Yahoo! News
Pandemic shift in values
Various predictions and discussions are being made about the after-pandemic world.
On the business side, the July 8 article "Actually, the jobs of" managers "are beginning to disappear in Japan ...! That cruel reality", the July 4 article "In the world of" After Corona ", In fact, there is a possibility that the changes mentioned in "Why the Japanese manufacturing industry is likely to make a big revival ...!"
[Photo] The true identity of "Japan's strength" that only Japanese people do not know ... Unexpected reality seen in Asia
In terms of spirit, the article on June 26, "Given to those who have become aware of the end of life in Corona,'Knowledge of complete burning'", and the article on June 10, "Corona, now is full of riots." It seems that the flow of "Let's review the utility of" God's request when suffering "" will become mainstream.
And it is the big flow of "from Chinese quality to Japanese quality" that we can see clearly as a form that combines the two "materials (economy / business)" and "spirit".
For example, if a T-shirt or digital camera is defective or defective, it is annoying, but there is nothing special about the life of the person who purchased it.
On the other hand, the sloppy quality of masks and respirators made in China, which has recently become a hot topic .... "Chinese quality" in such products that are directly related to life and safety is fatal.
No matter how cheap it is, you cannot buy such a product.
Even if you pay a considerable price, you will want "Japanese quality" products.
Of course, this trend is not unique to Japan.
It is clear from the fact that Western countries, which were in a difficult situation due to lack of masks and medical equipment, still made "returns" one after another due to the terrible "Chinese quality".
Safer and more secure than cheap
In addition, products such as automobiles are also products whose defects can be fatal (death due to an accident).
No matter how much China, South Korea and other countries attacked with the "cheap or bad" bargain strategy, they couldn't compete with the products made in Japan. The reason for the situation described in "Do you bow down to Toyota?" Is that "Japanese quality" is strongly required for automobile products.
And this pandemic reminded me that many other products also need "safety and security".
In addition, safety and security are important not only in "Japanese quality in manufacturing" but also in "Japanese quality in services such as logistics".
Like the toilet paper turmoil, there are times when the production capacity is decent, but the intermediate distribution is delayed and cannot be delivered.
Furthermore, self-sufficiency in Japan is also an important factor of "safety and security", as in the article "Who is the true criminal of mask shortage! Do not forgive the fireplace thief of the Chinese Communist Party administration" on April 17. I was keenly aware of that.
In the event of an emergency, it is natural for all countries to prioritize their own country, and it is very important to be able to procure essentials such as masks (medical equipment) and food in their own country.

Nagoya / Miyahara is positive for corona Soccer J1, first after resuming the league | Shizuoka Shimbun at S
Soccer J1 Nagoya announced on the 25th that it was confirmed that defender Kazuya Miyahara (24) had a positive reaction for the new coronavirus.
This is the first positive reaction of a player after the resumption of the J-League.
This is the third player in the club, following FW Mu Kanazaki (31) and Australian goalkeeper Mitchell Langerack (31) who were infected in June.
The two have already been treated and have returned to the match.
This season's Miyahara entered the bench at the J1 Oita match held at Showa Denko Dome Oita on the 22nd.
Nagoya held an online press conference on the 25th and revealed that it had conducted a PCR test on 60 athletes and staff on the same day.
98% reflection.
It turns out that the white paint derived from the Teflon-processed frying pan and the heat insulation enhance the cooling effect!
A big discovery!
This year was the rainy season, when the amount of rainfall was unprecedented, but when it is bright, the hot summer will begin in earnest.
It's hot and hot, and the burning days are so hot that even the air conditioner doesn't work.
Global warming is a major global problem, and humankind has squeezed its wisdom on how to overcome the hot midsummer as comfortably as possible.
One way to do this is to wear light white clothing.
You see, you don't have to wear black clothes to absorb heat in the summer, right?
And it seems that the same principle is applied to the construction of houses, and the number of cases where white paint is used is increasing.
Even if white is white, it was the latest research field whether it could be made into a paint with properties that reflect more light and do not absorb heat.
The Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) has recently collaborated with researchers at Columbia University's Faculty of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics to most efficiently repel solar heat and cool the interior of the building. Announced that it has found a method for formulating white paint that can improve the effect.
It is said that it is aimed at early commercialization.
Until now, the white paint with the highest reflectance of the sun's rays used titanium oxide, which has a reflectance of 85%.
White paint, which already uses titanium oxide, is applied to the roofs of buildings in high-temperature environments, and is useful for blocking solar heat and improving cooling efficiency.
However, what was newly discovered was a white paint derived from the fluororesin of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) used in that Teflon-processed frying pan.
It is a white paint that applies this Teflon effect, and it reflects the sun's rays to nearly 98%, enabling a significant heat cut.
Even in the hot summer, surprisingly, thanks to the white paint using Teflon, it is easy to spend indoors without being exposed to the intense heat.
Maybe such an era is coming soon, isn't it?
I feel that there are many dark colors on the roofs of Japanese houses, but from now on, white will become the mainstream?
When will Amazon's annual big sale be held this year?
Amazon.com has announced that it will postpone the annual big sale "Prime Day," CNBC reported on July 21.

On the other hand, we decided to hold it in India.
Posted a press release on the country's website.
He explained that it will be held for 48 hours from midnight on August 6.
Prime Day has been held worldwide at the same time so far, but this year it may take unusual measures.
■ Large-scale event with sales of 760 billion yen in two days Amazon launched this large-scale sale for members in 2015 as a sales promotion measure in the summer when sales are declining.
Initially it was a 24-hour event, but it has expanded year by year, and last year it was 48 hours from midnight on July 15 in 18 countries including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, India, Japan, China and Australia. Carried out.
According to the company, last year's two-day sales exceeded previous sales on "Black Friday" (the first day of the holiday season) and "Cyber Monday" (the following Monday).
This event has also contributed to the acquisition of new subscribers to the paid member "Prime". Last year, the number of applications on the first day was the highest ever, and the number of applications on the next day was the second highest.
Last year, it sold 175 million products worldwide.
Internet retailer, a magazine specializing in the online shopping industry, reported that the total global sales for two days increased by 70% from the previous year to $ 7.16 billion (about 760 billion yen).
Strict eyes on mobile number transfer and excessive detention.
What about fees and points awarded?
(New Switch) --Yahoo! News
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications is in full swing to review the mobile number portability system (MNP), which allows users to use their existing phone numbers as they are when changing mobile communication companies.
At a meeting of experts on the 21st, he announced a policy to revise the MNP guidelines established in 2004.
There are various specific issues, such as how MNP fees should be and whether or not to detain those who wish to move out.
With the backlash from telecommunications companies expected, attention will be focused on whether it will lead to the promotion of sound market competition.
At the beginning of 2006, when the dark MNP of communication companies, which is far from unlimited transfer of mobile numbers, was introduced, the user-paid charge was 2000 yen, but now it is 3000 yen.
The estimated MNP fee income of the three major mobile communication companies is 15.9 billion yen per year.
On the 21st, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications listed the current situation regarding MNP at the "Working Group on Verification of Competition Rules (WG)", a meeting of experts who discusses the competitive environment of the telecommunications market.
The time required to issue an MNP reservation number when consumers move to another telecommunications company is also mentioned as a spearhead.
Major telecommunications companies accept online, but due to the convenience of operating the core system, the main acceptance time is 9 to 20 o'clock.
The WG material stipulates that all-day support will be the principle for future studies.
It is also a problem that mobile communication companies will give points to those who wish to move out with MNP to retain them.
It is because it is judged that excessive detention may hinder fair competition.
Shunichi Kita, a partner of Nomura Research Institute, who is a member of the WG, said, "Please give me time to explain the provision of economic benefits or get permission from the user, and promptly issue a number to the user who does not permit and finish. It is important to thoroughly implement this process first. "
However, in a series of issues, regarding MNP fees, there is a structural problem that "the higher the fee, the more difficult it is for customers to flow out, so it is difficult to motivate them to actively lower it" (Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications staff).
If there is a company that takes the initiative in lowering MNP fees, there is concern that the outflow of customers from that company will increase and corporate efforts will not be rewarded.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications has also pointed out that many countries overseas do not require user-paid charges for MNP, and it is possible that this will happen in Japan as well.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications wants to summarize the results of the WG as a report around September-October, and then start the procedure for revising the MNP guidelines.
The time when the amendment will be made is expected to be after 21 years.
Mobile telecommunications companies are likely to have trouble with sales and customer support.

In the match against Fukudome, which was greeted here, he drove in with two balls, and finally forked.
In a three-ball game, he struck out and struck out, surpassing the pinch.
Katsuno finished the sixth inning with 83 pitches, but at the end of the midfield game, coach Yoda got out of the bench and announced a pitcher change.
Yuki Nishi, who played the pitcher's game, had 108 pitches at the same time, but he got off the mound first and could not get the right to win for the first time this season.

JC called on each block council nationwide to overcome the feeling of obstruction caused by the spread of the infection and to signal the rebirth of Japan.
It started at 8:00 pm at 117 locations in 46 prefectures.
At the Ichijodani Asakura site in Fukui City, a total of 53 shots of No. 2 to 4 balls were launched over a period of about 2 minutes while the surrounding mountains were covered with haze.
The light of the fireworks made the Karamon gate emerge in the dark night, creating a fantastic atmosphere.
In the prefecture, it was also held along the Matsubara coast in Tsuruga city and along the Mana river in Ono city.
In order to prevent infection, the launch site was not announced in advance in order to avoid a large number of spectators.
