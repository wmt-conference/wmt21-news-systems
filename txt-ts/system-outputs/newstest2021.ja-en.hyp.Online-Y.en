Butler once again praises Tyler Hero, a young warrior who is responsible for the future of the Heat “mindset is not that of rookies” (basket count) - Yahoo! news
Photo = Getty Images Heat scream (practice match) The first match is against the Kings.
In this successful match in 104-98, Duncan Robinson scored 18 team high and Tyler Hero followed by 15 goals and backcourt.
Robinson, the leading shooter in the league, as well as the rookie of 13th place in the whole draft, and the hero's step-up are important factors for the heat.
The hero missed 15 matches from February to March due to ankle injury, and the season entered a long break after the return match on March 12 Hornets.
The hero said, “We had plenty of time and we were able to regain 100% of the condition. I feel the best I've ever felt,” he says, but the performance at Scrimage was more convincing than words.
The late confluence of Kendrick Nan, the starting point guard, has increased hero play time and made use of that chance.
The value is great because it scored 15 goals after playing a different role brilliantly.
Team leader Jimmy Butler also praised her favorite hero this time.
“He can do handlers, take scores, and defence. It's a player who can do everything for the team. I can do it in any position because the mindset is not that of a rookie. Watching and researching the video, I'm tapping into my head where and how my teammates move and how they are free and what they should do against it.”
Before the start of this season, Butler loves the strength of the hero's rookies, and his stoic attitude to basketball.
That's why I invited me to practice at 4:00 in the morning and trained together.
Butler once said, “He says his own opinion to anyone and doesn't go down. That kind of fighting spirit can be respected.”
The butler is the type that he thought is sure to say, and if you think it's good for the team, you will be aware that the clash will happen.
It has also been in the past that the relationship with teammates deteriorated.
Butler is probably overlaying himself young to a hero.
Butler's character, sometimes too irritating for teammates, is a good guideline for those who have guts to come about it.
If the relationship between two mutually respectful pupils spill across the entire team, the heat should be a team that can aim further.

2 years Matsuura, thanks first strike
It was the fourth of the second year when he played for the first time this summer.
Matsuura, a merchant Shimada, knocked the changing ball on the first immortal base and carried it to the left.
“I retire immediately if I lose 3 years. I wanted to hit myself and win.”
The gem that played the number 4 last autumn also made my chest.
The first to three rounds fought on the subject for three years, and two years of power were turning ahead.
Ikeda gathered players at the meeting and said, “I have been connected for three years so far. I will go with the best members in the future,” he told Nine.
On this day, four out of nine stamen solidified the main axis in two years.
It seems to be ruthless, but it's evidence that you are serious about the game.
Matsuura said, “From now on, the level of the opponent pitcher will also increase. I am willing to return the runners.”
Saito, who became a renade, did not even step on the second base with a good throw to keep 6 hits to 1 hit, and looked at his intention for three years.
The number 10 says, “Two years are stimulated for three years. “If you lead to victory”, it is a positive response as a synergy.
The team aiming for the fourth strong entry in the Shizuoka tournament until last year for the third consecutive year is not going to make memories of the rest of the game.

Photos: An alert from spectis determines the authenticity of social media information by a professional team
Now, the first way for people to know the occurrence of disasters and accidents is beginning to move from television to Internet information (social media).
Social media, such as Twitter, have become an important media that transmits information immediately after disasters and accidents occur.
However, it is difficult to watch the overflowing information constantly and extract useful information from it by hand.
Specti detects natural disasters and accidents from information flowing on social media such as Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, analyzes the contents and determines the authenticity of the information It has the function to distribute to the user company.
“Positioning negative impact events such as stopping and stagnating social activities as a wide range of “crises” (Kenjiro Murakami, CEO) to visualize various crises occurring in Japan and abroad It's a crisis management support service.
NHK during the Kumamoto earthquake in April 2016 was the first major use case of specti, after which the adoption movement spread rapidly among companies.
It is said that more than 350 companies currently use specti in Japan, including companies supporting social infrastructure such as electricity, gas, and transportation, as well as television stations and newspapers, as well as local governments throughout the country.
■ Analyze posts to determine the type of “crisis” and where it occurred
The Spectre takes four steps to deliver information: “gathering information”, “analysis and classification”, “titling”, and “authenticity.”
Companies must specify in advance the regions (prefectures, municipalities, etc.) and categories of crisis (such as disasters and accidents) to collect information.
Species collect posts that fall under that designation using the API provided by social media.
It then analyzes and classifies the text, images, and videos contained in the collected posts.
For example, if you see a fire truck, black smoke rising from a building, and an orange flame coming out of the room, you can categorize it as “fire”.
In addition, the image of a reversed car is classified as “traffic accident” and “road flooding” for the image of a road covered with water.
The specti also estimates where disasters and accidents occur.
“Since we often don't know the location from the post, we estimate a combination of various information,” says CEO Murakami.
For example, if a road sign or signboard is reflected in an image or video, information about the place name is extracted from it, and the location is identified by matching it with a place-name database.

Japanese “chilled Chinese” does not ask Chinese...?
“Cold noodle dish” unpopular waké (modern business) - Yahoo! news
Chilled Chinese in China is “Nikshiki Cold Noodles”
As mentioned at the beginning, Hiyashi-chuka is a Chinese dish (Nikshiki Chinese) that originated in Japan based on the Chinese 'Liangbang Mien/Hiyashi-mixed Soba' (Liang Bang Mien/Hiyashi-mixed Soba).
Therefore, it originally does not exist in China, but due to the diversification of food, it began to be seen in Japanese restaurants in summer.
Recently, in Japanese convenience stores, there are also arranged products with the inscription "Nikshiki soba ryomega/soba chuka" and "Kawakatori Ryome/Szechuan style chicken hiyashi chuka.”
On the other hand, Japanese Chinese cuisine is not very popular in China because of the popular punchy Chinese cuisine, such as Sichuan and Hunan cuisine.
Of course, the seasoning of Nikshiki-chuka is often familiar to Chinese people.
That's why it's not bad, but it tends to be overrated for poor impact.
The 'hiyashi chuka' is no exception and is still a minor presence in China.
By the way, the name of chilled Chinese in China is' Nikshiki Reimen. '
It is recognized by Chinese as one of the Japanese dishes.
Summer staple is “Liumpei (Liumpei)”
In China, a noodle dish that feels summer is not “Liangpei”.
In Japan, there are many people who are not familiar with it, but the lizoku is a flat noodle made from wheat flour, rice flour, starch, etc. originated in Hanxi Province.
It is said that it has a history of 2000 years.
It is a staple of B-class gourmet that is also sold at food stalls, and the price is very reasonable for around 10-20 yuan (150-300 yen).
It contains the word 'cool', but it does not serve ice like the Japanese chilled Chinese.
Rather, room temperature is basic.
On top of the noodles, topped with your favorite ingredients, such as julienne cucumbers, carrots and boiled moyashi, add condiments such as coriander, chili, ginger, and garlic.
Finally, it is finished by mixing soy sauce, chili oil, vinegar, sesame paste and peanut paste.
With good throat and pulling noodles, the sour taste is refreshing and rich spicy sauce is often entangled, and even when you have no appetite in the summer, it will get in sluggish.
In addition, because it penetrates all over China, there are various toppings and flavorings, and the abundance of variations is also characteristic of the ryoskin, and one way to enjoy it.

“Cold Shower” Benefits to Body and Mind (Cosmopolitan) - Yahoo! news
Reduces inflammation such as muscle pain
A study published in The North American Journal of Medical Sciences investigating the effectiveness of hydrotherapy (treatment with water) showed that physical And it turns out that it can be expected to have an effect on mental healing.
By taking cold water after exercise, muscle pain and other inflammatory effects can be suppressed.
According to Professor Douglas Casa, head of the “Korey Stringer Institute” who studies sports medicine and teaches at the University of Connecticut, “do exercise and give as much time as possible It's important to take a cold shower without opening it. By quickly lowering body temperature after moving the body, recovery from inflammation and fatigue caused by exercise will be faster.”
Reduces fatigue
When you exercise in high temperatures, your heart, muscles, and skin will need more blood flow than usual.
“When exercising, heart rate increases so blood flow to the heart increases, and muscle blood flow is increased because it takes energy to contract muscles. Also, when it comes to skin, a lot of blood flows to regulate body temperature,” says Casa.
“Taking a cold shower reduces the temperature of the skin, so you can reduce the amount of blood flow sent to the skin. Instead, it sends blood flow to internal organs such as the gastrointestinal tract, which makes it easier to consume water and nutrients after exercise. As a result, you can reduce the fatigue you feel after exercise.”
Expected for the Hormysis effect
Drozevsky also explains that you can expect the “Hormesis effect” to be activated by bathing in cold water.
The Hormesis effect is the idea that harmful substances and stresses for the body are better to have a little, than at all.
“Hypoxia exercise, petite fasting, and cold water showers are some of the best health effects that can be expected. By taking a cold shower, hormones and neurotransmitters can be stimulated to increase physical and physical toughness and resilience.”

At that time, when I visited the newly completed Aomori Prefectural Museum of Art with my family, I was shocked by Marc Chagall's three huge paintings by Areco.
From the next day, the art class changed to a fun time, and even after going to Tokyo on the opportunity to go to university, I came to visit galleries and so on.
At the same time, there are no museums nearby, major exhibitions are held only in the metropolitan area, and it is difficult to go out due to child care. I also felt that many people do not have much opportunity to interact with art from various points of view.
So, while working for an IT affiliate, he took about two months to launch a website where you can appreciate art on the Internet.
The number of users reached an average of 10,000 per month in the first 10 months, and after the spread of the new corona, increased to 30,000.
Were you able to appreciate art in a free way when anyone wants to see it.
The aim of the other was accepted by a larger number of people due to the coronavirus.
Konno emphasized that the significance of art appreciation enriches imagination.
“As your imagination grows, you will be able to reach out to those in need.
I want you to become a better society by getting closer to art.”
The simple reason why the era of Chinese quality is over and the era of Japanese quality is coming (modern business) - Yahoo! news
Transforming values in the pandemic
Various predictions and discussions are being made about the afterpandemic world.
On the business side, the article on July 8 “In fact, the job of 'manager' is beginning to disappear in Japan...! “That cruel reality”, an article on July 4 “In the world of “post-corona”, in fact, “Japanese manufacturing” seems to be a great revival...! There is a possibility that changes mentioned in “etc.”
[Photo] The identity of “Japanese strength” that only Japanese people do not know... Surprising reality seen in Asia
Also, in the spirit of the article on June 26, “The Heart of Complete Burning” for those who have become aware of the end of life in Corona, and the article on June 10, “Corona, now full of riots, is the God's trust in times of pain.” It seems that the flow such as “Let's review the utility” will become mainstream.
And it seems that the two “substances (economy and business)” and “spirit” are combined into a form that can be clearly seen in our eyes, is a major trend of “from Chinese quality to Japanese quality”.
For example, if there is a defect or defect in a T-shirt or digital camera, it can be frustrating, but there is no separate in the life of the person who bought it.
On the other hand, the sloppy quality of masks and ventilators made in China that recently became a hot topic... “Chinese quality” in such products that are directly connected to life and safety is fatal.
No matter how cheap you can buy such a product.
You will seek products of “Japanese quality” even at a considerable price.
Of course, this flow is not happening only in Japan.
It is clear from the fact that Western countries, in difficult situations due to lack of masks and medical devices, still made “returns” one after another due to the extreme severity of “Chinese quality”.
More secure and safer than cheap
In addition, products such as automobiles are products that can be fatal (death due to accidents).
No matter how much countries such as China and Korea take offensive with the cheap strategy of “cheap or bad”, eventually it can not be made in Japan, article on June 16 “Still win alone, world automakers fall down to Toyota is it? “The situation as stated in” is that “Japanese quality” is strongly required for automotive products.
And the pandemic reminded us that many other products also need “peace of mind and safety”.
In addition, security and safety are important not only in “Japanese quality in manufacturing” but also in “Japanese quality in logistics and other services”.
Like toilet paper riot, even though the production capacity is neat, the intermediate distribution is stuck and can't reach your hand.
Furthermore, on April 17, “Who is the true culprit of the lack of masks! As in the article “Don't forgive fire site thieves in the Chinese Communist Party”, I was keenly aware that self-sufficiency in Japan is also an important element of “security and security.”
If it comes to emergency, every country is natural to have their own priority, and it is very important to be able to procure essentials such as masks (medical devices) and food in their own country.

Nagoya Miyahara players have corona positive soccer J1, first after league reopening | Shizuoka Shimbun at S
Football J1 Nagoya announced on 25 that DF Kazuya Miyahara (24) had confirmed a positive response for the new coronavirus.
This is the first positive reaction of players after J League reopened.

98% reflective
White paint derived from a nonstick frying pan, it turns out to enhance the cooling effect with thermal insulation!
Great discovery of the day!
This year was the rainy season where there was a lot of precipitation that is not usual, but if it is light, the hot summer will be in full swing.
The days of burning that are hot and hot, even cooling become bad... just imagine already, it seems to be swolling, right?
Global warming is a major global issue, and human beings have narrowed their wisdom on how to get over hot midsummer with a little comfort.
One way to do this is to wear sheer white clothing.
Hey, don't you need to wear a black dress that absorbs heat in summer?
And, applying the same principle to house architecture, it seems that there are more cases where whitish paint is used.
White could not be a paint that reflects more light and does not absorb heat. That was also the latest research field.
The Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) has recently been in Colombia In collaboration with researchers from the University's Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics, he announced the most efficient method of blending white paint to improve the cooling effect of the interior of the building by reproducing solar heat.
It is intended for early practical application.
Previously, white paints with the highest reflectivity of solar rays were made of titanium oxide, which reached 85% reflectance.
White paint using titanium oxide has already been applied to roofs of buildings in high temperature environments to help block solar heat and improve cooling efficiency.
However, a newly discovered white paint derived from polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) fluoroethylene (PTFE) used in nonstick frying pans.
It is a white paint that applies the Teflon effect. It reflects up to 98% of the sun's rays, making it possible to cut heat significantly.
Even in hot summer, thanks to the white paint using Teflon, it is easy to spend indoors without being exposed to the scorching heat ~.
Maybe such an era is coming up close, right?
I feel like there are many dark colors on the roofs of Japanese houses, but will the white system become mainstream in the future?
When will Amazon's annual large sale be held this year?
US Amazon Dot Com revealed a postponement of the annual large sale “Prime Day”, US CNBC reported on July 21.
It is held every July, but it was reportedly forced to postpone this year due to the spread of the COVID-19.
■ A spokesperson, “details will be announced soon,” an Amazon spokesman said in a statement:
“Prime Day has become a special celebratory event that we look forward to in the past five years. Held this year later than usual while ensuring employee safety and assisting customers and sellers.”
However, he stated that “details will be announced soon,” but did not reveal specific dates.
On the other hand, it was decided to hold it in India.
A press release was posted on the country's website.
I explained that it will be held for 48 hours from midnight on August 6.
Prime Day has been held at the same time around the world, but this year may be taking unusual measures.
■ The large event that sold 70 billion yen in two days Amazon began its large sales for members in 2015 as a sales promotion measure during the summer, where sales were declining.
Initially, it was a 24-hour event, but it expanded year by year and held last year from midnight to 48 hours on July 15 in 18 countries such as the United States, Canada, UK, Germany, France, India, Japan, China, and Australia did.
According to the company last year, sales for two days surpassed the previous sales performance of “Black Friday” (the first day of the year-end business season) and “Cyber Monday” (next Monday).
The event also contributed to the acquisition of new paid members Prime subscribers, with the highest number of applications on the first day last year, and the next day was second only to that.
The company also sold 175 million products worldwide last year.
In this regard, Internet Retailer, a magazine specializing in the online shopping industry, reported that global sales for two days increased 70% over the previous year to $7.36 billion (about 760 billion yen).
Strict eye on mobile number migration, excessive retention.
What happens to fees and points?
(New Switch) - Yahoo! news
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications is considering a review of the same number migration system (MNP) that can use traditional phone numbers as it is when changing cellular carriers.
At the meeting of experts on the 21st, the policy was made to amend the MNP guidelines enacted in 2004.
Specific issues cover a wide range of issues such as the MNP fee and the ability to redeem those who wish to move out.
While a repulsion from telecom companies is expected, attention will be drawn to whether it can lead to healthy market competition.
The darkness of communication companies far from all you can transfer to mobile phones is far from the darkness of MNP. At the beginning of 2006, the user fee was 2000 yen, but now 3000 yen.
Estimated MNP commission revenue of three major mobile communication companies is 159 billion yen per year -.
On 21, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications listed the current status of MNP at the “Working Group on the Verification of Competition Rules (WG)”, a meeting of experts discussing the competitive environment of the telecommunications market.
The hours for issuing the MNP reservation number required for consumers to move to other telecom companies were also listed in Yudama.
Major telecom companies accept them on the web, but due to the convenience of the operation of the core system, the reception hours are mainstream from 9 to 20:00.
In the WG materials, it was clearly stated that the all-day response is as a rule as a direction for future consideration.
For those who wish to move out at MNP, it is also a problem that a mobile carrier is trying to redeem points by granting points.
It is because of the judgment that excessive retention can hinder fair competition.
Shunichi Kita, partner of Nomura Research Institute, who serves as a member of WG, said, “If you can have time to explain the provision of economic benefits or obtain permission from the user, we will issue a number promptly to users who do not grant permission and terminate. It is important to ensure this process first.”
However, in a series of issues, the structural problem of MNP fee is “the higher the customer is less likely to flow out, so motivation to proactively lower it is difficult to work” (the person in charge of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications) lies.
If a business operator takes the initiative to lower the MNP fee, there is also a concern that the customer outflow from the company will increase and the efforts of the company will not be rewarded.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications also pointed out that many countries overseas do not seek user fees for MNP, and it is likely that this will happen in Japan.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications summarizes the results of WG as a report around September to October, and then wants to begin the amendment of the MNP guidelines.
The time when the amendment is made is considered to be after 21 years.
Cellular companies are likely to be bothering their brains, including sales and customer support.
Chunichi and Katsuno, 6 times no conceded points also won't get the right to a winning pitcher (Sankei Sports) - Yahoo! news
Chunichi Masayoshi Katsuno pitcher (23) departed for Hanshin 8th round (Nagoya Dome) on 25.
It was unconceded by 4 hits six times.

The first player of this season and the last 18 Hanshin Battle (Koshien), the starting start of the two times both suffered from domination and disembark up to four times.
It was a backwater mound that did not serve as a starting point, and this time trying to survive one army.
This time I attacked a strong tiger strike opponent with a bull with a feeling ball.
When the straight ball of the second half of 140 kilometers ran, changing spheres such as counting balls could be effectively used.
Six times he was hit on the first Sands left middle second base, but left Oyama and killed Boer in Nigoro, 2 death-third baseans.
In the fight against Fukudome we greeted here in two balls, and the final is a fork.
I took a strikeout of the sky in a 3-ball game and beat a pinch.
Katsuno was 83 balls after finishing six times, but at the end of the midfield, director Yoda got out of the bench and told him to change the pitcher.
Isami Nishi, who played the pitcher, was 108 balls at the same time, but he was able to get off the mound first and could not get the right to win the first time this season.

45% of households where my wife holds the wallet!
Is that my husband happy? unhappy?
“I'm missing pocket money this month, I'm missing...” said by my husband to be pounding, or angry wife, isn't there?
The family in which this conversation is held is the one in which the wife holds his wallet.
In the world, how many families do wives hold their wallets?
Also, let's look at the percentage of “married and married wallets” and “jointly managed” together.
Which one holds the household wallet?
Matsui Securities Co., Ltd., covers 400 men and women in their 20-30s within 3 years of marriage (young couples), and 400 men and women in their 50-60s over 30 years of marriage (mature couples), for a total of 800 people The following survey results are based on the results of the survey on household management circumstances of couples (announced in June, 2020).
Who is holding a household wallet?
Wife: 45.0% Husband: 24.8% The result was the most common family where the wife manages the household budget.
Whichever one manages, household management has twists and turns, but there seems to be a variety of episodes.
Wife is managing household budget: Child A is a mother of Arafifh who has daughters from third and first grade high school.
A child is in full control of the household budget.
I took the university entrance exam and the number of months when the juku fee got too heavy deficit, so I negotiated to lower pocket money to my husband, but enough of the proposal, I was resisted.
At that time, I was told “Show me what kind of balance it is” so I showed the family budget.
It was supposed to have stated all expenses, but it was not enough to make a deficit when looking at the household account.
I was likely to stop by my husband, “I'm enough,” but child A involuntarily says, “Ok, my household management is underpower, so please take care of you all.” Thank you again,” it seems to be returned.
Later, when a child A interviewed her husband, “I am dissatisfied with being managed such as pocket money, but I do not have the time and energy to manage various things in and out of the household (for example, school material costs and PTA expenses), It seems that he was saying “real”.
Husband manages household budget: If you are a child B, a full-time housewife, B, is given the cost of living from her husband and cuts it every day.
Last spring, because the freezer part of the refrigerator was broken, B asked her husband, “I want you to buy a refrigerator”.
However, my husband was hesitant to replace it as “the freezer is not good, but it's okay because the refrigerated part can still be used.”
However, it seems that in summer the husband wanted to prepare an environment where you can eat ice cream at any time, and the palm turned over saying, “Would you like to buy a refrigerator, after all?”
So B child involuntarily got a friend with “husband stingy enough to stick” seems to be stupid.

Among them, Villarreal and R Sociedad have the right to compete in the European League (EL) next season, and Granada will compete in the two EL qualifiers and meet the team requirements required by R Madrid.
How will the world's number one big club decide to ensue the “treasures of Japan”?
