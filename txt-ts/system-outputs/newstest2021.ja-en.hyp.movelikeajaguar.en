Add layers to the heavy semi-long [all real wind] fluffy hair
CanCam model Honoka said, "Of course it's beautiful, but I respect her for her professionalism!"
I asked Mitsuteru Asahi of "SUNVALLY," a hair salon in Omotesando that actually handles Minami Tanaka's haircut, to make it "Minami Style Hair."
Report on the cutting process!
Nogizaka46 Yamashita Mitsuki, first cover with short hair!
First of all, check the faint hair before cutting.
It is thin, soft, and abundant.
I have a habit, especially during the rainy season, so I sometimes apply a straight perm.
A heavy semi long with flowing bangs.
Finally the cut begins!
To make it easier to cut, first lightly wet the whole.
After that, separate the top of the bee (the upper part of the head above the surrounding area) and cut from the bottom.
By the way, here is the point of your hair!
1 Table Bang By shortening the inside of the bangs a little, you can enjoy changes depending on the styling, such as a slightly thicker look when fully lowered, or a see-through look when lightly divided.
2 Cut that makes use of habit If you reduce the hair volume too much, it may spread.
While consulting about the balance, keep the balance that is easy to handle and difficult to spread, and your own swell lives.
3 The layer around the face and the curly hair layer = a cut with steps.
Add a layer around your face to make it easier to move and create a cute finish.
If you make Okureha at the temple and at the front and back of the sideburns, it looks fashionable even when you quickly put it together.
When I cut the hair on the bee that I had separated, it was around my face.
Pull out the hair bundle of the upper part around the face and cut the tip of the hair.
In this way, when the hair bundle is lowered, there will be a step and movement will be easier (this is the layer cut).

Governor Yoshimura, with Corona against "Gurunavi" (Sankei Sports) - Yahoo!
Osaka Prefecture Governor Yoshimura Hirofumi (45) appeared remotely from the prefectural office on Osaka ABC TV's "Cast" (Monday - Friday, March 48) on the 20th, revealing that they are considering partnering with restaurant information website Gurunavi as part of measures to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus.
From the beginning of this month, Osaka Prefecture will issue "Infection Prevention Declaration Stickers" to businesses that comply with the Guidelines in order to promote measures to prevent the spread of infection and to provide security to citizens.
However, there are only 11,000 restaurants that issue stickers in Kyoto Prefecture, which is said to be more than 120,000 restaurants.
Governor Yoshimura said, "We are planning to do it at the end of the month, but we will form a partnership with Gurunavi and set up a store that issues declaration stickers when you make a reservation so that you can find out at the reservation stage," and announced that they are teaming up with an online reservation site.
"The important thing is not to put it all together as a 'town at night'," he said, "but we should clearly divide the shops that are doing measures against infectious diseases and the shops that are not doing it.

He is also helped by the calm response of the ally defense, and once he has survived the pinch of the rising with zero, he has been playing the Seibu line with a combination of slider and fork centering on the pride of straight twice.
He kept improving and lined up zeros on the scoreboard.
In the first round, the third baseman, Tsuyoshi Sugano, took off with a walk, and the second baseman, Oka Oumi, succeeded in stealing.
No. 4, Naonori Yasuda hit the right mae-uchi of a thousand dollars to break the balance.
Then, in the next eight innings, he attacked Miyagawa Tetsu, the opponent's third baseman, and scored four goals at once, including a two-run strike between the left and middle for the first time since the transfer of Toritani Kei, who was on the way.
As a result, the young Marines' ace candidate pushed his back, and the game was decided at once.
The game was played eight times, with each of the three players shutting down, and Taneichi returned nine times with more than 100 balls.
"I gave it my all," he said with a series of walks that left him with two dead bases, but in the end, he struck out the 10th strikeout of Spangenberg with a high straight and set the game.
I felt joy with a smile.
Bye-bye to the accident in the new strategy Tsuruoka station in cooperation with related organizations Safety education announcement Yamagata Shimbun
At a bicycle class held as the start of the operation, a collision test between a car and a bicycle was conducted at Shoko Gakuen Driving School in Tsuruoka City
In recent years, the Tsuruoka Police Station (headed by Keizo SATO) has launched the "Operation By-By-Zero Accident" to eliminate accidents involving bicycles and motorcycles, which often occur in the area.
In addition to promoting awareness of the prevention of accidents with traffic safety organizations in the area, we will also strengthen the control of bicycle traffic violation.
There have been three traffic fatalities in the jurisdiction of the station this year, and motorcyclists and cyclists have died.
Although the number of accidents has been decreasing, the rate of accidents involving bicycles is about 11.7% as of June 30, and those involving motorcycles is about 5.8%, both are higher than the prefectural average.
In particular, the percentage of bicycle accidents that have occurred in the past five years has often exceeded the prefectural average, and the plan was to overcome this situation.
The name of the operation was a combination of the words "Ka" and "Ka" and "Ka" to eliminate accidents.
In traffic safety classes and other activities, we will ask related organizations to give driving guidance to the elderly and to use noctilucent reflectors more than ever.
The station issues a yellow card (instruction warning card) to warn the police.
The opening ceremony of the operation was held on the 21st at Shoko Gakuen Driving School in Tsuruoka City.
About 30 people attended the event, and Chief Sato said, "I would like to ask for your cooperation to reduce even one tragic accident."
A person in charge of the office presented the policy and activities of each organization.
A bicycle class was held as the start of the operation.
A police officer in a car demonstrated how the impact on a bicycle differs between braking and a collision at about 55 km / h without stepping on the brake.
Koichi Kinnai, chairman of the Tsuruoka Area Regional Traffic Safety Activity Promotion Committee, said, "I have once again realized the horrors of traffic accidents, and I would like to call attention to young people as well as the elderly."

He laughed many times for his crisp speech and the way he drank with relish.
A company employee (58) from Naka-ku, Okayama, who visited with his wife, said with a smile, "The way they talk and the way they pause is exquisite, and I was immediately drawn in."
Kisuke said, "It was a long time since the last performance, and my voice was in a good condition, but it was a fulfilling time."
The guest rakugo storyteller Kotome KATSURA (31), Osaka City, and the magic group Tsuyama Magic Club also appeared.
Owarai Akasakatei opened in 1996 in the former Akasaka-cho as the first public yose in Japan.
They continued to hold regular yose and demae yose once a month, but due to the influence of the new corona, they had to cancel the yose last in February this year.

Children enjoying catching fish: Kaikokan in Nii-cho, Kosai
At Kaiko-kan, a tourist facility in Arai-cho, Kosai City, visitors can try catching fish and eel from Lake Hamana.

Butler once again praises Tyler Hero, the future of the Heat, "Thoughts are not rookies" (Basket Count) - Yahoo!
Getty Images The heat's scrimmage is the first match of the series against the Kings.
Duncan Robinson scored a team-high 18 points in the 104-98 win, followed by Tyler Hero with 15 points.
In addition to being the league's leading shooter, Robinson, rookie and hero step ups from the 13th overall draft are important factors for the Heat.
Hero missed 15 games between February and March due to an ankle injury, and the season was suspended for a long time after his return match against the Hornets on 12 March.
Hero said, "I had plenty of time, so I was able to get back to 100% condition, which is the best feeling I've ever felt," but his performance at scrimmage was more convincing than words.
The late arrival of starting point guard Kendrick Nunn increased hero playtime and took advantage of the opportunity.
He scored 15 goals after playing a different role, so the value is great.
Team leader Jimmy Butler once again praised the Favorite hero.
"He can be a handler, he can score goals, he can defend, he can do everything for the team, he can play every position because his way of thinking is not like that of a rookie, he's looking at the video and studying it and trying to figure out where and how his teammates move, become free, and what he should do about it."
Before the start of the season, Butler likes the unyielding strength of the hero's rookie and his stoic approach to basketball.
That's why I invited him to individual practice sessions that start at 4am and have been training with him.
Butler once said, "He speaks his opinion to everyone and does not back down, and I respect that fighting spirit."
The butler is the type who always says what he thinks, and if he thinks it will be good for the team, he confronts harsh opinions knowing that conflicts will occur.
In the past, his relationship with his teammates deteriorated.
Butler might be superimposing himself as a young hero.
The character of a butler, sometimes too harsh for a teammate, is a good guide for anyone with enough guts to follow.
If the teacher-student relationship between the two, who respect each other, spreads to the entire team, the Heat can become a team that can aim higher.
SHIMADA Sho, the fourth round of the 2020 Summer Shizuoka High School Baseball Tournament SHIMADA Sho, the Hamamatsu-jo Kita Ko, the Shizuoka Shimbun at ES
Shimada Sho - Hamamatsujo Hokko - First inning Shimada Sho is dead on base, Matsuura hits first = Kusanagi Baseball Stadium
4th round game (Kusanagi 1st game) Hamamatsu Johokuko 000000 - 041000 × - 5 Shimada Shoji game time 1 hour 26 minutes
[Review] SHIMADA Shō took advantage of the early opportunity and completely defeated Hamamatsujo Hokko.
Shō Shimada was the first player to hit a perfect base with Matsuura's two-run hit.
He added two more points with infield goro and squeeze.
In the first half of the game, the Spaniards had only one hit and six were eliminated.
The North Carolina Panthers failed to win the final two rounds.
Third year led the fourth round
Two years, Matsuura made the first shot of gratitude
It was the fourth time in two years that the other team made the first appearance this summer.
Matsuura of Shimada Shō hit a change ball at the first deadless base and carried it to the left.
"If I lose three years, I will retire immediately, I wanted to win by myself."
The exceptional talent who took the fourth place last autumn was proud.
In the first three rounds, they mainly fought for three years, and in the two years when they had power, they were on the sidelines.
Coach Ikeda gathered the players at a meeting and told Nine, "It has been three years since I got here, and from now on I will be the best member."
Four of the nine members of the group spent two years at the club.
It may seem cruel, but it is proof that he is committed to serious competition.
Matsura is encouraged to say, "From now on, the opponent's pitching level will go up, and I intend to return the runner."
In the sixth inning, Saito hit a single in six innings, but didn't even step on second base.
The number 10 shirt has been well received as a synergy, saying, "Two years will inspire me for three years. If it leads to victory."
The team that aims to enter the top four for the third consecutive year including the Shizuoka tournament until last year does not intend to make memories of the remaining games.
In addition, 16 musicians from Fukushima Prefecture gather in the world to sing with the citizens of Fukushima Prefecture (Fukushima Minpo) - Yahoo!
I want to bring the energetic singing of Hama, Naka and Aizu to the world.
Sixteen musicians associated with Fukushima Prefecture gathered together to create a message song.
The lyrics tell of the earnest efforts of Fukushima Prefecture to fight against the new coronavirus as it moves toward recovery from the Great East Japan Earthquake and the TEPCO's Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident.
The full version will be completed by next summer, which marks the 10th anniversary of the earthquake, infusing the voices of the citizens.
The song was released on YouTube.
Onomichi says, "Set him down for the Queen."
The cheerful melody expresses the desire to convey people's positive attitude from Fukushima.
Due to the influence of the new Corona, the live houses that became the base of music activities were forced to close, and many musicians lost the place to perform songs and performances.
Since it was a time when we could not see the future, it was decided to believe in the power of music by Teruo (46), a singer and songwriter living in Minamisoma City, and U-Uo (37), a member of the music group 'Mexicali Boys' in Iwaki City.
Nappo will write and compose the music, while Dazuo will do rap.
An original plan for the event was to start in March of the same year, with the help of Japanese singer-songwriter Mutato (28) from Fukushima City.
Nappo says with an impassioned expression, "I want to fully enjoy this opportunity, as it has become a gorgeous face that is unthinkable in normal times."
As a measure against infection, there was no opportunity for 16 people to gather, and each recorded at a live concert or at home.
In order to boost the project, artist Koa from Iwaki City drew the image character.
The blue and green colors represent the natural environment of Fukushima.
The finished song will be posted to the world via YouTube, with the aim of releasing it on CD.
Next year marks the tenth anniversary of the disaster, and the postponed Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics are scheduled to be held.
Dazo said, "We have overcome difficulties and have a lot of responsibilities, so I hope that we can encourage many people by presenting songs at milestones."
Other participating musicians are as follows.

A service that responds to this is Spectee, developed by Spectee, an AI-driven information analysis company.

Today, the means by which people first learn about disasters and accidents is shifting from television to online information (social media).
Social media such as Twitter has become an important medium for disseminating information immediately after a disaster or accident.
However, it is difficult to watch the overflowing information and extract useful information from it manually.
Specty has a function to detect natural disasters and accidents from information flowing on social media such as Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, analyze the content, determine whether the information is true or not, and distribute it to users.
It is a crisis management support service that visualizes various crises occurring in Japan and overseas, "broadly classifying events that have a negative impact on social activities as" crises "" (CEO Murakami Kenjiro).
NHK at the time of the Kumamoto earthquake in April 2016 was the first major use case of the Specty, and after that, the movement of adoption spread rapidly among companies.
In addition to television stations, newspapers, and other media organizations, the system is currently used by more than 350 companies in Japan, including companies supporting social infrastructure such as electricity, gas, and transportation, and local governments nationwide.
■ Analyze posts to determine the type and location of a crisis
The Specty distributes information in four steps: "Gather information," "Analyze and classify content," "Title," and "Boolean."
The companies that use the service specify in advance the areas where information is collected (prefectures, municipalities, etc.) and the categories of crises (disasters, accidents, etc.).
Spectrum collects posts that fall under that designation using APIs provided by social media.
Next, analyze and classify the text, images and videos contained in the collected posts.
For example, if a video shows a fire engine, black smoke coming from a building, and orange flames coming from a room, it is classified as a fire.
In addition, images of overturned cars are classified as "traffic accidents," and images of flooded roads are classified as "road flooding."
The spectrograph also estimates the location of disasters and accidents.
"We often don't know the location of a post, so we estimate it by combining various information," says Murakami.
For example, if a road sign or sign appears in an image or video, information on place names is extracted from it and compared with a place name database to identify the location.
The Angels lost the first game of the season with a bye... Otani struck out three battlefields in the first and ninth inning of the fifth (baseball king) - Yahoo!
"Los Angeles Angels 7x − 3 Angels" (July 24, Oakland Coliseum) - Shohei Otani (26) of the Angels made his debut on July 24 (July 25, Japan time) in the opening game against the Athletics at the enemy ground.
Although he hit his first hit of the season in the first inning, he missed the next four at-bats and had one hit and one strikeout in five at-bats.
Otani played against Montana again on the first base three times, and played grounder.
In the third inning of the fifth inning, he faced right-handed second baseman Pettit at first base after his first death, and was also knocked down by a ball.
In the fourth at-bat of the eighth inning with a 2-1 lead, he faced Diekman, who was in fifth position with his left arm, as the first batter.
The second ball went straight back at a good angle, but fell to the left wing instead of fencing over.
In the bottom of the eighth, the Angels had a one-run lead, and right arm Batley lost two points to allow the Angels to turn, but in the bottom of the ninth, when there was nothing left, new catcher No. 7 Castro moved his first solo to the right.
They tied 3-3 at the last minute.
Two days later, he hit second base and then second trout.
The Athletics Bench, who had declared trout unwilling, chose to play Otani at full base with two dead.
Otani was expected to win, but struck out three balls in front of Hendrix, the guardian of Athletics.
The game was inconclusive in the ninth inning, and the game began with an exceptional no-dead second base game.
He was the ninth and last baseman to score.
In the top of the 10th inning, the Angels' leading substitute, Walsh, hit a poignant first base, but first baseman Olson, who caught the ball well, sent it to third base.
Otani sandwiched between second and third bases became a touchout.
The Angels then filled the field with two dead bases, but Simmons fell on a double grounder.
On the other hand, the Angels were in a situation where Robles, who continued to straddle the inning, was hit with a dead ball and a wild pitch, resulting in one death and second base.
At this point, the new coach changed the infield to five players, but Robles made Davis walk on the fourth pitch and filled the base.
Milner, now with the left arm, carries a full base ball to the right to say goodbye to No. 5 Olson.
Isolated again... 56 people from 33 households in Takaki-mura fear of heavy rain in the southern part of the prefecture on the 26th when a temporary bridge is washed away due to rising water (NBS Nagano Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
In Nagano Prefecture, there is a possibility of heavy rain mainly in the southern part from the 26th, and it is necessary to be alert for landslides in the central and southern parts.
In Takaki Village, the road was blocked and the residents were isolated again.
Sandbags and temporary bridges were swallowed by the swollen river and washed away.
After 3: 00 a.m., the prefectural Iida Construction Office set up a surveillance camera in Takaki Village.
This is a roundabout road built on a riverbed instead of a prefectural road that was closed due to a landslide, and it was allowed to pass only by residents' cars from 17th.
As a result, 56 people from 33 households in the Oshima area have been isolated again, and the Iida Construction Office hopes to begin restoration work as soon as the water recedes.
Warm and moist air flows into the Meiyu front, and heavy rain of more than 30 mm per hour is expected to fall in some parts of the prefecture over 26 days.
By 6: 00 p.m. on the 26th, the expected amount of rainfall for 24 hours is 80mm in the central part and 120mm in the southern part of the country where the amount is high.
The weather station has issued heavy rain warnings for the Saku, Suwa and Kiso areas.
I can't understand "cheat congestion" "Uchinchi"...?
"I thought it was not a dialect," said a Chiba resident.
I am a citizen of Chiba Prefecture, which is close to Tokyo.
I have lived in the prefecture for almost 30 years since I was born.
When I used the word "slurping" in a conversation with a friend at a university (Tokyo), the word "slurping" was instantly pronounced.
They understood the meaning through the flow and sense of the word, but the citizens of Tokyo and Saitama told me not to use it.
It's true, "I wonder if the cheating admixture will cheat and cross over?"
Because it seems to be connected, the meaning seems to be able to guess somehow.
And another thing.
I didn't realize this after being pointed out, but the expression "Uchinchi," which means "my house," was not used at all even when I read books, and I didn't even hear it from my friends.
"Uchinchi" was that so?
I also use it in my hometown (Gunma Prefecture), but I didn't notice it because I naturally stopped using it as an adult...
Japanese 'hiyashi chuka' (cold Chinese food) is not popular with Chinese people...?
"Cold Noodles: The Unpopular Way of Business - Yahoo!
Chilled in China Chinese noodles are "Japanese-style cold noodles"
As mentioned at the beginning, hiyashi chuka (chilled Chinese food) is a Chinese food (Japanese-style Chinese food) that originated in Japan and was invented based on the Chinese ryan bammien (cold mixed Chinese food).
Therefore, it does not originally exist in China, but it has come to be seen in Japanese restaurants in summer due to diversification of food.
Recently, Japanese convenience stores have started selling arranged products titled "Japanese style soba cool mask / soba chilled Chinese" and "Kawakodori shiro mask / Sichuan style chicken chilled Chinese."
On the other hand, Japanese style Chinese cuisine is generally not popular in China, being overtaken by popular, punchy Chinese dishes such as Sichuan and Hunan.
Naturally, the seasoning of Japanese-style Chinese food is familiar to Chinese people.
Therefore, although it is not bad, if it has little impact, it tends to be criticized.
"Hiyashi chuka" is not an exception, and it is still a minor existence in China.
Incidentally, the name of chilled Chinese noodles in China is' Nisshiki reimen. '
It is recognized by the Chinese as one of Japanese cuisine.
The standard summer is' ryampi. '
In China, a noodle dish with a feeling of summer is "Liangpi."
Many people in Japan may not be familiar with it, but Liangqi is a flat noodle made from flour, rice flour, starch, etc. that originated in Shanxi Province.
It has a history of over 2000 years.
It is a standard B grade gourmet sold at street stalls, and the price is very reasonable, around 10-20 yuan (150-300 yen).
Although it has the word "Ryo" in it, it is not frozen like Japanese chilled Chinese food.
It is rather normal.
Toppings such as shredded cucumbers, carrots and boiled bean sprouts are added to the noodles, and condiments such as cilantro, chili pepper, ginger and garlic are added.
Finally, a special seasoning mixed with soy sauce, chili oil, vinegar, sesame paste and peanut paste is added.
The noodles are smooth and chewy, and the sourness of the sauce is refreshing and thick, and the sauce is tangled well.
In addition, as it has spread all over China, there are various toppings and seasonings, and there are many variations, which is one of the characteristics of Liangshan skin and how to enjoy it.

"The Power of a Cold Water Shower - Yahoo!
Suppresses inflammation like muscle pain
A study published in The North American Journal of Medical Sciences that examined the effectiveness of hydrotherapy (a water-based treatment) found that it was effective in both physical and mental healing.
Taking cold water after exercise can reduce muscle pain and other inflammatory effects.
According to Douglas Casa, head of the Korey Stringer Institute and a professor at the University of Connecticut, "It is important to exercise and take a cold shower as soon as possible without wasting time, and lowering your body temperature as soon as possible will help you recover from the inflammation and fatigue caused by exercise."
Reduces fatigue
When you exercise in high temperatures, your heart, muscles and skin need more blood flow than usual.
"During exercise, the blood flow to the heart increases due to the high heart rate, and the muscular blood flow increases because energy is required to contract the muscles.For the skin, more blood flows to regulate body temperature," says Dr. Casa.
"Taking a cold water shower lowers the temperature of the skin, so it reduces the flow of blood to the skin. Instead, it sends blood to internal organs such as the gastrointestinal tract, making it easier to ingest water and nutrients after exercise. As a result, it reduces the fatigue felt after exercise."
Hormesis effect.
Drozevsky explains that cold water can trigger the Hormesis Effect.
The hormesis effect is the idea that it is better to have a little bit of harmful substances and stress than no matter what.
"Hypoxic exercise, petit fasting, and cold water showers are some of the best examples of the hormesis effect for health, which stimulates hormones and neurotransmitters to increase physical and physical strength and resilience."

Director Yano "It's stately to watch" (Sankei Sports) - Yahoo! News
(SE league, Chunichi 2-5 Hanshin, 7-go, Hanshin 4-3, 24th Nagoya) The momentum of the fourth game does not stop.
The batting ball landed in the middle of the left wing.
Oyama hit an arch for the second consecutive race and circled the diamond.
When I came back to the bench, I saw a white tooth.
"We had a good swing and we were able to narrow down our target and take the plunge."
In the fourth inning, 0-2, he took the lead.
He started the first half of the second half, after a foul.
He did not miss the 134-kilometer slider that Ohno took in.
The ball he hit with his core was so perfect that the moment he hit it, he was sure he was standing in.
After the match against Hiroshima (Koshien) on the 23rd of the previous day, one shot in two consecutive games was a signal of counterattack.
It was also a valuable one that was hit from the opponent who was weak.
When they faced Ohno Yu at Koshien on the 17th, they had nine hits and scored four goals.
However, in the Nagoya Dome, he was allowed seven wins, one loss, and one hold in the past 12 games, and suffered from a draw on August 23, 2013 during the seven consecutive losses.
He scored the first goal of 23 innings in the Nagoya Dome (even leaving the game in one innings) with a dynamic single shot and did not pass the game.
Coach Yano said, "Being able to finish a sweet ball well is a high level. It's stately to watch, and the timing of hitting has an atmosphere even if it's a foul. I think he'll still hit it."
In the third round, he scored three runs in a row and six in a row.
He started the game before the start of the season, but his seven home runs and 16 RBI are already perfect as the team's top and fourth.
We will keep getting results to win.

Macau Casino Regulatory Authority inspects the implementation of epidemic prevention measures at casino facilities... new coronavirus negative certificate required at entrance (Macau Newspaper) - Yahoo! News
About 40 casinos in Macau have been closed for 15 days from February 5 to 19 due to the outbreak of a new type of coronavirus (COVID-19).
The Macau Casino Regulatory Authority (DICJ) requires operators to ensure maximum protection for the health of employees and guests upon reopening, to reduce the risk of cross-infection by ensuring the distance between gaming (casino) tables, handling table games where adjacent seats are available (for example, at baccarat tables, three to four people can sit at one table at a time), and operating slot machines at one or two tables.
Disinfection of chips and other gaming equipment has also been strengthened.
Guests are also required to wear a mask, take a temperature test, and present a valid health code (which is generated by entering their recent history of stay, history of contact with a new type of corona patient, presence or absence of symptoms such as fever or cough, and contact information) upon entry.
From 0: 00 on July 15, the submission of a new type of coronavirus nucleic acid test negative certificate (valid only for the period issued by Macau or Guangdong Province authorized facilities) was also added.
One of the reasons behind the new requirement to present a negative certificate is the relaxation of border control measures between Macau and Guangdong Province (the abolition of quarantine and quarantine for 14 days, subject to various conditions) from 6am on the 15th, which is a precautionary measure.
On July 18, DICJ announced that the director of DICJ, Adriano Ho, and other officials had inspected the implementation of epidemic prevention measures at the casino facilities, held a meeting with security representatives from the six companies operating the casino, and asked them to protect the health of employees and guests by ensuring that guests' entrance was controlled.
DICJ will continue to strictly patrol the casino facilities in the future, and will have regular meetings with the management company according to the situation and evaluation.
Hayashimatsu, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the Health Bureau, and others accompanied them on their visit to the casino facility, where they were given on-site guidance on disinfection of gaming (casino) chips and how to keep a safe distance between seats on electronic casino equipment.
Due to the sharp decrease in inbound passengers due to anti-epidemic measures including restrictions on entry, casino sales for the first six months of this year decreased by 77.4% from the same period of the previous year to 33.72 billion Macao Pataca (Japanese yen equivalent: About 451.9 billion yen).

Paper written by fans and local residents from all over the country is plastered and pasted onto about 350 units, enveloping the city of hot water with the light of ale and delivering healing to visitors.
The Bonbori-matsuri is an event that reproduces a festival that appears in the anime "Hanasaku Iroha," which is modeled on Yuwaku Onsen, and is hosted by the Yuwaku Onsen Tourism Association.
It began in 2011 when the anime was broadcast, and every year many anime fans from all over the country visit.
From the lighting ceremony in July to the main festival in October every year, the lanterns are lit up on the steps leading to Yuwaku Inari Shrine beside the main bath.
This year, the festival was cancelled due to the new corona, but local and national fans said, "It is sad that there is no bonbori in the summer of Yuwaku," and the association proposed this project.
The campaign was titled "Recovery Campaign" with the aim of helping to heal and recover the world that is in dire straits due to the Corona Disaster.
So far, about 50 students from local Yuwaku Elementary School and Shibahara Junior High School have been asked to write messages with illustrations, and over 100 students from all over Japan have applied.
The message form can be purchased from the Association's website, filled out, sent to the Association in a self-addressed envelope, and attached to a paper lantern to receive a photo with a light on.
A set costs 6,000 yen, and applications will be accepted until there are 350 bonbori in total.
The lights of the bonbori are scheduled to be on until the end of November.
Shinichiro Yamashita (48), who has served as the festival's executive committee chairperson since the first festival, said, "Reading the message also encourages us, and we would like to hold a grand festival next year, which will be the 10th milestone."
For the campaign, original illustrations of the blooming Iroha character and Asanogawa Ohashi Bridge were also prepared.
From the first day, a clear file with illustrations will be presented to the special guests of the Ryokan of Yuwaku Onsen.

Seibu's proud "Moriyama Gaigen" showed a spirit of cooperation and produced the second Sayonara victory this season.
In the second round of the second round of the second round of the tournament, the four remaining contestants who were still far from winning the tournament showed their determination to win.
Genda headed to first base from the safety bunt.
Then, in the last six games, Mori, the third batting average at the bottom with a batting average of 10%, 8% and 2 rin, made a bunt and hit second base.

Hero Tonosaki said, 'Even though I was on the bench (Genda's safety), I was surprised, and I thought that I had to do something. Tomoya also believed in me behind with a bunt and connected to me. Mr. Yamakawa gave me a word before going to first base in a distant, "Aggressively go!," so I was able to enter the feeling of giving up, "and it made the flow of Sanara for three people.
Mori and Yamakawa were first and second in the 2013 draft, Sotozaki was third in 2014, and Genda was third in 2016.
All of them have experience as captain in their amateur years, and their sense of responsibility is one-to-one.
Tozaki, who took over the captain from Yamakawa in the fourth year of Fuji University, said, "Mr. Yamakawa is a captain who pulls the team with words because he is good at talking anyway.On the other hand, I am a vice captain who is good at talking and leave talking to the vice captain who is good at talking, and he is the type who is standing behind."
Director Tsuji said, "Genda's safety? That's not a sign, but I thought, 'I can go' with that. Tomoya was also a great bunt. Sotozaki also hit well," praising the spirit of "Moriyama Gogen."
All four players are currently struggling with a batting average of 24% to 5 minutes, but they support the team with wisdom to win even if they can not hit.

Statue of Omura Masujiro conveys his achievements as an educator to Suzenji [Yamaguchi] | Ube Nippo
A bronze statue of Masujiro OMURA (1825-1869), one of the Ten Heroes of the Meiji Restoration, was unveiled at Suzenji, Yamaguchi City, his birthplace on the 23rd.
There was an unveiling ceremony in the front yard of the Suzenji Community Exchange Center where local residents and government officials celebrated its completion.
Masujiro was a military scholar, Western scholar and doctor during the Restoration period at the end of the Edo period.
After he became a teacher at Bansho Shirabesho, the bakufu's research and educational institution for Western studies, he opened a private school called Kyukyodo in Edo and taught Western studies, military science and medicine.
Even after he returned to Choshu Domain, he lectured on military science at Meirinkan in Yamaguchi.

Standing beside a globe, holding a book in his hand, he gave a lecture on Western studies.
The height of the statue with the pedestal is about three (1, 55), and it is said that it was made from the viewpoint of a pupil of Masujiro's lecture.
It was designed by local designer Takami Marie (27), descendant of Masujiro's wife Kotoko.
It was built by the Executive Committee of the 150 Years of the Death of Masujiro OMURA (Chairman: Bin OKAMOTO), which was based on the Jisenji Committee.
Approximately 12.8 million yen of donations were collected from 1104 people nationwide.
The project cost, including the installation of the name board, is approximately 12 million yen.
The remaining funds are used to maintain the statue.
Okamoto said, "Masujiro, who kept his ambition high and made a great contribution as an educator, is the pride of his hometown and a bronze statue that will be the hope of children in the region who will lead the future."

Corona Disaster "Art Closeness" Online Art Museum "Hasard" launched by Konno (Hachinohe) (Daily Tohoku Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
There is a museum where anyone can experience art for free.
The collection ranges from famous painters such as Claude Monet and Gustav Klimt to unknown artists in Japan.
Since its opening in April 2019, the online art museum "HASARD" has captured the hearts of users for its convenience and newness, and the new lifestyle brought about by the Corona Disaster has further increased its attention.
Shinnosuke Konno (26), a representative of Hachinohe City, who launched the site, lives in Tokyo, and says, "I wanted to create a service where anyone can easily enjoy art, and I want people to experience art under difficult circumstances."
When you visit the other, you will be surprised by the abundance of exhibits and the beauty of the images.
As of the 24th, a total of 14 exhibitions, both permanent and temporary, have been opened to the public, and visitors are attracted to the ultra-high resolution works that convey not only the color but also the texture of the brush.
There is no need to register as a member or pay admission fees, and it is characterized by not only the viewer but also the artist who wants to hold a solo exhibition.
The way to show it online also attracts attention.
Moving pictures is one of them.
In Claude Monet's permanent exhibition "It begins to move again," clouds, flowers and grasslands are digitally manipulated to move.
"I want people who are not interested in art to be able to enter it" (represented by Konno), so you can feel as if you are in a picture.
He first encountered art when he was in elementary school.
At that time, when I visited the newly completed Aomori Museum of Art with my family, I saw three huge paintings of Marc Chagall's "Aleko" and was shocked by its power.
From the next day, the art class changed into a fun time, and even after going to Tokyo to go to university, I started to visit galleries.
At the same time, I felt that many people do not have many opportunities to interact with art from various perspectives, such as not having a museum nearby, large exhibitions only held in the Tokyo metropolitan area, and it is difficult to go out due to childcare.
So, while working at an IT company, I spent about two months creating a website that allowed people to view art on the Internet.

The simple reason why the era of Chinese quality is over and the era of Japanese quality is coming (modern business) - Yahoo!
Pandemic changes values
There are various predictions and discussions about the post-pandemic world.
On the business side, there is a possibility that the changes mentioned in the article on July 8 "Actually, the work of" management "is starting to disappear in Japan now...! That cruel reality" and the article on July 4 "In the world of" Corona, "in fact," Japanese manufacturing "is about to be revived...!"
[Photo] The true nature of "Japan's strength" unknown only to Japanese people... An unexpected reality seen in Asia
On the spiritual side, it seems that the trend will become mainstream, such as the article on June 26, "The idea of complete combustion" to give to people who are conscious of the end of life with the corona, "and the article on June 10," Corona, now full of riots, let's reconsider the effectiveness of "God's favor in hard times."
And what we can clearly see is a major shift from "Chinese quality" to "Japanese quality" in the form of combining these two "materials" (economy and business) and "spirit."
For example, it would be infuriating if a T-shirt or digital camera were defective or defective, but the life of the person who purchased it is irrelevant.
On the other hand, the sloppy quality of masks and artificial respirators made in China, which has recently become a hot topic, is critical in terms of "Chinese quality" in products directly linked to life and safety.
No matter how cheap they are, they cannot buy such products.
They will want "Japanese quality" products even if they pay a considerable price.
Of course, this trend is not confined to Japan.
It is clear from the fact that the Western countries, which faced difficulties due to shortages of masks and medical equipment, returned products one after another due to the extremely poor quality of Chinese products.
Safer than cheaper
Products such as automobiles are also products whose defects can be fatal (death by accident).
No matter how much China, Korea, and other countries launch an offensive on the "cheap or bad" strategy of selling cars at a low price, they can not compete with Japanese cars, and the situation as described in the article on June 16, "Is the world's automakers going to bow down to Toyota?" Is because "Japanese quality" is strongly required for automobile products.
The recent pandemic also reminded us that safety and security are essential for many other products.
Also, safety and security are important not only for "Japanese quality in manufacturing" but also for "Japanese quality in services such as logistics."
In some cases, such as toilet paper riots, even though the production capacity is adequate, the intermediate distribution system is stuck and cannot be reached.
Furthermore, an article on April 17th titled, "Who is the real culprit behind the lack of masks? Don't allow the Chinese Communist government to rob fireplaces," made me keenly aware that self-sufficiency in Japan is also an important element of safety and security.
In the event of an emergency, each country will naturally give priority to its own country, and it is very important to be able to procure necessities such as masks (medical equipment) and food within its own country.
In South Korea, the number of newly infected coronas is over 100 for the first time in 115 days (= Foreign inflow is 86) - Yahoo!
(Seoul = Yonhap News) South Korea's Central Epidemic Prevention Headquarters announced on the 25th that the number of people infected with the new type of coronavirus as of midnight on the same day has increased by 113 since midnight the previous day, bringing the total to 14,092.
It was the first time in 115 days that the number of new infections per day exceeded 100 since April 1 (101).
In addition to 32 sailors on board a Russian ship that docked at Busan Port were found to be infected, 32 of the 293 workers who returned from Iraq on the 24th were judged positive.
The number of newly infected people in South Korea was in the range of 30-60 except for the 20th (26).
Of the new cases announced on January 25, 86 people came from overseas, the largest number since January 20, when the first cases of infection occurred in Korea.
The largest number of visitors came from Iraq, with 34 from Russia, five from the Philippines and three from the United States.
Meanwhile, 27 people have been infected in the city, with 11 confirmed cases in Seoul and Gyeonggi-do, and 5 in Busan.

Nagoya Miyahara player corona positive soccer J1 for first time since league resumes | Shizuoka Shimbun @ S
J1's Nagoya announced on the 25th that FDAM player Kazuya Miyahara (24) had tested positive for the virus.
After the J.League resumes, this is the first time that players have tested positive for J.League.
He is the third player from the club after FC Kanasaki Yumeo (31) and Australian goalkeeper Mitchell Langerak (31) who were infected in June.
The two were treated and returned to the game.
This season, Miyahara entered the bench in the battle of Oita at the Showa Denko Dome on July 22.
At an online press conference on the 25th, Nagoya revealed that 60 players and staff were tested on the same day.

It turns out that the white paint from the Teflon frying pan, the heat insulation will increase the cooling effect!
No way!
This year, the rainy season was marked by an unusually high amount of rainfall, but in the autumn, the extremely hot summer comes into full swing.
It's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, the air conditioning doesn't work, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot...
Global warming is a major global problem, and humanity has been trying to figure out how to overcome the hot summer with a little comfort.
One way to do this is to wear light, white clothing.
You know, you don't have to wear black summer clothes that absorb heat.
The same principle has been applied to the construction of houses, and white paint is increasingly being used.
White paint can reflect more light than white paint and does not absorb heat.
Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), in collaboration with researchers at the Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics at Columbia University, has recently announced that they have discovered a method for mixing white paint that can efficiently bounce back solar heat and increase the cooling effect inside the building.
They are aiming for early commercialization.
In the past, white paint with the highest solar reflectance was made of titanium oxide, which has a reflectance of 85%.
White paint using titanium oxide has already been applied to roofs of buildings in high-temperature environments, and is being used to cut off solar heat and improve cooling efficiency.
However, what was newly discovered was a white paint derived from the polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) fluoropolymer used in Teflon frying pans.
This white paint, which applies the Teflon effect, reflects nearly 98% of the sun's rays and is capable of significant heat cutting.
Even in the hot summer, thanks to the white paint using Teflon, it is easy to spend indoors without being exposed to the heat.
That era may be coming soon, right?
The roofs of Japanese houses seem to have a lot of dark colors, but from now on, will the white type become mainstream?
Amazon's annual big sale, when is this year?
Amazon.com has announced the postponement of its annual major sale, Prime Day, CNBC reported on July 21st.
The event is held every July, but it has been reported that it has been postponed this year due to the spread of a new type of coronavirus.
A spokesperson for Amazon said in a statement "details will be announced soon."
"Prime Day has become a special celebration event that we have been looking forward to for the past five years, and this year it will be held later than usual while ensuring the safety of employees and supporting customers and retailers."
However, he only stated that 'the details will be announced soon,' and did not specify the specific date.
On the other hand, we have decided to hold it in India.
A press release was posted on the country website.
August 6 from 0: 00 am to carry out 48 hours, said.
Until now, Prime Day has been held simultaneously around the world, but this year may be exceptional.
A large-scale event that sells 760 billion yen in two days Amazon started this large-scale sale for members in 2015 as a sales promotion measure in the summer when sales are declining.
The event was originally a 24-hour event, but has grown in scale year by year, and last year it was held in 18 countries including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, India, Japan, China and Australia for 48 hours from midnight on July 15.
According to the company, sales for the last two days surpassed those of Black Friday and Cyber Monday.
This event has also contributed to the acquisition of new subscribers to the paid member "Prime," and last year the number of applications on the first day reached a record high, followed by the next day.
Last year, they sold 175 million products worldwide.
Internet Retailer reported that worldwide sales for the two days were $7.16 billion, a 70% increase from the previous year.
Strict eyes on mobile number transfer and excessive retention.
What about fees and points?
Yahoo News - Yahoo!
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) is in the process of reviewing the MNP system, which allows users to use their existing phone number when changing mobile communications companies.
At a meeting of experts on January 21, the government announced its policy to revise the MNP guidelines established in 2004.
There are a wide range of issues to be discussed, including how MNP commissions should be applied and whether or not to retain individuals who wish to move out.
With opposition from telecommunications companies expected, attention is focused on whether this will promote healthy market competition.
Far from Unlimited Mobile Phone Transfers When the MNP was first introduced in 2006, the user fee was 2000 yen, but now it is 3000 yen.
It is estimated that the annual MNP commission revenue of the three major mobile communications companies amounts to 15.9 billion yen.
On the 21st, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) listed the current situation surrounding MNP at a meeting of the Working Group on Verification of Competition Rules, an expert panel that discusses the competitive environment in the telecommunications market.
The time required for customers to move out to another telecommunications company to receive an MNP reservation number is also mentioned in the report.
Major telecommunications companies accept applications on the web, but due to the operational convenience of core systems and other factors, the reception hours are mostly 9-20: 00.
The WG documents clearly stated that, in principle, all-day correspondence would be the direction of future consideration.
It is also problematic for mobile communication companies to give points to people who wish to move out via MNP.
Excessive restraint may hamper fair competition.
Kita Shunichi, a partner at Nomura Research Institute, who is a member of the working group, suggests, "It is important to get permission from users to give them time to explain the provision of economic benefits, and to promptly issue numbers to users who do not give permission.
However, in a series of issues, the structural problem of MNP commission lies in the fact that 'the higher the MNP commission, the more difficult it is to motivate customers to actively lower it' (a person in charge of MIC).
There is also concern that if a company takes the initiative in lowering MNP commission fees, this may result in an increase in the outflow of customers from that company, which will not pay off the company's efforts.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications has also pointed out that many countries overseas do not require user fees for MNP, and it is possible that this will happen in Japan.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) would like to compile the results of the WG into a report around September and October, and then start procedures for revising the MNP guidelines.
The date of the revision is thought to be 21 or later.
Mobile phone companies are likely to be troubled by sales and customer support.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
On July 25, Shokei KATSUNO (23) started in the Hanshin 8th round (Nagoya Dome).
He had four hits and no runs in six innings.
"I had my last pitch, so I thought it was my last chance, and there was a foreball, but I was able to play against the opponent without worrying too much."
In the first game of the season and the first game of the previous 18 days in Hanshin (Koshien), both of the two starts suffered from the control ball and dropped out of the game four times.
Unable to play the role of starter, this time it was a backwater mound trying to survive the first team.
This time, he made a strong attack with a hearty ball against a strong opponent.
When a straight ball in the upper 140 km range ran, changing balls such as count balls were also effective.
In the sixth inning, he was hit with a double at left center by the leading Suns, but he left Oyama and beat Boer to second base.
At the end of the second round, the two teams faced each other in the final round.
In three games, he struck out the ball in the air and survived the pinch.
Katsuno finished the sixth inning with 83 pitches, but at the end of the midfield game, Yoda came off the bench and announced the change of pitchers.
At the same time, Isamu Nishi, who played the pitcher game, had 108 pitching balls, but he stepped off the mound first and could not win the first win of the season.

Dodgers Betts signs 12-year, 39.1 billion yen contract!
Second in history behind the Angels Trout!
Mookie Betts, an outfielder for the Los Angeles Dodgers, was recently signed by the team.
"Boston Red Sox."
He signed a new contract until the end of the year 2032.
CBS Sports and other media outlets reported the event on October 22 (Japan time).
[Video] R Socks Betts demonstrates diverse talents!
You can do this other than baseball!
He made his major debut in 2014 at the age of 21.
He has contributed to the Boston Red Sox as a strong batting center and a strong right fielder.
From 2015 to last season, he was the pinnacle of middle-distance batting, recording more than 40 double hits every year.
In 2018, he batted .346 in the top division and MVP.
According to CBS Sports, Betts rejected a 10-year, $300 million offer from the Red Sox last year.
He was traded, along with left-arm ace David Price, to the Dodgers for cash and multiple players.
He signed a one-year contract worth $27 million.
The reported new contract is worth $365 million over 12 years from 2021 to 2032.
The largest contract ever awarded to an MLB outfielder, Mike Trout of the Los Angeles Angels, was worth $426 million in 2012.
The contract is the second biggest deal after this.
As for Betts, who will become a free agent (FA) in the off-season, it was inevitable that there would be a battle if he hit the market.
Before becoming FA, it will follow the trend in recent years to make long-term and expensive contracts.
In the turbulent MLB, Betts gained long-term stability.

"Hot Seminar" by Akio Kinoshita, Director of the Opthalmology Department of Hiramatsu Hospital, explains dry eyes etc = Yonezawa Saga Honten of glasses in Saga City
A "Health Hot Seminar" (hosted by Saga Newspaper and co-hosted by Megane no Yonezawa) was held on the 25th at Megane no Yonezawa Saga Main Store in Shimodacho, Saga, where experts give advice on various health issues.
Akio KINOSHITA, director of the ophthalmology department of Hiramatsu Hospital (Ogi City), described eye diseases deeply related to daily life such as dry eye and cataract.
Dry eye is said to be a "disease of tears," in which the quality of tears deteriorates and tears do not spread evenly across the surface of the eyes.
Kinoshita said, "Contact lens users are about four times more likely to use contact lenses," and cautioned, "Do not use them for a long time or sleep while wearing them."
The measures included placing the screen of the computer below the eye level and humidifying it in air-conditioned rooms.
We also introduced ingredients and food that are effective for dry eyes.
"Omega-3, which is found in blue fish, prevents tears from evaporating, and mucin, which is found in natto and okra, enhances the quality of tears," he said.
Regarding cataract surgery, I mentioned that there are two types of intraocular lenses that are inserted in place of the lens, one with single focus and the other with multiple focus, and I mentioned the difference in appearance.
About 40 people attended the seminar.
As a measure to prevent infection with the new type of coronavirus, the event was divided into two parts, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, and was held in small groups.

[G Osaka] 17-year-old, what are the chances of making his J1 debut against Kobe?
"Sports News - Yahoo!
When G-Osaka's head coach Tsuneyasu MIYAMOTO (43) spoke to him about the fourth consecutive win at Kobe (26 / Noesta), he expressed his hope for the third year of the FWW Tangshan Shoji (17), who joined the first team in the previous section.
The commander will make Karayama, who was promoted to the top this season, a member of the bench for the match against Hiroshima on the 22nd.
I didn't give him a chance to play, but so far at J3, the striker, who had scored three goals in five games this season, said, "There's a big thing about scoring. I'm 17 years old, but I want more gamsharas to play. I've seen players go abroad at a young age, but I want them to play with a high level of consciousness and greed."
Karayama played as a designated player for J3 last season and scored eight goals in 10 games.
Although he is thin at 178cm and 65kg, he boasts an astonishing scoring rate of 11 goals in 15 games in J3, thanks to his ability to get behind the defender with instant movement and his calmness to shoot in front of a crowded opponent.
However, the FWW Ademiusson and MFFA Onoze are out of the bench due to injury, and Karayama has a chance, but he has no opportunity to participate.
In a statement to the press, McCormick said: "We're not 100% sure what we're doing, but we're doing a lot of work.
If they are preserved, there is a possibility that Tangshan will be benched again.
At G-Osaka, MFDOH Ang (now PSV) was 16 years and 11 months old, and FWW Usami was 17 years and 0 months old when she made her debut at J1.
Karayama, who is now 17 years and 10 months old, is also expected to debut at J1 because of the existence that follows them.
A Ferrari stolen 26 years ago is found at the bottom of a river (octane.jp)
In 1994, Ferrari Mondial was stolen in the Netherlands.
The time passed without the police being able to solve it, but 26 years later the Mondial was miraculously discovered.
The discovery of the Ferrari (4 photos) at the bottom of the river was triggered by the fire department's diving training.
On July 8, a diver in training discovered something about a wedge shape that was sinking into the bottom of the river, and the police and the Dutch military were called in to pull something up, which was Ferrari Mondial.
By matching the VIN number to a database of stolen vehicles, the Ferrari was able to be linked to the 1994 case.
The car was handed over to its legal owner, the insurance company, and then sent to a scrap dealer.
Scrap dealer Lowie van DE Ooyevaar said, "There are still some parts left, but they are for the art of decorating: We have already received a lot of requests from people who want to make tables from the mondials that have been torn apart, we use engine blocks and glass plates."
For the time being, they are not planning to sell them in concrete terms, but rather they will be stored by scrap dealers as objects.

The car stopped for 40 minutes.
National Route 152 is closed for about 10 kilometers, and a detour to the other side of the Tenryu River is necessary to move around the town.
However, the width of the road is narrow and all sections alternate on one side, so waiting times are unpredictable.
In the town, a landslide occurred on the national route on the 9th, and the road was closed due to the danger of falling rocks on the nearby slope.
On the 13th, cracks were found in the Akiba tunnel in the regulatory zone, and the timing of the resumption of traffic has not yet been established.

"If it is a car, parents and myself have a large burden" I hope for early recovery.
According to the JR Tokai, it is expected to take about three months to resume operations, and from the 27th, special trains that go back and forth between Mizukubo Station and Oarashi Station one in the morning and one in the evening on weekdays are operated.
Within Mizukubo Town, landslides are frequent on forest roads that are also residential roads.
It may take several hours to detour.
Keiji Kumagai, the 69-year-old head of the Mizukubo Forestry Association, says, "The unloading of raw timber has been delayed, and there are isolated land islands everywhere. I am worried about the future rain."
