The acting head of Khabarovsk Krai spoke about his trip to the region in an exclusive interview with Komsomolskaya Pravda
Mikhail Degtyarev, acting governor of Khabarovsk Krai, called in an interview with Komsomolskaya Pravda columnist Alexander Gamov not to demonize the residents of Khabarovsk against the backdrop of rallies in support of the arrest of regurgalas.
I want to appeal to all political commentators, political scientists, participants of all kinds of talk shows.
It is not necessary to demonize the people of Khabarovsk Krai.
Working and wonderful people live here, - Mikhail Degtyarev shared.
In an interview, Degtyarev recalled that he is a member of the LDPR and one-party candidate of Furgal and added that he wishes him good luck in court, and the party and personally Vladimir Zhirinovsky will support him in court.
The full text of the interview has been published on KP.ru.
Earlier, the website KP.ru reported that Mikhail Degtyarev advocated an open trial of Sergei Furgal and considers it fair to hold him in Khabarovsk.
Hurricane Hannah alert issued in two Mexican states
The Mexican National Directorate of Civil Defense has declared an "orange" (high) alert level in the two eastern states of Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon due to the approaching Hurricane Hanna, TASS reports.
The storm will bring heavy downpours to Mexico, with some areas forecast to see between 150 and 250 litres of rain per square metre.
The authorities have prepared about 800 shelters for the population.
Ten thousand people will provide assistance, including rescuers, National Guard soldiers and the military.
At the moment, the hurricane reached the coast of the US state of Texas with a wind speed of 150 km / h.
Hannah's arrival in Mexico is expected Sunday morning.
Semilarski v. Prosecutor's Office: Former Deputy Mayor of Tartu will be considered for cassation on August 4
This means that a decision on it is likely to be made in early September.
The courts of the first two instances refused to consider Semilarski's lawsuit, but in April, his cassation appeal was accepted by the State Court.
On 12 December 2019, the Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the applicant, as its resolution was not within its competence as an administrative court.
The court ruling stated that the complaint contained a claim for compensation for damage caused during criminal proceedings.
"The prosecutor's office and the county court should regulate such issues," Anett Kreutzmann, a spokeswoman for the Tartu courts, previously explained to ERR.
According to her, Valvo Semilarski appealed the ruling in the district court, which on February 5 did not change the decision of the court of first instance.
Now the State Court will have to say its word.
According to Semilarski's defense attorney, attorney-at-law Oliver Nääes, his client had been wrongly suspected of bribery for about two years.
Now he demands that the prosecutor's office refute the untrue allegations against him and compensate him for moral damage.
The reason for filing a complaint to the court were the statements made by the prosecutor for special cases of the Liuna District Prosecutor's Office, Margus Gross, in October 2017, when Semilarski, together with several other at the time deputy mayor of Tartu, Artyom Sverd, was convicted.
"We would like to remind you that when I was detained, the Security Police and the Prosecutor's Office immediately organized a press conference and informed the entire Republic of Estonia that the leaders of Tartu, one of the most influential local governments, will be in charge.
These public suspicions that hung in the air accompanied me for about two years.
And now that these allegations and suspicions have turned out to be false, the prosecutor's office does not want to say anything about it," Semilarski commented in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Näes, at the press conference, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework in which the prosecutor's office should operate.
"The allegation of bribes and mis-selling turned out to be false, but that's not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its rulings on Russia, as well as on Lithuania, that during the investigation phase, representatives of the state should be careful when choosing words so that suspects are not presented before the suspects.
The prosecutor's office is also obliged to do this by the presumption of innocence, which, unfortunately, was not observed in this case against Valvo Semilarski," Näes said.
"The public presentation of Semilarski as a serious offender and a bribe-taker in circumstances where the facts underlying the suspicion of bribery are still being clarified is unacceptable for a wrongdoer, which contradicts the presumption of wrongdoer.
As rus.err.ee wrote, Valvo Semilarski, the former deputy mayor of Tartu, will not be prosecuted on bribery charges - the criminal case against him was partially closed in July.
At the same time, the former official is being tried on charges of knowingly violating anti-corruption legislation when conducting transactions on a particularly large scale.
According to the indictment, between 2015 and 2017, the former deputy mayor of Tartu participated more than thirty times in meetings of the city government in making decisions related to companies operating in Tartu, with the owners or managers of the larvae.
According to Gross, in all these cases Semilarski had personal interests, and therefore he had to step aside from participating in decision-making.
Earlier, as rus.err.ee wrote, the prosecutor's office charged Semilarski with suspicion of taking a bribe and violating anti-corruption legislation in conducting transactions on a particularly large scale.
This happened in October 2016, when he was detained along with another deputy mayor, Artem Suvorov (Centrist Party).
Then, the Prosecutor's Office and the Security Police said that there was strong evidence against both deputy mayors.
Both officials then resigned.
Suvorov's case later came to court, which fully acquitted the politician.
The judicial investigation into Valvo Semilarski is still ongoing.
The ex-soloist of the group "Hands Up" visited the Tver region
The ex-soloist of the group "Hands Up," and now a solo performer, businessman and actor Sergei Zhukov posted a photo from Kaliazin, Tver region, in his official Instagram account.
The photo was posted a day ago, on Saturday, July 25.
"I raise my hands up to the new Little One and say hello from the drunkenly fresh air!
Write in the comments, what is the weather in your city?
We have no rain today, but above +20 is not rising yet... "- writes Zhukov in social networks.
The singer is probably resting in the beautiful city of Tver region with his family.
Residents of the region have already thanked the performer for the visit, and also expressed hope for a meeting and personal communication.
The new "Kroshka" referred to in the post is probably referring to a new version of an old song that Zhukov has now recorded with blogger and musician David Manukyan (DAVA M).
At the same time, most fans remain FOR the old version: "Sergei, the old version of the song is clearly 1,000,000 times better!
Support me loyal fans of "Hands Up," "We don't need a "new crumb."
Most write directly that the original, which became a hit in its time, they like more.
The Ministry of Defense reported on the successful completion of tests of the hypersonic missile "Zircon"
The Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation reported on the successful completion of tests of the hypersonic missile "Zircon."
On Navy Day, the Defense Ministry noted that test launches conducted from the frigate "Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union Gorshkov" confirmed the unique tactical and technical characteristics of this missile.
According to the Defense Ministry, testing of the hypersonic missile is proceeding as planned.
Earlier in May, Deputy Defense Minister Alexei Krivoruchko reported that the ship's complex with the latest hypersonic missile "Zircon" will enter service in 2021-2022.
You all know well the truth that will be discussed today.
I think the idea of inequality as a divider and destroyer of society was in the air even before the French Revolution.
But we can now see evidence comparing the most and least similar societies, and seeing the consequences of inequality.
I will show you this data and explain why there are the relationships that will be discussed.
But first look at how we are a despondent mass.
(Laughter) I'll start with a paradox.
It shows life expectancy according to GNI, or the average level of well-being of countries.
It is clear that countries on the right, such as Norway and the US, are twice as rich as Israel, Greece and Portugal on the left.
But it has absolutely no effect on life expectancy.
There is no hint of a relationship.
But within societies, strong health gradations affecting all social strata are noticeable.
Again, life expectancy.
The chart refers to small areas of England and Wales: the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.
A huge difference between the poor and everyone else.
Even those slightly poorer than the richest are already less healthy than the top.
So income is very important within our societies, but not between them.
The explanation for this paradox is this: within our societies we look at relative income or social position, status - at what level we are relative to others, and what are the distances between us.
Having understood this idea, you will immediately think: what happens when the difference increases or shrinks, in other words, making the difference in income bigger or smaller?
Now I will show you this.
All the data used is absolutely real.
I take the UN's information, and the World Bank has the same: the scale of the income gap in these rich and advanced market democracies.
The indicator used by our team is very simple, you can download it. We consider the difference between the 20% richest and the 20% poorest citizens in each country.
See, in equal countries on the left, Japan, Finland, Norway, and Sweden, the rich 20% is 3.5-4 times richer than the poor 20%.
But in unequal countries, in the UK, Portugal, the US and Singapore, the difference is twice as big!
According to these measurements, we are twice as unequal as other successful democracies.
And now you will see what impact this has on society.
We collected statistics on social problems that are more frequent among the poor.
These are internationally comparable data on life expectancy, literacy and mathematical training of children, infant mortality, homicide rate, number of prisoners, teenage pregnancy, level of confidence, etc.
We put it all in one index.
They are all of equal importance.
The country is, of a kind, the average value of these data.
You see the countries in terms of the inequality figure that was shown at the beginning. I will revisit it again and again as the presentation progresses.
Unequal countries in general have more difficulty with all these social problems.
You see that the correlation is unusually high.
But if you look at the same index of health and social problems in relation to per capita GNP and Gross National Income, there is no correlation.
We were a bit worried that people would think we were picking up problems for our arguments and just "fitted" the evidence.
The index consists of 40 different parts, collected by different people together.
Among the criteria: the presence of books at home, the ability of children to talk to parents, the level of immunization, the presence of bullying in school.
It includes everything.
But it's all against the same indicator of inequality.
The situation for children is worse in unequal societies.
And this is a statistically significant relationship.
But again, if you look at the level of child welfare in relation to national income per capita, there is no correlation, no hint.
All the data demonstrated suggest one thing:
On average, the well-being of our societies no longer depends on national income and economic growth.
They are essential in poor countries, but not in the developed world.
The difference between us and our position against the background of others is what matters most.
I will show you fragments of our index.
For example, trust.
This is a part of the population that agrees that most people can be trusted.
Data taken from the World Values Survey.
Look, in unequal countries, only 15% of the population trusts others.
And in equal societies, this figure reaches 60-65%.
If you look at measures of social activity, or social capital, you will notice very similar ratios closely related to inequality.
We have done the work twice.
First, we analyzed developed countries, and then, as a benchmark study, we repeated the procedure in 50 U.S. states, asking one question: Are things worse for all our indicators in the most unequal states?
Here's the credibility of inequality, according to a general social study by the federal government.
A very similar spread, compared to a similar range of confidence levels.
The same story.
Overall, we found that almost everything related to trust at the international level manifests itself similarly in our benchmark study.
It's not just a coincidence.
Here is a timeline of mental illness.
WHO, through identical diagnostic interviews conducted on random samples of the population, collected results that allow us to compare the level of mental illness in each of the societies.
This shows the percentage of the population who suffered from some kind of mental illness last year.
The numbers start at around 8% and rise to almost 24%; entire societies with triple the rate of psychological illness.
Again, this is closely linked to inequality.
But here are the crimes.
These red dots show the US states, and the blue triangles show the Canadian provinces.
But look at the scale of the differences.
It starts with 15 murders per million and reaches 150.
This is the proportion of prisoners.
This is a tenfold difference, expressed in a logarithmic scale.
The figures rise from 40 to 400 in terms of the number of inmates in prisons.
These connections are not simply explained by higher crime.
Yes, in some cases this is partly true.
But they are mostly associated with harsher sentences.
Unequal societies are more often in favour of retaining the death penalty.
This shows the percentage of children dropping out.
Again, a pretty big difference.
It's incredibly malicious when it comes to using talent.
But social mobility.
This is a measure of income-based mobility.
Basically, the question is: do rich fathers have rich sons, and poor ones have poor sons, or is there no dependence?
Among unequal countries, in the UK and the US, the father's income is many times more important.
And in Scandinavian countries, income is already much less important.
As a result, there is greater social mobility.
And as we often like to say  ⁇  I know there are many Americans among the audience  ⁇  if Americans want to realize the American dream, they should go to Denmark.
(Laughter) (Applause) I showed only a couple of italics.
A number of other problems could be demonstrated.
Any kind of problem that becomes more significant among the lower social strata.
But there are endless problems with social gradients that are much worse in unequal countries; and not just a little bit, but 2, 10 times worse.
Think about the costs, what it costs people.
Let me go back to the previously shown chart, where all the data is put together.
First, graph by graph, the less successful countries, regardless of the result, are out of the unequal, and the well-performing ones are the Scandinavian countries and Japan.
So we see a general social dysfunction against the backdrop of inequality.
This is not one or two separate problems. It is a trend.
Let's take a look below: Sweden and Japan: countries are different literally in everything.
The situation of women, how closely they are connected with the family, is exactly the opposite in the conditions of developed countries.
Another very important difference is how they achieve greater equality.
In Sweden, the differences in income are huge, but they are reduced through taxation, through social programs, generous benefits, etc.
In Japan, things are different.
The wage gap is initially small.
Taxes are lower.
There are fewer social programmes.
And in our analysis of American states, we find the same contrast.
Some states succeed by redistributing revenue, others by making a smaller difference in net income before taxes.
We believe that it does not matter by what means equality is achieved as long as it is achieved.
I am not talking about full equality, but about what exists in rich and developed market democracies.
Another surprising observation is that not only the poor are affected by this inequality.
There seems to be some truth in John Donn's words: "Man is not an island."
A number of studies compare how people in more and less equal countries excel at every step of the social ladder.
One such example:
Mortality among newborns.
A group of Swedes classified many infant deaths according to the British Register of General Socio-Economic Classification.
It is rather anachronistic classification according to the profession of fathers, so single parents are not counted.
And by "low social level" there are unskilled professions.
Next  ⁇  skilled manual workers, then  ⁇  low-level white collar workers and up to the top level with highly qualified professions: doctors, lawyers, directors of large companies.
You see, things are going better in Sweden than in the UK in all walks of life.
The biggest difference at lower levels,
But even at the top, there are benefits from a more equal society.
We have shown this on five different data sets affecting educational outcomes and health in the US and internationally.
And this seems to be the overall picture: greater equality makes a bigger difference at the bottom, but it is also useful for the top.
But I still have to explain what is happening.
I think the psychosocial consequences of inequality are everywhere.
About feeling superior and inferior, about feeling valued and vice versa, about feeling respected for yourself and vice versa.
And, of course, the sense of competition that these feelings create fuels consumerism in our society.
It also leads to fear for one's status.
We are more concerned about how people around us think about us, whether they consider us attractive, smart - this worries us.
The more public assessments, the greater the fear.
Interestingly, parallel work is underway in social psychology: 208 different studies involving volunteers, who were tested in psychological laboratories for stress hormones, for reactions to stress, were considered.
Overall, they wanted to observe the types of stress that raise levels of cortisol, the main stress hormone.
As a result, such factors turned out to be situations that included a potential threat to social assessment, a threat to self-esteem or social status, situations where other people could give a negative assessment.
Just such stressors have a special impact on the physiology of stress.
There was also no criticism of us.
Of course, there will be dissenters or people who find this surprising.
I have to tell you, in response to the criticism over the data set, that we don't choose this data.
Our main rule is that if a data source has the necessary indicators for one of the analyzed countries, we include it in our analysis.
This source of information decides whether this data is real, but not us.
Otherwise we would have created a systematic error.
What about other countries?
Academic journals have 200 studies on health in relation to income and equality.
And they are not limited to these countries, but we have excluded others for illustrative purposes.
Same countries, same dimensions of inequality, problem after problem.
Why don't we control other factors?
Well, we have shown you that GNP per capita is irrelevant.
And, of course, others, using more sophisticated methods, controlled poverty, education, and so on.
What about causality?
The correlation alone does not prove causation.
We spent a lot of time on this.
Indeed, for some of these situations, cause and effect are well known.
A big change in our understanding of the causes of chronic health impacts in the developed world has been the significance of chronic social stress and its impact on the immune and cardiovascular systems.
For example, violence is becoming more common in unequal societies because people are more sensitive to contempt.
To address this, we should work on pre-tax and post-tax revenues.
We need to limit the income and additional bonuses of the top ranks.
I think it is necessary to make our bosses responsible for employees in every possible way.
I want you to go away with the realization that we can improve a person's real quality of life by reducing the income gap between us.
Now we have a point of reference for influencing the psychological well-being of entire societies, and that's really incredible.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Clubs claiming to be Miranchuk's Lokomotiv star and his salary in Italy became known.
According to "SE", at the moment, the Lokomotiv midfielder Alexei Miranchuk is claimed by the teams of Serie A Milan, Lazio, Fiorentina and Atalanta.

U.S. urges Qatar and its neighbors to end dispute
It is necessary to restore trust and unity between Qatar and other states, according to U.S. Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook.
He said the conflict between the emirate and other countries in the region had lasted too long and was damaging to regional interests in stability, prosperity and security.
So far, the US has unsuccessfully tried to mediate in the settlement of the dispute, which Washington views as a "threat to efforts to contain Iran."
Diplomatic relations with Qatar were severed three years ago by the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain.
They imposed a transport blockade, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorism.
In response, Doha said that neighbors simply envy Qatar's economic success - according to the IMF, Qatar has been leading GDP per capita for several years by a large margin.
The emirate is the third largest exporter of natural gas, the sixth largest exporter of natural gas and oil products.

The Russian Proton is ready to conquer vast
The Proton-M rocket is ready for launch, during which it will put into orbit two telecommunications satellites of the Express series.
The state commission came to this conclusion.
Already on July 26, the device will be launched at the launch site of the Baikonur Cosmodrome.
An immediate launch of the rocket is planned for July 30.
The original launch date was pushed back after a number of malfunctions were discovered among the launcher components.
According to REGNUM, according to Roscosmos, the defective parts were manufactured at the Ust-Katav plant in Chelyabinsk in 2015-2016.
Remenia won the second race in the SMP GT4 RUSSIA class.
Evgeny Kulikov, whose Porsche Cayman was damaged in the first race, failed to make the start.
That's why Alexei Bashmakov was on the reverse pole - though, by the second round, the Mercedes pilots had already pulled ahead.
Denis Remenyako again rushed forward, and Alexander Vaintrub was forced to repel the attacks of Alexander Maslennikov on the KTM, which broke from last place to third.
Despite a tight fight in the first part of the race, closer to the middle, Wainwright stepped up the pace, showing the best lap time in the race - and, although he could not catch up with the extremely stable Remenjako, guaranteed himself silver.
The Cayman group fell behind the leaders, but fought a tight battle among themselves.
Alexey Bashmakov became the best of the pilots at Porsche, which became the fourth in the standings, but also Andrei Fedotov and Konstantin Zakharevsky gave him a few moments.

According to the Cabinet of Ministers, one of these roads with a length of more than 663 kilometers Chekshino - Totma - Kotlas - Kuratovo connects Vologda and Arkhangelsk regions with the Republic of Komi.
Another highway over 388 kilometers long leads from Barnaul through Pavlovsk to the border with the Republic of Kazakhstan.
On this road, you can drive from the capital of the Altai Territory to the Kulunda checkpoint.
The acquisition of the new status will make it possible to bring these routes to a regulatory state with funds from the Federal Road Fund.
Major repairs and reconstruction of individual sections will be carried out, and the quality of the road surface will improve.
Tatarstan allowed to hold film screenings in the open air
The Cabinet of Ministers of Tatarstan has issued a decree according to which, from July 27, film screenings can be held in the republic on open areas - in parks, squares and embankments, writes "Tatar-inform."
The document also states that for citizens over 65, the mandatory self-isolation regime has been extended until August 9.
They can leave their homes to go to the store, take out trash or walk the dog.
But cinemas on premises are not planning to open until the third stage of lifting restrictions, the agency recalls.
"Washington" is glad to playoff matches.
We missed them
Russian "Washington Capitals" hockey player Alexander Ovechkin spoke about the club's preparations for the upcoming resumption of the NHL season.
The 34-year-old Capes striker noted the readiness of his partners for the matches.
Psychologically, all the guys are ready.
We are going to Toronto joyful, because we have been without a game for a long time and missed hockey in the playoffs, Ovechkin is quoted by the Russian version of the NHL.Com website.
- Now we are fresh, we do not have injuries and various painkillers.
However, Ovechkin also acknowledged that he and his partners have yet to recall some of the tactical combinations: "We don't have much time to play the majority and remember the March practices, how to move the puck in such situations.
But there is still time: I am sure that in Toronto we will devote part of the training to this.
Majority and minority are important in the playoffs.
And I am confident in our special brigades."
Recall that the restart of the Washington Capitals is scheduled for August 3, when the Capitals will play with the Tampa Bay Lightning.
After that, Caps players will also play with the Philadelphia Flyers (August 6) and Boston Bruins (August 9).
The Russian refused to pay for parking and beat a parking worker
In Vladivostok, a man refused to pay for parking and hit a parking worker, police are checking.
This is reported by the portal vl.ru with reference to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia for the city.
The incident occurred on Friday, July 24, in a parking lot near the shopping center.
The driver of the car refused to pay for the parking of the car, which caused a conflict with the parking worker.
The verbal dispute has grown into a ruckus.
The man punched the employee in the face, he fell unconscious.
He was hospitalized.
The source told the publication that the victim suffered a moderate head injury and was taken to the neurosurgery department.
Police are currently investigating the circumstances surrounding the incident.
Earlier, the Russian was charged with beating a disabled man who died later in hospital.
According to the investigation, the victim was visiting an acquaintance - a 45-year-old local resident.
The men drank alcohol together, after which there was a conflict between the friends.
The owner of the apartment beat the guest, he went home.
Two days later, the man became ill and was hospitalized.
He died from his injuries.
Recently, cyber attacks on the business world have become more frequent.
Access to data from companies such as JP Morgan, Yahoo, Home Depot and Target has caused them losses of hundreds of millions, and in some cases even billions of dollars.
It does not take too many such attacks to damage the global economy.
The public sector is also not immune to such problems.
From 2012 to 2014, there was a significant data leak at the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.
Access to security and fingerprint data for 22 million employees was compromised.
Government-sponsored hackers are known to attempt to influence election results in a number of countries through stolen data.
The two most recent cases of large-scale disclosure concern the Bundestag, the German federal parliament, and the theft of US Democratic National Committee emails.
The cyber threat affects our democratic processes.
The situation is even getting worse.
As computer technology advances, data protection systems become increasingly vulnerable.
A new kind of computer technology, computing on quantum computers that use the microscopic properties of nature to hugely increase computing power, is also of concern.
It is so powerful that it can crack many modern encryption systems.
Is the situation so hopeless?
Maybe it's time to pack up our vital data and prepare for the coming digital apocalypse?
I would say,  ⁇ Not yet time. ⁇
Quantum computers are still in development, and it will take many years before they are put into practice.
More important, there are major breakthroughs in encryption.
For me, this is a particularly exciting time in the history of secure communications.
About 15 years ago, when I learned about the new possibility of creating quantum effects that do not exist in nature, I was very encouraged.
I was intrigued by the idea of applying the fundamental laws of physics to create more secure encryption.
Today, a number of companies and laboratories around the world, including mine, are working on these technologies to put them into practice.
Right.
Now we are preparing to fight the quantum with the help of the quantum.
So how does it all work?
First, let's take a small look into the world of encryption.
To do this, we will need a briefcase, some important documents that we want to send to our friend, James Bond, and a lock to keep everything safe.
Since our information is completely secret, we need a special portfolio.
It has a special code lock: when closed, converts all text in documents into random numbers.
You put the documents in the briefcase, close the lock  ⁇  at this very moment all the documents are converted into random numbers  ⁇  and send the briefcase to James.
While the briefcase is on its way, you call James to report the code.
After receiving the briefcase, he enters the code, the documents are decrypted, and voila  ⁇  you just sent an encrypted message to James Bond.
(Laughter) A fun example, but it illustrates three important elements of coding.
Code  ⁇  we call it  ⁇ encryption key ⁇ .
It's like a password.
Call James to tell him the lock combination code.
This is called  ⁇ key exchange ⁇   ⁇
guarantee that you will get the encryption key safely from the right place.
And a lock that encodes and decodes the document.
This is called a "coding algorithm."
Using the key, it converts text in documents into random numbers.
A good algorithm will encode in such a way that without a key, the document is very difficult to decrypt.
The importance of encryption is that if someone takes possession of a portfolio and hacks it without the help of an encryption key and an encryption algorithm, he will still not be able to read its contents.
The information will look like a set of random numbers.
Most security systems rely on a secure way to exchange keys to transfer the encryption key to the right location.
However, the rapid development of computing power jeopardizes a number of modern key exchange methods.
Consider one of the most widely used systems today, RSA.
When it was invented in 1977, it was estimated that it would take 40 quadrillion years to crack the 426-bit RSA key.
In 1994, just 17 years later, the code was hacked.
As computers became more powerful, we had to use more complex codes.
Today we usually use 2,048 or 4,096 bits.
As you can see, code creators and hackers are engaged in an ongoing battle trying to outsmart each other.
And when quantum computers arrive in the next 10 to 15 years, they will be able to crack even faster the complex mathematics that underlies many modern encryption systems.
A quantum computer is likely to turn our current secure fortress into a simple house of cards.
We have to find a way to protect our fortress.
In recent years, there has been an increasing amount of research into the use of quantum effects to enhance crypto protection.
Some interesting discoveries have been made.
Remember the three main elements of encryption: high-quality keys, secure key exchange, and a complex algorithm?
Advances in science and technology put two of these three elements at risk.
First, the keys themselves.
Random numbers are the fundamental building blocks of encryption keys.
But to date, they are not entirely random.
Today we create encryption keys from random number sequences generated from software, so-called pseudorandom numbers.
In the numbers generated by the program or mathematical formula, in one way or another there is a certain regularity.
The less random the numbers  ⁇  in scientific terminology: the less entropy they contain  ⁇  the easier it is to predict them.
Recently, several casinos have been the victims of an inventive attack.
Combinations at the output of slot machines were recorded for some time, after which they were analyzed.
This allowed cyber criminals to redesign the pseudorandom number generator that controls the drums.
This, in turn, made it possible to predict the spin of the reels with high accuracy and to get a big win.
Encryption keys can also be subject to similar risks.
A truly random number generator is needed for secure encryption.
For years, scientists have been looking for the possibility of creating such a generator.
But most attempts today are either not random enough, not fast enough, or they are difficult to repeat.
But the quantum world is based on chance.
So it makes sense to take advantage of this fact.
Devices that can measure quantum effects can also create an infinite stream of random numbers at high speed,
which will prevent all these potential criminals from entering the casino.
A number of top universities and companies around the world are creating truly random number generators.
The first quantum generator created in my company was one by two meters in size and placed on an optical table.
Later we were able to reduce it to the size of a server box.
Today, it is the size of a PCI card that connects to a standard computer.
It is the world's fastest truly random number generator.
Its performance is a billion random numbers per second.
Today, it is used to enhance security by cloud providers, banks, government agencies around the world.
(Applause) But even with such a generator, the second big problem remains unresolved: the threat to secure key exchange.
Modern key exchange methods are not compatible with a quantum computer.
A quantum solution to this problem is called a "quantum key distribution," or QKD, based on a fundamental, paradoxical characteristic of quantum mechanics.
The quantum particle changes depending on its observation.
Let me give you an example of how this works.
Let's get back to sharing the codes for the castle with James Bond.
Only this time, instead of calling James with a code message, we will use quantum effects on the laser to create the code and send it to James via conventional optical fiber.
We believe Dr. Know will attempt to hack access to data sharing.
Luckily, his attempts to catch quantum keys along the way will leave fingerprints that James and you will be able to detect.
This will eliminate intercepted keys.
And the remaining keys can be used for enhanced data protection.
Because such security is based on the fundamental laws of physics, a quantum computer, or even any future supercomputer, will not be able to crack it.
My team and I are working with leading universities, as well as the defense sector, to develop this promising technology into the next generation security tools.
The Internet of Things heralds an era in which 25 to 30 billion devices are expected to interact by 2020.
Trust in the systems that support these devices is vital to the proper functioning of our society in the world of the Internet of Things.
I am ready to argue that quantum technologies will be able to provide this confidence, allowing us to take full advantage of the amazing innovations that will enrich our lives.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Video as cats helped injured dog cross road
A video of two cats helping an injured dog cross the road in Krasnodar Krai is becoming popular on the Internet.
A video recorder of one of the drivers recorded the touching procession.
Events occurred in the dark, the man noticed traffic on the road and reduced speed.
"Look, the delegation is a whole pret," the driver ironically says at first.
And then he notices that the dog moves with great difficulty.
The company safely reached the curb, after which it headed towards the forest.
"There is something people can learn from animals," they write in the comments.
On Sunday, parades in honor of the Day of the Russian Navy were held in St. Petersburg and near all major naval bases, including in Syrian Tartus.
219 different ships and 15 thousand personnel took part in them.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, who was hosting the main parade in St. Petersburg, said that in 2020, the Navy will be replenished with 40 new ships of different classes, as well as the latest weapons - including hypersonic attack drones and submersibles.
In 2020, the parade was held for the first time in Kaspiysk, where the base of the Caspian Fleet was relocated from Astrakhan.
In addition to St. Petersburg, parades were held in the Baltic, Kaspiysk, North Sea, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Vladivostok, as well as in annexed Sevastopol and on the raid of the Syrian port of Tartus.
The main parade in the waters of the Neva and the Gulf of Finland was attended by 4,000 servicemen and 46 ships, including nuclear and diesel submarines, as well as helicopters and aircraft of the Maritime Aviation.
Before the start of the parade, Putin, accompanied by Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, Navy Commander-in-Chief Admiral Nikolai Yevmenov, and Commander of the Western Military District, Colonel-General Zhuravlev, toured several of the ship's berths.
A copy of the first Russian battleship Poltava, recreated according to archival drawings, also became the decoration of the parade.
Emperor Peter I took part in its design.
In his speech, Putin recalled that this year marks the 200th anniversary of the discovery of Antarctica as a result of an expedition by Russian navigators Faddey Bellinghausen and Mikhail Lazarev.
And on the roof of the Senate and Synod during the parade, snipers were seen providing security.
More than 46 warships and more than 1.5 servicemen took part in the parade in Baltiysk, where the Baltic Fleet is based, and a large battleship, Kaliningrad, landed a naval landing.
In the annexed Sevastopol there was a parade with the participation of 30 ships and a performance dedicated to the history of the Black Sea Fleet, which also included the withdrawal of a group of divers from under the water.
The parade in Severomorsk was attended by the new strategic nuclear submarine Prince Vladimir, which was accepted into the Northern Fleet in June.
In Vladivostok, the holiday ended with a salute.
This year, the Russian Navy will receive forty ships and vessels
Forty ships and vessels will join the Russian Navy this year, Russian President Vladimir Putin said.
"The level of equipment of our military fleet is constantly growing.
This year, it will accept forty ships and vessels of various classes," he said, speaking at the main parade in honor of the Navy Day in St. Petersburg.
Putin also recalled that a few days ago, six more new ships of the long-distance maritime zone were laid down at three shipyards in Russia.
Earlier it was reported that a parade in honor of the Day of the Navy began in St. Petersburg.

How will the Central Bank's decision to reduce the key rate affect the economy
The Bank of Russia is expected to cut the key rate again.
It dropped another 0.25 percentage points, to 4.25% per annum - formally another historic low.
Judging by the return of the short rate cut, as well as the tone of the Central Bank's statements and updated forecasts for the Russian economy, the regulator looks at the economic outlook more optimistic than before.
This means that the current cycle of monetary easing could soon come to a halt.
"We have continued to soften monetary policy, primarily given that there are still risks of inflation deflecting down from 4% in 2021," Bank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina said.
They are associated with a significant decline in economic activity, a fall in domestic and external demand.
According to Nabiullina, the economic recovery will take more than a year and a half.
At the same time, she noted that after the removal of restrictions due to the pandemic, economic processes have revived: energy consumption, consumer and investment demand have been restored, construction and production of consumer goods have expanded, and annual freight turnover has slowed.
According to the updated forecast of the Central Bank, in 2020, the economy will shrink 4.5-5.5 percent (before that, it was expected 4-6 percent), and the economic recovery growth in 2021 will be 3.5-4.5 percent, in 2022 - 2.5-3.5 percent.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised its forecast for annual oil prices to $38 and $40 per barrel Urals in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
Earlier, the Central Bank expected $27 and $35 per barrel.
Finally, the Bank of Russia's inflation forecast for 2020 was 3.7-4.2% against the previously expected 3.8-4.8%.
The Bank of Russia's view on the economic situation is becoming more optimistic, which brings us closer to the end of the easing cycle, according to Russian and CIS "Renaissance Capital" economists Sofya Donetsk and Andrei Melashchenko.
Thus, the Bank of Russia has been consistently lowering the key rate for more than a year, since the beginning of last summer it has already dropped by 3.5 percentage points.
And at the last meeting in June, the Central Bank lowered it by one percentage point at once because of low inflation rates due to depressed demand and the need to stimulate the economy, which has stalled due to the pandemic and its associated restrictions.
The chances of fine-tuning monetary policy remain (at the next meeting on September 18 and before the end of the year), but the limit is already close, agrees chief analyst of Rosbank Evgeny Koshelev.
The combination of inflationary risks also indicates the proximity of a pause in interest-rate policy easing - disrupted supply chains, possible cost increases due to measures to prevent an epidemic, and a faster (than expected) recovery in demand.
In addition, subsequent actions by the Bank of Russia will require greater attention to inflationary processes during the harvest season, as well as external volatility, which has increased amid geopolitical conflicts, Koshelev points out.
In one way or another, the key rate reduction will lead to a further decrease in rates for the most reliable borrowers, as well as, possibly, for mortgages, says Maxim Petrovitch, senior economist at the analytical department of Otkritie bank.
The rate correction will be less pronounced than the key rate reduction, he clarifies.
Interest rates on loans may fall by another 0.3-0.6 percentage points during the second half of the year, mortgage rates may end the year in the range of 6.2-7%, does not exclude the economist of "BKC Premier" Anton Pokatovich.
Average deposit rates, in his opinion, will also fall - in the coming months they could fall to 4.2-4.5% (now barely above 4.5%).
Next, they could drop to 4% if the Central Bank reduces the key rate in the fall, according to Pokatovich.
The centrist party promises to pay all its debts by the end of the year
Michael Korb, General Secretary of the Centrist Party, said this in an interview with ERR.
According to him, the total amount of payments that the party is to make is about 300,000 euros.
"According to today's financial forecasts, the Centrist Party will settle its current debts and liabilities before the end of this year," Korb said.
Earlier it became known that the Prime Minister's party returned 110,100 euros to the state, which were considered a prohibited donation.
A car and a caravan collided in Harjumaa: four people were injured
According to police, the accident occurred at 13:50 in the village of Sodla, where a Mercedes-Benz car driven by a 31-year-old woman collided with a Fiat caravan with a 48-year-old man behind the wheel.
The drivers of both vehicles were injured in the incident, as well as passengers who were at the house on wheels: a 10-year-old child and a 48-year-old woman who were taken to hospital.
The rest of the victims received first aid on the spot, they did not need hospitalization.
The exact circumstances of what happened are being clarified.
Ukrainian military to monitor ceasefire in Donbass
The Ukrainian military has begun preparations for a ceasefire on the border line in Donbass, and the implementation of the agreements will be monitored by servicemen with experience in peacekeeping missions, the headquarters of the United Forces said on Facebook.
"Units from the United Forces have begun preparations for a full and comprehensive ceasefire on the line of demarcation, which takes effect from 27 July 2020," the statement said.
It is noted that, starting at 00:01 on 27 July, on each of the Ukrainian positions, the additional control over the ceasefire will be carried out by specially assigned Ukrainian servicemen, most of whom have combat experience and directly for the time being.
Such a move would "not distract the personnel of United Forces units from performing combat tasks and prevent possible provocations," the report said.
At the meeting of the contact group on Donbass held on Wednesday, the parties agreed on a set of additional measures to control the ceasefire, which, among other things, includes a ban on the activities of sabotage and reconnaissance groups and a ban on
13 patients with coronavirus died in Moscow

Psychologist: "Emelianenko still cannot forget parting with her beloved woman."
Psychologist Veronika Stepanova, who has more than 1 million followers on Youtube, spoke about MMA fighter Alexander Emelyanenko, who is the ex-husband of her sister.
Olya met Sasha, they began a storm of love, Stepanova said in a video on her Youtube channel.
- It was a very beautiful story, they instantly gave birth to a child, everything was fine and wonderful.
At one point, Sasha was full of it all, and wanted to walk a little.
And if any other woman treats this as normal (well, think, went for a walk, dance a little), then it's not about Olya.
She does not tolerate such things.
And his story of a little walk ended with his sister instantly marrying another man and immediately giving him a child.
When Sasha recovered from what had happened, he couldn't believe it.
He tried to crawl on his knees, giving diamonds.
His lion pride blew his head.
He wanted to return everything, but he didn't understand how to return it.
They maintain friendly relations, they have a common child, but he still cannot recover.
His destructive behavior is a cry of despair, an attempt to either kill or get her attention.

Albert Proza signs contract with Tallinn Legion
The last Proza club was Tartu's Tammeka, for which he played last season.
'Because of the injury I 've been out of football for more than a year.
He underwent surgery on April 30.
But now everything is fine - ready to play again.
However, while my form is far from optimal.
When will I debut for Legion?
It is quite possible that on July 29 I will play some amount of time for the Estonian Cup, and on August 1 I will be included in the application for the championship match against Paide.
But everything depends on the decision of the coach, he will decide whether I am ready or not.
I myself believe that I still need to recruit quite a lot," Albert Proza said on Sunday in an interview with ERR.
In the current Estonian Football Championship, after 14 rounds, Legion is ninth in the standings, having scored 10 points.
"At the moment, if you look at the table, we can't talk about the fight for high places, but Legion is an ambitious team, we have a good enough composition.
I think that next year we will have better results.
And the task for this year is to keep a place in the top league and play more confidently," Proza added.
"I don't set any personal goals for myself.
Getting back into football after such a big break is not easy.
Now my main task is to help the team stay in the top league and rise in the table as high as possible," said the attacker.
Previously, Proza also played for the capital's "Flora" and "Infonet," Finnish RPS and TPS, Maltese "Valetta."
Proza played 7 matches for the Estonian national team.

The main naval parade was marked by new ships and shooting technologies
At the Main Naval Parade in St. Petersburg, a new shooting technology was applied: a video camera "passed" under one of the ships, showing it "from the inside."
In this perspective, the passage of the newest serial small rocket ship "Soviet" along the Admiralty Embankment was filmed.
The main naval parade was broadcast by Russia 1 TV channel and Russia.tv website.
Earlier, on June 24, at the parade in honor of the 75th anniversary of the Great Victory, the camera, when moving from one plan to another, "passed" through the barrel of the tank inside an armored vehicle, and during the flight of fighter planes from the aeroplane groups "Russky.
The main naval parade consisting of 46 warships, boats and submarines, 41 airplanes and helicopters of naval aviation and more than 4 thousand troops ended in the water area of Kronstadt.
The parade included, in particular, the large anti-submarine ship Vice-Admiral Kulakov, the corvette Stoykyi, the large amphibious ships Minsk and Patriot, the nuclear submarine missile cruiser Eagle, and the underwater submarine
At the Kronstadt raid in the Gulf of Finland, it was possible to see for the first time the large amphibious assault ship "Peter Morgunov," built according to the project 11711 of the Nevsky Design Bureau at the Baltic Amber Plant.
The lead ship of this series, Ivan Gren, is already serving in the Northern Fleet, TASS reports.
Among other new recruits recently commissioned by the Navy was the first serial frigate, Admiral of the Kasatonov Fleet, built under the 22350 project at the Northern shipyard.
Another newcomer to the Navy is the diesel-electric submarine Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky of Project 636.3 of the Rubin Central Design Bureau of Marine Technology, built at Admiralty shipyards.
It joined Russia's Pacific Fleet in December 2019.
Other newest ships that have recently joined the Navy are the small missile ships "Sovetsk" and "Mytishchi" of the project 22800 ("Karakurt"), developed by the Almaz Central Design Bureau.
Small missile ships "Veliky Ustyug" and "Serpukhov" of the project 21631 "Buyan-M" also participated in the parade on the Neva.
And the largest participants were the nuclear submarine missile cruiser "Eagle" and the large anti-submarine ship "Vice Admiral Kulakov" - they could be seen in the Gulf of Finland.
In recognition of the great contribution of the Russian fleet to the exploration of the world's oceans, together with battleships on the Neva, two of the newest hydrographic boats, "Georgiy Zima" and "Mikhail Kazansky," passed over the Kronstadt
And near the Palace Bridge, one could see the first Russian battleship of the 16th century, Poltava, recreated at a historic shipyard.
This 54-gun sailboat was launched in 1712, took part in the war with the Swedes, and in 1717 provided landing on the island of Gotland.
In 1725, this ship was withdrawn from the Baltic Fleet, and after its re-creation, launched in St. Petersburg on May 27, 2018.
Travel to Kronstadt this year was limited for the duration of the parade due to the prevention of the spread of the coronavirus COVID-19, RIA Novosti reports.

Protests have taken place in Seattle, Portland, Louisville and Denver, The Daily Camera reported on Sunday.
In Austin, Texas, a man died during a protest.
The protester was shot with a rifle as he sat in his car.
The suspect has already been detained.
Demonstrators clashed with law enforcement in other cities.
The protesters staged a massive riot and the police were forced to use tear gas and stun grenades.
Poll: Lithuania's ruling Union of Peasants and Greens again tops party rankings
The Union of Peasants and Greens of Lithuania, which heads the ruling coalition of the Seimas, topped the party rankings.
This was revealed by a survey conducted by the sociological research company Vilmorus commissioned by the newspaper Lietuvos rytas.
After winning the 2016 parliamentary elections, "peasants" lost the first place and for a long time the leading critic of Russia in Lithuania, the opposition "Union of Fatherland - Christian Democrats (Conservatives), was in the lead.
However, recently, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda, assessing the electoral capabilities of the parties, said that the Union of Peasants and Greens after this year's parliamentary elections would probably be able to form a coalition again.
The announcement has angered conservatives.
The latest poll showed that if parliamentary elections were held today, 17.6 percent of voters would vote for peasants, and 17.2 percent for conservatives.
According to Vilmorus director Vladas Gaidys, the gap is within the margin of error, and yet the ruling parties have fallen behind the conservatives.
According to Gaidis, the sociological success of the "peasants" was helped by the news that their electoral list would be headed by Prime Minister Saulius Skvernialis.
The politician was first on the list of "peasants" and in the 2016 election.
In third place is the Social Democratic Party, for which 7.1 percent of respondents are now ready to vote.
In a month, it unexpectedly lost 2 percent.
The fourth is the Labour Party, led by businessman of Russian origin Viktor Uspassky (6.2 percent).
The rest of the political organizations, judging by the poll, will not yet be able to overcome the 5% electoral barrier.
Putin spoke about the unique advantages of the Russian fleet
Russian President Vladimir Putin said at the Main Naval Parade in St. Petersburg that the unique advantages and increased combat capabilities of the Russian fleet will be achieved through the introduction of advanced digital technology.
As the head of state specified, domestic hypersonic attack systems, unmanned underwater vehicles have no analogues in the world.
In addition, the Russian leader drew attention to the most effective means of defense of the Russian Federation.
According to the Russian leader, the level of equipment of the Russian Navy is constantly growing, so this year 40 ships and vessels of various classes will be accepted into its composition.
At the same time, it is noted that emphasis will be placed on equipping unique hypersonic attack systems.
Today, the Navy is armed with the latest ships equipped with precision weapons, strategic underwater cruisers and multipurpose submarines, as well as unique samples of special equipment, the president added.
Putin also stressed that military sailors adequately perform the most difficult tasks, serving the Fatherland flawlessly.
The Emergencies Ministry warned residents of the Moscow region of a thunderstorm
A thunderstorm and wind gusts of up to 15 m/s are expected in the Moscow region, the regional office of the Emergencies Ministry said on Sunday, July 26.
Residents are advised to remove household items from their yards and trim dry trees that could damage their homes.
The car needs to be placed in a garage or parked away from trees or poorly fortified structures.
To avoid a lightning strike, it is recommended not to heat the stove in the house in a storm and not to use electrical appliances, and not to hide in the street under trees (especially lonely ones), not to swim in water bodies.
Those in the car are advised to close the windows and stay inside.
On July 24, the Emergencies Ministry also warned residents of the Moscow region of a thunderstorm.
Extra requirements for applications for public procurement will be excluded by law
The legislation may establish exhaustive requirements for applications for participation in procurement.
In the autumn session, the plenary session of the State Duma plans to consider in the second reading a bill establishing requirements for the content and composition of an application for participation in procurement, the participants of which can only be small and medium-sized businesses.
The government is amending the law "On the procurement of goods, works, services by certain types of legal entities."
The draft law was developed in accordance with the road map for the implementation of the Strategy for the Development of Small and Medium Enterprises in the Russian Federation until 2030, approved by the government.
It provides for the preparation of a draft law on an exhaustive list of documents that customers are entitled to require as part of an application from participants in the procurement - subjects of small and medium-sized businesses.
And also - about the list of requirements for these documents.
To date, the law "On the procurement of goods, works, services by certain types of legal entities" framework regulates the procurement activities of certain types of legal entities.
Requirements for the content, form, design and composition of the application for participation in the procurement are set by customers independently in the procurement documentation.
"As a result, customers set excessive requirements for the content, registration of the application, the mandatory presence in its composition of certificates, certificates, extracts, the period of receipt of which in the authorized bodies may be comparable to the period of submission for the application.
The new draft law provides for the establishment of an exhaustive list of documents that customers are entitled to require as part of an application from procurement participants who are subjects of small and medium-sized businesses.
"The adoption of the document will eliminate the arbitrary establishment by customers of requirements for the composition and content of applications of participants who are small and medium-sized businesses," the explanatory note reads.
As an artist, the relationship is very important to me.
In my works I try to show that people are inseparable from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I first visited Antarctica almost 10 years ago and saw icebergs there.
I felt awe.
My heart was beating faster, my head was spinning, trying to understand what was opening in front of me.
The icebergs were almost 200 feet out of the water, and I couldn't help but wonder that it was one snowflake on top of another, year after year.
Icebergs are born when they break off from gletcher ice or break off from ice shelves.
Each iceberg has its own personality.
Everyone in their own way interacts with the environment and accumulates their experience.
Some refuse to give up and hold on until the bitter end, while others can no longer fight and die in a fit of vivid passion.
Looking at an iceberg, it's easy to think that it's isolated, that it's closed and lonely, just as we humans often see ourselves.
But things are very different in life.
When the iceberg melts, I inhale its ancient atmosphere.
When an iceberg melts, it releases fresh, mineral-enriched water that feeds many forms of life.
I approach photographing these icebergs as creating portraits of their ancestors, knowing that in these individual moments they exist in exactly that image, and that it will never happen again.
They do not die when they melt; it is not the end, but the continuation of their journey in the cycle of life.
Sometimes the ice in the icebergs I photograph is very young  ⁇  it is only a couple of thousand years old.
And some icebergs are over 100,000 years old.
The last photos I want to show you show an iceberg I photographed in Kirtartwiatsiak, Greenland.
It is very rare to see an iceberg spinning.
So here it is.
On the left you can see a small boat.
It is approximately 4.5 meters long.
Please note the shape of the iceberg and where it comes into contact with the water.
Here you can see how it starts to spin, and the boat sailed to the other side, and there is a man.
This is a medium-sized Greenland iceberg.
It protrudes from the water at about 120 feet or 40 meters.
But this record is in real time.
(Music) And so simple, the iceberg shows us a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
(Applause)
One winter morning a few years ago, I was driving to work in Johannesburg, South Africa, and noticed fog hanging over the city.
I drive there almost every day, so I would hardly have paid attention to it before.
Johannesburg is known for its special horizons that I could barely see that morning.
I soon realised it was a huge cloud of polluted air.
The contrast between my usual picturesque environment and that smog-covered sky stirred up something in me.
I was horrified that this city of colorful and picturesque sunsets would be swallowed up by the darkness.
At that moment I had a strong desire to do something, but I didn't know what.
I knew only that I could not stay away.
The main difficulty was that I didn't know much about ecology, air quality management or atmospheric chemistry.
I'm a computer engineer and I was sure I couldn't handle this problem with the help of code.
(Laughter) Who am I to make a difference?
But I was a resident of this city.
In the years that followed, I learned one very important lesson  ⁇  a lesson that must be taken seriously if we are to have a better future.
Even if you are not an expert in any field, your outside experience can be the key to solving complex problems in this field.
Sometimes your unique vision can turn into an extraordinary idea that will take everything off the ground, but you must be bold enough to try it.
This is the only way out.
Even then I realized that in order to at least try to change the situation for the better, first I would have to understand air pollution, so I became a student again.
At the very beginning of my research, I learned that air pollution is the most important danger to the environment.
According to the World Health Organization, nearly 14 percent of deaths worldwide in 2012 were caused by air pollution in homes and ambient air pollution, which is especially common in low- and middle-income countries.
Air pollution alone causes more deaths each year than malaria or HIV/AIDS.
In Africa, the number of premature deaths due to poor sanitation or malnutrition among children is in no comparison with the number of deaths due to air pollution, and this comes at a huge economic cost with more than 400 mA of development:
Now in my work I am exploring new opportunities in the field of artificial intelligence, where a symbiotic relationship between man and machine will help find a favorable basis for making the right decisions.
As we studied air pollution, it became clear that we needed to find a way to make better decisions to control air pollution, and given the magnitude of the problem, we needed to do it together.
So I decided to meet people who work in this field.
I started meeting with officials from Johannesburg and other nearby cities, I also engaged the local scientific community and made some cold calls.
The contact-building process I undertook helped me gain a deeper understanding of the problem.
It also helped me not fall into the trap that my colleagues often fall into when trying to innovate when we quickly apply technology before we are clearly aware of the problem.
I started thinking about what I could do to improve the situation.
I just started asking myself how I could effectively combine all my programming and artificial intelligence skills with the experiences of people I met.
I wanted to create an online air quality management platform that would identify patterns in pollution, look into the future and determine what we should expect.
I was determined to put my idea into practice, but faced with uncertainty, I had no guarantees of success.
I only had a certain set of engineering skills that I had acquired in my profession (Laughter) and that people dealing with air pollution had not had for years.
I realized that sometimes just one fresh look, some new skills create the conditions for the appearance of something outstanding.
Willpower and imagination are our guiding light, empowering us to find new ways and bypass challenges.
Armed with an in-depth understanding of air pollution and having studied the decades-old information on the concentration of pollutants and meteorological conditions in Johannesburg and beyond, I am excited to be setting up with my colleagues from South Africa.
The software system analyzes historical and real-time data to identify spatial and temporal trends.
Then we used new machine learning technology to predict the level of pollution for different pollutants a few days in advance.
This means that residents can make better decisions about their movements and where to live for their families.
We will be able to predict pollution cases in advance, calculate the culprits of pollution, who will be forced by the authorities to reduce the scope of their activities.
With scenario planning, urban planners will be able to make the right decisions in infrastructure development, such as residential settlements and industrial areas.
We completed testing of our technology, which lasted about 120 days, covering all of South Africa.
The results were welcomed when we demonstrated the close relationship between the forecast data and the data we received locally.
Thanks to our leadership, we have created advanced, innovative technologies that will be able to predict air quality with unprecedented accuracy, improving the city on which not so long ago I was driving in one winter morning, ⁇  he said.
And here's my conclusion: what if I didn't study air pollution then?
What if I didn't express concern about the state of the environment and just hoped that someone somewhere was already dealing with this problem?
That's what I've learned: when we tackle a complex enterprise that contributes to what we strongly believe in, it's important to focus on success and consider the consequences of inaction.
We must not go astray in the face of obstacles and difficulties, this should motivate us even more.
Wherever you are, when you realize that your natural curiosity is excited by something and that's what excites you, and you have crazy and bold ideas, and maybe it's beyond your competence, ask:
Why not act and solve the problem, as you can, in your own way?
And perhaps you will be pleasantly surprised.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Republicans propose to give another $1 trillion to support the U.S. economy
Republicans will propose spending another $1 trillion to support the United States economy, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin confirmed on Fox News on Sunday, July 26.
"In the $1 trillion package, there are the most priority and urgent things," the head of the U.S. Ministry of Finance noted.
The support package includes new direct payments to Americans.
The proposal must be accepted by Congress and signed by US President Donald Trump.
Representatives of the US Democratic Party believe that the proposed funds are not enough.
In the spring, about $3 trillion was allocated to support the economy in the United States.
On April 24, Trump signed a bill on financial assistance to the American economy in the amount of almost half a trillion dollars to combat the coronavirus and its consequences.
According to analysts, US GDP in the second quarter of 2020 will fall by 25% in annual terms, which will be the strongest decline in the country's history.
Microsoft will forcibly update older versions of Windows 10
Microsoft has confirmed the transition to the next stage of distributing the May 2020 Update for the Windows 10 operating system, writes the BetaNews portal on July 25.
The package is not needed: FAS questioned the validity of Microsoft's antivirus proposal
Having received software for remote work from an American corporation, government agencies can violate legislation
The company will expand the range of users with the new version of the OS.
To do this, computers with older versions of the system decided to automatically update.
It is assumed that a specially developed algorithm by the company will identify devices with older versions of the software platform, whose support period will soon end, and automatically install Windows 10 May 2020 Update on them.
In the near future, this will affect computers with Windows 10 (1809) and Windows 10 (1903), whose support expires on November 10 and December 8, respectively, notes the publication.
On July 21, it was reported that after the update of the Windows 10 operating system, users encountered problems when connecting to the Internet - there was no access to the network.
The difficulties were not related to the network connection itself, but to the connection status.
Dr. Myasnikov named the main indicators of human health
In the "death quartet" one of the main criteria was the excess of waist
Doctor and television presenter Alexander Myasnikov spoke about the key indicators by which human health can be determined.
His so-called "death quartet" included four criteria - an increase in pressure, cholesterol, sugar and waist volume, the doctor told Rossiya 1 television.
Butchers urged everyone to pay attention to these factors.
Moreover, according to him, controlling waist volume is even more important than weight.
For men, this parameter should not exceed 102 centimeters, for women - 88 centimeters.
Exceeding these norms may indicate that health is at risk.
First of all, it is a heart condition - the volume of the waist above the norm is a risk factor for stroke, heart attack, as well as cancer and diabetes.
Let us recall that earlier Myasnikov told why you can eat candy at night.
The doctor explained that sugar itself is not dangerous to health, the dessert will only become harmful when eating such food in large quantities, and candy at night, according to him, is not the worst snack.
The winners in Turing and Super Production were determined at Igor Drive
At the Igora Drive, where the main stage of the Russian series of ring races is taking place, the Turing and Super-production competitions have ended.
This was reported by Channel 5 on Sunday, July 26.
Leaders in Turing were Kirill Ladygin, Dmitry Bragin, Alexei Dudukalo, Pavel Kalmanovich, Ivan Lukashevich.
In Super Production, Andrei Petukhov, Vladislav Nezvankin, Nikolai Vikhansky, Vadim Antipov, Dmitry Lebedev won.
In the RSCG SMP Trophy, Rustam Fathutdinov became the best, Lev Tolkachev and Pavel Yashin became the winners.
The documentary John Lewis: Good Trouble has been released online.
The biography film, which was supposed to be a kind of visual greeting to Congressman John Lewis, who celebrated his 80th birthday at the beginning of the year, became an elaborate epitaph.
On July 17, a prominent human rights activist and politician died after a long battle with pancreatic cancer.
These days, numerous mourning events are held in the United States in memory of him.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows have floated the idea of a law focused on several topics, including federal unemployment payments, which expire Friday.
The remaining issues are proposed to be taken up later.
Moderna Inc said on Sunday that it received $472 million in additional funding from the U.S. Office of Higher Medical and Biological Research to develop a vaccine against the new coronavirus.
The U.S.-based drug firm explained that the additional funding is intended to help the company run late-stage clinical trials.
Without warning, the UK has removed Spain from the list of safe travel countries and imposed a two-week quarantine for all entering the country from Spain.
British Foreign Minister Dominic Raab did not apologize for the sudden decision, explaining its recent spike in the incidence of COVID-19 in Spain.
Protests
Protests were held in several cities in the United States to draw attention to racial injustice.
Seattle police fired stun grenades and tear gas and arrested 45 people after demonstrations in support of protests in Portland turned violent.
Police said more than 20 policemen were injured.
In Austin, Texas, on Saturday, a man died when someone shot at participants in the "Black Lives Matter" march.
According to media reports, the man may have approached the vehicle with a rifle when he was fired upon.
U.S. experts call Pompeo the worst secretary of state in the country's history
International affairs experts Aaron David Miller and Richard Sokolsky called Mike Pompeo the worst Secretary of State in United States history.
CNN published material with their opinion on July 23.
"In just two short years, Mike Pompeo - with a 2024 presidential run and support for President Donald Trump - has become not only the worst secretary of state in U.S. history, but also the most politically biased," the text said.
Experts accused Pompeo of "politicizing the office of secretary of state and desecrating the institution he leads" in order to advance his personal political agenda and protect Trump "from accountability and the rule of law."
According to them, the Secretary of State, in particular, covers up "Trump blackmail of Ukraine" and is ready to stand up for the employees of the American foreign policy agency for their cooperation with Congress in this case.
In addition, Pompeo was reminded that he was fairly friendly with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, who claimed partial responsibility for the murder of The Washington Post columnist Jamal Hashqaji.
Trump announced the decision to appoint Mike Pompeo as head of the State Department on March 13, 2018, following the dismissal of former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.
Before that, Pompeo was head of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
In Tikhoretsk, a foreign car drove into a store
Today, July 26, in Tikhoretsky on Menshikov Street, a Land Cruiser SUV drove at speed into the shopping hall of a chain supermarket.
PE fixed outdoor surveillance cameras.
A boy was injured in the accident, which happened to be in the store at the time.
The child was hospitalized with injuries and cuts.
In the hall of the shopping facility, windows and counters were destroyed.
Eyewitnesses claim that the driver of the foreign car was intoxicated.
Do you know how many species of flower plants exist?
A quarter of a million  ⁇  at least those we know  ⁇  a quarter of a million species of flower plants.
Flowers are a real problem for plants:
It's hard to create them,
They require a huge amount of energy and resources.
Why do plants go to such difficulties?
The answer to this, as to many other questions, is sex.
I know what you think when you look at these pictures.
The reason why sexual reproduction is so important is that there are many other ways to reproduce plants.
They can be propagated by cuttings; they can fertilize themselves or pollinate themselves.
But it is very important for them to spread their genes to mix them with the genes of other plants - so they can adjust to natural niches.
This is how evolution works.
Plants transmit genetic information through pollen.
Some of you may have seen some of these images before.
As I love to say, every home should have a raster electron microscope to look at these things.
There are as many different types of pollen as flowering plants.
By the way, this can be applied in forensics and not only.
Mostly, the pollen that causes allergies is pollen from plants that use wind to spread it. This is a very inefficient process, which is why it is clogged so hard into our noses.
Plants have to throw away huge amounts of pollen, in the hope that the sex cells, the male sex cells that are contained in the pollen, will somehow accidentally reach another flower, absolutely by chance.
Pollen from all herbs, and therefore all grains, and pollen from most trees, is carried by the wind.
However, most species use insects for this purpose. To some extent, this is more reasonable because less pollen is required.
Insects and other species can take pollen and transfer it to where it is needed.
It is clear that we know the relationship between insects and plants.
It's a symbiotic relationship: Whether it's flies, birds, or bees - they all get something in return, and it's something usually nectar.
In some cases, this symbiosis has led to amazing adaptations  ⁇  so, the hawk-mole hummingbird is beautiful in its adaptation.
The plant gets its own - the hawk moth spreads pollen elsewhere.
The plants evolved so they created small landing strips in different locations for the bees so they wouldn't get lost.
Many plants have a coloring that makes them look like insects.
These are lily pollens, cleverly made so that when an unsuspecting insect sits on them, the pollen flips over and hits it on the back, pummeling a large amount of pollen, with which the insect is squirming.
But an orchid that looks as if it has jaws. In a sense, it has them, which forces the insect to crawl out, covered with pollen, which it then spreads.
There are at least 20,000 species of orchids  ⁇  and they are all remarkably diverse.
They go for a variety of tricks.
They are forced to attract pollinators to reproduce.
This orchid, known as the Darwin orchid because it was he who studied it and made a startling prediction when he saw it.
You see the middle of the flower: the insect must put its trunk right in the middle and get to the bottom of this tube to get nectar.
Darwin said, looking at the flower, "I suppose something has evolved with it."
And indeed, that's the insect.
Usually its trunk is in a folded state, but in its straightened form it looks like this.
One might think that if nectar - so valuable and expensive in production - attracts so much attention from pollinators, then, just as with sex in humans, cheating can begin.
A flower might say, "I have a little nectar.
Look? "Here's the plant.
This is a plant that insects in South Africa love. In the process of evolution, they have acquired a long trunk to get nectar from the bottom.
And this is imitation.
This plant imitates the previous one.
But a long-tailed fly that didn't get a drop of nectar from a fake. Because the imitating plant didn't give her anything. She thought she would get something.
But the fly not only didn't get nectar from the fake plant, but also - if you get closer - in the area of the lower part of the head, picked up a little pollen, which it will transfer to another plant, unless there is a cockatoo.
(Laughter) Cheating is also spreading in the plant kingdom.
This flower has black dots: they seem black to us, but for male insects of a certain species, they look like two females ready for everything.
(Laughter) When an insect gets to this flower and lands on it, it dips itself in pollen, which, of course, will be transferred to another plant. If you look at the same raster electron microscope, you can zoom in.
So it probably even brings a pleasant feeling to the insect, in addition to what looks attractive.
In the image from the electron microscope - here is an orchid imitating an insect - it is clear that different parts of this structure have different colors and textures, but insects can perceive them in a completely different way.
Here this plant has adapted to imitate the shiny metallic body surface of some beetles.
Under the raster electron microscope, it can be seen that the surface is very different from the surfaces we looked at.
Sometimes the whole plant completely imitates an insect, even from our point of view.
I think it looks like some flying creature.
It's a striking, amazing flower.
And smart. It's called obsidian.
I call him Heathrowian.
For a bee of a certain species, it resembles another very aggressive bee, and it flies up and hits its head many times to repel the "bee," and of course is covered in pollen.
This plant also mimics another orchid that has a wonderful insect food warehouse.
And this has nothing for them.
So it cheats on two levels  ⁇  just unheard of.
(Laughter) That's ylang-ylang, a component of many perfumes.
I recently sniffed someone who suffocated them.
Flowers in principle do not need to be so fragrant.
They emit a striking spectrum of smells for any insects with a sense of smell.
But this smells not so good.
It is a flower that smells very, very bad, and has evolved to look like a fall.
It's very much like flies.
They fly and pollinate.
Here's this helicodiceros, also known as the "dead horse lily."
I don't know how a dead horse really smells, but this one definitely smells very similar.
It's really awful.
And meat flies simply cannot resist.
They fly inside and fly to the bottom.
There they lay their eggs, thinking it was a great piece of falling, and not realizing that there is no food for the larvae and the larvae will die, but in the meantime the plant has benefited because the bristles relax and the fly flies away.
Here is an arum, an arum maculatum, or in the United States, an aronic spotted.
I photographed it the previous week in Dorset.
It warms up to about 15 degrees above ambient temperature - amazing.
If you look at it from above, something like a dam can be seen behind the knob. The flies attract heat - the evaporation of volatile compounds - and they get stuck at the bottom in this container.
They drink divine nectar and become sticky.
During the night they are covered with pollen flowing from above them, and then the bristles we saw above weaken and release dust-covered flies.
If you think it's amazing, here's one of my favorites.
Filodendron Sello.
Those from Brazil should know about this plant.
This is the most striking thing.
Here is this phallic thing about 30 centimeters long.
It does something that no other plant I know does: When it blooms  ⁇  that's in the middle of its paws  ⁇  for about two days, its metabolism is similar to that of mammals.
Instead of starch being plant food, it takes something similar to brown fat and burns it at such a rate, digests it just like a small cat.
This return of energy, at equivalent weight, is twice as high as that of the hummingbird  ⁇  quite astonishing.
And it does something else, also unusual.
It not only warms itself to 115 Fahrenheit, or 43-44 Celsius, for two days, but also keeps the temperature constant.
It has a thermoregulation mechanism that maintains a constant temperature.
You ask, "Why is he doing this?"
Well, as if you didn't know that there are beetles who just love to make love at this temperature.
They get inside and it starts there.
(Laughter) A plant sprinkles them with pollen and they go to pollinate.
Surprisingly invented.
Most of the pollinators we know are insects, but many birds and butterflies also pollinate in the tropics.
Many tropical flowers are red, and it seems to us that all this is because butterflies and birds look like ours, and they see red very well.
But if you look at the spectrum, man and bird see red, green and blue - they see that spectrum.
Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet, and they distinguish different shades of ultraviolet,
which are at this end of the spectrum.
You probably think, "It would be great if we could see them."
Yes, we can.
So what does the insect see?
Last week, I took these pictures of the sunflower, a family of palm trees, in Dorset.
These are the smallest yellow flowers we see everywhere.
This is how it looks in daylight.
But this is how it looks if you remove the red.
Most bees do not see red.
Then I put ultraviolet filters on the camera and did a very, very long exposure with certain ultraviolet frequencies, and that's what happened.
Most of all, there is no "apple."
Of course, we know what bees see, no more than you know what I see when I call it red.
We can't say what's going on in the mind of a neighbor, they don't talk about the insect anymore.
But the picture will be about the same contrast, strongly highlighted in the background.
Here is another small flower - a different ultraviolet frequency range, other filters, to coincide with pollinators.
They will see about that.
In case you think this applies to all yellow flowers  ⁇  no flower was harmed in the process of shooting, this one was simply attached to a tripod, not ripped off - when they are in ultraviolet light, that's the look.
By the way, it could serve as the basis for sunscreen, because such creams work by absorbing ultraviolet light.
Maybe this connection would be useful.
Finally, here's one of the enothers that Bjorn Rorslett from Norway sent me - a fantastic hidden pattern.
I like the idea of something hidden.
I think there's something poetic about it. These photos were shot with an ultraviolet filter, which is mostly used by astronomers to shoot Venus  ⁇  in fact, Venus clouds.
This is the main purpose of this filter.
Venus, of course, is the goddess of love and fertility, and this is in tune with flowers.
Flowers not only spend a lot of effort to attract pollinators, they also somehow managed to convince us to plant entire fields of flowers and to give them to each other at the moments of birth and death, and, in particular, at the wedding, which, if possible, is celebrated.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
China's Yangtze River suffers third flood in a year
After a heavy downpour in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River -- China's longest waterway -- floods occurred for the third time in a year.
The flooding was caused by rising water levels in the river's tributaries in its upper course, which led to a rapid increase in the flow of water into the reservoir of the Chinese Sanxia hydroelectric power station / Three Gorges /.
At 2 p.m. on July 26, the reservoir experienced an inflow of 50 thousand cubic meters per second, which is expected to reach its maximum on the evening of July 27 -- 60 thousand cubic meters per second, the Water Management Committee of the Ministry of Water Resources of the Yangtze River reported.
The Committee today issued flood alerts for a section of the upper Yangtze River and the overflow of the Sanxia hydroelectric reservoir.
My job is to help computers communicate about the world.
There are many ways to do this, but I love helping computers tell what they see and understand.
For example, in this picture, a modern computer vision algorithm can recognize that it is a woman, and it is a dog.
He can tell a woman is smiling.
He is even able to say that the dog is unusually cute.
I'm working on it, thinking about how people understand and process data about the world.
What thoughts, memories and stories can awaken in people is this picture.
Everything related to such situations.
Perhaps you've seen a similar dog before or spent time also running along the beach, and this, in turn, evokes thoughts and memories of the past vacation, of the time spent on the beach, or the time when you were away.
One of my main principles is to help computers understand what it means to have such an experience, to understand what we share, what we believe in and what we feel, because then we will be ready to start involving computer technologies in complementary processes.
Going deeper, a few years ago I started helping computers write stories based on a series of images.
And one day during the course of work, I asked a computer what he thought about going to Australia.
He looked at the pictures and saw the koala.
He didn't know what a koala was, but said he thought it was a curious creature.
Then I shared with him a series of images of burning houses.
He looked at the pictures and said, "Amazing view! Great!"
I ran rattles around my back.
He looked at a terrible, life-destroying event and thought it was something positive.
I realized he recognized the contrasts, the shades of red and yellow, and thought it was worth a positive assessment.
Part of the reason he did it was because most of the images I gave him were positive.
Because people tend to share positive images when they talk about their experiences.
When was the last time you saw a selfie at a funeral?
I realized that by improving artificial intelligence, task by task, array by array, I created huge gaps, holes and gaps in what he could understand.
And in doing so, I encoded all sorts of prejudices.
Preconceptions that reflect limited vision, limited to a single set of data. Gaps that reflect human biases encoded in data, such as bias and stereotypes.
I thought about the evolution of technology that led me to where I was at that time  ⁇  how the first color photos were calibrated on the skin of white women, and therefore color photos were not adapted to dark faces.
And this same bias, the same gap was observed in the 90s.
And the same information gap we have today is in how well we can recognize diverse human faces with facial recognition technology.
I thought about the latest research, where we tend to limit our thinking to one set of data and one problem.
And in doing so, we created ever more gaps and biases that AI could develop even more strongly.
I realized that we need to think more about how the technologies we work with today will look in 5 and 10 years.
Humanity is evolving slowly, over time correcting problems in the interaction between humans and the environment.
Artificial intelligence, by contrast, is evolving at an incredible rate.
And that means it's really important to think about it carefully right now - to reflect on our own gaps, our own biases, and how it affects the technologies we create and discuss those that are modern in the future.
Top executives and scientists around the world are talking about what they think artificial intelligence will look like in the future.
Stephen Hawking warns: "AI can end humanity."
Elon Musk warns that this is one of the greatest existential risks our civilization has ever faced.
Bill Gates is perplexed: "I don't understand why people aren't concerned."
But these opinions are only part of history.
Mathematics, models, and the fundamental bricks of artificial intelligence are what we call access and what we work with.
We have open-source tools for machine learning and intelligence that we are willing to share.
And beyond that, we can share our experiences.
Share your knowledge about technology and how it bothers us and how it excites us.
We can discuss what we like.
We can foresee which aspects of technology will eventually become the most useful and which the most problematic.
If we all focus on an open dialogue about AI in the future, it will help create an atmosphere of shared awareness of what AI is now, what it can become, and what we need to do to get the best deal.
We already see and know all this about the technologies used today.
We use smartphones, digital assistants and vacuum cleaner robots.
Are they evil?
Maybe sometimes.
Are they useful?
Certainly.
And they are all different.
And in them you already see a ray of light illuminating our future.
The future starts with what we create and build right now.
We are launching the domino effect that will determine the path of AI development.
Right now we are shaping the AI of the future.
Technologies that immerse us in augmented realities bring past worlds back to life.
Technologies that help people share experiences when they have difficulty communicating.
Technologies based on understanding streaming visual worlds are used for unmanned vehicles.
Technologies based on image understanding and language generation are becoming technologies that help visually impaired people better access the visual world.
But we also see how technology can lead to problems.
Today, we have technologies that analyze our innate physical characteristics  ⁇  such as skin color or facial features  ⁇  to determine whether we can be criminals or terrorists.
We have technology analyzing data about us, even data such as gender or race, to determine if we can get credit.
All we see now is just one shot from the evolution of artificial intelligence.
Because where we are now is just the moment of this evolution.
This means that everything we do today will have an impact on our future.
If we want AI to evolve to help people, we need to identify the goals and strategies that will set that path now.
I'd like to see something that suits people well, blends with our culture and environment.
Technology that helps those of us who suffer from neurological or other diseases to make life equally difficult for everyone.
Technologies that work regardless of your skin color or demographic characteristics.
Today I am focused on the technologies that will be with us tomorrow and in 10 years.
AI can become anything.
But in this case, it's not a self-driving car without a final destination.
We control this machine.
We choose when to accelerate and when to slow down.
We choose when we need to turn.
We choose what the AI of the future will be.
There are countless things that artificial intelligence can do.
And it will become many things.
And our task today is to find out what exactly we should invest in AI so that the results obtained become the best for all of us.
Thank you

Nearly 9.5 thousand cases of CoViD-19 infection have been recorded in the Arctic
158 new cases of coronavirus infection have been identified in the Murmansk region.
In Murmansk, 135 new cases of CoViD-19 infection were recorded.
The total number of confirmed cases of the new coronavirus infection in the region is 9469.
The head of Dagestan discussed with Habib Nurmagomedov the construction of several sports facilities.
The head of Dagestan Vladimir Vasilyev held a meeting with the current champion of UFC in lightweight Habib Nurmagomedov, reports the website of the head of the republic.
The occasion was sports facilities, in the construction of which the late father of the champion, Honoured Coach of Russia Abdulmanap Nurmagomedov, showed great interest.
We are talking about a sports complex in the village of Dubki of the Kazbekovskiy district and the Center for Sports Training in Combat in the village of Sildi of the Tsumadinsky district.
First of all, Vladimir Vasilyev noted that now the construction of these sports facilities is also a tribute to the memory of the great coach.
The father of the baby kidnapped in Salsk revealed details of the incident
The father of a newborn kidnapped from a maternity hospital in Salsk, Rostov region, has revealed details of the incident.
Alexander Rusikov told TV 360 that the kidnapper had entered his wife's room when she was going to go to the toilet.
The mother of the abducted infant could not have thought that a person with evil intent might be in the maternity ward.
The woman was just a couple of metres away from the ward when she heard a neighbour's scream.
The infant was no longer in the ward.
According to Rusikov, everything happened between three and four o'clock in the morning.
He also said that the couple's ward was located between two medical posts, but there were no nurses on site at the time of the incident.
Also, the father of the abducted infant said that the hospital staff did not comment or apologize.
Recall that a newborn boy kidnapped on Saturday from a maternity hospital in Salsk was found on the same day in the Republic of Kalmykia.
Police have detained a 40-year-old kidnapping suspect.
The child has already been returned to the mother.
Doctors took tests on the infant to make sure he was healthy and not injured.
Four killed in plane crash in Swiss Alps
Four tourists died in a small plane crash in the Swiss canton of Valais, ANSA reported on Saturday, July 25.
The accident occurred at 12:25 local time (13:25 GMT) near the Glecherspitz mountaintop in the municipality of Blatten.
According to law enforcement sources, the victims of the crash were two Swiss aged 66 and 50, as well as two Austrians aged 50 and 46.

Three people died.
The expert assessed the role of vitamins in the formation of immunity
Chief freelance specialist for primary health care for adults of the Department of Health of Moscow, Andrey Tyazhelnikov, assessed the role of vitamins in the formation of immunity.
"It is impossible to create a stable immunity by extradosing on some drugs, vitamins or food in a very short period of time," he said in an interview with radio station Says Moscow.
According to him, there are certain rules.
For example, in summer it is better to spend more time outdoors, including under the sun.
He also noted that in the summer, if possible, you need to consume a large number of seasonal fresh vegetables and fruits.
"This generally strengthens immunity, gives a certain supply of vitamins and a certain amount of health," he added.
Earlier, he named several differences between the flu and the coronavirus.
5765 COVID-19 patients registered in Russia per day
In Russia, 5,765 new cases of coronavirus infection were detected by the day of July 26, according to the website stopcoronavirus.rf according to the federal operational headquarters.
During the entire period of observation, 812 485 cases of COVID-19 were recorded in Russia.
During the day, 77 people with confirmed coronavirus died, the total number of COVID-19-related deaths in Russia reached 13,269.
The number of COVID-19 cases in the world has exceeded 16 million, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
More than 4.1 million of them are in the United States, more than 2.3 million in Brazil.
Russia ranks fourth in the world for the total number of cases, third behind India (1.3 million cases).
In total, more than 644,000 people have died from coronavirus in the world, and more than 9.2 million have been cured.
Head of the region Igor Kobzev met with the mayors of Ust-Orda Buryat District
During the workshop, which took place today, July 24, the government of Irkutsk region discussed the main directions of development of remote agricultural areas.
During working trips to the districts of the Ust-Orda Buryat District, the head of the region gave a number of instructions.
Today the mayors reported on their performance.
First of all, the construction of the House of Sports in Ust-Orda has been resumed.
The order for this facility was given by the President of the Russian Federation fourteen years ago.
But only now has the situation managed to move from a dead end.
866 million roubles will be spent on construction.
The construction deadline is 2022.
And already this year, a school in the village of Bayandai should be commissioned.
At the moment, the finishing of the premises has been completed.
Of the remaining works - landscaping.
In general, the program of construction of pre-school and secondary education facilities is of particular importance for the region.
For your district in particular.
The demographic situation here is the best in the region.
And we are obliged to create all conditions for education and leisure for children of all ages, - noted the acting Governor of Irkutsk region, Igor Kobzev.
At the meeting, the head of the region instructed all mayors to actively engage in the work on developing master plans for human settlements.
This is one of the main conditions for the comprehensive development of the district.
All human settlements should have established boundaries and a master plan.
This is necessary for the development of the territory, for the construction of socially significant facilities, as well as infrastructure and cultural heritage, the head of the region stressed.
Also during the conversation, a problematic issue was raised with a 30% reduction in milk intake from cooperatives.
This was due to the redistribution of milk purchases by the processing enterprise in favor of peasant farms.
Because of this, the share of receiving products from cooperatives decreased.
The head of the region instructed the acting minister of agriculture to go to the site, study the structure of milk sales, analyze the experience of other territories and identify solutions to the problem.
Kuzminov won two races of the second stage of the RSCG SMP at Igor Drive.
Igor Drive hosted the second race of the second stage of the RSCG SMP Championship.
Pavel Kuzminov won his second consecutive victory.
He started fifth, but already took the lead on the first lap.
Second-placed Alexander Dudarev rose from sixth position.
Sergei Tikhomirov lost his position, repelled the attacks of Alexander Chernyak and first secured third place, but received a drive through penalty and after passing through Pitlein was eliminated from the fight for the podium.
The third was Ivan Pugachev, who won five positions.
The authorities of the Moscow region told about the fate of closed landfills
Solid waste landfills continue to be closed in the Moscow region.
This year, the authorities promise to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 existing landfills are being upgraded into modern waste processing facilities.
But this option is not possible for every landfill - many of them have overgrown dense residential development.
After the landfill closes, it gets up for recultivation - the body of the landfill is covered with soil, degassing and infiltration removal systems are installed.
This makes it possible to stop chemical processes inside the landfill, so that it does not ignite, does not emit stench, does not poison soil and groundwater.
And then the former landfill remains elevated by a useless pile among the surrounding residential buildings.
Why not make it something useful?
For example, in Ruz, where just the other day the redevelopment of the Annino landfill was completed, the authorities are considering making a ski slope out of the pile.
The landfill, which was in operation from 1976 to 2016, has expanded beyond the land allocated to it.
Therefore, during the recultivation, it was necessary to buy out neighboring areas, de facto long ago already clogged with garbage.
"Some time will pass, the landfill will fit down, the fortress will be built up, and we will think what can be done to make it start to benefit.
The ski resort catches the eye," Nikolai Parfenov, head of the Russian district, told reporters.
Two landfills to become renewable energy production sites
Torbeyevo landfills in Lyubertsy and Timokhovo in Bogorodsky District will become sites for the production of renewable energy sources from landfill and biological gases.
By the end of the year, a gas-piston power plant will be launched on the territory of Torbeyov, capable of generating up to 8 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per year, and about 0.95 gigacalories of thermal energy will be provided by conventional power plants.
Timokhovo will produce 72.5 million kilowatt hours and continue to operate as a garbage processing complex.
A museum could be set up at the Kuchino balashikha landfill, which was closed after complaints from residents about the Direct Line with the country's president.
"There was such an idea - to create a museum of recultivation of landfills near Moscow," - said the deputy chairman of the government - the Minister of Ecology and Natural Resources of the region Dmitry Kurakin.
Israel reports drone crash in southern Lebanon
An Israeli army drone has crashed in southern Lebanon.
The military said it collapsed "during operational activity."
The reasons for the fall of the apparatus are not reported.
"Some time ago, during operational activities near the border with Lebanon, an Israeli army drone crashed on Lebanese territory.
There is no risk of information leaking," the Israeli army said on Twitter.
Recall, this week the Israeli army decided to strengthen its military units on the border with Lebanon, fearing revenge of the Lebanese movement Hezbollah for the murders of its fighters in Syria.
Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah vowed not to leave unanswered the death of any of his "brothers."
More about the situation - in the Kommersant article "Israel is waiting for Hezbollah's revenge."
Furgal's replacement first came to the protesters
Mikhail Degtyarev, acting governor of Khabarovsk Krai, for the first time after his appointment went out to the participants of actions in support of the arrested ex-head of the region, Sergei Furgal.
The meeting was broadcast on his Instagram page.
"Moscow hears everyone, so I sent you a trio so that the region would not descend without power... I repeat once again about Furgal: he is "a" - my comrade, "b" - one-party, "c" - I am very worried about his fate,
According to Degtyarev, the Khabarovsk Territory cannot now remain without a leader, so he was appointed by President Vladimir Putin to the post of head of the region, so that "a wonderful building (the regional government) functions, everything works."
The acting governor explained that he had not gone to the protesters before because he could not communicate with thousands of demonstrators.
Therefore, he conducts broadcasts on social networks and reads all comments on them.
On July 25, two consecutive protests were held in Khabarovsk.
Rallies in support of the former governor have been held in the region since July 11.
On the eve of the next action, Mikhail Degtyarev announced that he would leave the city on the day of the rally.
His motorcade was stopped by protesters and called to speak about the fate of the arrested ex-governor of Furgal.
Degtyarev previously refused to come to the participants of the actions.
"There's more to do for the leader than to go out and talk to those screaming under the windows," the acting governor said.
Today I would like to show you how in the future we will do different things.
I believe that soon our buildings and machines will be self-assembling, will reproduce and repair themselves.
So I'm going to show you what I consider to be the current stage of industrial development, and then compare that with some natural systems.
So, at the current stage of industrial development, we have skyscrapers - 2.5 years, from 500,000 to a million parts, quite complex, new stunning technologies in steel, concrete and glass.
We have amazing machines that can take us into space - 5 years, 2.5 million parts.
But on the other hand, if you look at natural systems, we see proteins of two million species that can gather in 10,000 nanoseconds, or a DNA chain with three billion basic pairs that we can copy in one hour.
So, for all their complexity, natural systems are extremely efficient, far more efficient than anything we can build, far more complex than anything we can build.
They are much more energy efficient.
They almost never make a mistake.
And they can rebuild themselves over a long life.
So, there is something very interesting in natural systems.
And if we can move this into our man-made environment, our way of creating things will have tremendous potential.
And I think the key is self-assembly.
So, if we want to use self-assembly in our physical environment, I think four key factors need to be considered.
First: we need to decipher the complexity of what we want to build - our buildings and machines.
And we need to decompose them into a simple sequence - the basic DNA of construction processes.
Then we'll need programmable parts that can understand this sequence and use it to swerve or reassemble.
We will need a certain amount of energy, which will enable all this, make the parts able to assemble according to the program.
And we need some sort of back-up bug-fixing system to ensure we build what we want.
I'm going to show you some of the projects that we're working on with our EmAITi colleagues to achieve this self-assembling future.
The first two are MacroBot and DeciBot.
These are projects - large-scale reconfigurable robots - 2.5 and 3.5 meter proteins.
Mechanical electrical devices and sensors are built into them.
You paint what you want to roll into a sequence of angles - minus 120, minus 120, 0, 120, minus 120 - something like that; a sequence of angles or turns, and you send that sequence along the cord.
Each block receives its own message - minus 120. It turns this corner, checks if everything is correct and transmits information to a neighbor.
And these are brilliant scientists, engineers, designers who worked on this project.
And I think it actually reveals the question: Is there a different scale possible here?
I mean, thousands of dollars, lots of man hours to make this 2.5 meter robot.
Will we actually be able to scale up? Will we actually be able to integrate robotics into every part?
The next project solves this issue, considers a passive nature or tries to obtain a modified programability passively.
But he goes a step further and tries to get a real calculation.
At its core it has the most fundamental building block of computing, the logical element of a digital integrated circuit directly in each part.
It's an "I-NOT" element.
You have one tetrahedron, an element that will do all the calculations, and two tetrahedra for input.
One for inputting information by the user is the way you put bricks.
Another for information from the previous laid brick.
And then it displays information in three-dimensional space.
So this means that the user can start to move bricks in the right direction.
His calculations are based on what was done earlier and what you told him to do.
And now it starts moving in three-dimensional space - up or down.
On the left hand side, [1,1] input equals 0 at output, moving down.
On the right side, [0.0] input is 1 on output, which means upward movement.
And what really matters is that our structures now contain blueprints of what we want to build.
They contain all the information about what was built.
So that means we have some form of self-reproduction.
In this case, I call it self-managed reproduction because the structures contain clear blueprints.
If there are errors, you can replace the part.
All local information is saved so you know how to fix it.
So you may have something that moves and reads information and can pass it from one part to another.
It is built directly inside, without external control.
The latest project I'll show you is called Shifted Circuits, and this is perhaps the most exciting example of what we have now from passive self-assembling systems.
It combines the ability to reconfigure and program and creates a completely passive system.
At the core we have a chain of elements.
All elements are completely identical, and displaced.
So every chain or element wants to turn right or left.
And when you assemble the chain, you'll essentially program it.
You tell each block where it should turn: right or left.
So when you shake the chain, it folds into the configuration you programmed - in this case into a spiral, or in this case, two cubes next to each other.
So in general you can program any three-dimensional shape - or one-dimensional, two-dimensional - from these completely passive circuits.
So what does this tell us about the future?
I think it tells us that there are new opportunities for self-assembly, replication, repair in our physical structures, buildings, machines.
New software is possible in these parts.
And from here, you have new possibilities in computing.
We will have spatial computers.
Imagine that our buildings, bridges, cars, all our bricks could do calculations.
It's an amazing parallel and distributed computing power, new design features.
This is an incredible potential.
I think the projects I have shown you are only a small step towards the future if we introduce these new technologies, towards a new self-assembling future.
Thank you.

The number of deaths from coronavirus in the world exceeded 640 thousand
More than 15.7 million people infected
The number of coronavirus victims in the world has exceeded 640 thousand, almost 15.7 million cases of infection have been confirmed.
The World Health Organization (WHO) provides such data on Sunday, 26 July.
According to the information provided, during the past day, 200,625 new cases of coronavirus infection and 4,823 deaths were detected in the world.
Over the entire time, pandemics in the world have already recorded 15,785,641 cases of coronavirus infection, and the number of deaths has increased to 640,016.
The US remains the leader in the number of infected and dead, with more than 4.3 million infected and more than 149 thousand deaths already recorded.
In the second place of the anti-rating is Brazil, where the number of patients has now exceeded 2.4 million, and 86,500 patients with coronavirus have already died.
Next comes India, with 1.4 million infected and almost 33 thousand dead.
Recall, a day earlier, the number of people infected with coronavirus in the world within a day broke a new record.
In 24 hours, doctors identified 284,196 new cases.
The previous record was 247,225 infected.
what connected the Vatican and Nazi Germany
This week, the next date is 87 years since the conclusion of the treaty between the Vatican and Nazi Germany.
The document, signed a few months after Hitler came to power, became the basis on which the Holy See's relations with the fascists were built.
One of those preparing the treaty was Cardinal Pacelli, who six years before the outbreak of World War II became pontiff Pius XII.
In Sochi, the body of a dump truck crashed into the cab of a truck, killing the driver.
Footage has emerged online showing an accident that occurred last Saturday, July 25, at a construction site in Sochi.
The recording shows how, during the unloading operations, the lifted body of the dump truck collapsed down, hitting the cab of the truck directly.
According to the Emergencies Ministry, a 59-year-old man behind the wheel died on the spot from his injuries.
Rescue workers were needed to retrieve the body of the deceased.
Beautiful tall minarets only decorated Ayia Sofia
Once again, about Ayia-Sofia, the text of Fr. Vladimir Zelinsky came across, saying that it was necessary to protest.
First, there was a free entrance - hurrah!
I wasn't in Istanbul, but free entry to the House of God is better than paid entry.
Secondly, Muslims have just as honestly conquered this land as the Orthodox have conquered the Volga-Oka River, the Muslim Caucasus (and set up a church in Grozny) and planted apple trees on Mars.
God help!
Jews conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans conquered America.
Will we return everything to everyone?
Do you think there will be no pagans who will demand the return of their capitol, in the place of which the Tenth Church?
Third, Muslims improved the building and invested in it.
That is, they, like the factories and estates that the Leninists took from the bourgeoisie into their own ownership, belong to the Leninists - to Putin and other nomenclature.
They have improved everything - from the Kremlin to Angara, so it's all of them rightfully progressives.
Beautiful tall minarets have very decorated Ayia Sofia, very.
There was a silly ink, there was a silly ink with beautiful minarets.
Fourth, there are no "Islamic" or "Orthodox" civilizations.
There are believers, there are hypocrites, there are hanjis who combine faith and hypocrisy.
A believer in the categories of civilization does not think.
This is the thinking of a British Foreign Office official, Toynbee, who is ashamed to think so.
And to the believer everywhere is the place of prayer.
And always.
The believer does not pray only where he is asked to leave - he is removed to another place and prays there.
He is a believer, not an advocate.
We are cowboys, not grim stones.
The working week in St. Petersburg will begin with warm and dry weather

This was reported in the press service of the Ministry of Emergency Situations for the city, citing the forecast of the North-Western Department of Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring.
A variable wind at a speed of 1-4 meters per second is expected at night.
In the afternoon, southeast wind at a speed of 2-7 meters per second.
The air temperature at night will be +13... +15 degrees.
During the day it will warm up to +24... +26 degrees.
The atmospheric pressure will increase during the day.
Camera 'passed under ship' during Navy Day parade broadcast
Also on Victory Day, the camera flew through the barrel of a tank
Today, July 26, a parade in honor of the Day of the Navy is held in St. Petersburg.
During the filming, one of the cameras filming the equipment "went under the ship."
The use of new shooting technology allowed viewers to see the underwater part of the parade.
In the same perspective, the course of the newest serial small rocket ship "Sovetsk" was shown.
It passed along the Admiralty Embankment.
Recall, at the parade on June 24, dedicated to the 75th anniversary of the Victory, the camera passed through the barrel into the tower of one of the tanks and showed what equipment is inside the grandiose military vehicle.
Then, a record number of military equipment - 234 combat vehicles took part in the anniversary parade of the Victory.
We showed a lot of novelties that went to the main square of the country for the first time, for example, modernized main battle tanks T-90M and T-80BMW.
On June 24, for the first time, updated BMP-2M infantry fighting vehicles with the Berezhok combat module also passed through Red Square.
Almost half of Britons believe in Kremlin interference in Brexit referendum
Almost half of Britons - 49% - believe that Russia tried to influence the course of the 2016 referendum on the UK's exit from the European Union.
The Guardian writes about this, citing the results of a survey conducted by Opinium.
It is reported that 23% of respondents hold the opposite opinion on this issue.
47% of respondents also believe that the Kremlin interfered in the last general election in the UK in 2019.
July will go with the heat, August will start with the cool
Over the weekend, Moscow and the region experienced the coldest night of July.
Of course, no freezing apocalypse of the soul and body happened.
But for the top of the summer - shaky.
Before you talk about the weather in Moscow on July 27 - August 2, 2020, it is worth noting that on the night of Saturday, July 25, the air in the capital cooled to +8.8 degrees.
Kolomna even set a new temperature record: +7 degrees (the previous minimum for July 25 has been held since 1964, more than half a century).
Cherusti became the cold pole outside Moscow - thermometers showed + 3.9 degrees there.
However, both Saturday and Sunday were quite comfortable.
Although compared to climate norms, it is still 2 to 3 degrees cooler.
On working days, the real heat will not just return to Moscow.
On Monday, July 27, the Russian Hydrometer Center promises +26 degrees, on Tuesday and Wednesday +28...+29, on Thursday, July 30, +26 degrees.
Short rains - every day, in the middle of the week with thunderstorms.
The last day of July and the first days of August (that is, next weekend) will be cool, not higher than +19... +24 degrees.
And it won't do without precipitation.
Rwandan man admits setting fire to Nantes cathedral
A Rwandan national who volunteered at St. Peter and Paul's Cathedral in the French city of Nantes confessed to setting it on fire a week after the fire.
This was reported on Sunday by France-3 TV channel.
According to him, the man, who was already detained on July 19, the day after the fire, was detained again the day before.
He appeared before an investigating judge on Saturday evening.
After being charged with wilful damage to property, the man admitted organising arson at three locations - under a large organ, under a small organ and near an electrical shield.
Now he faces up to 10 years in prison and a 150,000 euro fine.
The motive of the 39-year-old from Rwanda has not yet been reported.
It is only known that he voluntarily assisted in the cathedral and on the day of the fire had to close its doors.
However, according to CCTV footage, he left the religious institution 15 minutes after receiving calls about a fire in the building.
The fire in the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul occurred on July 18.
More than 200 firefighters fought for several hours for the Gothic architecture monument.
However, they were unable to save the stained glass windows from the times of Louis XII and the unique Baroque organ.
The situation was brought under control only three hours after the fire started.
No one was injured as a result of the incident.
The current fire is not the first in the history of the temple.
In 1972, a fire destroyed its roof.
It took 13 years to eliminate the consequences of that fire.
For parishioners, the cathedral was reopened only in 1985.
The legendary goalkeeper-traveler Pfannenstiel can become an Inter scout.
Former German goalkeeper Lutz Pfannenstiel may join Inter's headquarters.
According to Kicker, the 47-year-old was offered the position of head of the Scout Department.
Pfannenstiel held a similar position at Fortuna from Düsseldorf from December 2018 to May 2020, and previously worked at Hoffenheim.
As a footballer, Pfannenstiel became famous for his frequent transitions.
He is the only professional player to have played in all six FIFA confederations and has replaced more than 20 clubs, including champions from Singapore, South Africa, New Zealand, Canada, Namibia and other countries.
It is believed that behind the wheel of a car can only be sighted people.
Until recently, it was believed that for the blind, safe and independent driving is an impossible task.
Hello, I am Dennis Hong, and we give the blind freedom and independence by developing a car for the visually impaired.
Before talking about this car for the blind, I will briefly talk about another project I worked on, called the DARPA Urban Challenge.
The project was to create a self-driving robot car.
The driver presses "start" and without his participation the car reaches its destination.
In 2007, our team won half a million dollars, finishing third in this competition.
Around the same time, the National Federation of the Blind, or NSF, tasked the research committee with developing a vehicle that can be independently and safely operated by the blind.
We decided to try our hand because we thought,  ⁇ Hey, what's that difficult?
We already have an autonomous car.
Let's put a blind man in it - and it's all over, right?"
(Laughter) But we are deeply mistaken.
The NFS wanted not just a car that would transport the blind, but a car that the blind person could independently drive.
So we had to take it all off and start from scratch.
So, to test this crazy idea, we developed a small car buggy prototype to test the feasibility of the project.
And in the summer of 2009, we invited blind youth from all corners of the country and gave them the opportunity to test this car.
It was an amazing experience.
But the catch is that this car was designed to operate in a strictly controlled environment, namely in a level closed parking lot, where even lanes are limited by red signal cones.
Due to this success, we decided to take the next big step and develop a real car that could be driven on real roads.
So how does it work?
Well, it's quite a complex system, but let me explain, perhaps even simplify it.
So, it includes three components.
It is tactile perception, calculation and non-visual interfaces.
Since the driver can't see anything, the system needs to understand the environment and gather information for the driver.
An initial parameter meter is used for this.
It measures acceleration, angular acceleration, like a person's inner ear.
This information is then transmitted to a GPS device to assess the location of the vehicle.
Two cameras are used to detect lane on the road
and three laser rangefinders.
Lasers scan the space around the car to detect various objects: an approaching oncoming or overtaking car, any obstacles encountered on the road or around the car.
Then all this huge amount of information is fed into the computer and the computer performs two steps.
First of all, it is processing this information to get an idea of the space: identifying lanes on the road, identifying obstacles, and then communicating this information to the driver.
The system is also smart enough to calculate the safest way to drive a car.
So, we can also give advice on how to operate the machine.
But the problem is, how do you convey this information and instructions to an blind person who does not have the quick and accurate response needed to drive?
For this purpose, we have developed a number of interface technologies for the blind:
A 3D ping sound system, a vibrating vest, a steering wheel with sound signals, a special foot prosthesis, and even shoes that put pressure on the leg.
But today we will only talk about three types of these special interfaces.
The first interface is called DriveGrip.
This is a pair of gloves with motors on the joints of the fingers, instructing the driver how to drive: direction and corner.
Another device is SpeedStrip.
Initially it is a massage chair.
Vibration is used to transmit speed information to the driver, as well as to guide the use of gas and brake pedals.
So, here you can see how the computer perceives the space around the car. And since the vibration cannot be seen, red LEDs are installed on the driver to demonstrate the process.
This is sensory data, which is transmitted to devices through a computer.
DriveGrip and SpeedStrip devices are very efficient.
But the problem is that these are training prompts.
They don't actually give freedom of control, do they?
The onboard computer gives the driver commands: "left", "right", "add speed", "stop".
We call him "an annoying passenger from the back seat."
So we are moving away from learning prompts and focusing on information devices.
An excellent example of such an interface is AirPix.
This is a kind of monitor for the blind.
A small panel with many holes through which compressed air enters, thereby creating images.
A blind person can bring his palm to this panel and "see" the lanes on the roadway and obstacles.
The driver can also change the frequency with which the air comes out and possibly the temperature of the air.
That is, it is an interface for displaying multidimensional data.
So, here you see the left and right camera of the car, and how the computer processes and sends this information to the AirPix panel.
Here we demonstrate a simulator, a blind man driving a car using AirPix.
This simulator proved to be very useful for training blind drivers, as well as for quickly checking ideas on the use of different types of special interfaces.
That's how this system works in short.
After all, this is a prototype car for the blind. And it will not be released on the roadway until they are convinced of its absolute safety.
And I truly believe this is likely.
Still, will society accept such a radical idea?
How much will auto insurance rules change?
On what conditions will the driver's license be issued?
Beyond the technological challenges, there are so many pitfalls that must be overcome before this becomes a reality.
Of course, the main goal of this project is to develop a car for the blind.
However, it is possible that the spin-off technologies developed during this project will be an invaluable contribution to our lives.
Our sensors work regardless of the time of day, fog and rain.
We can use these technologies together with new special interfaces to improve the safety of cars for the blind.
Or for the blind. Find them use in everyday appliances, in educational institutions, in offices.
Just imagine: a teacher in the classroom writes on a blackboard, and a blind student can see and read what is written using these special interfaces.
This is priceless.
So what I showed you today is just the beginning.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Bill & T's second trailer with Kianu Reeves released
The second trailer for the third part of the "Bill and Ted" franchise appeared on the YouTube channel of the Orion Pictures film studio.
The trailer reveals some details from the current life of budding friends: they settled in a suburban area, married to their girlfriends Joanne (Jaime Mays) and Elizabeth (Erinn Hayes) from "Nevergreen"
Brigitte Landy-Pain ("Glass Castle," "Atypical") plays Billy, Ted's daughter, and Samara Weaving ("I'm going to look for") is Thea, Bill's daughter (yes, Bill and Ted named their daughters Billy and Thea, such a wo).
On top of that, another great adventure awaits them: they must get into the future to steal their own song - only in this way can they save the world.
The trailer also features American rapper Kid Cudi and William Sadler (August Rush, Death Against, Green Mile) reprise the role of Death.
The film was originally scheduled for release on August 21, but was pushed back to September 1.
It is reported that the creators do not plan to reschedule the release date of the film.
The picture will also immediately be available online.
Earlier we wrote that Kianu Reeves would become a writer of comics about the demigod Berserk.
I want you to think for a second that almost all of our knowledge of the universe is derived from light.
We stand on Earth and see stars in the night sky with the naked eye.
The bright Sun can burn the retina of the eye,
but we see the same light in the reflection of the Moon.
Since the time of Galileo observing celestial bodies in his primitive telescope, we have been contemplating the universe through light passing through the endless ages of cosmic history.
With the help of modern telescopes, we were able to collect a stunning silent film about the universe, covering our entire history up to the Big Bang.
However, cinema is not without sound, because the universe is not soundless.
I want to prove to you that the Universe has its own soundtrack, and it is  ⁇ played ⁇  by the cosmos itself, because outer space vibrates like a drum.
It carries distinctive sounds that accompany the brightest events as they occur.
Today, we would like to complement the luxurious visual image of the universe we have with a soundtrack.
So far, we have never heard sounds from space, but in the near future we should listen carefully to what is happening there.
So, in order to record the "song" of the universe, we focused on black holes as the most promising objects, because they "beat" in space-time like a bell, and give a characteristic sound.
Maybe one day we'll see the shadow that a black hole casts out against a bright background, but we haven't seen that yet.
However, a black hole, even if invisible, can be heard as it "beats" in space-time like a drum.
The assumption that space is like a drum membrane belongs to Albert Einstein, to whom we owe so much.
Einstein concluded that if space were empty, if the universe were empty, it would look like this drawing, except, of course, such a visual grid.
If we were to fall freely through space, even without a convenient coordinate grid, we could mentally picture it ourselves, since we would notice that we are moving in a straight line, strictly in a straight line through the universe.
Einstein also realized  ⁇  and this is the bottom line  ⁇  that if you put energy or mass into the universe, it will lead to a warp of space, and a free-falling object will bend around, for example, the Sun, slanting along the curiosities.
This was Einstein's great general theory of relativity.
Even light curves along such a trajectory.
The deflection can be so strong that the object will simply get into orbit, and spin around the sun like the Earth, or like the Moon around the Earth.
These are natural curvature in space.
But Einstein didn't understand it - if we take our Sun and compress it to 6 kilometers in diameter, that is, a mass 1 million times heavier than the Earth to fit in an object not with a diameter of 6 km, then you will have a black hole with a black hole.
However, he always regarded black holes as mere mathematical curiosity.
Einstein did not believe they existed in reality.
He believed that nature itself should protect us from their appearance.
Decades passed before the term "black hole" was invented, and people realized that they were real astrophysical objects  ⁇  in fact, they were very massive stars in a post-mortem state, catastrophically collapsing.
Our Sun will not turn into a black hole.
Its mass is not enough for this.
But we'll do a little thought experiment,  ⁇  Einstein loved them very much  ⁇  and imagine how the Sun shrinks to 6 kilometers in diameter, and a tiny Earth revolves around it, roughly 30 to 30 miles across.
This Earth is shining, the Sun is no longer there, as is another light source, so let's make our little Earth self-luminous.
It turns out we can place Earth in a very close orbit, just 30 km from this black hole.
It is not much larger than Manhattan.
Perhaps it would have hooked up a little bit to Hudson before destroying Earth.
But the scale is about that.
We are talking about an object that would occupy approximately 1/2 of the area of Manhattan.
So, by placing this Earth very close  ⁇  just 30 km away  ⁇  we will notice that it perfectly revolves around a black hole.
This is a kind of myth that black holes absorb everything indiscriminately - to get into it, you need to come very close.
But what is striking is that from our point of view we will see the Earth all the time.
It cannot hide behind a black hole.
Some of the light that the Earth emits is absorbed by the hole, but some of it seems to be around it and coming back to us.
So that nothing can be hidden behind a black hole.
If you suddenly get into the Star Cruiser series "The Galaxy" and fight the Cylons, don't hide behind a black hole.
They will see you!
Our Sun will not turn into a black hole  ⁇  for this it is not massive enough. But there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
And if one of them blocked the Milky Way, that's how it would look.
We would see the shadow of a black hole amid hundreds of billions of stars and glowing dust.
If we were on the verge of falling into this black hole, we would see all this light around it, and even entering this shadow, would not notice the near catastrophe.
It would be useless to start the engines and try to get out, because nothing, including light, can escape from it.
Although the black hole looks like it from the outside, it is not dark inside, as all the light falls into it with us.
According to the relativistic effect known as time stretching, our clock would seem to slow down relative to all-galactic time, but we would instead see the evolution of the galaxy in an accelerated mode a moment before the death of the hole inside.
It would be like a near-death experience where you see the light at the end of the tunnel, but not 'near' but absolutely mortal.
(Laughter) And you won't tell anyone about the light at the end of the tunnel.
Scientists have not yet been able to see the shadow of a black hole, but we can hear it, even if it is invisible.
Let's imagine a real astrophysical situation - two black holes that have lived together a long life.
They may have been stars at first and then turned into black holes, each 10 times heavier than the Sun.
We will burn them up to 60 km in diameter.
They can rotate quickly: hundreds of revolutions per second.
At the end of their life cycle, they revolve around each other at almost the speed of light.
They cover thousands of kilometres in a fraction of a second, and not only curve space in this way, but also leave behind a trail: they cause oscillations, a wave trace in space-time.
Space shrinks and stretches, freeing itself from these black holes oscillating in the universe.
And they travel through space at the speed of light.
This computer simulation was done by Goddard's group at NASA studying relativity.
For almost 30 years, scientists around the world have fought over this problem.
It was one of the groups.
You see two black holes spinning around each other  ⁇  and again here the curves are clearly depicted.
If you see - a little pale turned out - they emit red waves, gravitational waves.
These are the sounds of vibrating space, and they will come from these black holes at the speed of light, as long as they subside and merge into one rotating, silent black hole  ⁇  that is the outcome.
If you were standing close enough, your ear would resonate as you squeeze and stretch space.
You would actually hear the sound.
Of course, and your head would shrink and stretch, so you would be hard pressed to understand what is going on.
But I would like to lose you that sound, as we predict it.
This is the work of my group, so the schedule here is more modest.
Imagine a light black hole falling into a very heavy one.
The sound you hear is emitted by a light hole, bending the space, approaching step by step towards the end.
If it is removed, the sound becomes quieter.
But it is like a hammer  ⁇ hitting ⁇  into space that vibrates like a membrane.
And we can predict what that sound will be like.
We know that as the hole sinks, it gets faster and louder.
In the end we will hear how a small hole just falls into a big one.
I haven't heard the record so loud yet - really, quite impressive.
At home it turns out to be much more modest.
Just quiet clicks.
It's a different sound created by my band.
Here I don't show you a picture, as black holes leave no visible marks, there are no visible curves in space.
If you went on a space cruise and heard that sound, I would recommend flying away as soon as possible.
(Laughter) Away from that sound.
Both black holes move.
They approach each other.
In this case, they are both very hesitant.
And now there will be a merger.
This "scratching" is very typical of merging black holes, this is the acceleration at the end.
We assume that would sound like that.
Fortunately, we are now at a safe distance, in Long Beach in California.
Undoubtedly, somewhere in the universe two black holes merge.
And no doubt the space around us is vibrating, and these oscillations may have passed millions of light years, that is, a million years moving towards us at the speed of light.
But the sound is too quiet, we can't hear it.
There is today a very complex project: LIGO (Laser-Interferometric Gravitational-wave Observatory) - it tracks deviations in the oscillations of space, the smallest - by the size of the nucleus of an atom by 4 kilometers.
This is an extremely ambitious experiment, and over the next few years it will focus on capturing such waves.
There is also a space programme planned, which I hope will be launched in the next 10 years: LIKA (Laser Interferometric Space Antenna).
It will be able to see super-heavy black holes, millions and billions of times more massive than the Sun.
In this Hubble Space Telescope image, we see two galaxies.
They look as if they were frozen in some kind of  ⁇ embrace, ⁇
and each probably contains a super-heavy black hole in its core.
But they have not frozen. In fact, they are merging.
These two black holes collide, and it will last for more than a billion years.
It is beyond our perception to hear a song of such duration.
But the lick may see the finale of a merger of two super-heavy black holes that began very long ago: the last 15 minutes of this action.
We are not only talking about black holes, but also about any serious mess in the universe, and the most important of them is the Big Bang.
When this expression was coined, it was ironic - "say, who will believe in the Big Bang?"
This animation from my friend from Proton Studios shows the Big Bang from the outside.
Any observer would like to be inside at this moment, because it is impossible to be outside the universe.
Imagine you're inside the Big Bang.
It is everywhere around you, and space vibrates chaotically.
14 billion years have passed, and this song still sounds around us.
Galaxies are born, and generations of stellar forms are born in them. And around one star, at least one, there is an inhabited planet.
And here we are persistently conducting these experiments, doing calculations, writing programs.
Imagine a billion years ago two black holes collided.
All the while, their song sounds in space.
We haven't even come to light yet.
The sound is getting closer and closer  ⁇  40,000 years ago, we are still making rock drawings.
If we were going to "hear" the Big Bang, it would sound like this.
Noise in its purest form.
It's white noise, just chaotic sounds.
But it probably surrounds us everywhere, unless it has been silenced by some other process in the universe.
And if we catch it, it will be the most pleasant music for us, because it is a quiet echo of the moment of our creation, the birth of the observable universe.
Over the next few years, we'll be able to add a bit of volume, and hear the universe in sound.
But if we catch echoes of those early events, it will bring us much closer to understanding the Big Bang, and it will already allow us to ask some of the most difficult, elusive questions.
Scrolling back and forth through the film about our universe, we learn that there was a Big Bang in the past, and maybe we'll even hear its cacophony, but was this explosion the only one?
I mean, hasn't it happened before?
Will it not happen again?
In the spirit of TED calling us to give back our faith in miracles, we can now ask questions that have always eluded us.
But we have to ask: is it possible that our universe is just a trace of some more significant history?
Or  ⁇  aren't we just one of the branches of the multiverse  ⁇  each of which has had its Big Bang in the past? Maybe with black holes and their  ⁇ songs ⁇ , or maybe without them, maybe with a reasonable life, but maybe with a reasonable life?
We will ask  ⁇  in such a multiverse, in its other branches, is there life?
Here are my brothers in the multiverse.
But are there other creatures out there that are thinking about us, and their origins?
And, if they are, I can imagine them doing calculations, like us, building instruments, trying to detect the faint sound of the moment of their creation, and thinking  ⁇  who else is there but us?
Thank you. Thank you.
(Applause)
Minneapolis residents create squads to patrol streets
The Wall Street Journal reports: detachments are being set up in Minneapolis to patrol the streets.
Local residents want to help the guards.
Some of the guards have weapons with them.
Armed citizens assure: they will not open fire, it is possible only in case of extreme necessity.
According to journalists, the creation of patrols is associated with a reduction in the police budget.
Law enforcement agencies will receive $10 million less per year (this amount can be reduced).
The previous law enforcement budget was $193 million.
The Minneapolis City Council made this decision in connection with the death of George Floyd and rallies against police brutality over the past two months.

Earlier, the Moscow "Dynamo" presented the form for next season.
City and Real Madrid will be able to play the return match of the 1/8 final of the Champions League in Manchester
The British newspaper The Guardian reports that Manchester City and Real Madrid will still be able to play the return match of the 1/8 final of the Champions League in Manchester at the Etihad Stadium on August 7.
Yesterday, on July 25, the UK government adopted a ruling that all people arriving in the UK from Spain are required to undergo a 14-day quarantine due to a new outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.
An exception will be made for Real, however.
The possibility of easing quarantine rules for sports teams and film crews was previously announced by the Secretary of the UK Ministry of Culture, Oliver Dowden.
In February, Real lost 1 ⁇ 2 to Manchester City.
The return match is scheduled for August 7.
The presidents of Russia and Ukraine discussed the implementation of the ceasefire in Donbass
Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky discussed the implementation of the ceasefire agreements in Donbass, reached during the Normandy summit in December 2019, the press service of the Kremlin and the office of the president of Ukraine reported.
The telephone conversation between Vladimir Putin and Vladimir Zelensky took place at the initiative of the Ukrainian side, the Kremlin press service claims.
The two sides welcomed the agreement reached at a meeting of the Minsk Contact Group on July 22 on a full and comprehensive ceasefire regime in the Donbas, which starts from 00:01 on July 27, 2020; the Russian President supported this agreement before.
The leaders agreed on the need for urgent implementation of additional measures to support the ceasefire in the Donbas.
At the same time, Putin criticized the decision adopted by the Verkhovna Rada on July 15 to organize local elections in the fall, which, according to the Russian side, ignores the Minsk agreement.
The situation in connection with the coronavirus pandemic was also discussed.
The July 22 agreement calls for a complete repudiation of all military activities, including reconnaissance, the sending of sabotage and reconnaissance groups, and sniper warfare.
Tinkoff shown video of bone marrow transplant
Russian entrepreneur, founder of the Tinkoff group, Oleg Tinkov, posted a video on which he told how he received a bone marrow transplant.
Let us recall that the businessman is fighting leukemia.
On the record, the businessman lies in the ward, the bone marrow is transplanted using a dropper.
Tinkov noted that the donor material is also being taken away.
"The skull is not cut," he added.
Judging by his posture during the operation, he feels comfortable and relaxed.
His donor was a girl from Germany.
The businessman expressed regret that there are only 130,000 bone marrow donors in Russia, while there are about 8 million in Germany.
Oleg Tinkou received a bone marrow transplant at a London clinic.
It became known about the destruction of Russian "Pantsir" in Ethiopia
Two Russian-made Panzir-S1 anti-aircraft missile systems, which were in service with the Ethiopian army, were destroyed.
This became known to the Telegram channel "Military Observer" on Sunday, July 26.
According to the channel, two vehicles that provided security for the Hydase hydroelectric plant on the Blue Nile River were put out of action by lightning.
No other details of the incident are given.
In May, Turkey's Anadolu Agency reported the destruction of nine Russian-made Panzir-S1 air defense systems in Libya.
They belonged to the forces of the Commander of the Libyan National Army (LNA) Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar and were destroyed with the help of Turkish tactical multi-purpose unmanned aerial systems Bayraktar TB2.
Then Defense Express called the incident "a real genocide."
Another Panzer-C1 in Libya was destroyed by a drone strike in early July.
In Warsaw, 1.5 thousand people are evacuated because of a bomb

Putin spoke to Shoigu in the cabin:
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke with Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of the Navy Nikolai Yevmenov.
The relevant footage was published by journalists from the Kremlin pool RIA Novosti on their Telegram channel on Sunday, July 26.
The short meeting took place in the cabin of the boat, where the head of state, together with Shoigu and Yevmenov, was heading to the parade of ships in the Gulf of Finland ahead of a parade timed to coincide with the Day of the Russian Navy.
They exchanged a couple of phrases while sitting at the table.
Earlier it was reported that Putin arrived in Kronstadt to participate in the celebrations.
From there, the president headed to St. Petersburg, where he is to host a holiday parade.
On July 26, parades are held across Russia to mark the Navy Day.
The main naval parade takes place in St. Petersburg.
It involves more than 4,000 troops, 46 ships, submarines and boats, as well as naval aviation.
In one of the Tyumen publics, there was a call to take part in the action "Buy from your grandmother."
Organizers are calling to buy from the grandmother vegetables, flowers and berries that they grew in their gardens, and not to bargain.
The author of the post even gave an example, indicating the specific address at which the grandmother sells cherries.
But Tyumen residents suddenly erupted in angry comments.
She saw how a merchant from neighboring countries approached her immediately and gave a new portion of goods "from her grandmother's garden" for sale.
Look carefully what you buy!!! - Nadezhda Grigoryeva shared her observations.
I saw more than once when greens were taken from merchants from neighboring countries and sold.
There is no trust, Larisa Harlamova agreed.
It's been a long time, I look, grandma's Victoria has a "glitter," and we haven't got a glitter in our garden, I ask: "Is it from your garden?"
"Yes!"
I bought a taste of a rag, well, not a fresh vegetable garden, then I look at these "yes" on every corner, my grandmother deceived me, I took it from someone to implement it, - Tatiana Krasilnikova told about her experience.
At the same time, users emphasize that they are not urged not to shop from their grandparents, but only share their opinion and advise to pay attention to the quality of products.

In Irkutsk, the plane made a forced landing
In Irkutsk, a plane on a Moscow-Ulan-Ude flight made a forced landing because of a smoke-filled passenger.
According to RIA Novosti, the incident occurred on Sunday night.
The plane stayed at Irkutsk airport for 25 minutes while the man who posed a threat to flight safety was handed over to police.
Before take-off, the plane was carefully checked for smoldering ash.
All costs for forced parking will be charged from the passenger who smoked.
Earlier, a man was detained at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport who staged a debacle on board the plane.
The passenger of the Kaliningrad-Moscow flight also smoked during the flight and did not react to the comments.
Later, at the sight of police officers who came to remove the offender from the plane, the deboshire arranged a scandal and broke his passport.

The decision to expand the RPL would not have been supported by either UEFA or FIFA
The president of the Russian Football Union (RFS), Alexander Dyukov, believes that it is wrong to expand the Russian Premier League (RPL) to 18 teams at the moment.
"First of all, it was a decision of the RPL, but I will agree with it, as it is wrong to change the rules after the tournament is over.
This violates the integrity of the tournament and the sporting principle.
And, of course, this decision would not have been supported by either UEFA or FIFA, "Dukov said after the final of the Russian Cup Zenit - Khimki (1:0).
Currently, there are 16 clubs in the RPL, but an option was considered to increase the number of teams to 18.
More than a hundred Russians returned home from Yerevan on export flights
More than a hundred Russians who could not leave Armenia amid the spread of the coronavirus returned home on export flights.
This was reported in the press service of the Russian Embassy in Yerevan on Sunday, July 26.
"We are pleased to report that on July 26, 106 Russians were able to return home on Yerevan-Rostov-on-Don flights," TASS quoted the report as saying.
The embassy noted that the process of registering and boarding passengers on the flight was coordinated by diplomats.
In total, since the introduction of restrictions on flights, 2,822 Russian citizens have been removed from Armenia.
At the same time, on July 24, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin announced the opening of air links with a number of countries from August 1.
Kirilenko shared memories of playing with Bryant and Jordan in the NBA
Head of the Russian Basketball Federation (RFB) Andrei Kirilenko shared his memories of his games against the legendary Kobi Bryant and Michael Jordan in matches of the National Basketball Association (NBA).
I knew that Bryant's self-indulgence couldn't be hurt by a thrash-talk to discourage his sports rage.
Kobi had a killer instinct, so I tried to talk him out of the game in an aggressive way on the court.
On the platform I gave him compliments: "Oh!
Koby, scored well, a great pass!
Listening to my enthusiastic responses, he almost forgot that it is necessary to take the ball once again and score another 3 - 4 points.
We communicated well with Kobi," Kirilenko quotes Evening Moscow as saying.
He also spoke about his first game against Jordan.

Degtyarev surprised by information about Sakhalin-1 gas purchase for dollars
Acting Governor of Khabarovsk Krai Mikhail Degtyarev on Sunday, July 26, during a meeting with residents of Soviet Havana, was surprised that the region was buying Sakhalin gas produced by Exxon.
American gas is contracted in dollars until 2025.
"To be honest, I didn't know it, and I am in such a knockdown because of this information.
I didn't even have an idea what is still possible in 2020 in Russia," RIA Novosti quotes him as saying.
Degtyarev noted that this issue was discussed with the head of the Russian Ministry of Energy, Alexander Novak, during his visit to Khabarovsk on July 24.
The acting governor also stressed that by 2025, Gazprom will switch to supplying Russian thermal power plants and facilities, which means that Russian gas purchased in rubles "at normal prices" will be used.
The Sakhalin-1 project is being implemented through a production sharing agreement, where Exxon Neftegas Ltd is the operator of the project with a 30% stake, Rosneft has another 20%, Japan's Sodeco has 30% and India's ONGC has 20%.
Khabarovsk Krai has been acquiring gas from this project since 2005.

Russian TV actor responds to accusations of 'LGBT propaganda and feminism'
The actor of the Russian TV series Chiki, whose creators have been accused of "propaganda of LGBT and feminism," has responded to the film's claims.
The authors "understood the urgency of the issues raised and did not want to offend anyone," American Stephen Thomas Oxner said in an interview with The Rise.
"It seems to me that this is a story about the power and general aspects of human life.
This has nothing to do with LGBT and feminism," said the actor, who played the father of a boy who dressed in women's clothing.
He stressed that he was "proud of the work" and did not consider it propaganda.
At the same time, added the American, he is frightened by the reaction of some people to the storyline of the series: for example, there was a case when "a person in a deep breath shot a film set and said that it was all untrue."
"Then on a couple of occasions we met disgruntled locals who didn't understand what we were doing.
But we were open, so the people who first came forward with claims began to help us," he concluded.
The shooting incident, the publication explains, occurred in September 2019 in Kabardino-Balkaria: a drunk man attacked a vehicle of a film crew with a weapon, after which he was detained by police officers.
Earlier it was reported that the public commissioner for the protection of the family, Olga Baranets, sent a complaint to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Roskomnadzor against the more.tv service that hosted the Russian series "Chiki."
Baranez accused the creators of the series of "propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations and feminism," drawing attention to the fact that the main characters of the film work as prostitutes, and the series itself contains "scenes of physical and psychological violence."
The ombudsman was also outraged that "a lot of attention was paid in the series to the homosexual sexual orientation" of the minor character.
The comedy drama "Chiki" tells about three prostitutes who started a new life and opened a business on the advice of a friend.
