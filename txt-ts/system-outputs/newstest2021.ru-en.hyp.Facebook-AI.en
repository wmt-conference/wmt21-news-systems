There is no need to demonize the people of Khabarovsk
The acting head of the Khabarovsk region spoke about his trip to the region in an exclusive interview with Komsomolskaya Pravda
The acting governor of the Khabarovsk Territory, Mikhail Degtyarev, urged in an interview with Komsomolskaya Pravda columnist Alexander Gamov not to demonize Khabarovsk residents amid rallies in support of the arrested former head of the region, Sergey Furgal.
I want to appeal to all political commentators, political scientists, participants in all kinds of talk shows.
Do not demonize the people of the Khabarovsk Territory.
Hardworking and wonderful people live here, - said Mikhail Degtyarev.
In an interview, Degtyarev recalled that he is a member of the LDPR and a member of Furgal's party and added that he wishes him luck in court, and the party and Vladimir Zhirinovsky personally will support him in court.
The full text of the interview is published on the KP.ru website.
Earlier, the website KP.ru reported that Mikhail Degtyarev called for an open trial of Sergey Furgal and considers it fair to hold it in Khabarovsk.
Two Mexican states put on alert for Hurricane Hanna
The Mexican National Office of Civil Defense has declared an "orange" (high) level of alert in the two eastern states of Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon due to the approaching Hurricane Hanna, TASS reports.
The hurricane will bring heavy rainfall to Mexico, with 150 to 250 liters of rain per square meter predicted in some areas.
The authorities have prepared about 800 shelters for the population.
10 thousand people, including rescuers, soldiers of the National Guard and the military will help people.
At the moment, the hurricane has reached the coast of the US state of Texas with wind speeds of 150 km/h.
Hannah is expected to arrive in Mexico on Sunday morning.
Semilarski against the prosecutor's office: the appeal of the former deputy mayor of Tartu will be considered on August 4
This means that a decision on it is likely to be made in early September.
The courts of the first two instances refused to consider Semilarski's claim, but in April his appeal was accepted by the State Court.
On 12 December 2019, the Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the applicant, as its resolution does not fall within its competence as an administrative court.
The court ruling stated that the complaint contained a claim for damages caused in the course of criminal proceedings.
"It is up to the prosecutor's office and the county court to regulate such matters," Anette Kreitsmann, spokeswoman for the Tartu courts, explained to ERR earlier.
According to her, Valvo Semilarski appealed the ruling to the district court, which on February 5 did not change the decision of the court of first instance.
Now Gossud will have his say.
According to Semilarski's defense attorney, sworn lawyer Oliver Njaes, his client was unjustifiably suspected of bribery for about two years.
He is now demanding that the prosecutor's office refute the false allegations against him and compensate him for moral damages.
The reason for filing the complaint with the court was the statements made by the prosecutor for special cases of the Lõuna District Prosecutor's Office, Margus Gross, in October 2017, when Semilarski, together with another deputy mayor of Tartu at the time, Artem Suvorov, was detained on suspicion of committing several crimes.
"Let's recall that when I was detained, the Security Police and the Prosecutor's Office immediately organized a press conference and informed the entire Republic of Estonia that the leaders of Tartu - one of the most influential local government bodies - are corrupt.
These public suspicions, hanging in the air, accompanied me for about two years.
And now that these allegations and suspicions have turned out to be false, the prosecutor's office does not want to say anything about it," Semilarski commented in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Njaes, at the press conference, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework in which the prosecutor's office should operate.
"The allegation of bribery and corruption turned out to be false, but that is not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its rulings on Russia, as well as on Lithuania, that at the investigation stage, state representatives should be careful in their choice of words, so that suspects are not presented as criminals before sentencing.
The prosecutor's office is also obliged to do so by the presumption of innocence, which, unfortunately, was not respected in this case against Valvo Semilarski," said Näes.
"The public presentation of Semilarski as a serious offender and bribe-taker, in circumstances where the facts underlying the suspicion of bribery are still being clarified, is unacceptable, contrary to the presumption of innocence and unfair to the complainant," the lawyer added.
According to rus.err.ee, the former vice-mayor of Tartu, Valvo Semilarski, will not be prosecuted on charges of bribery - the criminal case against him was partially closed in July.
At the same time, the former official is being tried on charges of knowingly violating anti-corruption legislation during large-scale transactions.
According to the indictment, between 2015 and 2017, the former deputy mayor of Tartu participated more than thirty times in meetings of the city council when making decisions related to companies operating in Tartu, with whose owners or managers Semilarski actively communicated on a personal level outside working hours.
According to Gross, in all these cases Semilarski had personal interests, and therefore he should have removed himself from participation in decision-making.
Earlier, as rus.err.ee wrote, the prosecutor's office presented Semilarski with suspicions of taking bribes and violating anti-corruption legislation when conducting transactions on a large scale.
This happened in October 2016, when he was detained together with another deputy mayor, Artem Suvorov (Center Party).
At the time, the Prosecutor's Office and the Security Police stated that there was strong evidence against both deputy mayors.
Both officials have since resigned.
Suvorov's case later went to court, which completely exonerated the politician.
The judicial investigation into the case of Valvo Semilarski is still ongoing.
The ex-soloist of the band "Hands Up" visited Tver region
The ex-soloist of the group "Hands Up," and now a solo artist, businessman and actor Sergey Zhukov posted a photo from Kalyazin, Tver region, on his official Instagram account.
The photo was posted a day ago, on Saturday, July 25.
"I raise my hands up to the new "Kroshka" and say hello to you from the heady fresh air!
Write in the comments what is the weather like in your city?
We have no rain today, but it does not rise above +20," Zhukov wrote on social media.
Probably, the singer is vacationing in the beautiful city of Tver region with his family.
Residents of the region have already thanked the performer for his visit, and expressed hope for a meeting and personal communication.
The new "Kroshka" referred to in the post is probably a new version of an old song, which Zhukov has now recorded with blogger and musician David Manukyan (DAVA M).
At the same time, most fans remain FOR the old version: "Sergei, the old version of the song is clearly 1 000 000 times better!
Support me loyal fans of "Hands Up," "We don't need a "new baby"."
Most of them write directly that they prefer the original, which became a hit at the time.
The Ministry of Defense announced the successful completion of tests of the Zircon hypersonic missile
The Russian Defense Ministry announced the successful completion of tests of the Zircon hypersonic missile.
On Navy Day, the defense ministry noted that the test launches conducted from the frigate "Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union Gorshkov" confirmed the unique tactical and technical characteristics of this missile in terms of range and accuracy of fire, as well as the hypersonic speed of its flight.
According to the Ministry of Defense, the testing of the hypersonic missile is going according to plan.
Earlier in May, Deputy Defense Minister Alexei Krivoruchko reported that the ship complex with the latest Zircon hypersonic missile will enter service in 2021-2022.
You are all well aware of the truth that will be discussed today.
I think the idea of inequality as a divider and destroyer of society was in the air even before the French Revolution.
But now we can see the evidence by comparing the most and least similar societies, and observing the effects of inequality.
I'm going to show you the data and explain why the relationships that I'm going to talk about exist.
But first, look at how dull we are.
(Laughter) I'll start with a paradox.
This shows life expectancy as a function of GNI, or the average wealth of countries.
You can see that countries on the right, like Norway and the US, are twice as rich as Israel, Greece and Portugal on the left.
But it doesn't affect life expectancy at all.
There is no suggestion of a link.
But within societies there are strong gradations in health status, affecting all social strata.
Average life expectancy again.
The graph refers to small areas of England and Wales, with the poorest on the right and the richest on the left.
A huge difference between the poor and everyone else.
Even those slightly poorer than the richest are already less healthy than the very top.
Thus, income is very important within our societies, but not between them.
The explanation for this paradox is that within our societies we look at relative income or social position, status - at what level we are in relation to others, and what are the distances between us.
Once you understand this idea, you immediately think: what happens when you increase the difference or compress it, in other words, make the income difference bigger or smaller?
I'll show it to you now.
All the data used is absolutely real.
I take the information from the UN, the World Bank has the same information: the scale of income disparities in these rich and developed market democracies.
The indicator used by our team is very simple, you can download it. We calculate the difference between the richest 20% and the poorest 20% of citizens in each country.
Look, in the equal countries on the left, Japan, Finland, Norway and Sweden, the rich 20% are 3.5-4 times richer than the poor 20%.
But in unequal countries, in the UK, Portugal, the US and Singapore, the difference is twice as big!
By these measures, we are less than half as equal as other successful democracies.
And now you see the impact it has on society.
We have collected statistics on social problems that are more common among the poor.
These are internationally comparable data on life expectancy, children's literacy and numeracy, infant mortality, homicide rates, incarceration rates, teenage pregnancy, levels of trust, obesity, mental illness - which, according to the standard diagnostic classification, includes drug and alcohol addiction - and, finally, social mobility data.
We put it all in one index.
They are all of equal importance.
The country is, in a way, an average of these data.
You see the countries in relation to the inequality indicator that was shown at the very beginning. I will come back to it again and again in the course of the presentation.
Unequal countries generally have more problems with all these social problems.
This is an unusually close relationship. You can see that the correlation is unusually high.
But if you look at the same index of health and social problems in relation to GNP per capita, Gross National Income, there is no correlation.
We were a bit worried that people would think we were cherry-picking issues to suit our argument and just "fitting" the evidence, so we also wrote an article in the British Medical Journal about the UNICEF Child Wellbeing Index.
The index is made up of 40 different parts put together by different people.
Among the criteria: the availability of books at home, the ability of children to talk to their parents, the level of immunization, and the presence of bullying at school.
Everything goes in there.
But this is all against the background of the same indicator of inequality.
Children fare worse in unequal societies.
And this is a statistically significant relationship.
But again, if you look at the level of child well-being in relation to national income per capita, there is no relationship, no hint.
All the evidence points to one thing:
on average, the well-being of our societies no longer depends on national income and economic growth.
They are extremely important in poor countries, but not in the developed world.
The difference between us, and where we stand compared to others, is what matters most.
I will show you the fragments of our index.
For example, trust.
This is the portion of the population that agrees that most people can be trusted.
The data comes from the World Values Survey.
Look, in unequal countries only 15% of the population trusts others.
In equal societies, the figure is 60-65%.
If you look at measures of social activity, or social capital, you see very similar ratios, closely related to inequality.
You could say we did the work twice.
First, we analyzed developed countries, and then, as a control study, we repeated the procedure on 50 American states, asking one question: are things worse for all our indicators in the most unequal states?
Here's trust versus inequality, according to the federal government's General Social Survey.
Very similar dispersion, compared to a similar range of confidence levels.
Same story.
Overall, we found that almost everything related to trust at the international level shows up the same way in our control study.
It's not just a coincidence.
Here is a timeline of mental illness.
WHO, through identical diagnostic interviews conducted on random samples of the population, collected results that allow us to compare the level of mental illness in each of the societies.
Here is the percentage of the population that suffered from a mental illness in the past year.
The numbers start at about 8% and go up to almost 24%; whole societies with three times the rate of mental illness.
Again, this is closely related to inequality.
And then there are the crimes.
These red dots represent American states, and the blue triangles represent Canadian provinces.
But look at the scale of the difference.
It starts at 15 murders per million and goes up to 150.
This is the proportion of prisoners.
This is a tenfold difference, expressed on a logarithmic scale.
The figures rise from 40 to 400 for the prison population.
These correlations are not explained simply by higher crime.
Yes, in some cases this is partly true.
But most of them are associated with harsher sentences.
Unequal societies are more likely to support the death penalty.
The dropout rate is shown here.
Again, quite a difference.
It is incredibly damaging when it comes to the use of talent.
And here is social mobility.
It's a measurement of mobility by income.
Basically it comes down to this: do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons, or is there no relationship?
Among unequal countries, in the UK and the US, the father's income is many times more important.
And in the Scandinavian countries, income is much less important.
The result is greater social mobility.
And as we often like to say - and I know there are a lot of Americans in the audience - if Americans want the American dream, they should go to Denmark.
(Laughter) (Applause) I just showed you a couple of things in italics.
A number of other problems could be demonstrated.
All sorts of problems that become more significant among the lower social strata.
But there are endless problems with social gradients, which are much worse in unequal countries; not just a little bit, but 2, 10 times worse.
Think about the cost, what it costs people.
Let me go back to the graph I showed earlier, where all the data is put together, and draw two conclusions.
First, chart by chart, the less successful countries, regardless of the result, turn out to be unequal, while the Scandinavian countries and Japan are doing well.
Thus, we see before us a general social dysfunction on the background of inequality.
This is not one or two separate problems. This is a trend.
Another important note about this graph. See below: Sweden and Japan: the countries are different in literally everything.
The situation of women, how closely they are connected with the family, is exactly the opposite in the conditions of developed countries.
Another very important difference is how they achieve greater equality.
In Sweden, income differences are huge, but they are reduced through taxation, through social programs, generous benefits, etc.
In Japan, things are different.
The wage gap is small to begin with.
Taxes are lower.
There are fewer social programs.
And in our analysis of American states, we find the same contrast.
Some states thrive on income redistribution, others on smaller differences in net pretax income.
We believe that it does not matter by what means equality is achieved, as long as it is achieved.
I am not talking about full equality, but the kind of equality that exists in rich and developed market democracies.
Another surprising observation is that it is not only the poor who are affected by this inequality.
There seems to be some truth in the words of John Donne: "No man is an island."
A number of studies can compare how well people in more and less equal countries do at each rung of the social ladder.
One such example:
Neonatal mortality.
A group of Swedes classified many cases of infant mortality according to the British register of general socioeconomic classification.
This is rather an anachronistic classification according to the profession of the fathers, so that single parents are not included.
And by "low social level" we mean unskilled occupations.
Next are skilled manual workers, then lower-level white-collar workers and up to the highest level with highly skilled professions: doctors, lawyers, directors of large companies.
You see, Sweden is doing better than the UK at all levels of society.
The biggest difference is at the lower levels,
But even at the top, there are benefits to a more equal society.
We have shown this in five different data sets covering educational outcomes and health in the US and internationally.
And that seems to be the general picture: greater equality makes a bigger difference at the bottom, but is also good for the top.
But I still have to explain what is going on.
I think it's all about the psychosocial effects of inequality.
About feelings of superiority and inferiority, about feelings of self-worth and vice versa, about feelings of self-respect and vice versa.
And, of course, the sense of competition that is born of these feelings fuels consumerism in our society.
It also leads to status anxiety.
We worry more about what other people think of us, whether they think we're attractive, whether they think we're smart.
The more public assessments, the greater the fear of them.
Interestingly, parallel work is being done in social psychology: 208 different studies were reviewed involving volunteers who were tested in psychological laboratories for stress hormones and reactions to stressful tasks.
Overall, they wanted to observe the types of stress that increase levels of cortisol, the main stress hormone.
As a result, these factors were situations that included a potential threat of social evaluation, a threat to self-esteem or social status, situations where other people could give a negative assessment.
Such stressors have a particular impact on the physiology of stress.
We were not without our critics.
Of course, there will be those who disagree or find it surprising.
I have to tell you, in response to criticism for cherry-picking data, that we don't cherry-pick data.
Our main rule is that if the data source has the necessary indicators for one of the analyzed countries, we include it in our analysis.
It's the source that decides if the data is real, not us.
Otherwise, we would have created a systematic error.
What about other countries?
There are 200 studies of health in relation to income and equality in academic journals.
And they are not limited to these countries but we have excluded others for clarity.
The same countries, the same measures of inequality, problem after problem.
Why don't we control for other factors?
Well, we have shown you that GNP per capita does not matter.
And, of course, others, using more sophisticated methods, controlled for poverty, education level, and so on.
What about causality?
Correlation alone does not prove causation.
We spent a lot of time on this.
Indeed, for some of these situations, the causal relationships are well known.
A major change in our understanding of the causes of chronic health effects in the developed world has been the significance of chronic stress of a social nature and its impact on the immune and cardiovascular systems.
For example, violence becomes more common in unequal societies because people are more sensitive to contempt.
I must say that to solve this problem, we should work on pre-tax and post-tax income.
We must limit the income and additional bonuses of the highest ranks.
I think we need to hold our bosses accountable for their employees in every way possible.
I want you to leave here with the knowledge that we can improve the real quality of human life by reducing the income gap between us.
So now we have a foothold to influence the psychological well-being of entire societies, and this is really incredible.
Thank you.
(Applause)
The clubs bidding for Lokomotiv star Miranchuk and his salary in Italy have been revealed.
According to SE, Serie A teams Milan, Lazio, Fiorentina and Atalanta are currently bidding for Lokomotiv midfielder Alexei Miranchuk.
The 24-year-old would like a four-year contract with a salary of at least €2 million per year with bonuses.
Any club that makes such an offer will be given priority.
Lokomotiv are determined to sell their star player and make money from it.
Otherwise, the club will face serious expenses to extend the contract with the midfielder.
It should be noted that Milan are hoping to include left-back Diego Laxalt in the deal.
In the 2019/20 season, Miranchuk made 32 appearances for the Railwaymen, scoring 16 goals and making 5 assists.
Together with Lokomotiv, the midfielder became Russian champion (2017/18), won the Russian Cup three times (2014/15, 2016/17, 2018/19) and the Russian Super Cup once (2019).
The US has called on Qatar and its neighbours to end their dispute
It is necessary to restore trust and unity between Qatar and other states, according to US Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook.
He said the conflict between the emirate and other countries in the region had gone on for too long and was detrimental to regional interests in stability, prosperity and security.
So far, the US has unsuccessfully tried to mediate a settlement of the dispute, which Washington sees as a "threat to efforts to contain Iran."
The UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain severed diplomatic relations with Qatar three years ago.
They imposed a transport blockade, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorism.
In response, Doha said that its neighbors are simply jealous of Qatar's economic success - according to the IMF, Qatar has been leading in GDP per capita by a wide margin for several years.
The emirate is the third in terms of natural gas reserves, the sixth natural gas exporter and a major exporter of oil and petroleum products.

Former U.S. diplomat calls Pompeo's remarks against China "primitive and ineffective"
US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo's highly provocative speech at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library aimed at denigrating China is "primitive and ineffective."
Former US Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel Russel said this on Friday.

Russia's Proton is ready to conquer the open spaces
The Proton-M rocket is ready for launch, during which it will put into orbit two Express-series telecommunications satellites.
This is the conclusion reached by the state commission.
On July 26, the device will be launched to the launch pad at the Baikonur Cosmodrome.
The actual launch of the rocket is scheduled for July 30.
The original launch date was pushed back after a number of faults were discovered among the components of the launch vehicle.
According to Roscosmos, the defective parts were manufactured at the Ust-Katavsky plant in Chelyabinsk in 2015-2016.
Remenyako won the second race in the SMP GT4 Russia class.
Evgeny Kulikov, whose Porsche Cayman was damaged in the first race, was unable to start.
Therefore, Alexey Bashmakov was on the reverse pole - however, by the second lap the Mercedes drivers had already pulled ahead.
Denis Remenyako again raced ahead, and Alexander Vayntrub was forced to repel the attacks of Alexander Maslennikov on the KTM, who broke through from last place to third.
Despite a close fight in the first part of the race, near the middle Vayntrub increased the pace, showing the best lap time in the race - and although he could not catch the extremely stable Remenyako, he guaranteed himself silver.
The Cayman group lagged behind the leaders, but had a close fight among themselves.
The best of the pilots in the Porsche was Alexey Bashmakov, who became the fourth in the standings, but Andrei Fedotov and Konstantin Zakharevsky also lost a few moments to him.
And at the intermediate finish in the middle of the race, Fedotov and Zakharevsky were separated by 0.001 seconds.
Two more highways added to the list of federal roads
The Government of the Russian Federation has added two more highways to the list of federal highways.
According to the Cabinet of Ministers, one of these roads with a length of more than 663 kilometers Chekshino - Totma - Kotlas - Kuratovo connects Vologda and Arkhangelsk regions with the Komi Republic.
Another highway, over 388 kilometers long, leads from Barnaul through Pavlovsk to the border with the Republic of Kazakhstan.
This road will take you from the capital of Altai Krai to the Kulunda checkpoint.
Obtaining a new status will make it possible to bring these routes to a standard state with funds from the Federal Road Fund.
Major repairs and reconstruction of individual sections will be carried out, and the quality of the road surface will be improved.
In Tatarstan, open-air film screenings are allowed
The Cabinet of Ministers of Tatarstan has published a decree, according to which from July 27 in the republic it is possible to hold film screenings in open areas - in parks, squares and on embankments, writes Tatar-Inform.
Also, the document states that for citizens over 65 years of age, the mandatory self-isolation regime has been extended until August 9.
They can leave the house to go to the store, take out the trash or walk the dog.
But indoor cinemas are not planned to open until the third stage of lifting restrictions, the agency reminds.
Washington is happy to be in the playoffs.
We missed them.
Russian hockey player Alexander Ovechkin of the Washington Capitals spoke about the club's preparations for the upcoming resumption of the NHL season.
The 34-year-old Caps forward noted the readiness of his teammates for the games.
Mentally, all the guys are ready.
We go to Toronto happy, because we were without a game for a long time and missed hockey in the playoffs," the Russian-language version of the NHL.Com website quotes Ovechkin as saying.
- Now we are fresh, we have no injuries and various aches and pains.
However, Ovechkin also admitted that he and his teammates still have to remember some of the tactical combinations: "We don't have much time to play the majority and remember the March developments, how to move the puck in such situations.
But there is still time: I am sure that in Toronto we will still devote part of the training to this.
Majority and minority are important in the playoffs.
And I have confidence in our special teams."
Recall that the restart of the Washington Capitals is scheduled for August 3, when the Capitals play the Tampa Bay Lightning.
After that, the Caps will also play the Philadelphia Flyers (August 6) and the Boston Bruins (August 9).
Russian man refused to pay for parking and beat up parking attendant
In Vladivostok, a man refused to pay for parking and punched a parking attendant, police are investigating.
This is reported by the portal vl.ru with reference to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia in the city.
The incident occurred on Friday, July 24, in the parking lot near the shopping center.
The driver of the car refused to pay for the parking of the car, which caused a conflict with the employee of the parking lot.
A verbal argument escalated into an assault.
The man hit the employee in the face and he fell unconscious.
He was hospitalized.
According to the source, the victim suffered a moderate head injury and was taken to the neurosurgery department.
The police are currently investigating the circumstances of the incident.
Earlier, the Russian was charged with beating a disabled man who later died in hospital.
According to investigators, the victim was visiting his friend, a 45-year-old local resident.
The men drank alcohol together, and then there was a conflict between the friends.
The host beat the guest, who went home.
Two days later, the man became ill and was hospitalized.
He died from his injuries.
Cyber attacks on the business world have become more frequent recently.
Access to data from companies such as JP Morgan, Yahoo, Home Depot and Target has cost them hundreds of millions and in some cases billions of dollars.
It doesn't take too many of these attacks to damage the global economy.
The public sector is not immune to these problems either.
From 2012 to 2014, there was a significant data breach at the US Office of Personnel Management.
Access to the security clearance and fingerprint data of 22 million employees was compromised.
State-sponsored hackers have been known to attempt to influence the outcome of elections in a number of countries using stolen data.
The two most recent big data breaches involve the Bundestag, Germany's federal parliament, and the theft of emails from the US Democratic National Committee.
The cyber threat affects our democratic processes.
The situation is getting even worse.
As computer technology advances, data protection systems become more vulnerable.
A new type of computer technology is also causing concern - computing on quantum computers, which use the microscopic properties of nature to vastly increase computing power.
It is so powerful that it can crack many modern encryption systems.
Is the situation really so hopeless?
Maybe it's time to pack up our vital data and prepare for the imminent digital apocalypse?
I would say, "It's not time yet."
Quantum computers are still in development, and it will be many years before they are put to practical use.
More important is the fact that major breakthroughs in encryption are taking place.
For me, this is a particularly exciting time in the history of secure communications.
About 15 years ago, when I learned about the new possibility of creating quantum effects that do not exist in nature, I became very excited.
I was intrigued by the idea of applying the fundamental laws of physics to create more secure encryption.
Today, a number of companies and labs around the world, including my own, are working on these technologies for practical applications.
Right.
Now we are preparing to fight quantum with quantum.
So how does it all work?
First, let's take a brief detour into the world of encryption.
To do this, we'll need a briefcase, some important documents to send to our friend, James Bond, and a lock to keep everything safe.
Because our information is top secret, we need a special briefcase.
It has a special code lock: when it is closed, it converts all the text in the documents into random numbers.
You put the documents in the briefcase, close the lock - at that very moment all the documents are converted into random numbers - and send the briefcase to James.
While the briefcase is in transit, you call James to give him the code.
After receiving the briefcase, he enters the code, the documents are decrypted, and voila - you've just sent an encrypted message to James Bond.
(Laughter) It's a funny example, but it illustrates three important elements of coding.
Code - we call it an "encryption key."
It's like a password.
A call to James to tell him the combination lock code.
This is called "key exchange" -
guarantee that you will securely receive the encryption key from the right place.
And a lock that encrypts and decrypts the document.
This is called an "encoding algorithm."
Using the key, it converts the text in the documents into random numbers.
A good algorithm will encode in such a way that without the key the document is very difficult to decipher.
The importance of encryption is that if someone gets hold of the briefcase and breaks into it without the help of the encryption key and the encryption algorithm, they still won't be able to read its contents.
The information will look like a set of random numbers.
Most security systems rely on a secure key exchange method to transmit the encryption key to the desired location.
However, the rapid development of computing power threatens a number of modern methods of key exchange.
Consider one of the most widely used systems today, RSA.
When it was invented in 1977, it was estimated that it would take 40 quadrillion years to crack a 426-bit RSA key.
In 1994, just 17 years later, the code was cracked.
As computers became more powerful, we had to use more complex codes.
Today, we usually use 2048 or 4096 bits.
As you can see, coders and hackers are engaged in an ongoing battle to outsmart each other.
And when quantum computers arrive in the next 10 to 15 years, they will be able to crack the complex math that underlies many modern encryption systems even faster.
A quantum computer is likely to turn our current secure fortress into a simple house of cards.
We must find a way to defend our fortress.
In recent years, there has been an increasing amount of research into the use of quantum effects to enhance cryptography.
Some interesting discoveries were made.
Remember the three main elements of encryption: high-quality keys, secure key exchange, and a complex algorithm?
Advances in science and technology are putting two of these three elements at risk.
First, the keys themselves.
Random numbers are the fundamental building blocks of encryption keys.
But today they are not entirely random.
Today, we create encryption keys from sequences of random numbers generated from software, so-called pseudo-random numbers.
There is a certain pattern in the numbers generated by a program or a mathematical formula.
The less random the numbers are - in scientific terminology: the less entropy they contain - the easier they are to predict.
Recently, several casinos have fallen victim to an ingenious attack.
The combinations on the output of the slot machines were recorded for some time and then analyzed.
This allowed cybercriminals to reverse engineer the pseudo-random number generator that controls the reels.
That, in turn, made it possible to accurately predict the spins of the reels and get a big win.
Encryption keys can be subject to similar risks.
A truly random number generator is needed for secure encryption.
For years, scientists have been looking for a way to create such a generator.
But most attempts to date are either not random enough, not fast enough, or difficult to replicate.
But the quantum world is based on randomness.
So it makes sense to take advantage of this fact.
Devices that can measure quantum effects can also generate an infinite stream of random numbers at high speed,
that will keep all those potential criminals out of the casino.
A number of top universities and companies around the world are building truly random number generators.
The first quantum generator created in my company was one meter by two meters and was placed on an optical table.
We were later able to shrink it down to the size of a server box.
Today it is the size of a PCI card connected to a standard computer.
It is the fastest truly random number generator in the world.
Its capacity is one billion random numbers per second.
Today, it is used by cloud providers, banks, and government agencies around the world to strengthen security.
(Applause) But even with this generator, the second big problem remains unsolved: the threat to the secure exchange of keys.
Current methods of exchanging keys are not compatible with a quantum computer.
The quantum solution to this problem is called "quantum key distribution" or QKD, which is based on a fundamental, paradoxical characteristic of quantum mechanics.
A quantum particle changes depending on its observation.
Let me give you an example of how this works.
Let's go back to exchanging lock codes with James Bond.
Only this time, instead of calling James with a code message, we will use quantum effects on the laser to create a code and send it to James over a conventional optical fiber.
We believe that Dr. No will try to hack access to the data exchange.
Fortunately, his attempts to catch quantum keys in transit will leave fingerprints that James and you will be able to detect.
This will eliminate intercepted keys.
And the remaining keys can be used for enhanced data protection.
Since this security is based on the fundamental laws of physics, a quantum computer or even any supercomputer of the future will not be able to break it.
My team and I are working with leading universities, as well as the defense sector, to develop this promising technology into next-generation security tools.
The Internet of Things heralds an era where 25-30 billion devices are expected to be connected by 2020.
For our society to function properly in an IoT world, trust in the systems that support these devices is vital.
I bet that quantum technologies will be able to provide that trust, allowing us to take full advantage of the amazing innovations that will enrich our lives.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Video of cats helping an injured dog cross the road
A video of two cats helping an injured dog cross a road in the Krasnodar region is going viral on the Internet.
The touching procession was recorded by the dashcam of one of the drivers.
The events took place in the dark, the man noticed movement on the road and slowed down.
"Look, there's a whole delegation," the driver says ironically at first.
And then he notices that the dog is moving with great difficulty.
The company made it safely to the side of the road and then headed towards the forest.
"Humans have a lot to learn from animals," the comments read.
On Sunday, parades in honor of the Day of the Russian Navy were held in St. Petersburg and near all major naval bases, including Tartus in Syria.
They were attended by 219 different ships and 15,000 personnel.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, who hosted the main parade in St. Petersburg, said that in 2020 the Navy will be replenished with 40 new vessels of different classes, as well as the latest weapons - including hypersonic strike systems and unmanned underwater vehicles.
In 2020, the parade was held for the first time in Kaspiysk, where the Caspian Fleet base was relocated from Astrakhan.
In addition to St. Petersburg, parades were held in Baltiysk, Kaspiysk, Severomorsk, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Vladivostok, as well as in annexed Sevastopol and at the Syrian port of Tartus.
Four thousand servicemen and 46 vessels took part in the main parade in the waters of the Neva and the Gulf of Finland, including nuclear and diesel submarines, as well as helicopters and aircraft of the Naval Aviation.
Before the start of the parade, Putin, accompanied by Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy Admiral Nikolai Evmenov and Commander of the Western Military District Colonel-General Zhuravlev, toured several ships stationed at the Kronstadt roadstead and in the Gulf of Finland, greeting the personnel.
The parade was also decorated with a replica of the first Russian battleship "Poltava," recreated according to archival drawings.
Emperor Peter I took part in its design.
In his speech, Putin recalled that this year marks the 200th anniversary of the discovery of Antarctica as a result of the expedition of Russian sailors Thaddeus Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev.
And snipers were spotted on the roof of the Senate and Synod building during the parade to ensure security.
More than 46 warships and more than 1.5 servicemen took part in the parade in Baltiysk, where the Baltic Fleet is based, and the large warship Kaliningrad made an amphibious landing.
In annexed Sevastopol, a parade was held with the participation of 30 ships and a performance dedicated to the history of the Black Sea Fleet, which included the release of a group of divers from under the water.
The new strategic nuclear submarine Knyaz Vladimir, which was commissioned into the Northern Fleet in June, participated in the parade in Severomorsk.
In Vladivostok, the celebration ended with fireworks.
The Russian Navy will receive forty ships and vessels this year
Forty ships and vessels will join the Russian Navy this year, Russian President Vladimir Putin said.
"The level of equipment in our military fleet is constantly growing.
This year it will consist of forty ships and vessels of various classes," he said, speaking at the main parade in honor of the Navy Day in St. Petersburg.
Putin also recalled that a few days ago six new ships of the far sea zone were laid down at three shipyards in Russia.
Earlier it was reported that a parade in honor of the Day of the Navy began in St. Petersburg.
A four-year-old child was injured in an accident near Volgograd

How the Central Bank's decision to cut the key rate will affect the economy
As expected, the Bank of Russia cut its key rate again.
It dropped another 0.25 percentage points, to 4.25% per annum - formally another historic low.
Judging by the return of a short rate cut, as well as the tone of the Central Bank's statements and updated forecasts for the Russian economy, the regulator is more optimistic about economic prospects than before.
This means that the current monetary easing cycle may soon come to a halt.
"We have continued to ease monetary policy, primarily taking into account that there are still risks of inflation deviating down from 4% in 2021," said Bank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina.
They are associated with a significant decline in economic activity and a fall in domestic and external demand.
According to Nabiullina, economic recovery will take more than a year and a half.
At the same time, she noted that after the lifting of restrictions due to the pandemic, economic processes revived: energy consumption, consumer and investment demand recovered, construction and production of consumer goods expanded, and the annual rate of decline in transport turnover and industrial production slowed down.
According to the revised forecast of the Central Bank, in 2020 the economic contraction will be 4.5-5.5% (previously it was expected to be 4-6%), and the recovery growth of the economy in 2021 will be 3.5-4.5%, in 2022 - 2.5-3.5%.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised its forecast for annual oil prices to $38 and $40 per barrel of Urals in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
Earlier, the Central Bank expected $27 and $35 per barrel.
Finally, the Bank of Russia's inflation forecast for 2020 was 3.7-4.2% compared to the previously expected 3.8-4.8%.
The Bank of Russia's view of the economic situation is becoming more optimistic, which brings us closer to the end of the easing cycle, according to Renaissance Capital's Russia and CIS economists Sofia Donets and Andrey Melashchenko.
Thus, the Bank of Russia has been consistently lowering the key rate for more than a year; since the beginning of last summer, it has already dropped by 3.5 percentage points.
And at the last meeting in June, the Central Bank immediately lowered it by one percentage point due to low inflation rates due to depressed demand and the need to stimulate the economy, which slowed down due to the pandemic and related restrictions.
Chances for fine-tuning the monetary policy remain (at the next meeting on September 18 and until the end of the year), but the limit is already close, agrees Evgeny Koshelev, chief analyst at Rosbank.
The combination of pro-inflationary risks also points to the proximity of a pause in interest rate policy easing - disrupted supply chains, a possible increase in costs due to epidemic prevention measures and a faster (than expected) recovery in demand, he says.
To top it off, the subsequent actions of the Bank of Russia will require more attention to inflationary processes during the harvest season, as well as external volatility, which has increased amid geopolitical conflicts, Koshelev points out.
One way or another, the reduction in the key rate will lead to a further reduction in rates for the most reliable borrowers, and possibly also for mortgages, says Maxim Petronevich, senior economist at the analytical department of Otkritie Bank.
The correction in rates will be less pronounced than the reduction in the key rate, he said.
Interest rates on consumer loans may fall by another 0.3-0.6 percentage points during the second half of the year, mortgage rates may end the year in the range of 6.2-7%, BKS Premier economist Anton Pokatovich does not exclude.
Average deposit rates, in his opinion, will also fall - in the coming months they could drop to 4.2-4.5% (currently barely above 4.5%).
Further, they can drop to 4% if the Central Bank lowers the key rate in the fall, Pokatovich believes.
Centre Party promises to pay all its debts by the end of the year
The General Secretary of the Centre Party, Mikhail Korb, said this in an interview with ERR.
According to him, the total amount of payments to be made by the party is about 300,000 euros.
"According to today's financial forecasts, the Center Party will pay off its current debts and obligations by the end of this year," Korb said.
Earlier it became known that the party of the Prime Minister returned 110,100 euros to the state, which were recognized as a prohibited donation.
A car and a caravan collided in Harju County, injuring four people
According to police, the accident occurred at 13:50 in the village of Soodla, where a Mercedes-Benz car driven by a 31-year-old woman collided with a Fiat caravan driven by a 48-year-old man.
As a result of the incident, the drivers of both vehicles were injured, as well as the passengers in the motor home: a 10-year-old child and a 48-year-old woman who was taken to the hospital.
The rest of the victims received first aid at the scene and did not require hospitalization.
The exact circumstances of the incident are being investigated.
Ukrainian military to monitor ceasefire in Donbass
The Ukrainian military has begun preparations for a ceasefire on the demarcation line in Donbass, control over the implementation of the agreements will be carried out by servicemen with experience in peacekeeping missions, the Joint Forces Headquarters reports on Facebook.
"Units from the Joint Forces have begun preparations for a full and comprehensive ceasefire on the demarcation line, which comes into effect on July 27, 2020," the statement said.
It is noted that, starting from 00:01 on July 27, at each of the Ukrainian positions, additional monitoring of the ceasefire will be carried out by specially dispatched Ukrainian servicemen, most of whom have combat experience and were directly involved in relevant issues while participating in peacekeeping missions under the auspices of the UN.
Such a step will allow "not to distract the personnel of the units of the Joint Forces from carrying out combat tasks and to prevent possible provocations," the statement said.
At the meeting of the Contact Group on Donbass held on Wednesday, the parties agreed on a set of additional measures to monitor the truce, which, among other things, includes a ban on the activities of sabotage and reconnaissance groups and a ban on firing, including sniper fire.
13 patients with coronavirus died in Moscow

Psychologist: "Emelianenko still can't forget parting with the woman he loved."
Psychologist Veronika Stepanova, who has more than 1 million subscribers on Youtube, spoke about MMA fighter Alexander Emelianenko, who is her sister's ex-husband.
Olya met Sasha, they fell in love, - said Stepanova in a video on her Youtube channel.
"It was a very beautiful story, they had a baby instantly, everything was beautiful and wonderful.
At some point, Sasha got tired of it all and wanted to go for a walk.
And if any other woman treats it normally (well, think about it, go for a walk, dance a little), then this is not about Olya.
She does not tolerate such things.
And his story about a short walk ended with his sister instantly marrying another man and immediately giving birth to his child.
When Sasha came to terms with what had happened, he couldn't believe it.
He tried to crawl on his knees, give diamonds.
His pride of lions made his head explode.
He wanted everything back, but he didn't understand how to get it back.
They maintain a friendly relationship, they have a child together, but he still can't recover.
His destructive behavior is a cry of desperation, an attempt to either kill himself or get her attention.
Carolina prospect will leave to play in Sweden.
Carolina prospect Jack Drury will play in the Swedish league next season, The Hockey News' Ryan Kennedy reports on Twitter.
The U.S. junior national team player played for Harvard in the NCAA last season.
He has 39 points (20+19) in 28 games.
Drury was selected by Carolina with the 42nd overall pick in the 2018 draft.
Albert Proza signs with Tallinn Legion
Proza's last club was Tartu Tammeka, where he played last season.
"Because of my injury, I was out of football for more than a year.
He underwent surgery on April 30.
But now everything is fine - I'm ready to play again.
True, my form is far from optimal.
When will I debut for the Legion?
It is possible that on July 29 I will play some time for the Estonian Cup, and on August 1 I will be in the squad for the championship match against Paide.
But it all depends on the decision of the coach, he will decide if I am ready or not.
I myself believe that I still have a lot to gain," Albert Proza said in an interview with ERR on Sunday.
In the current Estonian football championship, Legion is in ninth place in the standings after 14 rounds, with 10 points.
"At the moment, if you look at the table, we can't talk about fighting for high places, but Legion is an ambitious team, we have a good enough squad.
I think that next year we will have better results.
And the task for this year is to keep our place in the top league and play more confidently," added Proza.
"I don't set any personal goals for myself.
It is not easy to come back to football after such a long break.
Now my main task is to help the team stay in the top league and climb the table as high as possible," said the striker.
Previously, Proza also played for the capital's Flora and Infonet, Finland's RoPS and TPS, and Malta's Valletta.
Proza made 7 appearances for the Estonian national team.

The average daily growth rate of new COVID-19 cases per month is about -0.57%.
Among the newly identified cases - 49.2% - in people aged 18 to 45 years, 30.6% - from 46 to 65 years, 9.6% - from 66 to 79, and 3.3% - over 80 years.
Of these, 7.3% were children.
The main naval parade was marked by new ships and imaging technologies
At the Main Naval Parade in St. Petersburg, a new filming technology was used: a video camera "passed" under one of the ships, showing it "from the inside."
The passage of the newest serial small missile ship "Sovetsk" along the Admiralty Embankment was filmed in this perspective.
The main naval parade was broadcast by the TV channel Russia 1 and the website Russia.tv.
Earlier, on June 24, at the parade in honor of the 75th anniversary of the Great Victory, the camera, when moving from one plane to another, "passed" through the muzzle of the tank inside the armored vehicle, and during the flight of the fighters of the aerobatic teams "Russian Knights" and "Swifts," the camera "flew" out of the nozzle of the aircraft engine.
The main naval parade consisting of 46 warships, boats and submarines, 41 aircraft and helicopters of naval aviation and more than 4,000 servicemen ended in the waters of Kronstadt.
In particular, the large anti-submarine ship Vice-Admiral Kulakov, the corvette Stoiky, the large landing ships Minsk and Patriot, the nuclear submarine missile cruiser Orel, the submarine Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, the patrol ship Vasily Bykov, the small anti-submarine ships Kazanets and Urengoy, the small missile ships Liven and Passat, and the missile boat Chuvashia participated in the parade.
On the roadstead of Kronstadt in the Gulf of Finland, it was possible to see for the first time the large landing ship "Peter Morgunov," built according to project 11711 of the Nevsky Design Bureau at the Baltic plant "Yantar."
The lead ship of this series, Ivan Gren, is already serving in the Northern Fleet, reports TASS.
Among the other newcomers that recently entered service with the Navy was the first serial frigate Admiral of the Fleet Kasatonov, built under project 22350 at the Severnaya Verf shipyard.
Another newcomer to the Navy is the Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky diesel-electric submarine of Project 636.3 of the Rubin Central Design Bureau of Marine Equipment, built at the Admiralty Shipyards.
She joined Russia's Pacific Fleet in December 2019.
Other new ships that have recently joined the Navy are the small missile ships Sovetsk and Mytishchi of Project 22800 (Karakurt), developed by the Almaz Central Design Bureau.
The small missile ships Veliky Ustyug and Serpukhov of Project 21631 Buyan-M also participated in the parade on the Neva.
And the largest participants were the nuclear submarine missile cruiser Orel and the large anti-submarine ship Vice Admiral Kulakov - they could be seen in the Gulf of Finland.
In recognition of the great contribution of the Russian fleet to the exploration of the World Ocean, two state-of-the-art hydrographic boats "Georgy Zima" and "Mikhail Kazansky" passed along the Neva River together with warships.
And at the Palace Bridge, you could see the first Russian battleship of the 16th century, the Poltava, recreated at the historic shipyard.
This 54-gun sailing ship was launched in 1712, participated in the war with the Swedes, and in 1717 provided a landing on the island of Gotland.
In 1725, this ship was withdrawn from the Baltic Fleet, and after its reconstruction, it was launched in St. Petersburg on May 27, 2018.
Travel to Kronstadt this year was restricted for the duration of the parade in connection with the prevention of the spread of coronavirus COVID-19, RIA Novosti reports.
1 killed in U.S. protests
Protests were held in Seattle, Portland, Louisville and Denver, the Current Camera reported on Sunday.
In Austin, Texas, a man died during a protest.
The protester was shot with a rifle while sitting in his car.
The suspect has already been arrested.
In other cities, demonstrators clashed with law enforcement officers.
The protesters rioted and the police were forced to use tear gas and stun grenades.
Poll: Lithuania's ruling Union of Farmers and Greens again tops party rankings
The Lithuanian Peasants' and Greens' Union, which heads the ruling coalition in the Seimas, topped the party rankings.
This was shown by a poll conducted by the sociological research company Vilmorus for the newspaper Lietuvos rytas.
After winning the parliamentary elections in 2016, the "peasants" lost the first place and for a long time the main critic of Russia in Lithuania, the opposition "Fatherland Union - Christian Democrats (conservatives), was in the lead.
Nevertheless, recently Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda, assessing the electoral possibilities of the parties, said that the Union of Farmers and Greens will probably be able to form a coalition again after this year's parliamentary elections.
The announcement sparked outrage among conservatives.
The latest poll showed that if the parliamentary elections were held today, 17.6 percent of voters would vote for the peasants and 17.2 percent for the conservatives.
According to the director of Vilmorus, Vladas Gaidis, the gap is within the margin of error, and nevertheless, the ruling party has ceased to lag behind the conservatives.
According to Gaidis, the news that Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis would head their electoral list contributed to the sociological success of the "peasants."
This politician was at the top of the list of "peasants" in the 2016 election.
In third place is the Social Democratic Party, which 7.1 percent of respondents are now ready to vote for.
It unexpectedly lost 2 percent for the month.
The fourth is the Labour Party, led by Russian-born businessman Viktor Uspaskich (6.2 percent).
Other political organizations, according to the poll, will not yet be able to overcome the 5 percent electoral threshold.
Putin spoke about the unique advantages of the Russian fleet
Russian President Vladimir Putin said at the Main Naval Parade in St. Petersburg that the unique advantages and increasing the combat capabilities of the Russian fleet will be achieved through the introduction of advanced digital technologies.
As the head of state specified, Russian hypersonic strike systems and unmanned underwater vehicles have no analogues in the world.
In addition, the Russian leader drew attention to the most effective means of defense of the Russian Federation.
According to the Russian leader, the level of equipment of the Russian Navy is constantly growing, so this year it will receive 40 ships and vessels of various classes.
It is noted that the focus will be on equipping with unique hypersonic strike systems.
Today, the Navy is armed with the latest ships equipped with high-precision weapons, strategic submarine cruisers and multi-purpose submarines, as well as unique pieces of special equipment, the president added.
Putin also stressed that military sailors perform the most difficult tasks with dignity, serving the Fatherland impeccably.
The Ministry of Emergency Situations has warned residents of the Moscow region about the storm
Thunderstorms and wind gusts of up to 15 m/s are expected in the Moscow region. This was reported by the regional department of the Ministry of Emergency Situations on Sunday, July 26.
Residents are advised to remove household items from their yards and trim dry trees that could cause damage to their homes.
The car should be placed in a garage or parked away from trees or weak structures.
To avoid a lightning strike, it is recommended not to heat the furnace in the house during a thunderstorm and not to use electrical appliances, and on the street not to hide under trees (especially lonely ones), not to swim in ponds.
Those in the car are advised to close their windows and stay inside.
On July 24, the Ministry of Emergency Situations also warned residents of the Moscow region about the storm.
Unnecessary requirements for applications for public procurement will be excluded by law
The legislation may establish comprehensive requirements for applications for participation in procurement.
In the autumn session, at the plenary session of the State Duma, it is planned to consider in the second reading a bill establishing requirements for the content and composition of an application for participation in a procurement, the participants of which can only be small and medium-sized businesses.
Amendments are made by the government to the law "On procurement of goods, works and services by certain types of legal entities."
The bill is designed to implement the roadmap for the implementation of the Strategy for the Development of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises in the Russian Federation until 2030, approved by the government.
It provides for the preparation of a draft law on an exhaustive list of documents that customers are entitled to request as part of the application from procurement participants - small and medium-sized businesses.
As well as a list of requirements for these documents.
Today, the law "On procurement of goods, works and services by certain types of legal entities" regulates the procurement activities of certain types of legal entities.
The requirements for the content, form, design and composition of the application for participation in the procurement are set by the customers themselves in the procurement documentation.
"As a result, customers set excessive requirements for the content, design of the application, the mandatory presence in its composition of certificates, certificates, extracts, the deadline for receipt of which in the authorized bodies is comparable to the deadline for submitting applications, which leads to the impossibility of participating in such a purchase and reducing the number of participants in the purchase," the explanatory note to the bill says.
The new bill provides for the establishment of an exhaustive list of documents that customers are entitled to require as part of the application from procurement participants who are small and medium-sized enterprises.
"The adoption of the document will eliminate the arbitrary establishment of requirements by customers for the composition and content of applications of participants who are small and medium-sized businesses," the explanatory note says.
As an artist, interconnection is very important to me.
In my work I try to show that humans are inseparable from nature and that everything is connected.
The first time I went to Antarctica, almost 10 years ago, I saw icebergs.
I was in awe.
My heart beat faster, my head spinning, trying to make sense of what was unfolding before me.
The icebergs around me rose nearly 200 feet out of the water, and I couldn't help but marvel at the fact that it was one snowflake on top of another, year after year.
Icebergs are born when they break off from glacier ice or calve from ice shelves.
Each iceberg has its own personality.
Everyone interacts with the environment in their own way and accumulates their own experience.
Some refuse to give up and hang on until the bitter end, while others can no longer fight and die in a fit of violent passion.
Looking at an iceberg, it is easy to think that it is isolated, that it is closed and alone, just as we humans often see ourselves.
But life is very different.
As the iceberg melts, I breathe in its ancient atmosphere.
When an iceberg melts, it releases fresh, mineral-rich water that nourishes many life forms.
I approach photographing these icebergs as if I were making portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these individual moments they exist in this image and that it will never be repeated.
They do not die when they melt; it is not the end, but a continuation of their journey in the cycle of life.
Sometimes the ice in the icebergs I photograph is very young - only a couple of thousand years old.
And some icebergs are more than 100,000 years old.
The last pictures I want to show you are of an iceberg that I photographed in Kirtartiwatsiaq, Greenland.
It is very rare to see an iceberg turn.
So here it is.
A small boat can be seen on the left.
It is about 4.5 meters long.
Please pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and where it touches the water.
Here you can see how it starts to rotate, and the boat has crossed to the other side, and there is a man standing there.
This is a medium-sized Greenland iceberg.
It juts out of the water about 120 feet or 40 meters.
And here is the recording in real time.
(Music) And just like that, the iceberg shows us another side of its personality.
Thank you.
(Applause)
One winter morning a few years ago, I was driving to work in Johannesburg, South Africa, and noticed a fog hanging over the city.
I drive there almost every day, so it's unlikely I wouldn't have noticed it before.
Johannesburg is known for its distinctive skyline, which I could barely see that morning.
I soon realized that it was a huge cloud of polluted air.
The contrast between the picturesque environment I was used to and the smoggy sky stirred something in me.
I was terrified that this city of colorful and picturesque sunsets would be engulfed in darkness.
At that moment I had a strong urge to do something, but I didn't know what.
All I knew was that I couldn't stay away.
The main difficulty was that I didn't know much about ecology, air quality management or atmospheric chemistry.
I'm a computer engineer, and I was pretty sure I couldn't solve this problem with code.
(Laughter) Who am I to make a difference?
But I was a resident of this city.
In the years since, I have learned one very important lesson - a lesson that must be taken seriously if we aspire to a better future.
Even if you are not an expert in a field, your outside experience can be the key to solving complex problems in that field.
Sometimes your unique vision can result in an out-of-the-box idea that moves the needle, but you have to be brave enough to try.
This is the only way out.
Even then, I realized that in order to at least try to change things for the better, I would first have to understand air pollution, so I became a student again.
Early on in my research, I learned that air pollution is a major environmental hazard.
According to the World Health Organization, nearly 14 percent of deaths worldwide in 2012 were caused by household and ambient air pollution, which is especially prevalent in low- and middle-income countries.
Air pollution alone causes more deaths each year than malaria or HIV/AIDS.
In Africa, the number of premature deaths due to unsafe sanitation or child malnutrition is dwarfed by the number of deaths due to air pollution, and it comes at a huge economic cost: more than $400 billion as of 2013, according to a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
Now in my work I am exploring new possibilities in the field of artificial intelligence, where the symbiotic relationship between man and machine will help to find a favorable basis for making the right decisions.
In the process of studying the problem of air pollution, it became clear that we need to find a way to make better decisions to control air pollution, and given the scale of this problem, we need to do it together.
So I decided to get to know the people who work in this field.
I started meeting with officials in Johannesburg and other nearby cities, I also engaged the local academic community, and I made some cold calls.
The process of networking that I engaged in helped me gain a deeper understanding of the problem.
It also helped me avoid the trap that my colleagues often fall into when trying to innovate, where we quickly apply technology before we have a clear understanding of the problem at hand.
I started thinking about what I could do to make things better.
I just started to ask myself how I could effectively combine all my skills in programming and artificial intelligence with the experience of the people I met.
I wanted to create an online air quality management platform that would identify patterns in pollution, look into the future and determine what we should expect.
I was determined to put my idea into practice, but faced with uncertainty, I had no guarantee of success.
I only had a certain set of engineering skills, skills that I had acquired in my profession (Laughter) that people who had been dealing with air pollution for many years didn't have.
I realized that sometimes just one fresh look, some new skills create the conditions for the emergence of something outstanding.
Willpower and imagination are our guiding star, giving us the ability to find new paths and circumvent difficulties.
Armed with a deep understanding of air pollution and decades of information on pollutant concentrations and meteorological conditions in Johannesburg and beyond, my colleagues from South Africa and China and I built an air decision support system that lives in the cloud.
The software system analyzes historical and real-time data to identify spatial and temporal trends.
We then used new machine learning technology to predict pollution levels for different pollutants days in advance.
This means residents can make better decisions about where they move and where their families live.
We will be able to predict pollution incidents in advance, identify the polluters who will be forced by the authorities to reduce the scale of their activities.
With the help of scenario planning, urban planners will be able to make the right decisions in the development of infrastructure such as residential settlements and industrial zones.
We have completed the testing of our technology, which lasted about 120 days, covering the whole of South Africa.
The results obtained were approved when we demonstrated a close relationship between the forecast data and the data that we obtained on site.
Thanks to our leadership, we have created cutting-edge, innovative technologies that can predict air quality with unprecedented accuracy, improving a city that not long ago I drove through one winter morning and thought, "Something is wrong here. What can be done?"
And here's my conclusion: what if I hadn't started studying air pollution?
What if I didn't express concern about the environment and just hoped that someone, somewhere was already dealing with the problem?
Here's what I've learned: When we embark on a complex undertaking that furthers something we strongly believe in, it's important to focus on success and consider the consequences of inaction.
We should not lose our way in the face of obstacles and difficulties, it should motivate us even more.
Wherever you are, when you realize that your natural curiosity is piqued by something and it's something that excites you and you have crazy and bold ideas and maybe it's out of your purview, ask yourself: why not?
Why not take action and solve the problem as best you can in your own way?
And you might be pleasantly surprised.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Republicans will propose to give another $1 trillion to support the US economy
Republicans will propose spending another $1 trillion to support the United States economy, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin confirmed on Fox News on Sunday, July 26.
"Within the $1 trillion package, there are the most priority and urgent things," the head of the US Treasury said.
The stimulus package includes new direct payments to Americans.
The proposal must be passed by Congress and signed by US President Donald Trump.
Representatives of the US Democratic Party believe that the proposed funds are not enough.
In the spring, the United States allocated about $3 trillion to support the economy.
On April 24, Trump signed a bill to provide financial assistance to the US economy in the amount of almost half a trillion dollars to combat the coronavirus and its consequences.
According to analysts, the US GDP in the second quarter of 2020 will fall by 25% in annual terms, which will be the strongest decline in the history of the country.
Microsoft will forcibly update older versions of Windows 10
Microsoft has confirmed the transition to the next stage of distribution of the May 2020 Update for the Windows 10 operating system, writes the BetaNews portal on July 25.
No need for a package: FAS questioned the legitimacy of Microsoft's anti-virus proposal
After receiving software for remote work from an American corporation, government agencies may violate the law
The company will expand the range of users with the new OS version.
For this purpose, it was decided to automatically update computers with older versions of the system.
It is assumed that the algorithm specially developed by the company will identify devices with older versions of the software platform, whose support period will soon end, and will automatically install Windows 10 May 2020 Update on them.
In the near future, this will affect computers with Windows 10 (1809) and Windows 10 (1903), whose support expires on November 10 and December 8, respectively, the publication notes.
On July 21, it was reported that after updating the Windows 10 operating system, users encountered problems connecting to the Internet - there was no network access.
The difficulties were not related to the network connection itself, but to the connection status.
Dr. Myasnikov names the main indicators of human health
In the "deadly quartet" one of the main criteria was an excess of waist size
Doctor and TV presenter Alexander Myasnikov spoke about the key indicators that can determine a person's health.
His so-called "deadly quartet" includes four criteria - an increase in blood pressure, cholesterol, sugar and waist circumference, the doctor said on the Rossiya 1 TV channel.
Butchers urged everyone to pay attention to these factors.
And according to him, it is even more important to control waist size than weight.
For men, this parameter should not exceed 102 centimeters, for women - 88 centimeters.
Exceeding these standards may indicate that health is at risk.
First of all, we are talking about the state of the heart - a waist size above normal is a risk factor for stroke, heart attack, as well as cancer and diabetes.
Earlier, Butchers told why you can eat candy at night.
The doctor explained that sugar itself is not dangerous to health, dessert will become harmful only when there is such food in large quantities, and candy at night, according to him, is not the worst snack.
"Igora Drive" determined the winners in Touring and Super Production
At the "Igora Drive" circuit, where the main stage of the Russian series of circuit races takes place, the Touring and Super Production competitions have ended.
This was reported by Channel 5 on Sunday, July 26.
The leaders in Touring were Kirill Ladygin, Dmitry Bragin, Alexey Dudukalo, Pavel Kalmanovich, Ivan Lukashevich.
Andrei Petukhov, Vladislav Nezvankin, Nikolay Vikhansky, Vadim Antipov, Dmitry Lebedev won the Super Production.
In the RSKG SMP Trophy, Rustam Fatkhutdinov was the best, Lev Tolkachev and Pavel Yashin were the winners.
The documentary "John Lewis: Good Trouble" has been released online.
The biopic, which was supposed to be a kind of visual tribute to Congressman John Lewis, who celebrated his 80th birthday at the beginning of the year, became an extended epitaph.
On July 17, the prominent human rights activist and politician died after a long battle with pancreatic cancer.
These days, numerous mourning events are held in the United States in memory of him.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows have floated the idea of legislation focused on several topics, including federal unemployment benefits, which expire on Friday.
It is proposed to deal with the remaining issues later.
Moderna Inc said on Sunday it had received an additional $472 million from the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research Projects Agency to develop a vaccine against the new coronavirus.
The US-based drugmaker explained that the additional funding is intended to help the company's work in late-stage clinical trials.
Without warning, Britain removed Spain from its list of safe countries to travel to and imposed a two-week quarantine on anyone entering the country from Spain.
British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab made no apologies for the sudden decision, attributing it to a recent spike in COVID-19 cases in Spain.
Protests
Protests were held in a number of US cities to draw attention to the issue of racial injustice.
In Seattle, police used stun grenades and tear gas and arrested 45 people after demonstrations in support of the Portland protests turned violent.
Police said more than 20 officers were injured.
In Austin, Texas, a man was killed Saturday when someone fired into a Black Lives Matter march.
According to media reports, the man may have been approaching the car with a rifle when he was shot.
US experts call Pompeo the worst secretary of state in the country's history
Foreign affairs experts Aaron David Miller and Richard Sokolsky have called Mike Pompeo the worst secretary of state in the history of the United States.
Their opinion piece was published by CNN on July 23.
"In just two short years, Mike Pompeo - with an eye on the presidency in 2024 and the support of President Donald Trump - has become not only the worst secretary of state in U.S. history, but also the most politically biased," the text reads.
The experts accused Pompeo of "politicizing the office of secretary of state and desecrating the institution he leads" to advance his personal political agenda and protect Trump "from accountability and the rule of law."
According to them, the Secretary of State, in particular, is covering up "Trump's blackmail of Ukraine" and is ready to frame employees of the American foreign policy department for their cooperation with Congress in this case.
In addition, Pompeo was reminded that he was pretty friendly with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who took partial responsibility for the murder of The Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.
Trump announced his decision to appoint Mike Pompeo to head the State Department on March 13, 2018, after firing former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.
Prior to that, Pompeo headed the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
A foreign car drove into a shop in Tikhoretsk
Today, July 26, in Tikhoretsk, on Menshikov Street, a Land Cruiser SUV drove at speed into the sales hall of a supermarket chain.
The incident was recorded by surveillance cameras.
A boy who happened to be in the store at the time was injured in the crash.
The child was hospitalized with injuries and cuts.
In the hall of the shopping facility, shop windows and counters were destroyed.
Eyewitnesses claim that the driver of the car was intoxicated.
Do you know how many species of flowering plants there are?
A quarter of a million - at least that we know of - a quarter of a million species of flowering plants.
Flowers are a real problem for plants:
they are difficult to create,
they require a huge amount of energy and resources.
Why do plants go to such trouble?
The answer to this, as to many other questions, is sex.
I know what you're thinking when you look at these pictures.
The reason sexual reproduction is so important is that there are many other ways for plants to reproduce.
They can be propagated by cuttings; they can self-fertilize or self-pollinate.
But it is very important for them to spread their genes to mix them with the genes of other plants - so they can adapt to natural niches.
That's how evolution works.
Plants transmit genetic information through pollen.
Some of you may have seen some of these images before.
As I like to say, every home should have a scanning electron microscope to look at these things.
There are as many different types of pollen as there are flowering plants.
By the way, this can be applied to forensics and beyond.
Basically, the pollen that causes allergies is pollen from plants that use the wind to spread it. It's a very inefficient process, which is why it gets stuck in our noses so much.
The plants have to throw out huge masses of pollen, in the hope that the sex cells, the male sex cells, which are contained in the pollen, will somehow accidentally get to another flower, absolutely by chance.
The pollen of all grasses, and therefore of all cereals, and the pollen of most trees, is carried by the wind.
However, most species use insects to do this. To some extent, this is more sensible because less pollen is needed.
Insects and other species can take pollen and carry it to where it is needed.
Clearly, we know the relationship between insects and plants.
It's a symbiotic relationship: whether it's flies, birds or bees, they all get something in return, and that something is usually nectar.
In some cases, this symbiosis has led to amazing adaptations - for example, the hummingbird hawk-moth is beautiful in its adaptation.
The plant gets its way - the hawk moth spreads its pollen elsewhere.
Plants have evolved to create little landing strips in different places for bees so they don't get lost.
Many plants have coloring that makes them look like insects.
These are lily anthers, cleverly made so that when an unsuspecting insect lands on them, the anther flips over and hits it on the back, showering it with a large amount of pollen, with which the insect then travels to another plant.
Here's an orchid that looks like it has jaws. In a way, it does, which forces the insect to crawl out, covered in pollen, which it will then spread.
There are at least 20,000 species of orchids - and they are all amazingly diverse.
They are up to all sorts of tricks.
They have to attract pollinators in order to reproduce.
This orchid, known as Darwin's orchid because he was the one who studied it and made a startling prediction when he saw it, you can see a very long nectar tube coming down from the orchid.
You can see the middle of the flower: the insect has to stick its proboscis right in the middle and reach the very bottom of this tube to get the nectar.
Darwin stated, looking at this flower, "I suppose something has co-evolved with it."
And sure enough, here comes the insect.
Normally his proboscis is curled up, but in its straightened form it looks like this.
One might think that if nectar - so valuable and expensive to produce - attracts so much attention from pollinators, then, as with sex in humans, deceptions might ensue.
A flower might say, "I have some nectar.
Will you look in?" Here is the plant.
This is a plant that insects love in South Africa. They have evolved a long proboscis to get nectar from the bottom.
And this is imitation.
This plant mimics the previous one.
And here's a long-tongued fly that didn't get a drop of nectar from the fake. Because the mimicking plant didn't give it any. It thought it would get something.
But the fly not only did not get the nectar from the fake plant, but also - if you zoom in - in the area of the lower part of the head, picked up some pollen, which it will transfer to another plant, unless some botanist appears and pins it on a blue cardboard.
(Laughter) The deception extends to the vegetable kingdom.
This flower has black dots: they look black to us, but to the male insects of a certain species, they look like two females ready for anything.
(Laughter) When the insect gets to this flower and lands on it, it dips itself into the pollen, which of course it will transfer to another plant. If you look into the same scanning electron microscope, which should be in every home, you can observe a certain three-dimensional arrangement of the pattern here.
So it probably even feels good to the insect, in addition to looking attractive.
The picture from the electron microscope - here is an orchid imitating an insect - shows that different parts of this structure have different colors and textures, but insects can perceive them completely differently.
This plant has adapted to mimic the shiny metal surface of the body of some beetles.
Under a scanning electron microscope, you can see that the surface is very different from the surfaces we were looking at.
Sometimes the whole plant mimics an insect, even from our perspective.
I think it looks like some kind of flying creature.
It's an amazing, amazing flower.
And clever. It's called obsidian.
I call him Chitrodian.
To a bee of a certain species, he resembles another very aggressive bee, and it flies up and headbutts him many times to drive the "bee" away, and of course gets covered in pollen.
This plant also mimics another orchid that has a wonderful storehouse of food for insects.
And this one has nothing for them.
So she's cheating on two levels - just unheard of.
(Laughter) This is ylang-ylang, a component of many perfumes.
I recently smelled someone who had smelled it.
The flowers don't really need to be that fragrant.
They emit a startling array of odors for any insect with a sense of smell.
That doesn't smell so good.
It's a flower that smells really, really bad, and it's evolved to look like carrion.
The flies love it.
They fly in and pollinate.
This one, helicodiceros, is also known as the dead horse lily.
I don't know what a dead horse really smells like, but this sure smells a lot like it.
It's really terrible.
And meat flies just can't resist.
They fly inside and reach the very bottom.
There they lay their eggs, thinking that this is a great piece of carrion, and not realizing that there is no food for the larvae and the larvae will die, but in the meantime the plant has benefited because the bristles relax and the fly flies off to pollinate the next flower. It's amazing.
Here is an arum, an arum maculatum, or in the United States, a spotted arum.
I photographed him the previous week in Dorset.
It heats up to about 15 degrees above the ambient temperature - amazing.
If you look at it from above, you can see what looks like a dam behind the cob. The flies are attracted by the heat - the evaporation of volatile compounds - and they get stuck at the bottom of this container.
They drink the divine nectar and become sticky.
Overnight, they get covered in pollen flowing over the top of them, and then the bristles we saw above loosen and release the pollen-covered flies. Amazing stuff.
If you think that's amazing, here's one of my favorites.
Philodendron Sello.
Those from Brazil should know about this plant.
It's the most amazing thing.
This phallic thing is about a foot long.
It does something that no other plant I know of does: when it blooms - here in the middle of the cob - for about two days, its metabolism is similar to that of a mammal.
Instead of starch, which is plant food, it takes something that looks like brown fat and burns it at this rate, digesting it in the same way as a small cat.
This energy output, in equivalent weight, is twice that of a hummingbird - quite astounding.
And it does something else, also unusual.
Not only does it heat itself up to 115 Fahrenheit, or 43-44 Celsius, within two days, but it also keeps the temperature constant.
It has a thermoregulation mechanism that maintains a constant temperature.
You ask, "Why is he doing this?"
Well, as if you didn't know that there are beetles that just love to make love at this temperature.
They get inside and that's where it starts.
(Laughter) And the plant showers them with pollen, and they go off to pollinate.
Amazingly contrived.
Most pollinators that we know of are insects, but in the tropics many birds and butterflies also pollinate.
Many tropical flowers are red, and it seems to us that this is because butterflies and birds have vision similar to ours, and that they see red very well.
But if you look at the spectrum, humans and birds see red, green and blue - they see that spectrum.
Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet, and they distinguish different shades of ultraviolet,
who are at that end of the spectrum.
You're probably thinking, "It would be great if we could see them."
Yes, we can.
So what does an insect see?
Last week, I took these pictures of sunflowers, the frankincense family, in Dorset.
These are the same little yellow flowers that we see everywhere.
This is what it looks like in daylight.
And this is what it looks like when you take away the red.
Most bees can't see red.
Then I put ultraviolet filters on the camera and took a very, very long exposure with certain frequencies of ultraviolet, and this is what I got.
There is no such thing as an "apple."
Of course, we don't know what the bees see any more than you know what I see when I call this red.
We cannot tell what is going on in the mind of a neighbor, let alone an insect.
But the picture will have about the same contrast, standing out strongly against the background.
Here's another little flower - different range of ultraviolet frequencies, different filters to match the pollinators.
They will see something like this.
Just in case you think this applies to all yellow flowers - no flowers were harmed in the process, this one was just attached to a tripod, not plucked - when they're in UV light, take a look at this one.
By the way, it could serve as the basis of a sunscreen, because such creams work by absorbing ultraviolet radiation.
Maybe this connection would be useful.
Finally, here's one of the oenothers that Bjorn Rorslett from Norway sent me - a fantastic hidden pattern.
I like the idea of something hidden.
I think there's something poetic about it. These photos were taken with an ultraviolet filter, which is mostly used by astronomers to photograph Venus - actually the clouds of Venus.
This is the main purpose of this filter.
Venus, of course, is the goddess of love and fertility, which is consonant with flowers.
Flowers not only spend a lot of effort to attract pollinators, they also somehow managed to convince us to plant whole fields of flowers and give them to each other at the moments of birth and death, and, in particular, at the wedding, which, if you think about it, is a moment that represents the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
China's Yangtze River floods for third time this year
After a heavy downpour, the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, China's longest waterway, flooded for the third time this year.
The flood was caused by an increase in the water level in the tributaries of the river in its upper reaches, which led to a rapid increase in the flow of water into the reservoir of the Chinese hydroelectric power station "Sanxia" / "Three Gorges."
At 14:00 on July 26, an inflow of 50 thousand cubic meters per second was observed in the reservoir, which is expected to reach its maximum of 60 thousand cubic meters per second in the evening of July 27, according to the Yangtze River Water Management Committee under the Ministry of Water Resources of the People's Republic of China.
The committee today issued flood alerts for a section of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and the overflowing reservoir of the Sanxia hydropower station.
My job is to help computers report on the world around them.
There are many ways to do this, but I like to help computers talk about what they see and understand.
For example, in this picture, a modern computer vision algorithm can recognize that this is a woman and this is a dog.
He can tell that the woman is smiling.
He is even able to say that the dog is unusually cute.
I work on this by thinking about how people understand and process data about the world.
What thoughts, memories and stories a picture like this can evoke in people.
Everything to do with situations like this.
You may have seen a similar dog before or spent time running on the beach in the same way, and this in turn triggers thoughts and memories of a past holiday, time spent at the beach, or time spent running somewhere with other dogs.
One of my main principles is to help computers understand what it means to have these experiences, to understand what we share, what we believe and what we feel, because then we will be ready to start involving computer technology in processes that complement our own experience.
Digging deeper, a few years ago I started helping computers write stories based on a series of images.
And one day at work, I asked the computer what it thought about going to Australia.
He looked at the pictures and saw a koala.
He did not know what a koala was, but said he thought it was a curious creature.
Then I shared with him a series of images about burning houses.
He looked at the pictures and said: "Amazing view! Amazing!"
It sent shivers down my spine.
He was looking at a horrible, life-destroying event and thinking it was something positive.
I understood that he recognized the contrasts, the shades of red and yellow, and thought it deserved a positive assessment.
In part, he did this because most of the images I gave him were positive.
Because people tend to share positive images when they talk about their experiences.
When was the last time you saw a selfie at a funeral?
I realized that by perfecting artificial intelligence, task by task, dataset by dataset, I had created huge gaps, holes, and gaps in what it could understand.
And in doing so, I encoded all kinds of biases.
Biases that reflect a limited vision confined to a single data set. Gaps that reflect human biases encoded in the data, such as bias and stereotypes.
I thought about the evolution of technology that led me to where I was then - how the first color photographs were calibrated to the skin of white women, which meant that color photographs were not adapted to dark faces.
And the same prejudice, the same gap was observed in the 1990s.
And that's the same information gap we have today in how well we can recognize diverse human faces with facial recognition technology.
I was thinking about the latest research, where we tend to limit our thinking to one data set and one problem.
And by doing so, we created more and more gaps and biases that the AI could develop even more.
I realized that we need to think more about how the technologies we work with today will look in 5 and 10 years.
Humanity evolves slowly, correcting problems in the interaction of people and the environment over time.
Artificial intelligence, on the other hand, is evolving at an incredible rate.
And that means it's really important to think carefully about this right now - to reflect on our own gaps, our own biases and how that affects the technologies we create, and to discuss what today's technologies will mean in the future.
Top managers and scientists around the world talk about what they think artificial intelligence will be like in the future.
Stephen Hawking warns: 'AI could spell the end of humanity'
Elon Musk warns that this is one of the greatest existential risks our civilization has ever faced.
Bill Gates is perplexed: "I don't understand why people are not concerned."
But those opinions are only part of the story.
The mathematics, the models, the foundational building blocks of artificial intelligence are what we call access and work with.
We have open source tools for machine learning and intelligence that we are willing to share.
And beyond that, we can share our experiences.
Sharing our knowledge about technology and how it worries us and how it excites us.
We can discuss what we love.
We can anticipate which aspects of technology are likely to be most useful over time and which are likely to be most problematic.
If we all focus on an open dialogue about AI in the perspective of the future, it will help to create an atmosphere of general awareness of what AI is now, what it can become, and what we should do to get the most suitable result for us.
We already see and know all of this about the technologies in use today.
We use smartphones, digital assistants and robot vacuum cleaners.
Are they evil?
Maybe sometimes.
Are they useful?
Of course.
And they are all different.
And in them you already see a ray of light illuminating our future.
The future begins with what we create and build right now.
We are starting the domino effect that will determine the path of AI development.
Right now, we are shaping the AI of the future.
Technologies that immerse us in augmented realities bring past worlds back to life.
Technologies that help people share experiences when they have difficulty communicating.
Technologies based on the understanding of streaming visual worlds are used for self-driving cars.
Technologies based on image understanding and language generation are evolving into technologies that help visually impaired people better access the visual world.
But we also see how technology can lead to problems.
Today, we have technologies that analyze our innate physical characteristics - such as skin color or facial features - to determine whether we might be criminals or terrorists.
We have technology that analyzes data about us, even data like gender or race, to determine whether we can get a loan.
Everything we see now is just one snapshot of the evolution of artificial intelligence.
Because where we are now is just a moment in that evolution.
This means that everything we do today will have an impact on our future.
If we want AI to evolve to help humans, we need to define the goals and strategies that will set that path now.
I would like to see something that fits people well, fits with our culture and environment.
Technologies that help those of us with neurological or other conditions to make life equally difficult for all.
Technology that works regardless of your skin color or demographic.
Today I am focused on the technologies that will be with us tomorrow and in 10 years.
AI can be anything.
But in this case, it's not a self-driving car with no final destination.
We are driving this car.
We choose when to speed up and when to slow down.
We choose when we need to turn.
We choose what the AI of the future will be.
There are countless things that artificial intelligence can become.
And it will become many things.
And our task today is to figure out what exactly we should invest in AI to get the best results for all of us.
Thank you

Almost 9.5 thousand cases of CoViD-19 infection have been recorded in the Arctic
158 new cases of coronavirus infection were detected in Murmansk region.
In the city of Murmansk, 135 new cases of CoViD-19 infection were recorded.
In total, the total number of confirmed cases of new coronavirus infection in the region is 9,469.
The head of Dagestan discussed the construction of several sports facilities with Khabib Nurmagomedov.
The head of Dagestan Vladimir Vasilyev held a meeting with the current UFC lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov, the website of the head of the republic reports.
The reason was sports facilities, in the construction of which the late father of the champion, the honored coach of Russia Abdulmanap Nurmagomedov, showed great interest.
We are talking about a sports complex in the village of Dubki, Kazbekovsky District, and a martial arts training center in the village of Sildi, Tsumadinsky District.
First of all, Vladimir Vasilyev noted that now the construction of these sports facilities is also a tribute to the memory of the great coach.
The father of the baby kidnapped in Salsk has revealed details of the incident
The father of a newborn kidnapped from a maternity hospital in Salsk, Rostov region, has revealed details of the incident.
Alexander Rusikov told the TV channel "360" that the kidnapper entered his wife's room when she was about to go to the toilet.
The mother of the kidnapped baby could not even think that a person with evil intent could be in the hospital.
The woman moved away from the ward just a couple of metres when she heard her neighbour scream.
The baby was no longer in the room.
According to Rusikov, it all happened between three and four in the morning.
He also said that the wife's room is located between two medical posts, but there were no nurses at the time of the incident.
Also, the father of the kidnapped baby said that there was no comment or apology from the hospital staff.
Recall that a newborn boy abducted on Saturday from a maternity hospital in Salsk was found the same day in the Republic of Kalmykia.
Police arrested a 40-year-old suspect in the kidnapping.
The child has been returned to his mother.
Doctors took tests from the baby to make sure he was healthy and unharmed.

Three people died.
Expert assesses the role of vitamins in the formation of immunity
Andrei Tyazhelnikov, chief external specialist for primary health care for the adult population of the Moscow Department of Health, assessed the role of vitamins in the formation of immunity.
"It is impossible to create a stable immunity with extra doses of some drugs, vitamins or food in a very short time," he said in an interview with Govorit Moskva radio station.
According to him, there are certain rules.
For example, in summer it is better to spend more time outdoors, including in the sun.
Tyazhelnikov also noted that in the summer, if possible, it is necessary to consume a large amount of seasonal fresh vegetables and fruits.
"It generally strengthens the immune system, gives a certain amount of vitamins and a certain amount of health," he added.
Earlier, Tyazhelnikov mentioned several differences between the flu and the coronavirus.
5,765 COVID-19 cases registered in Russia in 24 hours
In Russia, 5,765 new cases of coronavirus infection were detected per day by July 26, according to the website stopcoronavirus.rf, based on data from the federal operational headquarters.
During the entire observation period, 812,485 COVID-19 cases were recorded in Russia.
During the day 77 people with confirmed coronavirus died, the total number of COVID-19-related deaths in Russia reached 13,269.
The number of COVID-19 cases in the world has exceeded 16 million, according to Johns Hopkins University.
More than 4.1 million of them are in the United States, and more than 2.3 million are in Brazil.
Russia ranks fourth in the world in the total number of cases, third behind India (1.3 million cases).
In total, more than 644,000 people have died from coronavirus in the world, and more than 9.2 million have recovered.
Head of the region Igor Kobzev met with mayors of Ust-Orda Buryat district
During a working meeting held today, July 24, the government of the Irkutsk region discussed the main directions for the development of remote agricultural areas.
During his working visits to the districts of the Ust-Orda Buryat district, the head of the region gave a number of instructions.
Today, the mayors reported on their implementation.
First of all, the construction of the Sports House in Ust-Orda has been resumed.
The order for this facility was given by the President of the Russian Federation fourteen years ago.
But it is only now that the situation has been brought to a head.
866 million rubles will be spent on the construction.
The deadline for the construction is 2022.
A school in the village of Bayandai is to be commissioned this year.
At the moment, the decoration of the premises has been completed.
The remaining work is landscaping.
In general, the program of construction of preschool and secondary education facilities is of particular importance for the region.
Especially for your district.
The demographics here are the best in the region.
And we must create all conditions for education and leisure for children of all ages, - said Igor Kobzev, Acting Governor of Irkutsk Region.
At the meeting, the head of the region instructed all mayors to actively participate in the development of master plans for settlements.
This is one of the main conditions for the comprehensive development of the district.
All settlements must have defined boundaries and a master plan.
This is necessary for the development of the territory, for the construction of socially significant facilities, as well as infrastructure and cultural heritage, the head of the region stressed.
Also during the conversation, a problematic issue was raised with a 30% reduction in the intake of milk from cooperatives.
This was due to the redistribution of milk purchases by the processing company in favour of peasant farms.
Because of this, the share of receiving products from cooperatives has decreased.
The head of the region instructed the acting minister of agriculture to go to the site, study the structure of milk sales, analyze the experience of other territories and determine options for solving the problem.
Kuzminov won two races of the second stage of the RSKG SMP at "Igora Drive."
The second round of the second stage of the SMP RSKG championship was held at Igora Drive.
Pavel Kuzminov earned his second consecutive victory.
He started fifth, but took the lead on the first lap.
Alexander Dudarev, who came in second, moved up from sixth place.
Sergey Tikhomirov lost his position, fought off the attacks of Alexander Chernyak and at first gained a foothold in third place, but received a drive through penalty and after driving through the pitlane was eliminated from the fight for the podium.
Ivan Pugachev finished third, gaining five positions.
The authorities of the Moscow region spoke about the fate of closed dumps
Solid waste landfills continue to be closed in the Moscow region.
This year, the authorities are promising to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 landfills that existed in the region are being upgraded into modern waste processing facilities.
But this option is not possible for every landfill - many of them are overgrown with dense residential development.
After the landfill is closed, it is subject to reclamation - the body of the landfill is covered with soil, and degassing and infiltrate removal systems are installed.
This allows you to stop the chemical processes inside the landfill so that it does not ignite, does not emit a stench, and does not poison the soil and groundwater.
And then the former landfill is left to rise in a useless heap among the residential buildings that surround it.
Why not make something useful out of it?
For example, in Ruza, where the reclamation of the Annino landfill was completed just a few days ago, the authorities are considering the option of turning the heap into a ski slope.
This landfill, which operated from 1976 to 2016, grew so much that it exceeded the boundaries of the land allocated for it.
Therefore, during the reclamation, it was necessary to buy out the neighboring plots, which had de facto been clogged with garbage for a long time.
"Some time will pass, the range will "settle down," it will gain strength, and we will think about what can be done to make it useful.
What catches the eye is the ski resort," Nikolai Parfenov, head of the Ruza district, told reporters.
Two landfills will become sites for the production of renewable energy
The Torbeevo landfills in Lyubertsy and Timokhovo in Bogorodsky District will become sites for the production of renewable energy sources from landfill and biological gases.
By the end of the year, a gas piston power plant will be launched on the territory of Torbeyev, capable of generating up to 8 million kilowatt-hours of electricity and about 0.95 gigacalories of thermal energy per year, which will provide for the landfill's own needs - heat supply for administrative and industrial premises.
Timokhovo will produce 72.5 million kilowatt hours and will continue to operate as a waste treatment facility.
And a museum may be created at the Balashikha "Kuchino" firing range, which was closed after residents complained about the "Direct Line" with the country's president.
"There was such an idea - to create a museum of landfill reclamation in the Moscow region," said Deputy Prime Minister - Minister of Ecology and Natural Resources of the region Dmitry Kurakin.
Israel reports drone crash in southern Lebanon
An Israeli army drone has crashed in southern Lebanon.
The military said he collapsed "during an operational activity."
The cause of the crash has not been reported.
"Some time ago, during an operational activity near the border with Lebanon, an unmanned aerial vehicle of the Israeli army fell in Lebanese territory.
There is no risk of information leakage," the Israeli army said on Twitter.
Recall that this week the Israeli army decided to strengthen its military units on the border with Lebanon, fearing the revenge of the Lebanese Hezbollah movement for the killing of its fighters in Syria.
Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah promised not to let the death of any of his "brothers" go unanswered.
Read more about the situation in the Kommersant article "Israel is waiting for Hezbollah's revenge."
Furgal's replacement first came out to the protesters
The acting governor of the Khabarovsk Territory, Mikhail Degtyarev, for the first time after his appointment, came out to the protesters in support of the arrested former head of the region, Sergey Furgal.
The meeting was broadcast on his Instagram page.
"Moscow hears everyone, that's why it sent you an acting governor, so that the region does not slide without power... I repeat once again about Furgal: he is "a" - my comrade, "b" - a party member, "c" - I am very worried about his fate, the party is helping him, giving him food, Zhirinovsky is knocking on all the offices," the acting governor said.
According to Degtyarev, now the Khabarovsk Territory cannot remain without a leader, so he was appointed to the post of head of the region by decree of President Vladimir Putin, so that "the wonderful building (the regional government) functions, everything works, the budget is spent on social needs."
The acting governor explained that he did not go to the protesters earlier because he could not communicate with thousands of demonstrators.
So he broadcasts on social media and reads all the comments on them.
On July 25, two consecutive protests were held in Khabarovsk.
Rallies in support of the former governor have been held in the region since July 11.
On the eve of the next rally, Mikhail Degtyarev announced that he would leave the city on the day of the rally.
His motorcade was stopped by protesters who called on him to speak out about the fate of the arrested ex-governor Furgal.
Degtyarev had previously refused to meet with the protesters.
"There is actually something for the head to do than to go out and communicate with those who are shouting under the windows," the acting governor said.
Today I would like to show you how in the future we will do different things.
I believe that soon our buildings and machines will be self-assembling, reproducing and repairing themselves.
So I'm going to show you what I think the current stage of industrial development is, and then compare it to some natural systems.
So, at the current stage of industrial development, we have skyscrapers - 2.5 years old, 500,000 to a million parts, quite complex, new amazing technologies in steel, concrete and glass.
We have amazing machines that can take us into space - 5 years, 2.5 million parts.
But on the other hand, if we look at natural systems, we see proteins of two million species that can assemble in 10,000 nanoseconds, or a DNA strand with three billion base pairs that we can copy in about an hour.
So natural systems, for all their complexity, are extremely efficient, far more efficient than anything we can build, far more complex than anything we can build.
They are much more energy efficient.
They are almost never wrong.
And they can repair themselves over a long lifetime.
So there is something very interesting about natural systems.
And if we can translate that into our built environment, our way of making things has tremendous potential.
And I think the key is self-assembly.
So, if we want to use self-assembly in our physical environment, I think there are four key factors to consider.
The first is to decipher the complexity of what we want to build - our buildings and machines.
And we need to break them down into a simple sequence - the basic DNA of construction processes.
Then we need programmable parts that can understand that sequence and use it to fold or reassemble themselves.
We will need some amount of energy that will allow all this to activate, make the parts able to assemble according to the program.
And we need some kind of back-up error correction system to ensure that we can successfully build what we want.
I'm going to show you some of the projects that my colleagues and I at MIT are working on to achieve this self-assembling future.
The first two are MacroBot and DeciBot.
These are projects - large-scale reconfigurable robots - 2.5 and 3.5 meter squirrels.
They are embedded with mechanical electrical devices and sensors.
You draw what you need to fold into a sequence of angles - minus 120, minus 120, 0, 0, 120, minus 120 - something like that; a sequence of angles or turns, and you send that sequence down the cord.
Each block receives its message - minus 120. It turns to this corner, checks if everything is correct and transmits the information to the neighbor.
And these are the brilliant scientists, engineers and designers who worked on this project.
And I think that really brings up the question: Is there a different scale here?
I mean, thousands of dollars, a lot of man hours to make this 2.5 meter robot.
Can we really scale up? Can we really build robotics into every part?
The next project addresses this issue, considering the passive nature or trying to get the modification programmability passively.
But he goes a step further and tries to get a real calculation.
At its core, it has the most fundamental building block of computing, the logic element of a digital integrated circuit directly in every part.
This is the "AND-NOT" element.
You have one tetrahedron, the element that will do all the calculations, and two tetrahedrons for input.
One for user input, that's how you lay bricks.
Another for information from the previous brick laid.
And then it displays the information in three-dimensional space.
So, this means that the user can start moving the bricks in the right direction.
His calculations are based on what has been done before and what you have told him to do.
And now he begins to move in three-dimensional space - up or down.
On the left side, [1,1] input equals 0 output, moving down.
On the right side, [0,0] input is 1 on the output, which means upward movement.
And what is really important is that our structures now contain the blueprints of what we want to build.
They contain all the information about what has been built.
So this means that we have some form of self-replication.
In this case, I call it self-directed reproduction because the structures contain clear blueprints.
If errors occur, you can replace the part.
All local information is saved so you know how to fix it.
So you can have something that moves and reads information and can transmit it from one part to another.
It's built right in, with no external controls.
The last project I'm going to show you is called Displaced Circuits, and it's probably the most exciting example we have right now of passive self-assembling systems.
It combines the ability to reconfigure and program and creates a completely passive system.
Basically, we have a chain of elements.
All the elements are completely identical, and offset.
So every circuit or every element wants to turn right or left.
And when you assemble a circuit, you're essentially programming it.
You tell each block which way it should turn: right or left.
So when you shake the chain, it folds into whatever configuration you've programmed - in this case, a spiral, or in this case, two cubes next to each other.
So basically you can program any three-dimensional shape - or one-dimensional, two-dimensional - out of these completely passive circuits.
So what does this tell us about the future?
I think it tells us that there are new opportunities for self-assembly, replication, repair in our physical structures, buildings, machines.
New programming is possible in these parts.
And from there, you have new possibilities in computing.
We will have spatial computers.
Imagine if our buildings, our bridges, our cars, all of our bricks could compute.
It's an amazing parallel and distributed scrubbing power, new design possibilities.
This is an incredible potential.
I think that the projects that I have shown you are just a small step towards the future, if we implement these new technologies, towards a new self-assembling future.
Thank you.

The number of deaths from coronavirus in the world has exceeded 640,000
More than 15.7 million people are infected
The number of coronavirus victims in the world has exceeded 640,000, and almost 15.7 million cases of infection have been confirmed.
Such data was provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) on Sunday, July 26.
According to the information provided, 200,625 new cases of coronavirus infection and 4,823 deaths were detected in the world over the past 24 hours.
During the pandemic, the world has already recorded 15,785,641 cases of coronavirus infection, and the number of deaths has risen to 640,016.
The United States remains the leader in the number of infected and dead, with more than 4.3 million infected and more than 149,000 deaths.
In second place is Brazil, where the number of cases has now exceeded 2.4 million, and 86,500 coronavirus patients have already died.
India is next, with 1.4 million cases and nearly 33,000 deaths.
We will remind, a day earlier, the number of people infected with coronavirus in the world during the day broke a new record.
In 24 hours, doctors identified 284,196 new cases.
The previous record was 247,225.
that linked the Vatican and Nazi Germany
This week marks the 87th anniversary of the signing of a treaty between the Vatican and Nazi Germany.
The document, signed a few months after Hitler came to power, became the foundation on which the Holy See's relations with the Nazis were built.
One of those who prepared the treaty was Cardinal Pacelli, who became Pope Pius XII six years before the outbreak of the Second World War.
In Sochi, the body of a dump truck collapsed onto the cab of a truck, killing the driver.
Footage has emerged online showing an accident that occurred last Saturday, July 25, at a construction site in Sochi.
The recording shows how, during unloading operations, the lifted body of the dump truck crashed down, landing directly in the cab of the truck.
According to the Ministry of Emergency Situations, the 59-year-old man who was driving died on the spot from his injuries.
Rescuers were needed to retrieve the body of the deceased.
Beautiful tall minarets adorned the Hagia Sophia
Once again about the Hagia Sophia - I came across a text by Fr Vladimir Zelinsky saying that we should protest.
First, there was free admission - hooray!
I have not been to Istanbul, but a free entrance to the House of God is better than a paid one.
Second, the Muslims conquered this land as honestly as the Orthodox conquered the Volga-Oka interfluve, the Muslim Caucasus (and put a church in Grozny) and planted apple trees on Mars.
God help us!
The Jews conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans conquered America.
Are we going to return everything to everyone?
Do you think there will be no pagans who will demand the return of their temple, on the site of which is the Church of the Tithes?
Thirdly, the Muslims improved the building and invested in it.
In other words, it belongs to them, just as the factories and estates that the Leninists seized from the bourgeoisie belong to the Leninists - Putin and the rest of the nomenklatura.
They improved everything from the Kremlin to the Angara, so it's all theirs by right of progressives.
The beautiful tall minarets decorated the Hagia Sophia very, very much.
There was a stupid inkwell, and then there was a stupid inkwell with beautiful minarets.
Fourth, there are no "Islamic" or "Orthodox" civilizations.
There are believers, there are hypocrites, there are hypocrites who combine faith and hypocrisy.
The believer does not think in terms of civilization.
This is the thinking of the British Foreign Office official Toynbee, a believer is ashamed to think so.
And for a believer, everywhere is a place of prayer.
And always.
The believer does not pray only where he is asked to leave, but goes to another place and prays there.
He is a believer, not a defender.
We are koloboks, not sullen stones.
The work week in St. Petersburg will start with warm and dry weather
It will be partly cloudy in St. Petersburg on Monday, July 27, with no precipitation expected.
This was reported by the press service of the Main Directorate of the Ministry of Emergency Situations for the city with reference to the forecast of the North-West Directorate for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring.
During the night, a variable wind speed of 1-4 meters per second is expected.
In the afternoon, southeast wind at a speed of 2-7 meters per second.
The air temperature at night will be +13...+15 degrees.
In the afternoon, the temperature will rise to +24...+26 degrees.
Atmospheric pressure will increase throughout the day.
During the broadcast of the Navy Day parade, the camera "went under the ship"
Also on Victory Day, the camera flew through the muzzle of a tank
Today, July 26, a parade is held in St. Petersburg in honor of the Navy Day.
During the filming, one of the cameras filming the equipment "went under the ship."
The use of new camera technology allowed viewers to see the underwater part of the parade.
In the same perspective, the course of the newest serial small missile ship "Sovetsk" was shown.
It ran along the Admiralty Embankment.
Recall that at the parade on June 24 dedicated to the 75th anniversary of the Victory, the camera passed through the barrel into the turret of one of the tanks and showed what equipment is inside the grandiose military machine.
At that time, a record number of military vehicles - 234 combat vehicles - took part in the anniversary Victory Parade.
They showed a number of new products that went to the main square of the country for the first time, for example, the upgraded T-90M and T-80BVM main battle tanks.
The upgraded BMP-2M infantry fighting vehicles with the "Berezhok" combat module also passed through Red Square for the first time on June 24.
Almost half of Britons believe the Kremlin interfered in the Brexit referendum
Almost half of Britons - 49% - believe that Russia tried to influence the course of the 2016 referendum on Britain's exit from the European Union.
This was reported by the Guardian newspaper, citing the results of a poll conducted by Opinium.
It is reported that 23% of respondents hold the opposite opinion on this issue.
47% of respondents also believe that the Kremlin interfered in the last general election in the UK in 2019.
July will end hot, August will start cool
Over the weekend, Moscow and the region experienced the coldest night in July.
There was, of course, no bone-chilling apocalypse of frost.
But it's chilly for the height of summer.
Before talking about the weather in Moscow on July 27 - August 2, 2020, it is worth noting that on the night of Saturday, July 25, the air cooled to +8.8 degrees in the capital.
Kolomna even set a new temperature record: +7 degrees (the previous minimum for July 25 was held since 1964, more than half a century).
The cold pole near Moscow was Cherusti - thermometers there showed +3.9 degrees.
However, during the day on both Saturday and Sunday it was quite comfortable.
Although compared to climatic norms, it is still 2 - 3 degrees cooler.
Not just warmth, but real heat will return to Moscow on weekdays.
On Monday, July 27, the Hydrometeorological Center of Russia promises +26 degrees, on Tuesday and Wednesday +28...+29, on Thursday, July 30, +26 degrees.
Short rains every day, with thunderstorms in the middle of the week.
The last day of July and the first days of August (that is, next weekend) will be cool, no higher than +19...+24 degrees.
And it won't be without rain.
Rwandan man admits to setting fire to Nantes cathedral
A native of Rwanda, who worked at the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul in the French city of Nantes on a voluntary basis, confessed to his arson a week after the fire.
This was reported on Sunday by France 3 television.
According to him, the man, who was already detained on July 19, the day after the fire, was detained again the day before.
He appeared before an investigating magistrate on Saturday evening.
After being charged with malicious damage to property, the man admitted to setting fires in three locations - under a large organ, under a small organ and near an electrical panel.
He now faces up to 10 years in prison and 150,000 euros in fines.
The motives of the 39-year-old Rwandan have not yet been reported.
It is only known that he voluntarily helped in the cathedral and had to close its doors on the day of the fire.
However, according to CCTV footage, he left the religious institution 15 minutes after receiving calls about a fire in the building.
A fire broke out in the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul on July 18.
More than 200 firefighters battled for hours to save the gothic monument.
However, they were unable to save the Louis XII stained glass windows and the unique Baroque organ.
The situation was brought under control only three hours after the fire started.
No one was injured in the incident.
The current fire is not the first during the existence of the temple.
In 1972, a fire destroyed its roof.
It took 13 years to clean up the aftermath of that fire.
The cathedral was reopened to parishioners only in 1985.
Legendary journeyman goalkeeper Pfannenstiel could become an Inter scout.
Former German goalkeeper Lutz Pfannenstiel could join Inter's staff.
According to Kicker, the 47-year-old has been offered the position of head of scouting.
Pfannenstiel held a similar position at Fortuna Düsseldorf from December 2018 to May 2020, having previously worked at Hoffenheim.
As a player, Pfannenstiel became famous for his frequent transfers.
He is the only professional player to have played in all six FIFA confederations, changing more than 20 clubs, including representatives of the championships of Singapore, South Africa, New Zealand, Canada, Namibia and several other countries.
It is believed that only sighted people can drive a car.
Until recently, it was believed that safe and independent driving was an impossible task for a blind person.
Hi, I'm Denis Hong, and we give blind people freedom and independence by designing cars for the visually impaired.
Before I talk about this car for the blind, I'll briefly talk about another project I've been working on called the DARPA Urban Challenge.
The project was to create a self-driving robot car.
The driver presses "start" and the car reaches its destination without his participation.
In 2007, our team won half a million dollars, taking third place in this competition.
Around the same time, the National Federation of the Blind, or NFB, tasked a research committee with developing a car that could be operated independently and safely by a blind person.
We decided to give it a try because we thought, "Hey, what's the big deal?
We already have an autonomous car.
Let's put a blind man in it and be done with it, shall we?"
(Laughter) But we were dead wrong.
The NSF wanted not just a car that would transport the blind, but a car that the blind could drive themselves.
So we had to scrap everything and start from scratch.
So, to test this crazy idea, we developed a small prototype buggy car to test the feasibility of the project.
And in the summer of 2009, we invited blind young people from all over the country and gave them the opportunity to test this car.
It was an amazing experience.
But the catch is that this car was designed to be driven in a highly controlled environment, namely a flat, enclosed car park where even the lanes are restricted by red traffic cones.
Due to this success, we decided to take the next big step and develop a real car that could be driven on real roads.
So how does it work?
Well, it's a pretty complicated system, but let me explain, maybe even simplify it.
So, it includes three components.
This is tactile perception, computation and non-visual interfaces.
Since the driver cannot see anything, the system must perceive the environment and gather information for the driver.
For this purpose, the initial parameter meter is used.
It measures acceleration, angular acceleration, similar to the human inner ear.
This information is then transmitted to a GPS device to estimate the location of the vehicle.
Two cameras are used to detect lanes on the road
and three laser rangefinders.
Lasers scan the space around the car to detect various objects: an approaching oncoming or overtaking car, any obstacles encountered on the road or around the car.
Then all this huge amount of information is fed into a computer, and the computer performs two steps.
First of all, it is the processing of this information to get an idea of space: determining the lanes on the road, identifying obstacles, and then communicating this information to the driver.
The system is also smart enough to calculate the safest way to drive.
So, we can also make recommendations on how to operate the machine.
But the problem is how to convey this information and instructions to a blind person who does not have the quick and accurate reactions necessary for driving?
For this purpose, we have developed a number of interface technologies for the blind:
A three-dimensional ping sound system, a vibrating vest, a steering wheel with audible signals, a special prosthetic leg, and even shoes that put pressure on the foot.
But today we will talk only about three types of these special interfaces.
The first interface is called DriveGrip.
It's a pair of gloves with motors on the knuckles that instruct the driver how to steer: the direction and angle of the turn.
Another device is the SpeedStrip.
Initially, it is a massage chair.
Vibration is used to transmit speed information to the driver, as well as to guide the use of the accelerator and brake pedals.
So, here you can see how the computer perceives the space around the car. And since the vibration can not be seen, the driver is equipped with red LEDs to demonstrate the process.
This is sensory data, it is transmitted to devices via a computer.
DriveGrip and SpeedStrip are very effective.
But the problem is that these are educational prompting devices.
They don't really give free reign, do they?
The on-board computer gives the driver commands: "left," "right," "speed up," "stop."
We call him "the annoying passenger in the back seat."
Therefore, we are moving away from educational prompting devices and focusing on informing devices.
A great example of such an interface is AirPix.
This is a kind of monitor for the blind.
A small panel with many holes through which compressed air comes out, thereby creating images.
A blind person can hold their hand up to this panel and "see" lanes on the roadway and obstacles.
Also, the driver can change the frequency at which the air comes out and, possibly, the air temperature.
In other words, it is an interface for displaying multidimensional data.
So here you can see the left and right camera of the car, and how the computer processes and sends this information to the AirPix panel.
Here we demonstrate the simulator, a blind man drives a car using AirPix.
This simulator turned out to be very useful for training blind drivers, as well as for quickly testing ideas for using different types of special interfaces.
This is how the system works in a nutshell.
After all, this is a prototype of a car for the blind. And it will not be allowed on the road until it is convinced of its absolute safety.
And I sincerely believe that this is quite likely.
But will society accept such a radical idea?
How much will the car insurance rules change?
Under what conditions will driver's licenses be issued?
Beyond the technological challenges, there are so many pitfalls that need to be overcome before this becomes a reality.
Of course, the main goal of this project is to develop a vehicle for the blind.
However, it is possible that the spin-off technologies developed during this project will prove to be an invaluable contribution to our lives.
Our sensors work regardless of the time of day, fog and rain.
We can use these technologies together with new special interfaces to improve car safety for the visually impaired.
Or for the blind. Find their use in everyday household appliances, in educational institutions, in offices.
Just imagine: a teacher in a classroom writes on a blackboard, and a blind student can see and read what is written using these special interfaces.
This is priceless.
So what I've shown you today is just the beginning.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
The second trailer for Bill & Ted starring Keanu Reeves has been released
The second trailer for the third installment of the Bill & Ted franchise has appeared on the YouTube channel of the Orion Pictures film studio.
The trailer reveals some details from the current life of the bosom friends: they have settled in a suburban area, are married to their girlfriends Joanna (Jayma Mays) and Elizabeth (Erinn Hayes) from Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure (1989), moreover, the restless adventurers have long been raising daughters.
Brigitte Lundy-Paine (The Glass Castle, Atypical) plays Billie, Ted's daughter, and Samara Weaving (I'm Looking) plays Thea, Bill's daughter (yes, Bill and Ted named their daughters Billie and Thea, pun intended).
On top of all this, another great adventure awaits them: they must go into the future to steal their own song - the only way they can save the whole world.
The trailer also features American rapper Kid Cudi and William Sadler (August Rush, In Spite of Death, The Green Mile) reprising his role as Death.
The film was originally scheduled to be released on August 21, but the date was pushed back to September 1.
It is reported that the makers do not plan to reschedule the release date of the film.
The picture will also be immediately available online.
Earlier we wrote that Keanu Reeves will become a comic book writer about the demigod Berserk.
I want you to think for a second about the fact that almost all of our knowledge about the universe comes from light.
We stand on Earth and see stars in the night sky with the naked eye.
The bright Sun can burn the retina of the eye,
but we see the same light in the reflection of the moon.
Since the time of Galileo, who observed the heavenly bodies with his primitive telescope, we have been contemplating the universe thanks to the light that passes through the vast ages of cosmic history.
With the help of modern telescopes, we have been able to assemble a stunning silent movie of the universe, spanning our entire history up to the Big Bang.
However, the movie is not devoid of sound, because the universe is not silent.
I want to prove to you that the universe has its own sound track, and it is "reproduced" by the cosmos itself, because outer space vibrates like a drum.
It carries distinctive sounds that accompany the most striking events as they happen.
Today we would like to complement the luxurious visual image of the universe we have with a soundtrack.
Until now, we have never heard sounds from space, but in the near future we should listen carefully to what is happening there.
So, in order to record the "song" of the universe, we focused on black holes as the most promising objects, because they "beat" space-time like a bell, and give a characteristic sound.
Maybe one day we'll see a shadow cast by a black hole against a bright background, but we haven't seen that yet.
However, a black hole, although invisible, can be heard because it "beats" space-time like a drum.
The assumption that the cosmos is like the membrane of a drum belongs to Albert Einstein, to whom we owe so much.
Einstein concluded that if space were empty, if the universe were empty, it would look like this picture, except, of course, for the grid.
If we were free-falling through space, even without a convenient coordinate grid, we could mentally picture it ourselves, because we would notice that we are moving in a straight line, in a straight line through the universe.
Einstein also realized - and this is the crux of the matter - that if you put energy or mass into the universe, it will cause space to curve, and a free-falling object will curve around, for example, the sun, deviating along natural curves in space.
It was Einstein's great general theory of relativity.
Even light bends in this way.
The deflection can be so strong that the object will simply fall into orbit, and will revolve around the Sun like the Earth, or like the Moon around the Earth.
These are natural curves in space.
But Einstein did not understand this - if you take our Sun and compress it to 6 kilometers in diameter, that is, a mass 1 million times heavier than the Earth can fit in an object with a diameter of 6 km, you will get a black hole so dense that light that passes too close to it will never escape.
However, he always considered black holes to be just a mathematical curiosity.
Einstein did not believe they existed in reality.
He believed that nature itself should protect us from their appearance.
It took decades before the term "black hole" was invented and people realized that they are real astrophysical objects - in fact, they are very massive stars in a posthumous state, catastrophically collapsed at the end of their life cycle.
Our sun will not turn into a black hole.
Its mass is not enough for that.
But we'll do a little thought experiment - Einstein loved them - and imagine the sun shrinking to 6 kilometers in diameter, with a tiny Earth orbiting it, about 30 kilometers from the sun's black hole.
This Earth is luminous, the Sun is no more, and there is no other source of light, so let us make our little Earth self-luminous.
It turns out that we can put the Earth in a very close orbit, only 30 km from this black hole.
It's not much bigger than Manhattan.
Maybe it would have caught a bit of the Hudson before it destroyed the Earth.
But that is about the size of it.
We're talking about an object that would take up about 1/2 the area of Manhattan.
So, if we put this Earth very close - just 30 km away - we will notice that it perfectly orbits the black hole.
It's kind of a myth that black holes swallow everything indiscriminately - you have to get really close to get in.
But what's amazing is that from our vantage point, we'll see Earth all the time.
She can't hide behind a black hole.
Some of the light that the Earth emits is absorbed by the hole, but some of it goes around it and comes back to us.
So you can't hide anything behind a black hole.
If you ever find yourself on Battlestar Galactica, fighting the Cylons, don't hide behind a black hole.
They will see you!
Our sun will not turn into a black hole - it is not massive enough for that. But there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
And if one of them eclipsed the Milky Way, this is what it would look like.
We would see the shadow of a black hole against a background of hundreds of billions of stars and glowing dust.
If we were on the verge of falling into this black hole, we would see all this light bending around it, and even already entering this shadow, we would not notice the near catastrophe.
It would be useless to start the engines and try to get out, because nothing, including light, can escape from it.
Although a black hole looks like one from the outside, it is not dark inside, since all light falls into it with us.
According to a relativistic effect known as time dilation, our clocks would appear to slow down relative to galactic time, but we would instead see the evolution of the galaxy speed up in the moments before death inside the black hole.
It would be like a near-death experience where you see the light at the end of the tunnel, only not "near" but absolutely mortal.
(Laughter) And you can't tell anybody about the light at the end of the tunnel.
Scientists have not yet been able to see the shadow of a black hole, but we can hear it, albeit invisible.
Let's imagine a real astrophysical situation - two black holes that have lived a long life together.
They may have started out as stars before turning into black holes, each 10 times more massive than the sun.
Let's compress them to 60 km in diameter.
They can spin rapidly: hundreds of revolutions per second.
At the end of their life cycle, they orbit each other at nearly the speed of light.
They cover thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second, and not only do they warp space, but they also leave a trace: they cause oscillations, a wave trail in space-time.
Space shrinks and stretches, freeing itself from these black holes rippling through the universe.
And they travel through space at the speed of light.
This computer simulation is from Goddard's relativity group at NASA.
For almost 30 years, scientists around the world have struggled with this problem.
It was one of the groups.
You see two black holes orbiting each other - and again, the curves are clearly shown here.
If you see - it turned out a bit pale - they emit red waves, gravitational waves.
These are the sounds of vibrating space, and they will emanate from these black holes at the speed of light as they fall silent and merge into one spinning, silent black hole - this is the outcome.
If you were standing close enough, your ear would resonate as the space was compressed and stretched.
You would actually hear the sound.
Of course, your head would also shrink and stretch, so it would be hard for you to understand what was going on.
But I would like to play you this sound as we predict it.
This is the work of my group, so the graphics here are more modest.
Imagine a light black hole falling into a very heavy one.
The sound you hear is a slight hole, bending the space, approaching step by step to the end.
If it is removed, the sound becomes quieter.
But it is like a hammer that "hits" a space that vibrates like a membrane.
And we can predict what that sound will be.
We know that as the hole gets swallowed up, it gets faster and louder.
In the end, we will hear how a small hole just falls into a big one.
I've never heard a recording so loud - it's really quite impressive.
At home it is much more modest.
Just quiet clicks.
It's a different sound created by my band.
I'm not showing you a picture here, because black holes don't leave visual traces, there are no visible curves in space.
If you were going on a space cruise and you heard a sound like that, I would recommend leaving as soon as possible.
(Laughter) Away from that sound.
Both black holes are moving.
They approach each other.
In this case, they both fluctuate wildly.
And now there will be a merger.
This "chirp" is very characteristic of merging black holes, this is the acceleration at the end.
We guess that's what it would sound like.
Fortunately, we are now at a safe distance, in Long Beach, California.
Undoubtedly, somewhere in the universe, two black holes are merging.
And without a doubt, the space around us vibrates, and these vibrations may have traveled millions of light years, that is, a million years moving towards us at the speed of light.
But the sound is too quiet, we can't hear it.
Today there is a very complex project: LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) - it monitors deviations in the oscillations of space, the smallest - by the size of the nucleus of an atom by 4 kilometers.
This is an extremely ambitious experiment, and the next few years will be devoted to capturing such waves.
One space program is also planned, which will hopefully be launched in the next 10 years: LICA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna).
It will be able to see supermassive black holes that are millions and billions of times more massive than the Sun.
In this picture from the Hubble telescope we see two galaxies.
They look like they are frozen in a kind of "hug,"
and each is likely to have a supermassive black hole at its core.
But they are not frozen. In fact, they are merging.
These two black holes are colliding, and it will last for more than a billion years.
It is beyond our comprehension to hear a song of this length.
But LIKA can see the finale of the merger of two supermassive black holes that began a long time ago: the last 15 minutes of this action.
We are not only talking about black holes, but also about any serious trouble in the universe, and the most important of them is the Big Bang.
When the expression was coined, it was ironic - "who would believe in the Big Bang?"
This animation from my friend at Proton Studios shows the Big Bang from the outside.
Any observer would like to be inside at this moment, because it is impossible to be outside the universe.
Imagine you are inside the Big Bang.
It's all around you and the space is vibrating chaotically.
It's been 14 billion years, and that song is still around.
Galaxies are born, and in them are generations of star forms. And around one star, at least one, there is a habitable planet.
And here we persist in conducting these experiments, making calculations, writing programs.
Imagine - a billion years ago, two black holes collided.
All the while, their song is playing in space.
We're not even born yet.
The sound is getting closer and closer - 40,000 years ago, we're still making cave paintings.
If we were going to "hear" the Big Bang, it would sound like this.
Noise in its purest form.
It's white noise, just random sounds.
But it is probably all around us, unless it has been drowned out by some other process in the universe.
And if we catch it, it will be the most pleasant music for us, because it is a quiet echo of the moment of our creation, the birth of the observable universe.
Over the next few years, we'll be able to turn up the volume a bit and hear the universe in sound.
But if we catch an echo of those early events, it will bring us much closer to understanding the Big Bang, and that will allow us to ask some of the most difficult, elusive questions.
If we play the movie of our universe backwards, we will know that in the past there was a Big Bang, and perhaps we will even hear its cacophony, but was this explosion the only one?
I mean, hasn't it happened before?
Will it happen again?
In the spirit of TED urging us to reclaim our faith in miracles, we can now ask the questions that have always eluded us.
But we have to ask: Is it possible that our universe is just a trace of some bigger story?
Or - are we just one of the branches of the multiverse - each of which had its own Big Bang in the past? Maybe with black holes and their "songs," or without them, maybe with intelligent life, and maybe without - they are not in our past, not in our future, but somehow connected to us?
We will ask, in such a multiverse, in its other branches, is there life there?
Here are my fellow multiverses.
But are there other creatures out there who wonder about us, and about their origins?
And if they are, I can imagine them calculating like us, building instruments, trying to detect that faint sound of the moment of their creation, and thinking - who else is there but us?
Thank you. Thank you.
(Applause)
Minneapolis residents form squads to patrol the streets
The Wall Street Journal reports: Minneapolis is creating squads to patrol the streets.
Local residents want to help the police.
Some of the vigilantes are armed.
Armed citizens assure: they will not open fire, it is possible only in case of emergency.
According to journalists, the creation of patrols is due to police budget cuts.
Law enforcement agencies will receive $10 million less per year (this amount may be reduced).
The previous budget of law enforcement officers was $193 million.
The Minneapolis City Council made the decision in response to the death of George Floyd and protests against police brutality over the past two months.

City and Real Madrid could play Champions League last-16 second leg in Manchester
The British newspaper The Guardian reports that Manchester City and Real Madrid will still be able to hold the second leg of the Champions League round of 16 on August 7 in Manchester at the Etihad Stadium.
Yesterday, July 25, the government of the United Kingdom issued a decree that all persons arriving in the UK from Spain are required to undergo a 14-day quarantine due to a new outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.
However, an exception will be made for Real Madrid.
The possibility of easing quarantine rules for sports teams and film crews was previously announced by the secretary of the UK Ministry of Culture, Oliver Dowden.
In February, Real Madrid lost 2-1 at home to Manchester City.
The second leg is scheduled for August 7.
Presidents of Russia and Ukraine discuss implementation of ceasefire in Donbass
Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky discussed the implementation of the agreements on a ceasefire in Donbass reached during the Normandy summit in December 2019, the press services of the Kremlin and the office of the President of Ukraine reported.
The telephone conversation between Vladimir Putin and Vladimir Zelensky was initiated by the Ukrainian side, according to the Kremlin press service.
The interlocutors welcomed the agreement reached on 22 July at the meeting of the Minsk Contact Group on a full and comprehensive ceasefire in Donbas, which begins at 00:01 on 27 July 2020; the Russian President supported this agreement.
The leaders agreed on the need to urgently implement additional measures to support the ceasefire in Donbas.
At the same time, Putin criticized the resolution adopted by the Verkhovna Rada on July 15 on the organization of local elections in the autumn, which, according to the Russian side, ignores the Minsk agreements.
The situation with the coronavirus pandemic was also discussed.
The July 22 agreement provides for the complete renunciation of any military action, including reconnaissance, the sending of sabotage and reconnaissance groups and sniper warfare.
Tinkov showed a video of a bone marrow transplant
Oleg Tinkov, a Russian entrepreneur and founder of the Tinkoff Group, posted a video in which he described how he received a bone marrow transplant.
The businessman is battling leukemia.
In the recording, the businessman lies in the ward, the bone marrow is transplanted with the help of an IV.
Tinkov noted that the donor material is collected in the same way.
"The skull is not cut open," he added.
Judging by his posture during the operation, he feels comfortable and relaxed.
His donor was a girl from Germany.
The businessman expressed regret that in Russia there are only 130,000 bone marrow donors, while in Germany there are about 8 million.
Oleg Tinkov's bone marrow transplant was carried out at the London Clinic.
It became known about the destruction of Russian Pantsirs in Ethiopia
Two Russian-made Pantsir-S1 anti-aircraft missile systems that were in service with the Ethiopian army were destroyed.
This was reported by the Telegram channel "Military Observer" on Sunday, July 26.
According to the channel, two machines that ensured the safety of the Hidase hydroelectric power plant on the Blue Nile River were disabled as a result of lightning.
No other details of the incident were given.
In May, Turkey's Anadolu Agency reported the destruction of nine Russian-made Pantsir-S1 air defense systems in Libya.
They belonged to the forces of the commander of the Libyan National Army (LNA), Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, and were destroyed using Turkish Bayraktar TB2 tactical multi-purpose unmanned aerial systems.
At the time, Defense Express called the incident "true genocide."
Another Pantsir-S1 in Libya was destroyed by an attack drone in early July.
1,500 people evacuated in Warsaw due to bomb

Putin had a word with Shoigu in the cabin:
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke with Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Navy Commander Nikolai Evmenov.
On Sunday, July 26, journalists from the Kremlin pool of RIA Novosti published the relevant footage on their Telegram channel.
The brief meeting took place in the cabin of the boat on which the head of state, together with Shoigu and Evmenov, was heading to the parade of ships in the Gulf of Finland before the parade dedicated to the Russian Navy Day.
They exchanged a few words while sitting at the table.
Earlier it was reported that Putin arrived in Kronstadt to take part in the celebrations.
From there, the president headed to St. Petersburg, where he is to receive a celebratory parade.
On July 26, parades are held across Russia to celebrate the Navy Day.
The main naval parade takes place in St. Petersburg.
It involves more than 4,000 military personnel, 46 ships, submarines and boats, as well as naval aviation.
In one of the Tyumen public, there was a call to take part in the "Buy from Grandma" campaign.
The organizers urge people to buy vegetables, flowers and berries from grandmothers, which they have grown in their gardens, and not to bargain.
The author of the post even gave an example, giving a specific address where the grandmother sells cherries.
But the people of Tyumen suddenly burst into angry comments.
She herself saw how a trader from neighboring countries immediately approached this grandmother and gave her a new portion of goods "from her grandmother's garden" to sell.
Be careful what you buy!!! - Nadezhda Grigoryeva shared her observations.
I have seen more than once when greens were taken from traders from neighboring countries and sold.
There is no trust, agreed Larisa Kharlamova.
It's been a long time, I see, grandma Victoria has a "glitter," but she didn't grow in our garden, I ask: "Is it from your garden?"
"Yes!"
I bought it, the taste of rags, well, not fresh garden, then I see these "yes" on every corner, my grandmother deceived me, she took it from someone to sell, - Tatiana Krasilnikova told about her experience.
At the same time, users emphasize that they do not urge not to shop at grandmothers, but only share their opinion and advise to pay attention to the quality of products.
Residents of the Tyumen region celebrate the Year of Memory and Glory online
The plane made an emergency landing in Irkutsk
In Irkutsk, a plane en route from Moscow to Ulan-Ude made an emergency landing due to a passenger smoking.
According to RIA Novosti, the incident occurred on Sunday night.
The plane stayed at the airport in Irkutsk for 25 minutes while the man, who posed a threat to flight safety, was handed over to the police.
The plane was thoroughly checked for smoldering ash before takeoff.
All expenses for forced parking will be charged to the passenger who smoked.
Earlier, a man was detained at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport for causing a disturbance on board a plane.
A passenger on the Kaliningrad-Moscow flight also lit a cigarette during the flight and did not react to the comments.
Later, at the sight of police officers who came to remove the offender from the plane, the brawler made a scene and tore his passport.

the decision to expand the RPL would not have been supported by either UEFA or FIFA
President of the Russian Football Union (RFU) Alexander Dyukov believes that expanding the Russian Premier League (RPL) to 18 teams is wrong at the moment.
"First of all, it was the RPL's decision, but I agree with it because it's not right to change the rules after the tournament is over.
It violates the integrity of the tournament and the sporting principle.
And, of course, this decision would not be supported by either UEFA or FIFA," Dyukov said after the Russian Cup final between Zenit and Khimki (1-0).
Currently, there are 16 clubs in the RPL, but an option to increase the number of teams to 18 was considered.

Kirilenko shares memories of playing with Bryant and Jordan in the NBA
The head of the Russian Basketball Federation (RBF) Andrei Kirilenko shared his memories of playing against the legendary Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan in National Basketball Association (NBA) matches.
I knew that Bryant's ego could not be hurt by some trash talk, so as not to stimulate his sports rage.
Kobe had a killer instinct, so on the court I tried to talk to him so that he did not perceive the game in an aggressive way.
I complimented him on the court: "Oh!
Kobe, well scored, great pass!
Listening to my enthusiastic responses, he slightly forgot about the need to once again pick up the ball and score another 3-4 points.
We communicated well with Kobe," Kirilenko told Vechernyaya Moskva.
He also talked about his first game against Jordan.
"I took care of him.
For the first three minutes of the match I was running around in complete awe of having a legend next to me that I had only seen on TV.
While I was breathless with joy, Michael scored a lot of points.
Soon I moved away from enthusiasm, covered his throws a couple of times...
In that game, my team won, but Jordan still scored 44 points," the head of the Russian Basketball Federation added.
Kirilenko spent 12 seasons in the NBA.
He was selected by the Utah Jazz with the 24th overall pick in the 1999 draft.
In addition to Utah, where he spent ten seasons, the Russian forward played for the Minnesota Timberwolves and Brooklyn Nets.
In a total of 797 games, he averaged 11.8 points, 5.5 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 1.8 blocks.
Earlier it was reported that Kirilenko will put forward his candidacy for the election of the head of the RFB.
Degtyarev surprised by information on purchase of Sakhalin-1 gas in dollars
The acting governor of the Khabarovsk Territory, Mikhail Degtyarev, on Sunday, July 26, during a meeting with residents of Sovetskaya Gavan, was surprised that the region buys Sakhalin gas produced by the American company Exxon Neftegas in dollars.
American gas is contracted in dollars until 2025.
"Honestly, I didn't know that, and I'm so blown away by that information.
I had no idea that this was still possible in 2020 in Russia," RIA Novosti quoted him as saying.
Degtyarev noted that this issue was discussed with Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak during his visit to Khabarovsk on July 24.
The acting governor also stressed that by 2025, Gazprom will switch to supplying Russian thermal power plants and capacities, which means that Russian gas purchased in rubles "at normal prices" will be used.
The Sakhalin-1 project is being implemented through a production sharing agreement, where Exxon Neftegas Ltd is the operator of the project with a 30% stake, Rosneft has another 20%, Japan's Sodeco has 30% and India's ONGC has 20%.
The Khabarovsk region has been purchasing gas from this project since 2005.

Actor of Russian TV series responds to accusations of "LGBT and feminist propaganda"
The actor of the Russian series "Chiki," whose creators were accused of "propaganda of LGBT and feminism," responded to the claims about the film.
The authors "understood the severity of the issues raised and did not want to offend anyone," said American Steven Thomas Ochsner in an interview with the publication "Rise."
"It seems to me that this is a story about power and the general aspects of human life.
It has nothing to do with LGBT and feminism," said the actor, who played the father of a boy who dressed in women's clothes.
He stressed that he was "proud of the work" and did not consider it propaganda.
At the same time, the American added, he is frightened by the reaction of some people to the storyline of the series: for example, there was a case when "a man in a deep binge shot the set and said that all this was not true."
"Then there were a couple of cases when we met disgruntled locals who didn't understand what we were doing.
But we were open, so people who first came with complaints started helping us," he concluded.
The case of shooting, the publication explains, occurred in September 2019 in Kabardino-Balkaria: a drunk man attacked the car of the film crew with a weapon, after which he was detained by police officers.
Earlier it was reported that the public commissioner for the protection of the family, Olga Baranets, sent a complaint to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Roskomnadzor about the service more.tv, which posted the Russian series "Cheeky."
Baranets accused the creators of the series of "propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations and feminism," drawing attention to the fact that the main characters of the film work as prostitutes, and the series itself contains "scenes of physical and psychological violence."
The ombudsman was also outraged by the fact that "the series pays a lot of attention to the homosexual sexual orientation" of a minor character.
The comedy-drama "Cheeky" tells the story of three prostitutes who start a new life and open a business on the advice of a friend.
