There is no need to demonize the people of Khabarovsk
The acting head of the Khabarovsk Territory spoke about his trip to the region in an exclusive interview with Komsomolskaya Pravda
The interim governor of the Khabarovsk Territory, Mikhail Degtyarev, called in an interview with Komsomolskaya Pravda columnist Alexander Gamov not to demonize Khabarovsk residents amid rallies in support of the arrested former head of the region, Sergei Furgal.
I want to appeal to all political commentators, political scientists, participants in all kinds of talk shows.
There is no need to demonize the people of Khabarovsk Krai.
Hard-working and wonderful people live here, Mikhail Degtyarev shared.
In an interview, Degtyarev recalled that he is a member of the LDPR and a fellow party member of Furgal and added that he wishes him good luck in court, and the party and personally Vladimir Zhirinovsky will support him in court.
The full text of the interview is published on the KP.ru website.
Earlier, the KP.ru website reported that Mikhail Degtyarev advocated an open trial of Sergei Furgal and considers it fair to hold it in Khabarovsk.
Hurricane Hannah alerts two Mexican states
The Mexican National Civil Defense Administration announced an "orange" (high) alert level in the two eastern states of Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon due to the approaching Hurricane Hannah, TASS reported.
The hurricane will bring heavy downpours to Mexico, with some areas predicting between 150 and 250 litres of rain per square metre.
The authorities have prepared about 800 shelters for the population.
Ten thousand people, including rescuers, National Guard soldiers and the military, will provide assistance to people.
At the moment, the hurricane has reached the coast of the American state of Texas with a wind speed of 150 km/h.
Hannah's arrival in Mexico is expected Sunday morning.
Semilarski vs. the prosecutor's office: the cassation of the former deputy mayor of Tartu will be considered on August 4
This means that a decision on it is likely to be made in early September.
The courts of the first two instances refused to consider Semilarski's claim, but the Supreme Court accepted his cassation appeal in April.
On December 12, 2019, the Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the applicant, since its resolution does not fall within his competence as an administrative court.
The court ruling stated that the complaint contains a claim for compensation for damage caused during criminal proceedings.
"The prosecutor's office and the county court should regulate such issues," Anett Kreitsmann, spokeswoman for the Tartu courts, previously explained to the ERR correspondent.
According to her, Valvo Semilarski appealed this decision in the district court, which on February 5 did not change the decision of the court of first instance.
Now the State Court will have to say its word.
According to Semilarski's lawyer, sworn lawyer Oliver Niaes, his client was unreasonably suspected of bribery for about two years.
Now he demands that the prosecutor's office refute the incorrect allegations against him and compensate him for moral damage.
The reason for filing a complaint with the court was the statements of the prosecutor for special cases of the Lyunas district prosecutor's office, Margus Gross, made by him in October 2017, when Semilarski, together with the then other deputy mayor of Tartu, Artem Suvorov, was detained on suspicion of committing several crimes.
"Recall that when I was detained, the Security Police and the Prosecutor's Office immediately organized a press conference and informed the whole Republic of Estonia that the leaders of Tartu - one of the most influential local government bodies - were corrupt.
These public suspicions hanging in the air accompanied me for about two years.
And now, when these allegations and suspicions turned out to be false, the prosecutor's office does not want to say anything about it, "Semilarski commented in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Niaes, at a press conference, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework within which the prosecutor's office should operate.
"The allegation of bribery and corruption turned out to be false, but this is not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its rulings on Russia, as well as on Lithuania, that during the investigation phase, representatives of the state should be careful when choosing words, so that suspects would not be presented as criminals before sentencing.
The prosecutor's office is also obliged to do this by the presumption of innocence, which, unfortunately, was not observed in this case against Valvo Semilarski, "Niaes said.
"The public presentation of Semilarski as a serious offender and bribe-taker in circumstances where the facts underlying the suspicion of bribery are still being clarified is unacceptable, which contradicts the presumption of innocence and is unfair to the applicant," the lawyer added.
As rus.err.ee wrote, the former deputy mayor of Tartu, Valvo Semilarski, will not be prosecuted on bribery charges - the criminal case against him was partially closed in July.
At the same time, the former official is being tried on charges of deliberately violating anti-corruption legislation when conducting transactions on a particularly large scale.
According to the indictment, between 2015 and 2017, the former deputy mayor of Tartu participated more than thirty times in meetings of the city council when making decisions related to companies operating in Tartu, with whose owners or managers Semilarski actively communicated on a personal level outside working hours.
According to Gross, in all these cases Semilarski had personal interests, and therefore he had to withdraw from participation in decision-making.
Earlier, as rus.err.ee wrote, the prosecutor's office presented Semilarski with suspicions of receiving a bribe and violating anti-corruption legislation when conducting transactions on a particularly large scale.
This happened in October 2016, when he was detained together with another deputy mayor, Artem Suvorov (Centre Party).
At that time, the prosecutor's office and the Security Police stated that there was strong evidence against both deputy mayors.
After that, both officials resigned.
Suvorov's case later reached the court, which fully acquitted the politician.
The judicial investigation into the case of Valvo Semilarski is still ongoing.
Ex-soloist of the group "Hands Up" visited the Tver region
Former soloist of the group "Hands Up," and now solo performer, businessman and actor Sergei Zhukov posted a photo from Kalyazin, Tver region, on his official Instagram account.
The photo was published a day ago, on Saturday, July 25.
"I raise my hands up under the new" Little "and say hello to you from the drunken-fresh air!
Write in the comments, what is the weather in your city?
Today we have no rain, but it still does not rise above + 20..., "Zhukov writes on social networks.
The singer is probably vacationing in the beautiful city of the Tver region with his family.
Residents of the region have already thanked the performer for the visit, and also expressed hope for a meeting and personal communication.
The new "Little" in the post is probably a new version of an old song that Zhukov has now recorded with blogger and musician David Manukyan (DAVA M).
At the same time, the majority of fans remain for the old version: "Sergei, the old version of the song is clearly 1,000,000 times better!
Support me loyal fans of "Hands Up," "We don't need a" new crumb. ""
Most people write directly that they like the original, which at one time became a hit, more.
The Ministry of Defense reported on the successful completion of tests of the hypersonic missile "Zircon"
The Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation reported on the successful completion of tests of the Zircon hypersonic missile.
On Navy Day, the Defense Ministry noted that test launches conducted from the frigate Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union Gorshkov confirmed the unique tactical and technical characteristics of this missile in terms of range and accuracy of firing, as well as the hypersonic speed of its flight.
According to the Ministry of Defense, testing of a hypersonic missile is proceeding as planned.
Earlier in May, Deputy Defense Minister Alexei Krivoruchko reported that the ship's complex with the latest hypersonic Zircon missile will be put into service in 2021-2022.
You are all well aware of the truth that will be discussed today.
I think the idea of inequality as a divider and destroyer of society was in the air even before the French Revolution.
But now we can see the evidence by comparing the most and least similar societies, and by observing the consequences of inequality.
I will show you this data and explain why there are relationships that will be discussed.
But first look at how dull we are.
(Laughter) I'll start with a paradox.
This shows life expectancy, depending on GNI, or the average level of well-being of countries.
It can be seen that countries on the right, such as Norway and the United States, are twice as rich as Israel, Greece and Portugal on the left.
But this does not affect life expectancy at all.
There is no hint of a relationship.
But within societies, there are strong health gradations affecting all social strata.
Again, life expectancy.
The graph refers to small areas of England and Wales: the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.
There is a huge difference between the poor and everyone else.
Even those who are slightly poorer than the richest are already less healthy than the very top.
So income is very important within our societies, but not between them.
The explanation for this paradox is this: within our societies, we look at relative income or social position, status - at what level we are in relation to others, and what are the distances between us.
Having understood this idea, you will immediately think: what will happen if the difference increases or shrinks, in other words, making the difference in income bigger or smaller?
Now I'll show you that.
All the data used are absolutely real.
I take UN information, as does the World Bank: the scale of the income gap in these rich and developed market democracies.
The indicator used by our team is very simple, you can download it. We consider the difference between the 20% richest and the 20% poorest citizens in each country.
Look, in equal countries on the left, Japan, Finland, Norway, and Sweden, the rich 20% are 3.5-4 times richer than the poor 20%.
But in unequal countries, the UK, Portugal, the US, and Singapore, the difference is twice as big!
According to these measurements, we are half as equal as other successful democracies.
And now you will see what impact this has on society.
We have collected statistics on social problems that are more common among the poor.
These are internationally comparable data on life expectancy, the level of literacy and mathematical training of children, neonatal mortality, homicide rates, the number of prisoners, teenage pregnancy, confidence levels, obesity, mental illness, which, according to the standard diagnostic classification, include drug and alcohol addiction, and finally, data on social mobility.
We put it all in one index.
They are all equally important.
The country is, in a way, the average value of these data.
You see countries in relation to the inequality indicator that was shown at the very beginning. I will go back to it again and again during the presentation.
Unequal countries in general have more difficulty with all these social problems.
This is an unusually close relationship. You see that the correlation is unusually high.
But if you look at the same index of health and social problems in relation to GNP per capita, Gross National Income, there is no correlation anymore.
We were a bit worried that people would think we were matching the issues to our arguments and just "matching" the evidence. So we also wrote an article in the British Medical Journal about the UNICEF Child Wellbeing Index.
The index consists of 40 different parts, collected by different people together.
Among the criteria: the presence of books at home, the ability of children to talk to parents, the level of immunization, the presence of bullying in school.
Everything comes in there.
But this is all against the backdrop of the same measure of inequality.
The situation of children is worse in unequal societies.
And this is a statistically significant relationship.
But again, if you look at the level of children's well-being in relation to national income per capita, there is no correlation, no hint.
All the evidence shows one thing:
On average, the well-being of our societies is no longer dependent on national income and economic growth.
They are essential in poor countries, but not in the developed world.
The difference between us, and our position against others, is what matters most.
I will show you fragments of our index.
Here, for example, is trust.
This is the part of the population that agrees that most people can be trusted.
The data comes from the World Values Study.
Look, in unequal countries, only 15% of the population trusts others.
And in equal societies, this figure reaches 60-65%.
If you look at the measures of social activity, or social capital, you will notice very similar ratios closely related to inequality.
We can say that we have done the work twice.
First, we analyzed developed countries, and then, as a benchmark study, we repeated the procedure in 50 American states, asking one question: are things worse in all our indicators in the most unequal states?
Here is the credibility of inequality, according to a general social study by the federal government.
A very similar spread, compared to a similar range of confidence levels.
The same story.
Overall, we found that almost everything related to trust at the international level manifests itself in the same way in our control study.
It's not just a coincidence.
Here is a graph of mental illness.
The WHO, using identical diagnostic interviews conducted on random samples of the population, has collected results that allow us to compare the level of mental illness in each society.
Here is the percentage of the population suffering from any mental illness in the past year.
The numbers start at around 8% and rise to almost 24%; entire societies with triple rates of psychological illness.
Again, this is closely linked to inequality.
But here are the crimes.
These red dots show American states, and the blue triangles show Canadian provinces.
But look at the scale of the differences.
It starts with 15 murders per million and reaches 150.
This is the proportion of prisoners.
This is a tenfold difference expressed in the logarithmic scale.
The figures rise from 40 to 400 in terms of the number of prisoners in prisons.
These relationships are not simply explained by higher crime rates.
Yes, in some cases this is partly true.
But for the most part, they are associated with harsher sentences.
Unequal societies are more likely to favour retaining the death penalty.
This shows the percentage of children dropping out of school.
Again, quite a big difference.
It is incredibly harmful when it comes to using talents.
But social mobility.
This is a measure of income-related mobility.
The main question is: do the rich fathers have rich sons and the poor have poor sons, or is there no dependence?
Among unequal countries, in the UK and the US, the father's income is many times more important.
And in the Scandinavian countries, income is already much less significant.
As a result, there is greater social mobility.
And as we often like to say - I know there are many Americans among the audience - if Americans want to realize the American dream, they should go to Denmark.
(Laughter) (Applause) I only showed a couple of points in italics.
A number of other problems could be demonstrated.
All sorts of problems that become more significant among the lower social strata.
But there are endless problems with social gradients, which are much worse in unequal countries; and not a little bit, but 2, 10 times worse.
Think about the costs, what it costs people.
Let me return to the previously shown graph, where all the data is collected together. Let's draw two conclusions.
First, schedule after schedule, the less prosperous countries, regardless of the result, are out of the equals, and the well-performing ones are the Scandinavian countries and Japan.
Thus, we see a general social dysfunction in the face of inequality.
It's not one, not two separate problems. It's a trend.
Another important point about this schedule. Let's look below: Sweden and Japan: countries are different in literally everything.
The situation of women, how closely they are connected with the family, is exactly the opposite, in the conditions of developed countries.
Another very important difference is how they achieve greater equality.
In Sweden, income differences are huge, but they are reduced through taxation, social programs, generous benefits, etc.
In Japan, however, things are different.
The difference in wages was initially small.
Taxes are lower.
There are fewer social programs.
And in our analysis of American states, we find the same contrast.
Some states thrive on income redistribution, others on a smaller difference in net income before taxes.
We believe that it does not matter by what means equality is achieved as long as it is achieved.
I am not talking about complete equality, but about what exists in rich and developed market democracies.
Another surprising observation is that not only the poor are affected by this inequality.
There seems to be some truth in John Donne's words: "Man is not an island."
A number of studies can compare how people in more or less equal countries succeed at every step of the social ladder.
One such example:
Mortality among newborns.
A group of Swedes classified many cases of infant mortality according to the British register of general socio-economic classification.
It is rather an anachronistic classification according to the profession of fathers, so that single parents are not counted.
And by "low social level" we mean unskilled professions.
Then there are skilled manual workers, then there are low-level white-collar workers and up to the highest level with highly qualified professions: doctors, lawyers, directors of large companies.
You see, things are going better in Sweden than in the UK in all walks of life.
The biggest difference at the lowest levels -
but even for the higher echelons there are benefits from a more equal society.
We showed this on five different sets of data affecting educational outcomes and health in the US and internationally.
And this seems to be the overall picture: greater equality makes a bigger difference at the bottom, but it is also good for the top.
But I still have to explain what is happening.
I think it's all about the psychosocial consequences of inequality.
About a sense of superiority and inferiority, about a sense of one's worth and vice versa, about a sense of self-respect and vice versa.
And, of course, the sense of competition that these feelings generate fuels consumerism in our society.
It also leads to fear for their status.
We are more worried about how others think about us, whether they consider us attractive, smart - this worries us.
The more public assessments, the greater the fear of them.
Interestingly, parallel work is underway in social psychology: 208 different studies involving volunteers who were tested in psychological laboratories for stress hormones, for reactions to stressful tasks, were considered.
In general, they wanted to observe the types of stress that raise levels of cortisol, the main stress hormone.
As a result, such factors turned out to be situations that included a potential threat to social assessment, a threat to self-esteem or social status, situations where other people could give a negative assessment.
Just such stressors have a special effect on the physiology of stress.
There was also criticism of us.
Of course, there will be dissenters or people who find it amazing.
I have to tell you, in response to criticism for the data collection, that we do not choose this data.
Our main rule is that if the data source has the necessary indicators for one of the analyzed countries, we include it in our analysis.
This source of information decides whether this data is real, but not us.
Otherwise, we would have created a systematic error.
What about other countries?
There are 200 studies of health in relation to income and equality in academic journals.
And they are not limited to these countries, but we have excluded others for clarity.
The same countries, the same dimensions of inequality, problem after problem.
Why don't we control other factors?
Well, we showed you that GNP per capita doesn't matter.
And, of course, others, using more sophisticated methods, controlled poverty, education, and so on.
And what about causation?
Correlation alone does not prove causation.
We spent a lot of time on it.
Indeed, for some of these situations, causality is well known.
A big change in our understanding of the causes of chronic health effects in the developed world has been how significant chronic stress of a social nature is and its impact on the immune and cardiovascular systems.
For example, violence is becoming more common in unequal societies because people are more sensitive to contempt.
I must say that in order to solve this problem, we should work on pre-tax and post-tax incomes.
We must limit the income and additional bonuses of the upper echelons.
I think that it is necessary to make our bosses responsible for employees in every possible way.
I want you to get out of here with the realization that we can improve a person's real quality of life by reducing the income gap between us.
Now we have a point of reference for influencing the psychological well-being of entire societies, and this is really incredible.
Thank you.
(Applause)
The clubs claiming Lokomotiv star Miranchuk and his salary in Italy became known.

U.S. urges Qatar and its neighbors to end dispute
It is necessary to restore trust and unity between Qatar and other states, U.S. Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook believes.
He said the conflict between the emirate and other countries in the region has been going on for too long and harms regional interests in stability, prosperity and security.
So far, the US has tried unsuccessfully to mediate a settlement of the dispute, which Washington views as "a threat to efforts to contain Iran."
Diplomatic relations with Qatar were severed three years ago by the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain.
They imposed a transport blockade, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorism.
In response, Doha said that neighbors are simply jealous of Qatar's economic success - according to the IMF, Qatar has been leading by a wide margin in GDP per capita for several years.
The Emirate is the third largest exporter of natural gas, the sixth largest exporter of natural gas and a major exporter of oil and oil products.

Despite a tight fight in the first part of the race, closer to the middle, Vaintrub increased the pace, showing the best lap time in the race - and, although he could not catch up with the extremely stable Remyako, guaranteed himself silver.
The Kaymanov group lagged behind the leaders, but fought closely with each other.
The best of the pilots on Porsche was Alexei Bashmakov, who became the fourth in the standings, but Andrei Fedotov and Konstantin Zakharevsky conceded a few moments to him.
And at the intermediate finish in the middle of the race, Fedotov and Zakharevsky split 0.001 seconds altogether.
Two more highways are included in the list of federal roads
The Russian government has added two more highways to the list of federal highways.
According to the Cabinet of Ministers, one of these roads with a length of more than 663 kilometers Chekshino - Totma - Kotlas - Kuratovo connects the Vologda and Arkhangelsk regions with the Republic of Komi.
Another highway with a length of more than 388 kilometers leads from Barnaul through Pavlovsk to the border with the Republic of Kazakhstan.
On this road, you can drive from the capital of the Altai Territory to the Kulunda checkpoint.
Obtaining a new status will make it possible to bring these roads to a regulatory state with funds from the Federal Road Fund.
Major repairs and reconstruction of certain sections will be carried out, and the quality of the road surface will improve.
Tatarstan allowed to hold open-air film screenings
The Cabinet of Ministers of Tatarstan published a resolution according to which, from July 27, it is possible to hold film screenings in open areas in parks, squares and embankments in the republic, writes Tatar-inform.
Also, the document states that for citizens over 65 years of age, the mandatory self-isolation regime has been extended until August 9.
They can leave their homes to go to the store, take out garbage or walk the dog.
But cinemas in the premises do not plan to open until the third stage of lifting restrictions, the agency recalls.
Washington is excited about the playoffs.
We missed them
Russian Washington Capitals hockey player Alexander Ovechkin spoke about the club's preparations for the upcoming resumption of the season in the NHL.
The 34-year-old Caps striker noted the readiness of his partners for matches.
Psychologically, all the guys are ready.
We go to Toronto joyful, because we have been without a game for a long time and missed hockey in the playoffs, - quotes Ovechkin Russian version of the site NHL.Com.
- Now we are fresh, we have no injuries and various sores.
However, Ovechkin also admitted that he and his partners still have to remember some of the tactical combinations: "We don't have much time to play the majority and remember March's achievements, how to move the puck in such situations.
But there is still time: I am sure that in Toronto we will devote part of our training to this.
Majority and minority are important in the playoffs.
And I am confident in our special teams. "
Recall that the restart of the Washington Capitals is scheduled for August 3, when the Capitals will play with the Tampa Bay Lightning.
After that, the Caps will also have to play with the Philadelphia Flyers (August 6) and the Boston Bruins (August 9).
A Russian man refused to pay for parking and beat up a parking worker
In Vladivostok, a man refused to pay for parking and hit a parking attendant, police are conducting an investigation.
This is reported by the portal vl.ru with reference to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia in the city.
The incident occurred on Friday, July 24, in a parking lot near the shopping center.
The driver of the car refused to pay for parking, which caused a conflict with the parking attendant.
The verbal dispute turned into a handshake.
The man punched the employee in the face, he fell unconscious.
He was hospitalized.
According to the source of the publication, the victim suffered a moderate head injury and was taken to the neurosurgery department.
Currently, the police are establishing all the circumstances of the incident.
Earlier, the Russian was charged with beating a disabled person who later died in hospital.
According to investigators, the victim was visiting his friend - a 45-year-old local resident.
The men drank alcohol together, after which there was a conflict between the friends.
The owner of the apartment beat the guest, who went home.
Two days later, the man became ill and was hospitalized.
He died of his injuries.
Recently, cyber attacks on the business world have become more frequent.
Access to data from companies such as JP Morgan, Yahoo, Home Depot and Target caused them losses of hundreds of millions, and in some cases even billions of dollars.
Doing damage to the global economy does not require too many such attacks.
Nor is the public sector immune to such problems.
Between 2012 and 2014, there was a significant data leak at the U.S. Office of Human Resources Management.
Access to data on security checks and fingerprints of 22 million employees was compromised.
Attempts by state-sponsored hackers to influence election results in a number of countries using stolen data are known.
The last two high-volume disclosures concern the Bundestag, Germany's federal parliament, and the theft of Democratic National Committee emails.
The cyber threat affects our democratic processes.
The situation is even getting worse.
As computer technology develops, data protection systems become increasingly vulnerable.
A new type of computer technology, computing on quantum computers, which use the microscopic properties of nature to dramatically increase computing power, is also a cause for concern.
It is so powerful that it will be able to crack many modern encryption systems.
Is the situation so hopeless?
Maybe it's time to pack our vital data and prepare for the imminent digital apocalypse?
I would say, "It's not time yet."
Quantum computers are still in development, and it will take many years before they are put into practice.
More importantly, there are major breakthroughs in encryption.
For me, this is a particularly exciting time in the history of secure communications.
About 15 years ago, when I learned about the new possibility of creating quantum effects that do not exist in nature, I was very excited.
I was intrigued by the idea of applying the fundamental laws of physics to create more secure encryption.
Today, a number of companies and laboratories around the world, including mine, are working on these technologies to put them into practice.
Right.
Now we are preparing to fight quantum with quantum.
So how does it all work?
First, let's take a small dive into the world of encryption.
To do this, we will need a briefcase, some important documents that we want to send to our friend, James Bond, and a lock to keep everything safe.
Since our information is top secret, we need a special portfolio.
It has a special code lock: when closed, it converts all text in documents into random numbers.
You put the documents in a briefcase, close the lock - at which point all the documents are converted into random numbers - and send the briefcase to James.
While the briefcase is on the way, you call James to report the code.
After receiving the briefcase, he enters the code, the documents are decrypted, and voila - you just sent an encrypted message to James Bond.
(Laughter) A funny example, but it illustrates three important coding elements.
Code - we call it the "encryption key."
It's like a password.
Call James to tell him the lock combination code.
This is called "key exchange" -
a guarantee that you will securely receive the encryption key from the right place.
And a lock that encodes and decodes the document.
This is called a "coding algorithm."
Using a key, it converts text in documents into random numbers.
A good algorithm will encode in such a way that it is very difficult to decrypt a document without a key.
The importance of encryption is that if someone takes possession of a portfolio and hacks it without the help of an encryption key and an encoding algorithm, they still won't be able to read its contents.
The information will look like a set of random numbers.
Most security systems rely on a secure way of exchanging keys to transfer the encryption key to the right place.
However, the rapid development of computing power threatens a number of modern methods of key exchange.
Consider one of the most widely used systems today - RSA.
When it was invented in 1977, it was estimated that it would take 40 quadrillion years to crack the 426-bit RSA key.
In 1994, just 17 years later, the code was hacked.
As computers became more powerful, we had to use more complex codes.
Today we usually use 2,048 or 4,096 bits.
As you can see, code creators and hackers are engaged in an ongoing battle, trying to outwit each other.
And when quantum computers appear in the next 10-15 years, they will be able to crack even faster the complex mathematics that underlies many modern encryption systems.
A quantum computer is likely to turn our current secure fortress into a simple house of cards.
We must find a way to protect our fortress.
In recent years, the number of studies in the field of using quantum effects to strengthen crypto protection has been increasing.
Some interesting discoveries have been made.
Remember the three main elements of encryption: high quality keys, secure key exchange, and a sophisticated algorithm?
Advances in science and technology threaten two of these three elements.
First, the keys themselves.
Random numbers are the fundamental building blocks of encryption keys.
But to date, they are not entirely random.
Today, we create encryption keys from sequences of random numbers generated from software, so-called pseudo-random numbers.
In the numbers generated by the program or mathematical formula, one way or another, there is a certain regularity.
The less random the numbers are - in scientific terms: the less entropy they contain - the easier it is to predict them.
Recently, several casinos have been the victims of an ingenious attack.
Combinations at the output of slot machines were recorded for some time, after which they were analyzed.
This allowed cybercriminals to redesign the pseudo-random number generator that controls the drums.
This, in turn, made it possible to predict the spins of the reels with high accuracy and get a big win.
Encryption keys can also be exposed to similar risks.
A truly random number generator is needed for secure encryption.
For many years, scientists have been looking for the possibility of creating such a generator.
But most attempts today are either not random enough, not fast enough, or difficult to repeat.
But the quantum world is based on chance.
Therefore, it makes sense to take advantage of this fact.
Devices that can measure quantum effects can also create an infinite stream of random numbers at high speeds -
which will prevent all these potential criminals from entering the casinos.
A number of top universities and companies around the world are developing truly random number generators.
The first quantum generator created in my company was one by two meters in size and was placed on an optical table.
Later, we were able to reduce it to the size of a server box.
Today it is the size of a PCI card connected to a standard computer.
It is the world's fastest generator of truly random numbers.
Its performance is a billion random numbers per second.
Today, it is used to strengthen the security system by cloud providers, banks, and government agencies around the world.
(Applause) But even with such a generator, the second big problem remains unresolved: the threat to secure key exchange.
Modern methods of key exchange are not compatible with a quantum computer.
The quantum solution to this problem is called "quantum key distribution" or QKD, which is based on the fundamental, paradoxical characteristic of quantum mechanics.
The quantum particle changes depending on its observation.
Let me give you an example of how this works.
Let's get back to exchanging lockdown codes with James Bond.
Only this time, instead of calling James with a code message, we will use quantum effects on the laser to create the code and send it to James using normal optical fibre.
We believe that Dr. Nou will try to hack access to data exchange.
Fortunately, his attempts to catch quantum keys en route will leave fingerprints that James and you will be able to detect.
This will make it possible to exclude intercepted keys.
And the remaining keys can be used for enhanced data protection.
Since such security is based on the fundamental laws of physics, a quantum computer, or even any supercomputer of the future, will not be able to hack it.
My team and I are working with leading universities, as well as the defence sector, to develop this promising technology into next-generation security tools.
The Internet of Things heralds an era in which 25-30 billion devices are expected to interact by 2020.
For the proper functioning of our society in the world of the Internet of Things, trust in the systems that support these devices is vital.
I am ready to bet that quantum technologies will be able to provide this trust, allowing us to take full advantage of the amazing innovations that will enrich our lives.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Video of cats helping injured dog cross road
A video of two cats helping an injured dog cross a road in Krasnodar Krai is becoming popular online.
A touching procession was recorded by the video recorder of one of the drivers.
The events took place in the dark, the man noticed traffic on the road and slowed down.
"Look, the whole delegation is rushing," the driver ironically says at first.
And then he notices that the dog moves with great difficulty.
The company safely reached the roadside, then headed towards the forest.
"There is something people can learn from animals," they write in the comments.
On Sunday, parades in honor of the Day of the Russian Navy were held in St. Petersburg and near all major naval bases, including in the Syrian Tartus.
219 different ships and 15 thousand personnel took part in them.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, who hosted the main parade in St. Petersburg, said that in 2020, the Navy will be replenished with 40 new ships of different classes, as well as the latest weapons - including hypersonic strike systems and unmanned underwater vehicles.
In 2020, the parade was held for the first time in Kaspiysk, where the base of the Caspian Fleet was relocated from Astrakhan.
In addition to St. Petersburg, parades were held in Baltiysk, Kaspiysk, Severomorsk, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Vladivostok, as well as in the annexed Sevastopol and on the raid of the Syrian port of Tartus.
The main parade in the waters of the Neva River and the Gulf of Finland was attended by 4,000 military personnel and 46 ships, including nuclear and diesel submarines, as well as helicopters and aircraft of the Naval Aviation.
Before the start of the parade, Putin, accompanied by Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, Navy Commander-in-Chief Admiral Nikolai Evmenov and Commander of the Western Military District, Colonel-General Zhuravlev, toured several ships on the Kronstadt raid and in the Gulf of Finland, greeting the personnel.
The decoration of the parade was also a copy of the first Russian liner ship "Poltava," recreated according to archival drawings.
Emperor Peter I took part in its design.
In his speech, Putin recalled that this year marks the 200th anniversary of the discovery of Antarctica as a result of an expedition by Russian sailors Faddey Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev.
And snipers providing security were seen on the roof of the Senate and Synod buildings during the parade.
More than 46 warships and more than 1.5 military personnel took part in the parade in Baltiysk, where the Baltic Fleet is based, and a large warship, Kaliningrad, landed a naval landing.
In the annexed Sevastopol, a parade was held with the participation of 30 ships and a performance dedicated to the history of the Black Sea Fleet, which included the departure of a group of divers from under the water.
The parade in Severomorsk was attended by the new strategic nuclear submarine Prince Vladimir, which was accepted into the Northern Fleet in June.
In Vladivostok, the holiday ended with fireworks.
The Russian Navy will receive forty ships and vessels this year
Forty ships and vessels will join the Russian Navy this year, Russian President Vladimir Putin said.
"The level of equipment of our navy is constantly growing.
This year, it will include forty ships and vessels of various classes, "he said, speaking at the main parade in honor of Navy Day in St. Petersburg.
Putin also recalled that a few days ago, six new ships of the far sea zone were laid at three shipyards in Russia.
Earlier it was reported that a parade in honor of Navy Day began in St. Petersburg.

How the Central Bank's decision to reduce the key rate will affect the economy
The Bank of Russia is expected to cut the key rate again.
It fell another 0.25 percentage points, to 4.25% per annum - formally another historic low.
Judging by the return of the short rate cut step, as well as the tone of the Central Bank's statements and updated forecasts for the Russian economy, the regulator looks at economic prospects more optimistically than before.
This means that the current cycle of monetary easing may soon come to a halt.
"We continued to soften monetary policy, primarily given that there are still risks of inflation deviating from 4% in 2021," said the head of the Bank of Russia, Elvira Nabiullina.
They are associated with a significant decline in economic activity, a fall in domestic and external demand.
According to Nabiullina, economic recovery will take more than a year and a half.
At the same time, she noted that after the lifting of restrictions due to the pandemic, economic processes revived: energy consumption, consumer and investment demand were restored, construction and production of consumer goods expanded, and the annual rate of decline in freight turnover of transport and industrial production slowed.
According to the updated forecast of the Central Bank, in 2020 the economy will shrink by 4.5-5.5% (previously 4-6% was expected), and the economic recovery in 2021 will amount to 3.5-4.5%, in 2022 - 2.5-3.5%.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised its forecast for annual oil prices to $38 and $40 per barrel of Urals in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
Previously, the Central Bank expected $27 and $35 per barrel.
Finally, the Bank of Russia's inflation forecast for 2020 amounted to 3.7-4.2% against the previously expected 3.8-4.8%.
The Bank of Russia's view of the economic situation is becoming more optimistic, which brings us closer to the end of the easing cycle, according to economists for Russia and the CIS Renaissance Capital, Sofia Donets and Andrei Melashchenko.
Thus, the Bank of Russia has been consistently reducing the key rate for more than a year, since the beginning of last summer it has already fallen by 3.5 percentage points.
And at the last meeting in June, the Central Bank lowered it immediately by one percentage point due to low inflation rates due to depressed demand and the need to stimulate the economy, which slowed down due to the pandemic and related restrictions.
The chances of fine-tuning monetary policy remain (at the next meeting on September 18 and until the end of the year), but the limit is already close, agrees the chief analyst of Rosbank, Evgeny Koshelev.
The combination of pro-inflationary risks also points to the proximity of a pause in easing interest rate policy - disrupted supply chains, possible cost increases due to epidemic prevention measures and a faster (than expected) recovery in demand, he says.
To top it off, the Bank of Russia's subsequent actions will require greater attention to inflationary processes during the harvest season, as well as external volatility, which has increased amid geopolitical conflicts, Koshelev points out.
One way or another, a reduction in the key rate will lead to a further reduction in rates for the most reliable borrowers, as well as, possibly, on mortgages, says Maxim Petronevich, senior economist at the analytical department of Otkritie Bank.
The adjustment of rates will be less pronounced than the reduction of the key rate, he clarifies.
Rates on consumer loans could fall by another 0.3-0.6 percentage points during the second half of the year, mortgage rates could end the year in the range of 6.2-7%, BKS Premier economist Anton Pokatovich does not rule out.
Average deposit rates, in his opinion, will also fall - in the coming months they may fall to 4.2-4.5% (now barely above 4.5%).
Further, they could fall to 4% if the Central Bank lowers the key rate in the fall, Pokatovich believes.
The Centre Party promises to pay all its debts by the end of the year
The general secretary of the Centre Party, Mikhail Korb, spoke about this in an interview with ERR.
According to him, the total amount of payments to be made by the party is about 300,000 euros.
"According to today's financial forecasts, the Centre Party will settle its current debts and obligations by the end of this year," Corb said.
Earlier it became known that the prime minister's party returned 110,100 euros to the state, which were recognized as a prohibited donation.
Car and caravan collide in Harjumaa: four people injured

As a result of the incident, the drivers of both vehicles were injured, as well as passengers on wheels in the house: a 10-year-old child and a 48-year-old woman, who were taken to hospital.
The rest of the victims received first aid on the spot, they did not need hospitalization.
The exact circumstances of the incident are being clarified.
Ukrainian military to control ceasefire in Donbass
The Ukrainian military has begun preparations for a cease-fire on the demarcation line in the Donbas, control over the implementation of agreements will be carried out by military personnel with experience in peacekeeping missions, reports the headquarters of the United Forces on Facebook.
"Units from the United Forces have begun preparations for a full and comprehensive ceasefire on the demarcation line, which comes into effect on July 27, 2020," the statement said.
It is noted that, starting from 00: 01 on July 27, at each of the Ukrainian positions, additional control over the ceasefire will be exercised by specially seconded Ukrainian military personnel, most of whom have combat experience and directly dealt with relevant issues during their participation in peacekeeping missions under the auspices of the UN.
Such a step will allow "not to distract the personnel of the units of the United Forces from performing combat tasks and prevent possible provocations," the statement said.
At a meeting of the contact group on Donbas held on Wednesday, the parties agreed on a set of additional measures to control the truce, which, among other things, includes a ban on the activities of sabotage and reconnaissance groups and a ban on firing, including sniper fire.

Psychologist: "Emelyanenko still can't forget parting with her beloved woman."
Psychologist Veronika Stepanova, who has more than 1 million followers on Youtube, spoke about MMA fighter Alexander Emelyanenko, who is the ex-husband of her sister.
Olya met Sasha, they began to have a stormy love, "Stepanova said in a video on her YouTube channel.
- It was a very beautiful story, they instantly gave birth to a child, everything was fine and wonderful.
At some point, Sasha was fed up with all this, he wanted to take a little walk.
And if any other woman treats this normally (well, think about it, I went for a walk, to dance a little), then this is not about Olga.
She does not tolerate such things.
And his story about a little walk ended with the fact that his sister instantly married another person and immediately gave birth to a child for him.
When Sasha recovered from what had happened, he couldn't believe it.
He tried to crawl on his knees, give diamonds.
His lion's pride blew his head off.
He wanted to return everything, but he didn't understand how to return it.
They maintain friendly relations, they have a common child, but he still cannot recover.
His destructive behavior is a cry of despair, an attempt to either kill or get her attention.
Carolina Avenue will leave to play in Sweden.

Albert Proza signed a contract with Tallinn's Legion
Prose's last club was Tartu's Tammeka, which he played for last season.
"I've been out of football for more than a year because of injury.
On April 30, he underwent surgery.
But now it's all right - ready to play again.
However, so far my form is far from optimal.
When will I make my debut for Legion?
It is quite possible that on July 29 I will play a certain amount of time for the Estonian Cup, and on August 1 I will be included in the application for the championship match against Paide.
But everything depends on the coach's decision, he will decide whether I am ready or not.
I myself believe that I still need to recruit quite a lot, "Albert Proza said in an interview with ERR on Sunday.
In the current Estonian Football Championship, Legion, after 14 rounds, is ninth in the standings with 10 points.
"At the moment, if you look at the table, we can't talk about fighting for high places, but Legion is an ambitious team, we have a pretty good squad.
I think that next year we will have better results.
And the task for this year is to keep a place in the top league and play more confidently, "added Proza.
"I don't set any personal goals for myself.
Returning to football after such a long pause is not easy.
Now my main task is to help the team stay in the top league and climb the table as high as possible, "the striker said.
Previously, Proza also played for the capital's Flora and Infonet, the Finnish ROPs and TPNs, and the Maltese Valletta.
Proza played 7 matches for the Estonian national team.

The main naval parade was marked by new ships and shooting technologies
At the Main Naval Parade in St. Petersburg, a new shooting technology was applied: a video camera "passed" under one of the ships, showing it "from the inside out."
From this perspective, the passage of the newest serial small rocket ship Sovetsk along the Admiralteyskaya Embankment was filmed.
The main naval parade was broadcast by the Rossiya 1 television channel and the Russia.tv website.
Earlier, on June 24, at a parade in honor of the 75th anniversary of the Great Victory, the camera "passed" through the barrel of a tank inside an armored vehicle during the transition from one plan to another, and during the flight of fighters from the Russian Vityazi and Strizhi aerobatic groups, the camera "flew" from the nozzle of the plane's engine.
The main naval parade consisting of 46 warships, boats and submarines, 41 aircraft and helicopters of naval aviation and more than 4 thousand military personnel ended in the waters of Kronstadt.
In particular, the parade was attended by the large anti-submarine ship Vice Admiral Kulakov, the corvette Stoyky, the large landing ships Minsk and Patriot, the nuclear submarine missile cruiser Eagle, the submarine Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, the patrol ship Vasily Bykov, the small anti-submarine ships Kazanets and Urengoy, the small missile ships Liven and Passat, and the missile boat Chuvashia.
On the Kronstadt raid in the Gulf of Finland, it was possible to see for the first time the large landing ship "Peter Morgunov," built according to the project 11711 of the Nevsky Design Bureau at the Baltic plant "Yantar."
The lead ship of this series, Ivan Gren, is already serving in the Northern Fleet, TASS reports.
Among other newcomers to the Navy's service recently was the first serial frigate, the Admiral of the Kasatonov Fleet, built under project 22350 at the North Shipyard plant.
Another newcomer to the Navy is the diesel-electric submarine "Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky" of project 636.3 of the Central Design Bureau of Marine Equipment "Rubin," built at the "Admiralty Shipyard."
It joined Russia's Pacific Fleet in December 2019.
Other newest ships that have recently become part of the Navy are the small rocket ships Sovetsk and Mytishchi of project 22800 (Karakurt), developed by the Almaz Central Design Bureau.
Small missile ships "Veliky Ustyug" and "Serpukhov" of project 21631 "Buyan-M" also took part in the parade on the Neva.
And the largest participants were the nuclear submarine missile cruiser "Eagle" and the large anti-submarine ship "Vice Admiral Kulakov" - they could be seen in the Gulf of Finland.
In recognition of the great contribution of the Russian fleet to the exploration of the world's oceans, two state-of-the-art hydrographic boats, Georgy Zima and Mikhail Kazansky, passed along the Neva together with warships. And on the Kronstadt raid, the oceanographic research vessel Admiral Vladimir, which completed in June a joint scientific round-the-world expedition to the shores of Antarctica in honor of the 200th anniversary of its discovery by Russian sailors Faddey Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev, rose.
And at the Palace Bridge, one could see the first 16th-century Russian liner ship, Poltava, recreated at the historic shipyard.
This 54-gun sailboat was launched in 1712, participated in the war with the Swedes, and in 1717 provided landing on the island of Gotland.
In 1725, this ship was withdrawn from the Baltic Fleet, and after its re-establishment, it was launched in St. Petersburg on May 27, 2018.
Travel to Kronstadt this year was limited for the duration of the parade due to the prevention of the spread of the coronavirus COVID-19, RIA Novosti reports.
1 person killed during protests in the US
Protests took place in Seattle, Portland, Louisville and Denver, Actual Camera reported on Sunday.
In Austin, Texas, a man died during a protest.
The protester was shot with a rifle while he was sitting in his car.
A suspect in the crime has already been detained.
Demonstrators clashed with law enforcement officers in other cities.
Protesters staged riots and police were forced to use tear gas and stun grenades.
Poll: The ruling Union of Peasants and Greens of Lithuania once again topped the rating of parties
The Union of Peasants and Greens of Lithuania, which heads the ruling coalition of the Seimas, topped the rating of parties.
This was shown by a survey conducted by the sociological research company Vilmorus since the order of the newspaper Lietuvos rytas.
After winning the 2016 parliamentary elections, the "peasants" lost first place and for a long time led the main critic of Russia in Lithuania, the opposition "Fatherland Union - Christian Democrats (Conservatives).
However, recently, the President of Lithuania, Gitanas Nauseda, assessing the electoral possibilities of the parties, stated that the Union of Peasants and Greens, after this year's parliamentary elections, will probably be able to form a coalition again.
The announcement sparked outrage from conservatives.
The latest poll showed that if parliamentary elections were held today, 17.6 percent of voters would vote for peasants and 17.2 percent for conservatives.
According to Vilmorus director Vladas Gaidis, the gap is within the margin of error, and yet the ruling parties have stopped lagging behind the conservatives.
According to Gaidis, the sociological success of the "peasants" was facilitated by the news that their electoral list will be headed by Prime Minister Saulus Skvernjalis.
This politician was first on the list of "peasants" in the 2016 elections.
In third place is the Social Democratic Party, for which 7.1 percent of respondents are now ready to vote.
During the month, it unexpectedly lost 2 percent.
The fourth is the Labour Party, headed by a businessman of Russian origin, Viktor Uspaskikh (6.2 percent).
The rest of the political organizations, judging by the poll, will not yet be able to overcome the 5 percent electoral barrier.
Putin spoke about the unique advantages of the Russian fleet
Russian President Vladimir Putin said at the Main Naval Parade in St. Petersburg that the unique advantages and increased combat capabilities of the Russian fleet will be achieved through the introduction of advanced digital technologies.
As the head of state specified, domestic hypersonic strike systems, unmanned underwater vehicles have no analogues in the world.
In addition, the Russian leader drew attention to the most effective means of defense of the Russian Federation.
According to the Russian leader, the level of equipment of the Russian Navy is constantly growing, so this year 40 ships and vessels of various classes will be admitted to its composition.
At the same time, it is noted that the emphasis will be placed on equipping unique hypersonic shock systems.
Today, the Navy is armed with the latest ships equipped with high-precision weapons, strategic submarine cruisers and multi-purpose submarines, as well as unique specimens of special equipment, the president added.
Putin also stressed that naval sailors perform the most difficult tasks with dignity, serving the Fatherland impeccably.
The Ministry of Emergency Situations warned residents of the Moscow region about the threat
A thunderstorm and wind gusts of up to 15 m/s are expected in the Moscow region. This was reported by the regional department of the Ministry of Emergency Situations on Sunday, July 26.
Residents are advised to remove household items from courtyards and trim dry trees that could damage housing.
The car needs to be placed in a garage or parked away from trees or weakly fortified structures.
To avoid a lightning strike, it is recommended not to heat the stove in the house in a thunderstorm and not to use electrical appliances, and not to hide outside under trees (especially lonely ones), not to swim in water bodies.
Those in the car are advised to close the windows and stay inside.
On July 24, the Ministry of Emergency Situations also warned residents of the Moscow region about the threat.
Excess requirements for applications for public procurement will be excluded by law
The law may establish exhaustive requirements for applications for participation in procurement.
In the autumn session, at the plenary session of the State Duma, it is planned to consider in the second reading a bill establishing requirements for the content and composition of an application for participation in the procurement, the participants of which can only be small and medium-sized businesses.
Amendments are being made by the government to the law "On the procurement of goods, works and services by certain types of legal entities."
The bill was developed in compliance with the roadmap for the implementation of the Strategy for the Development of Small and Medium Enterprises in the Russian Federation until 2030, approved by the government.
It provides for the preparation of a draft law on an exhaustive list of documents that customers have the right to require as part of an application from procurement participants - small and medium-sized businesses.
And also - on the list of requirements for these documents.
To date, the law "On the procurement of goods, works, services by certain types of legal entities" provides a framework for regulating the procurement activities of certain types of legal entities.
The requirements for the content, form, registration and composition of the application for participation in the procurement are established by the customers themselves in the procurement documentation.
"As a result, customers establish excessive requirements for the content, registration of an application, the mandatory presence in its composition of certificates, certificates, extracts, the period of receipt of which in the authorized bodies is comparable to the period of submission of applications, which leads to the impossibility of participating in such a procurement and a reduction in the number of participants in the procurement," the explanation to the bill reads.
The new bill provides for the establishment of an exhaustive list of documents that customers have the right to require as part of an application from procurement participants who are small and medium-sized businesses.
"The adoption of the document will eliminate the arbitrary establishment by customers of requirements for the composition and content of applications of participants who are subjects of small and medium-sized businesses," the explanatory note says.
As an artist, interconnection is very important to me.
In my works, I try to show that people are inseparable from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I first visited Antarctica almost 10 years ago, where I saw icebergs.
I felt awe.
My heart beat faster, my head swirled, trying to understand what opened up in front of me.
The icebergs floated around almost 200 feet out of the water. And I couldn't help but be surprised that it's one snowflake on top of another, year after year.
Icebergs are born when they break off glacial ice or break off ice shelves.
Each iceberg has its own personality.
Everyone interacts with the environment in their own way and accumulates their experience.
Some refuse to give up and hold on until the bitter end, while others can no longer fight and die in a fit of vivid passion.
Looking at the iceberg, it is easy to think that it is isolated, that it is closed and alone, just as we humans often see ourselves.
But things are very different in life.
When the iceberg melts, I breathe in its ancient atmosphere.
When an iceberg melts, it releases fresh, mineral-rich water that nourishes many forms of life.
I approach photographing these icebergs as creating portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these individual moments they exist in this image, and that it will never happen again.
They do not die when they melt; it is not the end, but the continuation of their journey in the cycle of life.
Sometimes the ice in the icebergs I photograph is very young - it's only a couple thousand years old.
And some icebergs are over 100,000 years old.
The last photos I want to show you show an iceberg I photographed in Kirtartivatziak, Greenland.
It is very rare to see an iceberg spin.
So here it is.
On the left you can see a small boat.
It is approximately 4.5 metres long.
Please note the shape of the iceberg and where it comes into contact with water.
Here you can see how it starts to spin, and the boat has swam to the other side, and there is a person standing there.
This is a medium-sized Greenland iceberg.
It protrudes out of the water at about 120 feet or 40 meters.
But this record is in real time.
(Music) And so simply, the iceberg shows us the other side of his personality.
Thank you.
(Applause)
One winter morning a few years ago, I was driving to work in Johannesburg, South Africa, and noticed fog hanging over the city.
I drive there almost every day, so it's unlikely I wouldn't have paid attention earlier.
Johannesburg is known for its special skyline, which I could barely see that morning.
Soon I realised it was a huge cloud of polluted air.
The contrast between my usual picturesque environment and that smog-shrouded sky stirred up something in me.
I was horrified that this city of colourful and picturesque sunsets would be engulfed in darkness.
At that moment, I had a strong desire to do something, but I didn't know what.
All I knew was that I couldn't stay away.
The main difficulty was that I didn't really understand ecology, air quality management or atmospheric chemistry.
I'm a computer engineer and I was sure I couldn't handle the problem with code.
(Laughter) Who am I to make a difference?
But I was a resident of this city.
In the years that followed, I learned one very important lesson - one that needs to be taken seriously if we are to have a better future.
Even if you are not an expert in any field, your experience from outside can be the key to solving complex problems in this area.
Sometimes your unique vision can result in an extraordinary idea that will move everything from the dead end, but you have to be bold enough to try it.
This is the only way out.
Even then, I realised that in order to at least try to make a difference, first I would have to sort out air pollution, so I became a student again.
Already at the very beginning of my research, I learned that air pollution is the greatest danger to the environment.
According to the World Health Organization, nearly 14 percent of global deaths in 2012 were caused by air pollution in homes and ambient air pollution, which is especially common in low- and middle-income countries.
Air pollution alone causes more deaths each year than malaria or HIV/AIDS.
In Africa, the number of premature deaths due to unsafe sanitation or child malnutrition is no match for the number of deaths due to air pollution, and it costs huge economic costs: more than $400 billion as of 2013, according to a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
Now, in my work, I am exploring new opportunities in the field of artificial intelligence, where the symbiotic relationship between man and machine will help find a favorable basis for making the right decisions.
In the process of studying the problem of air pollution, it became clear that we need to find a way to make better decisions to control air pollution, and given the scale of the problem, it is necessary to do this together.
So I decided to get to know people who work in this area.
I started meeting with officials from Johannesburg and other nearby cities, I also engaged the local scientific community and also made some cold calls.
The networking process I took up helped me gain a deeper understanding of the problem.
It also helped me avoid falling into the trap that my colleagues often fall into when trying to innovate, when we quickly apply technology before we are clearly aware of the problem.
I started to think about what I could do to improve the situation.
I just started asking myself how I could effectively combine all my programming and artificial intelligence skills with the experiences of the people I met.
I wanted to create an online platform for air quality regulation that would identify patterns in pollution, look to the future and determine what we should expect.
I was determined to put my idea into practice, but faced uncertainty, I had no guarantee of success.
I only had a certain set of engineering skills, skills that I had acquired in my profession (Laughter) and that people dealing with air pollution had not had for years.
I realized that sometimes just one fresh look, some new skills create the conditions for the appearance of something outstanding.
Will power and imagination are our guiding star, empowering us to find new ways and circumvent difficulties.
Armed with a deep understanding of the problem of air pollution and having studied decades of information on pollutant concentrations and meteorological conditions in Johannesburg and beyond, my colleagues from South Africa and China and I have created an air decision support system that is in the cloud.
The software system analyzes historical data and data in real time to identify spatial and temporal trends.
We then used new machine learning technology to predict pollution levels for different pollutants a few days in advance.
This means that residents can make better decisions about their movements and choice of place of residence for their families.
We will be able to predict pollution cases in advance, calculate the culprits of pollution, who, by order of the authorities, will be forced to reduce the scale of their activities.
With the help of scenario planning, urban planners will be able to make the right decisions in the development of infrastructure, such as residential settlements, industrial zones.
We completed testing of our technology, which lasted about 120 days, covering the whole of South Africa.
The results were approved when we demonstrated a close relationship between the forecast data and the data we received on the spot.
Thanks to our leadership, we have created cutting-edge, innovative technologies that will be able to predict air quality with unprecedented accuracy, improving a city that not so long ago I drove one winter morning and thought: "Something is wrong here. What can be done?"
And here's my conclusion: what if I hadn't studied air pollution then?
What if I hadn't expressed concern about the state of the environment and just hoped that someone somewhere was already dealing with the problem?
That's what I've learned: when we decide on a complex enterprise that contributes to what we firmly believe in, it's important to focus on success and consider the consequences of inaction.
We must not get out of the way in the face of obstacles and difficulties, this should motivate us even more.
Wherever you are, when you realise that your natural curiosity is aroused by something and it's something that excites you and you have crazy and bold ideas and maybe it's beyond your competence, ask yourself: why not?
Why not take action and solve the problem in your own way, as you can?
And perhaps you will be pleasantly surprised.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Republicans will offer to issue another $1 trillion to support the US economy
Republicans will propose spending another $1 trillion to support the United States economy, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin confirmed on Fox News on Sunday, July 26.
"Inside the $1 trillion package, there are the most priority and urgent things," the head of the US Treasury noted.
The support package includes new direct payments to Americans.
The proposal must be accepted by Congress and signed by US President Donald Trump.
Representatives of the Democratic Party of the United States believe that the proposed funds are insufficient.
In spring, about $3 trillion was allocated to support the economy in the United States.
On April 24, Trump signed a bill on financial assistance to the American economy in the amount of almost half a trillion dollars to combat the coronavirus and its consequences.
According to analysts, US GDP in the second quarter of 2020 will fall by 25% in annual terms, which will be the strongest decline in the country's history.
Microsoft will forcibly update older versions of Windows 10
Microsoft has confirmed the transition to the next stage of distribution of the May 2020 Update for the Windows 10 operating system, writes the BetaNews portal on July 25.
Package not needed: FAS questioned the legality of Microsoft's antivirus proposal
Having received software for remote work from an American corporation, government agencies may violate the law
The company will expand the range of users with a new version of the OS.
To do this, it was decided to automatically update computers with older versions of the system.
It is assumed that a specially developed algorithm by the company will identify devices with older versions of the software platform, whose support period will soon end, and automatically install Windows 10 May 2020 Update on them.
In the near future, this will affect computers with Windows 10 (1809) and Windows 10 (1903), whose support expires on November 10 and December 8, respectively, the publication notes.
On July 21, it was reported that after the update of the Windows 10 operating system, users faced problems connecting to the Internet - there was no access to the network.
The difficulties were not related to the connection itself, but to the status of the connection.
Dr. Myasnikov named the main indicators of human health
In the "death quartet," one of the main criteria turned out to be excess waist volume
Doctor and TV presenter Aleksandr Myasnikov spoke about the key indicators by which human health can be determined.
His so-called "death quartet" includes four criteria - an increase in pressure, cholesterol, sugar and waist volume, the doctor told Rossiya 1 TV channel.
Myasnikov urged everyone to pay attention to these factors.
Moreover, according to him, controlling waist volume is even more important than weight.
For men, this parameter should not exceed 102 centimeters, for women - 88 centimeters.
Exceeding these standards may indicate that health is at risk.
First of all, we are talking about the state of the heart - the volume of the waist above normal is a risk factor for stroke, heart attack, as well as cancer and diabetes.
Earlier, Myasnikov explained why you can eat candy overnight.
The doctor explained that sugar itself is not dangerous to health, dessert will become harmful only when there is such food in large quantities, and candy at night, according to him, is not the worst snack.
"Igor Drive" determined the winners in Turing and Super Production
At the "Igor Drive" motorway, where the main stage of the Russian series of ring races takes place, the competitions in Touring and Super Production have ended.
This was reported by Channel 5 on Sunday, July 26.
The leaders in Turing were Kirill Ladygin, Dmitry Bragin, Alexei Dudukalo, Pavel Kalmanovich, Ivan Lukashevich.
Andrey Petukhov, Vladislav Nezvankin, Nikolai Vikhansky, Vadim Antipov, Dmitry Lebedev won the Super Production.
Rustam Fatkhutdinov became the best in the SMP RSKG Trophy, Lev Tolkachev and Pavel Yashin became the winners.
The documentary "John Lewis: Good Trouble" was released online.
The biographical film, which was supposed to be a kind of visual congratulation to Congressman John Lewis, who celebrated his 80th birthday at the beginning of the year, became an unfolding epitaph.
On July 17, a prominent human rights activist and politician died after a long battle with pancreatic cancer.
These days, the United States hosts numerous mourning events in memory of him.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows have pushed for legislation focused on several topics, including federal unemployment benefits, which expire Friday.
It is proposed that the remaining issues be taken up at a later date.
Moderna Inc said Sunday that it received an additional $472 million from the U.S. Office of Higher Biomedical Research to develop a vaccine against the new coronavirus.
The U.S.-based drug firm explained that the additional funding is intended to help the company operate at a late stage of clinical trials.
Without any warning, the UK removed Spain from the list of safe countries for travel and introduced a two-week quarantine for all those entering the country from Spain.
British Foreign Secretary Dominique Raab did not apologise for the sudden decision, explaining it by the recent spike in the incidence of COVID-19 in Spain.
Protests
Protests were held in a number of cities in the United States to draw attention to the problem of racial injustice.
In Seattle, police used stun grenades and tear gas and arrested 45 people after demonstrations in support of protests in Portland turned violent.
Police said more than 20 police officers were injured.
In Austin, Texas, on Saturday, a man died when someone shot at members of the Black Lives Matter march.
According to media reports, the man may have approached the car with a rifle when he was shot.
US experts call Pompeo the worst secretary of state in the country's history
International affairs experts Aaron David Miller and Richard Sokolsky called Mike Pompeo the worst secretary of state in the history of the United States.
CNN published a material with their opinion on July 23.
"In just two short years, Mike Pompeo - with an eye to the presidency in 2024 and the support of President Donald Trump - has become not only the worst Secretary of State in U.S. history, but also the most politically biased," the text says.
Experts accused Pompeo of "politicizing the position of secretary of state and desecrating the institution he leads" in order to advance his personal political agenda and protect Trump "from responsibility and the rule of law."
According to them, the Secretary of State, in particular, covers up "Trump's blackmail of Ukraine" and is ready to substitute employees of the American Foreign Ministry for their cooperation with Congress in this case.
In addition, Pompeo was reminded that he was very friendly with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who claimed partial responsibility for the murder of The Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashqaji.
Trump announced the decision to appoint Mike Pompeo as head of the State Department on March 13, 2018, following the dismissal of former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.
Prior to that, Pompeo headed the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
In Tikhoretsk, a foreign car entered a store
Today, July 26, in Tikhoretsk, on Menshikov Street, a Land Cruiser SUV speedily entered the shopping hall of a chain supermarket.
Emergency was recorded by surveillance cameras.
The accident injured a boy who was in the store at the time.
The child was hospitalized with injuries and cuts.
Showcases and counters were destroyed in the hall of the shopping facility.
Eyewitnesses claim that the driver of the foreign car was drunk.
Do you know how many species of flowering plants exist?
A quarter of a million - at least those we know - a quarter of a million species of flowering plants.
Flowers are a real problem for plants:
it's hard to create them -
they require huge amounts of energy and resources.
Why do plants go to such difficulties?
The answer to this, as to many other questions, is sex.
I know what you're thinking when you look at these pictures.
The reason why sexual reproduction is so important is that there are many other ways to reproduce plants.
They can be propagated by cuttings; they can fertilize themselves or pollinate themselves.
But it is very important for them to spread their genes in order to mix them with the genes of other plants - so they can adjust to natural niches.
This is how evolution works.
Plants transmit genetic information through pollen.
Some of you may have seen some of these images before.
As I like to say, every home should have a raster electron microscope to look at these things.
There are as many different types of pollen as flowering plants.
By the way, this can be applied in forensics and not only.
Basically, the pollen that causes allergies is the pollen of plants that use the wind to spread it. It's a very inefficient process, that's why it gets so hard into our noses.
Plants have to throw away huge masses of pollen, in the hope that the sex cells, the male sex cells that are contained in the pollen, somehow accidentally reach another flower, absolutely by accident.
The pollen of all herbs, and therefore of all cereals, and the pollen of most trees, is carried by the wind.
However, most species use insects for this. To some extent, this is more reasonable because less pollen is required.
Insects and other species can take pollen and carry it where it is needed.
It is clear that we know the relationship between insects and plants.
It's a symbiotic relationship: whether it's flies, birds or bees - they all get something in return, and it's something that's usually nectar.
In some cases, this symbiosis has led to amazing adaptations - for example, the hummingbird hawk-moth is beautiful in its adaptation.
The plant gets its way - the hawk moth spreads pollen elsewhere.
Plants have evolved in such a way that they have created small landing strips in different places for bees, so that they are not lost.
Many plants have colours that make them look like insects.
These are lily pollen, cleverly made so that when an unsuspecting insect sits on them, the pollen flips over and hits it on the back, showered with a large amount of pollen, with which the insect then goes to another plant.
But an orchid that looks like it has jaws. In a sense, it has them, which forces the insect to crawl out, covered in pollen, which it will then spread.
There are at least 20,000 species of orchids - and they are all surprisingly diverse.
They go for a variety of tricks.
They are forced to attract pollinators to breed.
This orchid, known as the Darwin orchid, because it was he who studied it and made a startling prediction when he saw it. A very long tube of nectar can be seen descending from the orchid.
You see the middle of the flower: the insect must shove the proboscis directly into the middle and reach the very bottom of this tube to get nectar.
Darwin argued, looking at the flower: "I guess something has evolved with it."
And indeed, here is the insect.
Usually his proboscis is folded, but in its straightened shape it looks like this.
One might think that if nectar - so valuable and expensive in production - attracts so much attention from pollinators, then, as with sex in humans, deceptions can begin.
A flower might say, "I have a little nectar.
Will you take a look? "Here is a plant.
This is a plant that insects love in South Africa. In the process of evolution, they acquired a long proboscis to get nectar from the bottom.
And this is imitation.
This plant imitates the previous one.
And here's the long-proboscis fly, which didn't get a drop of nectar from the fake. Because the imitation plant didn't give her anything. She thought she'd get something.
But not only did the fly not receive nectar from the fake plant, but also - if you look closer - in the area of the lower part of the head, it grabbed a little pollen, which it will transfer to another plant, unless some botanist appears and pinches it on a blue cardboard.
(Laughter) The deception is spreading in the plant kingdom as well.
This flower has black dots: they seem black to us, but for male insects of a certain species, they look like two females ready for anything.
(Laughter) When an insect gets to this flower and lands on it, it dips itself in pollen, which, of course, it will transfer to another plant. If you look at the same raster electron microscope that should be in every house, you can see here a certain three-dimensional layout of the pattern.
So it probably even brings a pleasant sensation to the insect, in addition to what looks attractive.
In the picture from the electronic microscope - here is an orchid imitating an insect - it is clear that different parts of this structure have different colors and textures, but insects can perceive them in a completely different way.
This plant has adapted to imitate the shiny metal surface of the body of some beetles.
Under the raster electron microscope, it can be seen that the surface is very different from the surfaces we were looking at.
Sometimes the whole plant mimics the insect, even from our point of view.
I think it looks like some kind of flying creature.
It's an amazing, amazing flower.
And smart. It's called obsidian.
I call him a cunning man.
For a bee of a certain species, it resembles another very aggressive bee, and it flies up and hits his head many times to drive away the "bee," and of course is covered with pollen.
This plant also mimics another orchid that has a wonderful store of food for insects.
And this one has nothing for them.
So she's cheating on two levels - just unheard of.
(Laughter) Here is ylang ylang, a component of many perfumes.
I recently smelled someone who had strangled them.
Flowers, in principle, do not need to be so fragrant.
They emit a striking range of smells for any insects with a sense of smell.
But it does not smell so good.
It is a flower that smells very, very bad and has evolved to look like a fall.
The flies really like it.
They fly in and pollinate.
Here is this one, helicodiceros, also known as the "lily of a dead horse."
I don't know how a dead horse really smells, but this one definitely smells very similar.
It's really horrible.
And meat flies just can't resist.
They fly inside and fly to the bottom.
There they lay their eggs thinking it was a great piece of falling and not realising there was no food for the larvae and the larvae would die, but in the meantime the plant has benefited because the bristles relax and the fly flies off to pollinate the next flower.
Here is an arum, an arum maculatum, or, in the United States, a spotted aronic.
I took a picture of him the previous week in Dorset.
It warms up about 15 degrees above ambient temperature - astonishing.
If you look at it from above, you can see something like a dam behind the cob. Flies are attracted by the heat - the evaporation of volatile compounds - and they get stuck underneath in this container.
They drink divine nectar and become sticky.
During the night, they are covered with pollen flowing around them from above, and then the bristles we saw above weaken and release the pollen covered flies.
If you think it's amazing, here's one of my favorites.
Philodendron Cello.
Those from Brazil should be aware of this plant.
This is the most striking thing.
This phallic piece is about 30 centimetres long.
It does something that no other plant I know does: when it blooms - here in the middle of the cobs - for about two days, its metabolism is similar to that of mammals.
Instead of starch, which is food for plants, it takes something similar to brown fat and burns it at such a rate, digests just like a small cat.
This energy output, in equivalent weight, is twice that of a hummingbird - quite astonishing.
And it does something else, also unusual.
Not only does it heat itself to 115 Fahrenheit, or 43-44 Celsius, for two days, but it also keeps the temperature constant.
It has a thermoregulation mechanism that maintains a constant temperature.
You ask, "Why is he doing this?"
Well, as if you didn't know that there are beetles that just love making love at this temperature.
They get inside and that's where it starts.
(Laughter) And the plant showered them with pollen and they went to pollinate.
Surprisingly invented.
Most of the pollinators we know are insects, but in the tropics also many birds and butterflies pollinate.
Many tropical flowers are red, and it seems to us that this is because butterflies and birds have a vision similar to ours, and that they see red very well.
But if you look at the spectrum, man and bird see red, green and blue - they see that spectrum.
Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet light, and they distinguish different shades of ultraviolet light -
which are at this end of the spectrum.
Surely you think, "It would be great if we could see them."
Yes, we can.
So what does the insect see?
Last week I took these pictures of the colourful sun flower family in Dorset.
These are the smallest yellow flowers we see everywhere.
This is what it looks like in daylight.
But this is what it looks like if you remove the red.
Most bees don't see red.
Then I put ultraviolet filters on the camera and did a very, very long exposure with certain ultraviolet frequencies, and that's what happened.
The most important thing is that there is no "apple."
Of course, we know exactly what bees see, no more than you know what I see when I call it red.
We can't say what's going on in the mind of a neighbor, they're not talking about an insect anymore.
But the picture will be about the same contrast, standing out strongly in the background.
Here is another small flower - a different range of ultraviolet frequencies, other filters, to match pollinators.
They will see something like this.
In case you think this applies to all yellow flowers - no flower was hurt during the shooting, this one was just attached to a tripod and not ripped off - when they are in ultraviolet light then take a look at this one.
By the way, it could serve as the basis of sunscreen, because such creams work by absorbing ultraviolet light.
Maybe this connection would be useful.
Finally, here is one of the enoters that Bjorn Rorslett from Norway sent me - a fantastic hidden pattern.
I like the idea of something hidden.
I think there's something poetic about it. These photos were taken with an ultraviolet filter, which is mainly used by astronomers to capture Venus - actually the clouds of Venus.
This is the main purpose of this filter.
Venus, of course, is the goddess of love and fertility, and this is in tune with flowers.
Flowers not only spend a lot of effort to attract pollinators, they also somehow managed to convince us to plant whole fields of flowers and give them to each other at the moments of birth and death, and in particular at a wedding, which, if you think about it, is a moment that represents the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another.
Thank you very much.

In China, the Yangtze River experienced its third flood in a year
After a heavy downpour in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, China's longest waterway, floods erupted for the third time in a year.
The flooding was caused by an increase in the water level in the upstream tributaries of the river, which led to a rapid increase in the flow of water into the reservoir of the Chinese hydroelectric power station "Sanxia"/"Three Gorges" /.
At 14: 00 on July 26, an inflow of 50 thousand cubic meters/s was observed in the reservoir, which is expected to reach its maximum of 60 thousand cubic meters/s in the evening of July 27, the Yangtze River Water Management Committee under the Ministry of Water Management of the PRC reported.
The committee today issued flood alerts on a section of the upper Yangtze River and overflow of the Sanxia HPP reservoir.
My job is to help computers communicate about the world around them.
There are many ways to do this, but I love helping computers talk about what they see and understand.
For example, in this picture, a modern computer vision algorithm can recognize that this is a woman, and this is a dog.
He can say the woman is smiling.
He can even say that the dog is unusually cute.
I'm working on it, thinking about how people understand and process data about the world.
What thoughts, memories and stories can such a picture awaken in people.
Everything related to such situations.
You may have seen a similar dog before or spent time running around the beach as well, and this in turn evokes thoughts and memories of a past vacation, a time spent on the beach, or a time when you ran somewhere with other dogs.
One of my main principles is to help computers understand what it means to have this kind of experience, to understand what we share, what we believe in and what we feel, because then we will be ready to start involving computer technologies in processes that complement our own experience.
If you dig deeper, a few years ago I started helping computers write stories based on a series of images.
And one day in the course of work, I asked the computer what he thought about going to Australia.
He looked at the pictures and saw a koala.
He didn't know what a koala was, but said he found it curious.
Then I shared with him a series of images of burning houses.
He looked at the pictures and said, "Awesome look! Awesome!"
Goosebumps ran down my back.
He looked at a horrible, life-destroying event and thought it was something positive.
I realised he recognised the contrasts, the shades of red and yellow and thought it deserved a positive assessment.
In part, he did it because most of the images I gave him were positive.
Because people tend to share positive images when they talk about their experiences.
When was the last time you saw a selfie at a funeral?
I realised that by improving artificial intelligence, task by task, data by array, I had created huge gaps, holes and gaps in what he could understand.
And in doing so, I encoded all kinds of prejudices.
Prejudices that reflect a limited vision, limited to a single set of data. Gaps that reflect human prejudices encoded in the data, such as bias and stereotypes.
I thought about the evolution of technology that led me to where I was then - how the first colour photographs were calibrated to the skin of white women, meaning colour photographs were not adapted to dark faces.
And this is the same prejudice, the same gap was observed in the 90s.
And the same information gap we have today is how well we can recognise diverse human faces with facial recognition technology.
I was thinking about the latest research, where we tend to limit our thinking to one set of data and one problem.
And by doing so, we created more gaps and prejudices that AI could develop even more.
I realised that we need to think more about how the technologies we are working with today will look in 5 and 10 years.
Mankind evolves slowly, correcting problems in the interaction between people and the environment over time.
Artificial intelligence, by contrast, is evolving at an incredible rate.
And that means it's really important to think carefully about it right now - reflect on our own gaps, our own prejudices and how it affects the technologies we create, and discuss what modern technologies will mean in the future.
Top managers and scientists around the world are talking about what they think artificial intelligence will be like in the future.
Stephen Hawking warns: "AI can end humanity."
Elon Musk warns that this is one of the greatest existential risks our civilization has ever faced.
Bill Gates is perplexed: "I don't understand why people aren't concerned."
But these opinions are only part of the story.
Mathematics, models, the fundamental building blocks of artificial intelligence are what we call access and what we work with.
We have open source tools for machine learning and intelligence that we are willing to share.
And beyond that, we can share our experience.
Share your knowledge of technology, and how it concerns us, and how it concerns us.
We can discuss what we love.
We can anticipate which aspects of technology may become the most useful over time and which are the most problematic.
If we all focus on an open dialogue about AI in the future, it will help create an atmosphere of shared awareness of what AI is now, what it can become, and what we must do to get the best result for us.
We already see and know all this about the technologies used today.
We use smartphones, digital assistants and robot vacuum cleaners.
Are they evil?
Maybe sometimes.
Are they useful?
Certainly.
And they are all different.
And in them you already see a ray of light illuminating our future.
The future starts with what we are creating and building right now.
We are launching the domino effect that will determine the path of AI development.
Right now, we are shaping the AI of the future.
Technologies that immerse us in augmented reality bring past worlds back to life.
Technologies that help people share experiences when they have difficulty communicating.
Technologies based on an understanding of the streaming visual worlds are used for unmanned vehicles.
Technologies based on image understanding and language generation are turning into technologies that help visually impaired people better access the visual world.
But we also see how technology can lead to problems.
Today, we have technologies that analyze our innate physical characteristics - such as skin color or facial features - to determine whether we can be criminals or terrorists.
We have technologies analyzing data about us, even data such as gender or race, to determine if we can get credit.
All we see now is just one shot from the evolution of artificial intelligence.
Because where we are now is just a moment of this evolution.
This means that everything we do today will have an impact on our future.
If we want AI to evolve to help people, we must define the goals and strategies that will set this path now.
I would like to see something that suits people well, blends in with our culture and environment.
Technologies that help those of us who suffer from neurological or other diseases to make life equally difficult for everyone.
Technologies that work regardless of your skin color or demographic characteristics.
Today I am focused on the technologies that will be with us tomorrow and in 10 years.
AI can become anything.
But in this case, it is not a self-driving car without a final destination.
This machine is controlled by us.
We choose when to speed up and when to slow down.
We choose when we need to turn.
We choose what the AI of the future will be.
There are countless things that artificial intelligence can become.
And it will become a lot of things.
And our task today is to find out what exactly we should invest in AI so that the results obtained become the best for all of us.
Thank you

Almost 9.5 thousand cases of CoViD-19 infection were recorded in the Arctic
In Murmansk region, 158 new cases of coronavirus infection have been identified.
The city of Murmansk recorded 135 new cases of CoViD-19 infection.
In total, the total number of confirmed cases of the new coronavirus infection in the region is 9,469.
The head of Dagestan discussed with Khabib Nurmagomedov the construction of several sports facilities.
The head of Dagestan Vladimir Vasilyev held a meeting with the current champion of UFC in lightweight Habib Nurmagomedov, reports the website of the head of the republic.
The reason was sports facilities, in the construction of which the late father of the champion, Honored Coach of Russia Abdulmanap Nurmagomedov, showed great interest.
We are talking about a sports complex in the village of Dubki, Kazbekovsky district, and the Centre for Martial Arts Training in the village of Sildi, Tsumadinsky district.
First of all, Vladimir Vasilyev noted that now the construction of these sports facilities is also a tribute to the memory of the great coach.
Father of baby kidnapped in Salsk reveals details of incident
The father of a newborn kidnapped from a maternity hospital in Salsk, Rostov region, has revealed details of the incident.
Aleksandr Rusikov told TV channel 360 that the kidnapper entered his wife's ward when she was about to go to the toilet.
The mother of the kidnapped baby could not even think that a person with malicious intent could be in the maternity hospital.
The woman walked away from the ward literally a couple of meters when she heard a neighbor scream.
The baby was no longer in the ward.
According to Rusikov, everything happened between three and four o'clock in the morning.
He also said that the wife's ward is located between two medical posts, but at the time of the incident there were no nurses on the spot.
Also, the father of the kidnapped baby said there were no comments or apologies from hospital staff.
Recall that a newborn boy kidnapped on Saturday from a maternity hospital in Salsk was found on the same day in the Republic of Kalmykia.
Police detained a 40-year-old kidnapping suspect.
The child has already been returned to his mother.
Doctors took tests from the baby to make sure he was healthy and unhurt.
Four killed in plane crash in Swiss Alps
Four tourists were killed in the crash of a small plane in the Swiss canton of Valais, ANSA reported on Saturday, July 25.
The accident occurred at 12: 25 local time (13: 25 Moscow time) near the mountain peak of Glecherspitz in the municipality of Blatten.
According to law enforcement, the victims of the crash were two Swiss aged 66 and 50, as well as two Austrians aged 50 and 46.
Their names and details are not disclosed.
Earlier in the day, a small plane crashed into a residential building in the German city of Wezel.
Three people died.
The expert assessed the role of vitamins in the formation of immunity
Andrei Tyazhelnikov, chief freelance specialist in primary health care for adults at the Moscow Department of Health, assessed the role of vitamins in the formation of immunity.
"It is impossible to create stable immunity in a very short period of time by extradosing some drugs, vitamins or food," he said in an interview with the radio station Says Moscow.
According to him, there are certain rules.
For example, in summer it is better to spend more time outdoors, including under the sun.
Tyazhelnikov also noted that in summer, if possible, it is necessary to consume a large number of seasonal fresh vegetables and fruits.
"This generally strengthens immunity, gives a certain supply of vitamins and a certain supply of health," he added.
Earlier, Tyazhelnikov named several differences between influenza and coronavirus.
5,765 COVID-19 patients registered in Russia per day
In Russia, 5,765 new cases of coronavirus infection were detected per day by July 26, according to the website stopcoronavirus.rf, according to the federal operational headquarters.
During the entire period of observation, 812,485 cases of COVID-19 were recorded in Russia.
During the day, 77 people with confirmed coronavirus died, and the total number of COVID-19 related deaths in Russia reached 13,269.
The number of COVID-19 cases in the world has exceeded 16 million, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
More than 4.1 million of them fall on the United States, more than 2.3 million - on Brazil.
Russia ranks fourth in the world in terms of the total number of cases, third behind India (1.3 million cases).
Globally, more than 644,000 people have died from coronavirus, and more than 9.2 million have been cured.
Head of the region Igor Kobzev met with mayors of the Ust-Orda Buryat district
During the workshop, which took place today, July 24, the government of Irkutsk region discussed the main directions for the development of remote agricultural areas.
During working trips to the districts of the Ust-Orda Buryat district, the head of the region gave a number of instructions.
Today, mayors reported on their performance.
First of all, the construction of the Sports House in Ust-Orda has been resumed.
The order for this facility was given by the President of the Russian Federation fourteen years ago.
But only now has the situation been brought to a standstill.
866 million roubles will be spent on construction.
The deadline for delivery of the structure is 2022.
And already this year, a school in the village of Bayandai should be put into operation.
At the moment, the finishing of the premises has been completed.
Of the remaining works - landscaping.
In general, the programme for the construction of preschool and secondary education facilities is of particular importance for the region.
For your district in particular.
The demographic situation here is the best in the region.
And we must create all conditions for the education and leisure of children of all ages, noted Igor Kobzev, Acting Governor of Irkutsk Region.
At the meeting, the head of the region instructed all mayors to actively engage in the development of master plans for human settlements.
This is one of the main conditions for the comprehensive development of the district.
All settlements must have established boundaries and a master plan.
This is necessary for the development of the territory, for the construction of socially significant facilities, as well as infrastructure and cultural heritage, the head of the region stressed.
Also, during the conversation, a problematic issue was raised with a 30% reduction in milk intake from cooperatives.
This was due to the redistribution by the processing enterprise of the purchase of milk in favor of peasant farms.
Because of this, the share of receiving products from cooperatives has decreased.
The head of the region instructed the acting minister of agriculture to go to the site, study the structure of milk sales, analyze the experience of other territories and determine options for solving the problem.
Kuzminov won two races of the second stage of the SMP RSKG at Igor Drive.
The second race of the second stage of the SMP RSKG championship took place at Igor Drive.
Pavel Kuzminov won the second consecutive victory.
He started fifth, but already in the first round he took the lead.
Alexander Dudarev, who became the second, rose from sixth position.
Sergei Tikhomirov lost his position, repulsed the attacks of Alexander Chernyak and first gained a foothold in third place, but received a drive through penalty and after passing through the pitlane dropped out of the fight for the podium.
The third was Ivan Pugachev, who played five positions.
Moscow Region Authorities Tell About Fate of Closed Landfills
Solid municipal waste landfills continue to be closed in the Moscow region.
This year, the authorities promise to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 existing landfills in the region are being modernized into modern waste processing complexes.
But this option is not possible for every landfill - many of them have grown into dense residential development.
After the landfill is closed, it rises for recultivation - the body of the landfill is poured with soil, gas-freeing and infiltration systems are installed.
This makes it possible to stop chemical processes inside the landfill, so that it does not ignite, does not emit stench, does not poison the soil and groundwater.
And then the former landfill remains elevated by a useless pile among the residential buildings that surrounded it.
Why not make something useful out of it?
For example, in Ruz, where the recultivation of the Annino test site was completed just the other day, the authorities are considering the option of making a ski slope out of a pile.
The landfill, which operated from 1976 to 2016, has grown beyond the boundaries of the land allocated for it.
Therefore, during the recultivation, it was necessary to buy out neighboring plots, de facto already clogged with garbage for a long time.
"Some time will pass, the test site will" sit down, "fortresses will be built, and we will think what can be done to make it begin to benefit.
A ski resort catches the eye, "Nikolai Parfyonov, head of the Ruz district, told reporters.
Two landfills will become sites for the production of renewable energy sources
Torbeevo landfills in Lyubertsy and Timokhovo in Bogorodsky District will become sites for the production of renewable energy sources from landfill and biological gases.
By the end of the year, a gas-piston power plant will be launched on the territory of Torbeyev, capable of generating up to 8 million kilowatt-hours of electricity and about 0.95 gigacalories of thermal energy per year, which will provide for the landfill's own needs - heat supply to administrative and industrial premises.
Timokhovo will produce 72.5 million kilowatt-hours and will continue to operate as a garbage processing complex.
A museum could be created at Balashikha's Kuchino test site, which was closed after residents complained about the Straight Line with the country's president.
"There was such an idea - to create a museum for the recultivation of landfills near Moscow," said Deputy Prime Minister - Minister of Ecology and Natural Resources of the region Dmitry Kurakin.
Israel reports drone crash in southern Lebanon
An Israeli army drone has crashed in southern Lebanon.
The military said it collapsed "during operational activities."
The reasons for the fall of the device are not reported.
"Some time ago, during operational activities near the border with Lebanon, an Israeli army unmanned aerial vehicle crashed into Lebanese territory.
There is no risk of information leakage, "the Israeli army said on Twitter.
Recall that this week, the Israeli army decided to strengthen its military units on the border with Lebanon, fearing revenge from the Lebanese Hezbollah movement for the killing of its fighters in Syria.
The leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, promised not to leave unanswered the death of any of his "brothers."
More about the situation - in Kommersant's article, "Israel is waiting for Hezbollah's revenge."
Furgal's replacement walked out to protesters for the first time
The acting governor of the Khabarovsk Territory, Mikhail Degtyarev, for the first time since his appointment, came out to the protesters in support of the arrested former head of the region, Sergei Furgal.
The meeting was broadcast on his Instagram page.
"Moscow hears everyone, so it sent you vrio so that the region does not slide without power... I repeat once again about Furgal: he is" a "- my comrade," b "- a party member," c "- I am very worried about his fate, the party is helping him, handing him food, Zhirinovsky knocks on all offices," the acting governor said
According to Degtyarev, now the Khabarovsk Territory cannot remain without a leader, so he was appointed to the post of head of the region by decree of President Vladimir Putin, so that "a wonderful building (the regional government) functions, everything works, the budget is spent on social needs."
The acting governor explained that he had not come out to the protesters before because he could not communicate with thousands of demonstrators.
Therefore, he broadcasts on social networks and reads all comments to them.
On July 25, two consecutive protests took place in Khabarovsk.
Rallies in support of the former governor have been held in the region since July 11.
On the eve of the next rally, Mikhail Degtyarev announced that he would leave the city on the day of the rally.
His motorcade was stopped by protesters and called to speak about the fate of the arrested ex-governor of Furgal.
Degtyarev previously refused to go out to the protesters.
"There is really something for the head to do, than to go out and communicate with those who shout under the windows," the acting governor said.
Today I would like to show you how we will do different things in the future.
I believe that soon our buildings and cars will be self-assembling, reproducing and repairing themselves.
So, I'm going to show you what I consider to be the current stage of industrial development, and then compare it with some natural systems.
So, at the current stage of industrial development, we have skyscrapers - 2.5 years, from 500,000 to a million parts, quite complex, new amazing technologies in steel, concrete and glass.
We have amazing machines that can take us into space - 5 years, 2.5 million parts.
But on the other hand, if we look at natural systems, we see proteins of two million species that can gather in 10,000 nanoseconds, or a chain of DNA with three billion basic pairs that we can copy in about an hour.
So, natural systems, for all their complexity, are extremely efficient, far more effective than anything we can build, far more complex than anything we can build.
They are much more energy efficient.
They are almost never wrong.
And they can rebuild themselves over a long life.
So, there is something very interesting about natural systems.
And if we can bring that into our man-made environment, our way of creating things will have tremendous potential.
And I think the key is self-assembly.
So, if we want to use self-assembly in our physical environment, I think four key factors need to be considered.
First, we need to decipher the complexity of what we want to build - our buildings and cars.
And it is necessary to decompose them into a simple sequence - the basic DNA of construction processes.
Then we will need programmable parts that can understand this sequence and use it to curl up or reassemble.
We will need a certain amount of energy that will make it possible to activate all this, make the parts capable of gathering according to the program.
And we need some kind of backup bug fixing system to ensure the successful construction of what we want.
I'm going to show you some of the projects that EmIT and I are working on to achieve this self-fulfilling future.
The first two are MacroBot and DeciBot.
These are projects - large-scale reconfigurable robots - 2.5 and 3.5 meter squirrels.
Mechanical electrical devices and sensors are built into them.
You paint what you need to curl into, into a sequence of angles - minus 120, minus 120, 0, 0, 120, minus 120 - something like that; a sequence of angles or turns, and you send that sequence along the cord.
Each block receives its own message - minus 120. It turns this corner, checks if everything is correct and transmits information to a neighbor.
And these are brilliant scientists, engineers, designers who worked on this project.
And I think it really raises the question: are other scales possible here?
I mean, thousands of dollars, lots of man-hours to make this 2.5 meter robot.
Can we really scale up? Can we really embed robotics in every part?
The next project solves this issue, considers the passive character, or tries to get modified programmability passively.
But he goes one step further and tries to get a real calculation.
Basically, it has the most fundamental building block of calculations, the logical element of the digital integrated circuit directly in each part.
This is the "I-NOT" element.
You have one tetrahedron - an element that will do all the calculations, and two tetrahedrons to enter.
One for user input, it's the way you put the bricks.
Another for information from the previous brick laid.
And then it displays information in three-dimensional space.
So, this means that the user can start moving the bricks in the right direction.
His calculations are based on what was done before and what you told him to do.
And now it starts to move in three-dimensional space - up or down.
On the left side, [1.1] the input equals 0 at the output, moving down.
On the right side, [0.0] the input is 1 at the output, which means moving upwards.
And what really matters is that our structures now contain blueprints of what we want to build.
They contain all the information about what was built.
So, it means that we have some form of self-reproduction.
In this case, I call it self-directed reproduction because the structures contain clear drawings.
If there are errors, you can replace the part.
All local information is stored so you know how to fix it.
So you may have something that moves and reads information and can transfer it from one part to another.
It is built directly inside, without external control.
The last project I will show you is called Displaced Chains, and this is perhaps the most exciting example of what we now have of passive self-assembling systems.
It combines the ability to reconfigure and program and creates a completely passive system.
At the core, we have a chain of elements.
All elements are completely identical, and displaced.
So every chain or every element wants to turn right or left.
And when you assemble a chain, you essentially program it.
You tell each block where it should turn: right or left.
So when you shake the chain, it rolls into the configuration you have programmed - in this case a spiral, or in this case two cubes next to each other.
So in general, you can program any three-dimensional form - or one-dimensional, two-dimensional - of these completely passive circuits.
So, what does this tell us about the future?
I think this tells us that there are new opportunities for self-assembly, replication, and repair in our physical structures, buildings, and machines.
New software is possible in these parts.
And from here, you have new opportunities in computing.
We will have space computers.
Imagine our buildings, bridges, cars, all our bricks could do the calculations.
This is an amazing parallel and distributed cleaning force, new design possibilities.
This is an incredible potential.
I think the projects I have shown you are only a small step towards the future, if we introduce these new technologies, towards a new self-assembled future.
Thank you.
(Applause)

The number of deaths from coronavirus in the world exceeded 640,000
More than 15.7 million people are infected
The number of coronavirus victims in the world has exceeded 640,000, and almost 15.7 million cases of infection have been confirmed.
The World Health Organization (WHO) cites such data on Sunday, July 26.
According to the information provided, over the past day, 200,625 new cases of coronavirus infection and 4,823 deaths have been detected in the world.
During the entire period of the pandemic, 15,785,641 coronavirus cases have already been recorded in the world, and the number of deaths has increased to 640,016.
The leader in the number of infected and dead remains the United States, where more than 4.3 million infected and more than 149,000 deaths have already been registered.
In second place in the anti-rating is Brazil, where the number of cases has now exceeded 2.4 million, and 86.5 thousand patients with coronavirus have already died.
This is followed by India with 1.4 million infected and almost 33 thousand dead.
Recall, the day before, the number of people infected with coronavirus in the world within a day broke a new record.
In 24 hours, doctors identified 284,196 new cases.
The previous record was 247,225 infected.
what connected the Vatican and Nazi Germany
This week, the next date is 87 years since the conclusion of the treaty between the Vatican and Nazi Germany.
The document, signed a few months after Hitler came to power, became the basis on which the Holy See's relations with the fascists were built.
One of those who prepared the treaty was Cardinal Pacelli, who, six years before the outbreak of World War II, became Pontiff Pius XII.
In Sochi, a dump truck body crashed into the cab of a truck, killing the driver.
Footage has surfaced online showing an accident that occurred last Saturday, July 25, at a construction site in Sochi.
The recording shows how, during unloading operations, the raised body of the dump truck collapsed downstairs, hitting directly into the cab of the truck.
According to the Ministry of Emergency Situations, a 59-year-old man who was driving died on the spot from his injuries.
Rescue assistance was needed to retrieve the body of the deceased.
Beautiful tall minarets only adorned Ayia Sofia
Once again about Ayia Sofia - the text of Fr. Vladimir Zelinsky came across that supposedly it is necessary to protest.
First, there was free entry - cheers!
I haven't been to Istanbul, but it's better to have a free entrance to the House of God than a paid one.
Second, the Muslims conquered this land just as honestly as the Orthodox conquered the Volga-Okskoye inter-river, the Muslim Caucasus (and set up a church in Grozny) and planted apple trees on Mars.
God help us!
The Jews conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans conquered America.
Will we return everything to everyone?
Do you think that there will be no Gentiles who will demand the return of their capital, in the place of which is the Tithe Church?
Third, Muslims have improved the building and invested in it.
That is, it is theirs, just as the factories and estates that Leninists took from the bourgeoisie into their property belong to Leninists - Putin and other nomenklatura.
They've improved everything from the Kremlin to Angara, so it's all their rightful progressives.
Beautiful tall minarets very decorated Ayia Sofia, very much.
There was a stupid ink box, there was a stupid ink box with beautiful minarets.
Fourthly, there are no "Islamic" or "Orthodox" civilizations.
There are believers, there are hypocrites, there are khanges that unite faith and hypocrisy.
A believer in the categories of civilization does not think.
This is the thinking of British Foreign Office official Toynbee, who believes it is a shame to think so.
And to the believer there is a place of prayer everywhere.
And always.
A believer does not only pray where he is asked to leave - he leaves for another place and prays there.
He is a believer, not a defender.
We are koloboks, not sullen stones.
The working week in St. Petersburg will begin with warm and dry weather
On Monday, July 27, there will be low clouds in St. Petersburg, no precipitation is expected.
This was reported in the press service of the Ministry of Emergency Situations of the city with reference to the forecast of the North-West Department of Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring.
At night, a variable wind is expected at a speed of 1-4 meters per second.
During the day, southeast wind at a speed of 2-7 meters per second.
The air temperature at night will be + 13... + 15 degrees.
During the day it will warm up to + 24... + 26 degrees.
Atmospheric pressure will rise during the day.
During the broadcast of the parade on Navy Day, the camera "passed under the ship"
Also on Victory Day, the camera flew through the barrel of a tank
Today, July 26, a parade is being held in St. Petersburg in honor of Navy Day.
During the shooting, one of the cameras filming the equipment "passed under the ship."
The use of new shooting technology allowed viewers to see the underwater part of the parade.
In the same perspective, the course of the newest serial small rocket ship, Sovetsk, was shown.
It passed along the Admiralty Embankment.
Recall that at the parade on June 24, dedicated to the 75th anniversary of the Victory, the camera passed through the barrel into the tower of one of the tanks and showed what equipment is inside the grand military vehicle.
At that time, a record number of military equipment - 234 combat vehicles - took part in the anniversary Victory Parade.
They showed a lot of novelties that went to the main square of the country for the first time, for example, modernized main battle tanks T-90M and T-80BVM.
On June 24, updated infantry fighting vehicles BMP-2M with the Berezhok combat module also passed through Red Square for the first time.
Nearly half of Britons believe in Kremlin interference in Brexit referendum
Almost half of Britons - 49% - believe that Russia tried to influence the course of the 2016 referendum on Britain's exit from the European Union.
The Guardian newspaper writes about this with reference to the results of a survey conducted by Opinium.
It is reported that 23% of respondents hold the opposite opinion on this issue.
47% of respondents also believe that the Kremlin interfered in the last general election in the UK in 2019.
July will go away with heat, August will start with coolness
Over the weekend, Moscow and the region experienced the coldest night of July.
Of course, no frost chilling apocalypse occurred.
But for the top of the summer, it's a shame.
Before talking about the weather in Moscow on July 27 - August 2, 2020, it is worth noting that on the night of Saturday, July 25, the air cooled to + 8.8 degrees in the capital.
Kolomna even set a new temperature record: + 7 degrees (the previous minimum for July 25 has been held since 1964, more than half a century).
Cherusti became the cold pole near Moscow, where thermometers showed + 3.9 degrees.
However, in the afternoon, both Saturday and Sunday were quite comfortable.
Although, compared to climate norms, it is still 2 to 3 degrees cooler.
On working days, not just heat, but real heat will return to Moscow.
On Monday, July 27, the Russian Hydrometeorological Center promises + 26 degrees, on Tuesday and Wednesday + 28... + 29, on Thursday, July 30, + 26 degrees.
Short rains - every day in the middle of the week with thunderstorms.
The last day of July and the first days of August (that is, next weekend) will be cool, not higher than + 19... + 24 degrees.
And it will not do without rainfall.
A Rwandan confessed to setting fire to a cathedral in Nantes
A native of Rwanda, who worked at the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul in the French city of Nantes on a voluntary basis, admitted arson a week after the fire.
This was reported on Sunday by the France-3 television channel.
According to him, the man, who had already been detained on July 19, the day after the fire, was detained again the day before.
On Saturday evening, he appeared before an investigating judge.
After being charged with intentional damage to property, the man admitted that he had set fire to three places - under a large organ, under a small organ and at an electric shield.
Now he faces up to 10 years in prison and a fine of 150 thousand euros.
The motives of the 39-year-old from Rwanda have not yet been reported.
It is only known that he voluntarily helped in the cathedral and on the day of the fire had to close its doors.
However, according to CCTV footage, he left the religious institution 15 minutes after receiving calls about a fire in the building.
The fire in the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul occurred on July 18.
More than 200 firefighters fought for several hours for the Gothic architectural monument.
However, they failed to save Louis XII stained glass windows and a unique Baroque organ.
The situation was brought under control only three hours after the start of the fire.
No one was injured in the incident.
The current fire is not the first during the existence of the temple.
In 1972, fire destroyed its roof.
It took 13 years to eliminate the consequences of that fire.
For parishioners, the cathedral was reopened only in 1985.
The legendary traveling goalkeeper Pfannenstil could become an Inter scout.
Former German goalkeeper Lutz Pfannenstil could join Inter's headquarters.
According to Kicker, the 47-year-old specialist was given the post of head of the Scout Department.
Pfannenstil held a similar position at Fortune from Dusseldorf from December 2018 to May 2020, and previously worked at Hoffenheim.
When he was a football player, Pfannenstil became famous for his frequent transitions.
He is the only professional player to have played in all six FIFA confederations, replacing more than 20 clubs, including representatives from the championships of Singapore, South Africa, New Zealand, Canada, Namibia and a number of other countries.
It is believed that only sighted people can drive a car.
Until recently, it was believed that for a blind person, safe and independent driving is an impossible task.
Hello, I am Dennis Hong, and we give the blind freedom and independence by developing a car for the visually impaired.
Before talking about this car for the blind, I will briefly talk about another project I worked on, called the DARPA Urban Challenge.
The project was to create a self-driving robot car.
The driver presses "start," and without his participation the car reaches its destination.
In 2007, our team won half a million dollars, taking third place in this competition.
Around the same time, the National Federation of the Blind, or NFU, tasked the research committee with developing a vehicle that can independently and safely drive a blind person.
We decided to try our hand because we thought, "Hey, what's difficult about that?
We already have an autonomous car.
Put a blind man in it - and it's over, isn't it? "
(Laughter) But we were deeply mistaken.
The NFU wanted not just a car that would transport the blind, but a car that the blind could drive themselves.
So we had to reject everything and start from scratch.
So, to test this crazy idea, we developed a small car buggy prototype to test the feasibility of the project.
And in the summer of 2009, we invited blind youth from all over the country and gave them the opportunity to test this car.
It was an amazing experience.
But the catch is that this car was designed to operate in a strictly controlled environment, namely in a flat, closed parking lot, where even lanes are limited by red signal cones.
Due to this success, we decided to take the next big step and develop a real car that could be driven on real roads.
So, how does it work?
Well, it's a pretty complex system, but let me clarify, perhaps even simplify it.
So, it has three components.
These are tactile perception, computation and non-visual interfaces.
Since the driver sees nothing, the system must perceive the environment and collect information for the driver.
For this purpose, an initial parameter meter is used.
It measures acceleration, angular acceleration, like a person's inner ear.
This information is then transmitted to a GPS device to assess the location of the vehicle.
Two cameras are used to detect lanes on the road
and three laser rangefinders.
Lasers scan the space around the car to detect various objects: an approaching oncoming or overtaking car, any obstacles encountered on the road or around the car.
Then all this huge amount of information is fed into the computer, and the computer performs two stages.
First of all, it is processing this information to get an idea of space: determining lanes on the road, identifying obstacles, and then bringing this information to the driver.
The system is also smart enough to figure out the safest way to drive a car.
So, we can also give advice on how to operate the machine.
But the problem is how to convey this information and instructions to a blind person who does not have the fast and accurate reaction necessary to drive?
For this purpose, we have developed a number of interface technologies for the blind:
A three-dimensional ping sound system, a vibrating vest, a rudder with sound signals, a special prosthetic leg, and even shoes that put pressure on the leg.
But today we will only talk about three types of these special interfaces.
The first interface is called DriveGrip.
This is a pair of gloves with motors on the joints of the fingers, instructing the driver how to steer: direction and angle of turn.
Another device is the SpeedStrip.
It was originally a massage chair.
The vibration is used to transmit speed information to the driver, as well as to guide the use of gas and brake pedals.
So, here you can see how the computer perceives the space around the car. And since the vibration cannot be seen, red LEDs are installed on the driver to demonstrate the process.
This is sensory data, it is transmitted to devices via a computer.
The DriveGrip and SpeedStrip devices are very effective.
But the problem is that these are teaching aids.
They don't actually give freedom to govern, do they?
The on-board computer gives the driver commands: "left," "right," "speed up," "stop."
We call him an "annoying passenger from the back seat."
Therefore, we are moving away from educational prompting devices and focusing on informative devices.
An excellent example of such an interface is AirPix.
This is a kind of monitor for the blind.
A small panel with many holes through which compressed air exits, thereby creating images.
A blind person can bring his palm to this panel and "see" lanes on the roadway and obstacles.
The driver can also change the frequency at which the air is released and possibly the temperature of the air.
That is, it is an interface for displaying multidimensional data.
So, here you see the left and right camera of the car, and how the computer processes and sends this information to the AirPix panel.
Here we demonstrate a simulator, a blind person drives a car using AirPix.
This simulator proved to be very useful for training blind drivers, as well as for quickly testing ideas for using different types of special interfaces.
That's how this system works in a nutshell.
After all, this is a prototype car for the blind. And it will not be released on the roadway until they are convinced of its absolute safety.
And I sincerely believe that this is quite likely.
Still, will society accept such a radical idea?
How much will the rules of auto insurance change?
On what conditions will a driver's license be issued?
Beyond the technological challenges, there are so many pitfalls that need to be overcome before this becomes a reality.
Of course, the main goal of this project is to develop a car for the blind.
However, it is possible that the spin-off technologies developed during this project will prove to be an invaluable contribution to our lives.
Our sensors work regardless of the time of day, fog and rain.
We can use these technologies together with new special interfaces to improve the safety of visually impaired vehicles.
Or for the blind. Find their use in everyday household appliances, in educational institutions, in offices.
Just imagine: a teacher in the classroom writes on a blackboard, and a blind student can see and read what is written using these special interfaces.
It's priceless.
So what I showed you today is just the beginning.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Bill & Ted's second trailer with Keanu Reeves released
The second trailer for the third part of the Bill & Ted franchise appeared on Orion Pictures' YouTube channel.
The trailer reveals some of the details of the current life of crony friends: they settled in a suburban area, are married to their girlfriends Joanne (Jaime Mace) and Elizabeth (Erinn Hayes) from "The Incredible Adventures of Bill and Ted" (1989), moreover, restless adventurers have long been raising daughters.
Brigitte Landy-Payne ("Glass Castle," "Untypical") plays Billy, Ted's daughter, and Samara Weaving ("I'm going to search") plays Thea, Bill's daughter (yes, Bill and Ted named their daughters Billy and Thea, that's the pun).
On top of everything, another great adventure awaits them: they must get into the future to steal their own song - the only way they can save the whole world.
The trailer also features American rapper Kid Cudi and William Sadler (August Rush, Death Contrary, Green Mile) replaying the role of Death.
It was originally planned that the film would be released on August 21, but the date was postponed to September 1.
It is reported that the creators do not plan to reschedule the release date of the film.
The picture will also be immediately available online.
Earlier, we wrote that Keanu Reeves would become a screenwriter for comics about the demigod Berserk.
I want you to think for a moment that almost all of our knowledge of the universe comes from light.
We stand on Earth and see stars in the night sky with the naked eye.
A bright sun can burn the retina of the eye -
but we see the same light in the reflection of the Moon.
Since Galileo observed celestial bodies in his primitive telescope, we have been contemplating the universe thanks to light passing through the vast ages of cosmic history.
With the help of modern telescopes, we were able to collect a stunning silent film about the universe, covering our entire history up to the Big Bang.
However, cinema is not without sound, because the universe is not silent.
I want to prove to you that the Universe has its own sound track, and it is "played" by space itself, because outer space vibrates like a drum.
It contains unique sounds that accompany the most striking events as they occur.
Today, we would like to add a soundtrack to the luxurious visual image of the universe we have.
So far, we have never heard sounds from space, but in the near future we should listen carefully to what is happening there.
So, in order to record the "song" of the universe, we focused on black holes as the most promising objects, because they "beat" in space-time like a bell, and give a characteristic sound. Now you will hear how, in our opinion, this song will sound.
Maybe one day we will see a shadow cast by a black hole against a bright background, but so far we have not seen such a thing.
However, a black hole, albeit invisible, can be heard as it "beats" in space-time like a drum.
The assumption that space is like a drum membrane belongs to Albert Einstein, to whom we owe so much.
Einstein concluded that if space were empty, if the universe were empty, it would look like this picture, except, of course, for such a visual grid.
If we were to fall freely through space, even without a convenient coordinate grid, mentally we could portray it ourselves, since we would notice that we are moving in a straight line, strictly in a straight line through the universe.
Einstein also understood - and this is the crux of it - that if you put energy or mass into the universe, it will lead to the curvature of space, and a freely falling object will bend, for example, the Sun, deviating along natural curves in space.
It was Einstein's great general theory of relativity.
Even light curves along such a trajectory.
The deviation could be so strong that the object would simply get into orbit, and revolve around the Sun like the Earth, or like the Moon around the Earth.
These are natural curves in space.
But Einstein did not understand this - if you take our Sun and compress it to 6 kilometers in diameter, that is, a mass 1 million times heavier than the Earth to fit in an object with a diameter of 6 km, then you get a black hole so dense that the light that passed too close to it will never escape.
However, he always considered black holes to be just a mathematical curiosity.
Einstein did not believe they existed in reality.
He believed that nature itself should protect us from their appearance.
Decades passed before the term "black hole" was invented, and people realised that they were real astrophysical objects - in fact, very massive stars in a posthumous state, catastrophically destroyed at the end of their life cycle.
Our Sun will not turn into a black hole.
Its mass is not enough for this.
But we will do a little mental experiment - Einstein loved them very much - and imagine the Sun shrinking to 6 kilometres in diameter and a tiny Earth revolving around it, about 30 kilometres from the sun's black hole.
This Earth is shining, the Sun is no longer there, as is another light source, so let's make our little Earth self-luminous.
It turns out that we can place the Earth in a very close orbit, just 30 km from this black hole.
It is not much larger than Manhattan.
Perhaps she would have hooked up a bit with the Hudson before destroying the Earth.
But the scale is about that.
We are talking about an object that would occupy approximately 1/2 of Manhattan's area.
So, by placing this Earth very close - just 30 km away - we will notice that it revolves perfectly around a black hole.
It's a kind of myth that black holes absorb everything indiscriminately - to get into it, you have to come very close.
But what is striking is that from our point of view, we will see the Earth all the time.
It cannot hide behind a black hole.
Part of the light that the Earth emits is absorbed by the hole, but part of it seems to encircle it and return back to us.
So, nothing can be hidden behind the black hole.
If you suddenly get into the series "Star Cruiser" Galaxy, "and fight with Silons - do not hide behind a black hole.
They will see you!
Our Sun won't turn into a black hole - it's not massive enough for that. But there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
And if one of them obscured the Milky Way, that's what it would look like.
We would see the shadow of a black hole amid hundreds of billions of stars and glowing dust.
If we were on the verge of falling into this black hole, we would see all this light enveloping it, and even already entering this shadow, we would not notice a near catastrophe.
It would be useless to start the engines and try to get out, because nothing, including light, can escape from it.
Although the black hole looks like it from the outside, it is not dark inside, as all the light falls into it with us.
According to a relativistic effect known as time stretching, our clocks would seem to slow down relative to galactic time, but we would instead see the galaxy evolve at an accelerated rate a moment before dying inside a black hole.
It would be like a near-death experience, where you see light at the end of a tunnel, but not "near," but absolutely mortal.
(Laughter) And you won't tell anyone about the light at the end of the tunnel.
Scientists have not yet been able to see the shadow of the black hole, but we can hear it, albeit invisible.
Let's imagine a real astrophysical situation - two black holes that lived a long life together.
They may have been stars at first and then turned into black holes. Each is 10 times heavier than the sun.
We will squeeze them up to 60 km in diameter.
They can rotate quickly: hundreds of revolutions per second.
At the end of their life cycle, they revolve around each other almost at the speed of light.
They cover thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second, and not only curve space in this way, but also leave a trail behind them: they cause oscillations, a wave trail in space-time.
Space shrinks and stretches, freeing itself from these black holes oscillating in the universe.
And they travel through space at the speed of light.
This computer simulation was done by NASA's Goddard team studying relativity theory.
For almost 30 years, scientists around the world have struggled with this problem.
It was one of the groups.
You see two black holes spinning around each other - and again here the curves are clearly depicted.
If you see - a little pale turned out - they emit red waves, gravitational waves.
These are the sounds of vibrating space, and they will come from these black holes at the speed of light as they subside and merge into one rotating, quiet black hole - that is the outcome.
If you stood close enough, your ear would resonate as space shrinks and stretches.
You would actually hear the sound.
Of course, your head would also shrink and stretch, so it would be difficult for you to understand what was going on.
But I would like to lose you this sound, as we predict it.
This is the work of my group, so the schedule here is more modest.
Imagine a light black hole falling into a very heavy one.
The sound you hear emits a light hole, flexing space as you approach the end step by step.
If it is removed, the sound becomes quieter.
But it is like a hammer "hitting" a space that vibrates like a membrane.
And we can predict what that sound will be like.
We know that as the hole is absorbed, it gets faster and louder.
At the end, we will hear how a small hole just falls into a large one.
I haven't heard the recording so loud yet - it's really quite impressive.
At home it turns out to be much more modest.
Just quiet clicks.
It's a different sound created by my band.
Here I do not show you a picture, since black holes leave no visible traces, there are no visible curves in space.
If you went on a space cruise and heard such a sound, I would recommend flying away as soon as possible.
(Laughter) Away from that sound.
Both black holes are moving.
They approach each other.
In this case, they both fluctuate a lot.
And now there will be a merger.
This "dragging" is very characteristic of merging black holes, this is the acceleration at the end.
We assume that this would be the case.
Fortunately, we are now at a safe distance, in Long Beach, California.
There is no doubt that two black holes merge somewhere in the universe.
And without a doubt, the space around us is vibrating, and these oscillations may have passed millions of light years, that is, a million years have moved towards us at the speed of light.
But the sound is too quiet, we can't hear it.
Today there is a very complex project: LIGO (Laser-Interferometric Gravitational-Wave Observatory) - it tracks deviations in space fluctuations, the smallest - by the size of the nucleus of the atom by 4 kilometers.
This is an extremely ambitious experiment, and in the next few years it will be dedicated to capturing such waves.
One space programme is also planned, which I hope will be launched in the next 10 years: LIKA (Laser Interferometric Space Antenna).
It will be able to see super-heavy black holes, millions and billions of times more massive than the Sun.
In this image from the Hubble telescope, we see two galaxies.
They look like they're frozen in a kind of "hug,"
and each of them probably contains a super-heavy black hole in its core.
But they didn't freeze. In fact, they merge.
These two black holes collide, and it will last more than a billion years.
It's beyond our comprehension to hear a song of this length.
But LIKA can see the finale of the merger of two super-heavy black holes, which began a long time ago: the last 15 minutes of this action.
We are talking not only about black holes, but also about any serious disturbances in the universe, and the most important of them is the Big Bang.
When this expression was coined, it was ironic - "they say, who will believe in the Big Bang?"
This animation from my friend from Proton Studios shows the Big Bang from the outside.
Any observer would like to be inside at this moment, because it is impossible to be outside the universe.
Imagine you're inside the Big Bang.
It's everywhere around you and the space vibrates chaotically.
14 billion years have passed, and this song still sounds around us.
Galaxies are born, and there are generations of stellar forms in them. And around one star, at least one, there is an inhabited planet.
And here we stubbornly conduct these experiments, make calculations, write programs.
Imagine two black holes colliding a billion years ago.
All the while, their song sounds in space.
We haven't even been born yet.
The sound is coming closer, closer and closer - 40,000 years ago, we are still making rock carvings.
If we were going to "hear" the Big Bang, it would sound like this.
Noise in its purest form.
It's white noise, just chaotic sounds.
But he probably surrounds us everywhere, unless he has been silenced by some other process in the universe.
And if we catch it, it will be the most pleasant music for us, because it is a quiet echo of the moment of our creation, the birth of the observed universe.
Over the next few years, we will be able to add a bit of volume, and hear the universe in sound.
But if we catch the echo of those early events, it will bring us much closer to understanding the Big Bang, and it will already allow us to ask some of the most difficult, elusive questions.
Scrolling through a film about our universe backwards, we learn that there was a Big Bang in the past, and we may even hear its cacophony, but was it the only explosion?
I mean, hasn't it happened before?
Won't it happen again?
In the spirit of TED urging us to regain faith in miracles, we can now ask questions that have always eluded us.
But we have to ask: is it possible that our universe is just a trace of some more significant history?
Or - are we just one of the branches of the multiverse - each of which has had its Big Bang in the past? Maybe with black holes and their "songs," or without them, maybe with intelligent life, and perhaps without - they are not in our past, not in our future, but somehow connected to us?
We will ask - in such a multiverse, in its other branches, is there life there?
Here are my multiverse brethren.
But are there other creatures out there who think about us and their origins?
And, if they are, I can imagine them doing calculations, like us, building tools, trying to detect that faint sound of the moment of their creation, and thinking - who else is there but us?
Thank you. Thank you.
(Applause)
Minneapolis residents create squads to patrol streets
The Wall Street Journal reports that units are being created in Minneapolis to patrol the streets.
Locals want to help the guards.
Some of the squads have weapons with them.
Armed citizens assure: they will not open fire, this is possible only in case of emergency.
According to journalists, the creation of patrols is associated with a reduction in the police budget.
Law enforcement agencies will receive $10 million less per year (this amount may be reduced).
The previous budget of law enforcement agencies was $193 million.
This decision was made by the Minneapolis City Council in connection with the death of George Floyd and rallies against police brutality over the past two months.

The original drawing of the Olympic rings by the founder of the modern Olympic Games, Pierre de Coubertin, was sold at auction for €185,000.
The drawing was made on a white canvas measuring 21 × 27.5 cm and represents the interweaving of five rings of different colors - blue, yellow, black, green and red.
The first modern Olympic Games were held in 1896 in Athens.
Dynamo won't renew contract with Panchenko
Forward Kirill Panchenko will leave Moscow's Dynamo due to the end of his contract.
According to the source, the club has already notified the footballer of its decision.
The 30-year-old Panchenko spent four seasons at Dynamo, played 103 matches and scored 37 goals.
Earlier, Moscow's Dynamo presented the form for the next season.
City and Real will be able to play the return match of the 1/8 finals of the Champions League in Manchester
The British newspaper The Guardian reports that Manchester City and Real Madrid will still be able to hold the return match of the 1/8 final of the Champions League in Manchester at the Etihad Stadium on August 7.
Yesterday, on July 25, the UK government issued a ruling that all people arriving in the UK from Spain must undergo a 14-day quarantine due to the new outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.
For Real, however, an exception will be made.
The possibility of easing quarantine rules for sports teams and film crews was previously announced by Secretary of the Ministry of Culture of Great Britain Oliver Dowden.
In February, Real lost to Manchester City on their field with a score of 1: 2.
The return match is scheduled for August 7.
Presidents of Russia and Ukraine discuss implementation of truce in Donbass
Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky discussed the implementation of the armistice agreements in the Donbas reached during the Normandy Summit in December 2019, the press services of the Kremlin and the office of the President of Ukraine reported.
The telephone conversation between Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky took place at the initiative of the Ukrainian side, according to the Kremlin press service.
The interlocutors welcomed the agreement reached on July 22 at a meeting of the Minsk Contact Group on a full and comprehensive ceasefire in the Donbas, which begins at 00: 01 on July 27, 2020; the President of Russia supported this agreement.
The leaders agreed on the need for urgent implementation of additional measures to support the ceasefire in the Donbas.
At the same time, Putin criticized the resolution adopted by the Verkhovna Rada on July 15 on the organization of local elections in the fall, which, in the opinion of the Russian side, ignores the Minsk agreement.
The situation in connection with the coronavirus pandemic was also discussed.
The July 22 agreement provides for a complete renunciation of all military actions, including reconnaissance, sending sabotage and reconnaissance groups, and sniper warfare.
Tinkov showed a video of a bone marrow transplant
Oleg Tinkov, a Russian entrepreneur and founder of the Tinkoff group, published a video in which he described how his bone marrow was transplanted.
Let us recall that the businessman is fighting leukemia.
On the record, the businessman lies in the ward, the bone marrow is transplanted using a dropper.
Tinkov noted that the same is happening with the collection of donor material.
"The skull is not cut," he added.
Judging by his posture during the surgery, he feels comfortable and relaxed.
His donor was a girl from Germany.
The businessman expressed regret that in Russia there are only 130,000 bone marrow donors, while in Germany there are about 8 million.
Oleg Tinkou underwent a bone marrow transplant at a London clinic.
It became known about the destruction of Russian Pantsirei in Ethiopia
Two Russian-made Pantsir-C1 anti-aircraft missile and cannon complexes, which were in service with the Ethiopian army, were destroyed.
This became known to the Telegram channel "Military Observer" on Sunday, July 26.
According to the channel, two vehicles that ensured the safety of the Hidase hydroelectric power plant on the Blue Nile River were disabled by lightning.
Other details of the incident are not given.
In May, the Turkish agency Anadolu reported the destruction of nine Russian-made Pantsir-C1 missile defense systems in Libya.
They belonged to the forces of the commander of the Libyan National Army (LNA) Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar and were destroyed with the help of Turkish operational-tactical multipurpose unmanned aerial systems Bayraktar TB2.
Defense Express then called the incident a "real genocide."
Another Pantsir-C1 in Libya was destroyed by a drone strike in early July.
1,500 people evacuated in Warsaw due to bomb
About 1.5 thousand residents of Warsaw are being evacuated because of a bomb found during the construction of the metro, RIA Novosti reports, citing a representative of the capital's mayor's office, Carolina Galetskaya.
She said that an unexploded ordnance weighing 250 kg and about 2 m long was found on the construction of a second metro line near Basilian Street in the Warsaw district of Brody.
In this regard, about 1,500 people are being evacuated from eight adjacent neighborhoods.
Only then will deminers start working.
Lokomotiv is close to signing a contract with a Belarusian football player
The striker of Salihorsk Shakhtar and the Belarusian national football team, Vitaly Lisakovich, is preparing to move to Moscow's Lokomotiv.
According to the source, the 22-year-old football player will soon undergo a medical examination for Lokomotiv, after which he will sign a four-year contract.
Lisakovich scored nine goals in 18 matches in the current season of the championship of Belarus.
He has five games for the Belarusian national team, in which he has never scored.
Earlier, the media named Miranchuk's wishes under a contract with Serie A clubs.
Putin spoke to Shoigu in his cabin:
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke with Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Navy Chief Nikolai Evmenov.
Relevant footage on Sunday, July 26, was published by journalists from the Kremlin pool of RIA Novosti in their Telegram channel.
A short meeting took place in the cabin of the boat, where the head of state, together with Shoigu and Evmenov, was heading to the ceremonial formation of ships in the Gulf of Finland before the parade timed to coincide with the Day of the Russian Navy.
They exchanged a couple of phrases while sitting at the table.
Earlier it was reported that Putin arrived in Kronstadt to participate in the celebrations.
From there, the president headed to St. Petersburg, where he is to host a festive parade.
On July 26, parades are held throughout Russia to celebrate Navy Day.
The main naval parade takes place in Saint Petersburg.
It involves more than 4 thousand military personnel, 46 ships, submarines and boats, as well as naval aviation.
In one of the Tyumen public there was an appeal to take part in the action "Buy from your grandmother."
Organizers are urging to buy vegetables, flowers and berries from grandmothers, which they grew in their gardens, and not to bargain.
The author of the post even gave an example, specifying the specific address at which the grandmother trades cherries.
But Tyumen suddenly erupted in angry comments.
She herself saw how immediately a merchant from neighboring countries approached this grandmother and gave a new portion of goods "from her grandmother's garden" for sale.
Look closely at what you buy!!! - Nadezhda Grigoryeva shared her observations.
I have seen more than once when greens were taken from merchants from neighboring countries and sold.
There is no trust, Larisa Kharlamova agreed.
It's been a long time since, I see, Grandma had a quiz - "glitter," but it didn't degenerate in our garden, I ask: "Is it from your garden?"
"- Yes!"
I bought, the taste of a rag, well, not a fresh vegetable garden, then I look at these "yes" on every corner, my grandmother deceived me, she took it from someone for sale, Tatiana Krasilnikova told about her experience.
At the same time, users emphasize that they are not urged not to shop with grandmothers, but only share their opinion and advise paying attention to the quality of products.
Residents of Tyumen district celebrate the Year of Memory and Glory online
The plane made an emergency landing in Irkutsk
In Irkutsk, a plane travelling on a Moscow-Ulan-Ude flight made an emergency landing because of a smoked passenger.
According to RIA Novosti, the incident occurred on Sunday night.
The plane stayed at Irkutsk airport for 25 minutes while the man who posed a threat to the safety of the flight was handed over to police.
Before takeoff, the plane was thoroughly checked for smoldering ash.
All costs for forced parking will be recovered from the passenger who smoked.
Earlier, at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport, a man who staged a brawl on board an airplane was detained.

the decision to expand the RPL would not be supported by either UEFA or FIFA
The president of the Russian Football Union (RFU), Alexander Dukov, believes that it is currently wrong to expand the Russian Premier League (RPL) to 18 teams.

This violates the integrity of the tournament and the sporting principle.
And, of course, this decision would not have been supported by either UEFA or FIFA, "Dukov said after the Russian Cup final between Zenit and Khimki (1: 0).
Currently, 16 clubs play in the RPL, but the option of increasing the number of teams to 18 was considered.

I knew that Bryant's self-esteem could not be touched by any thrash current, so as not to stimulate his sporting anger.
Kobe had a killer instinct, so I tried to talk him on the court so that he did not perceive the game in an aggressive way.
On the court, I complimented him: "Oh!
Kobe, scored well, great pass!
Listening to my enthusiastic responses, he slightly forgot that it was necessary to once again pick up the ball and score another 3 - 4 points.
We communicated well with Kobi, "Kirilenko quotes Evening Moscow as saying.
He also spoke about his first game against Jordan.
"I took care of him.
For the first three minutes of the match, I ran in complete admiration for the fact that there was a legend next to me, which I only saw on television.

Soon I moved away from delight, covered his throws a couple of times...
In that game, my team won, and Jordan still scored 44 points, "added the head of the RFB.

Actor of Russian TV series responds to accusations of "propaganda of LGBT and feminism"
The actor of the Russian TV series "Chiki," whose creators were accused of "propaganda of LGBT and feminism," responded to the claims against the film.
The authors "understood the severity of the issues raised and did not want to offend anyone," said American Stephen Thomas Oxner in an interview with the publication "Rise."
"It seems to me that this is a story about strength and general aspects of human life.
This has nothing to do with LGBT and feminism, "said the actor, who played the father of a boy who dressed in women's clothing.
He stressed that he is "proud of the work" and does not consider it propaganda.
At the same time, the American added, he is frightened by the reaction of some people to the storyline of the series: for example, there was a case when "a man in deep breath shot the set and said that all this was not true."
"Then there were a couple of cases where we met disgruntled locals who didn't understand what we were doing.
But we were open, so people who first came with claims began to help us, "he concluded.
The shooting incident, the publication explains, occurred in September 2019 in Kabardino-Balkaria: a drunk man attacked a film crew car with a weapon, after which he was detained by police officers.
Earlier it was reported that the public commissioner for the protection of the family, Olga Baranets, sent a complaint to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Roskomnadzor about the service more.tv, which hosted the Russian series "Chiki."
Baranets accused the creators of the series of "propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations and feminism," noting that the main characters of the film work as prostitutes, and the series itself contains "scenes of physical and psychological violence."
The ombudsman was also outraged that "the series pays a lot of attention to the homosexual sexual orientation" of the minor character.
