No need to demonize the people of Khabarovsk
The acting head of Khabarovsk Krai spoke about his trip to the region in an exclusive interview with Komsomolskaya Pravda
The acting governor of Khabarovsk Krai, Mikhail Degtyarev, urged in an interview with Komsomolskaya Pravda columnist Alexander Gamov not to demonize Khabarovsk residents amid rallies in support of the arrested former head of the region, Sergei Furgal.
I want to appeal to all political commentators, political scientists, and participants in all kinds of talk shows.
There is no need to demonize the people of Khabarovsk Krai.
Hardworking and wonderful people live here, "Mikhail Degtyarev shared.
In an interview, Degtyarev recalled that he was a member of the LDPR and a member of Furgal's party, and added that he wished him good luck in court, and that the party and Vladimir Zhirinovsky personally would support him in court.
The full text of the interview was published on the UP.ru website.
Earlier, the UP.ru website reported that Mikhail Degtyarev called for an open trial of Sergei Furgal and considers it fair to hold it in Khabarovsk.
Hurricane Hanna alerts in two Mexican states
The Mexican National Directorate of Civil Defense has announced an "orange" (high) alert level in the two eastern states of Tamaulipas and Nuevo Len due to the approaching Hurricane Hanna, TASS reports.
The hurricane will bring heavy downpours to Mexico, with 150 to 250 litres of rainfall per square meter forecast in some areas.
Authorities have prepared about 800 shelters for the population.
Ten thousand people, including rescuers, members of the National Guard and the military, will provide assistance to people.
So far, the hurricane has reached the coast of the U.S. state of Texas with winds of 150 km / h.
Hanna is expected to arrive in Mexico on Sunday morning.
Semilarski against the prosecutor's office: the appeal of the former deputy mayor of Tartu will be considered on August 4
This means that a decision on it is likely to be made in early September.
The courts of the first two instances refused to consider Semilarski's claim, but in April, the Supreme Court accepted his appeal.
On December 12, 2019, the Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the applicant, as its resolution does not fall within the competence of the administrative court.
The court ruling stated that the complaint contained a claim for compensation for damage caused in the course of criminal proceedings.
"It is up to the prosecutor's office and the county court to regulate such matters," Anette Kreitsmann, press secretary for the Tartu courts, previously explained to ERR.
According to her, Valvo Semilarski appealed the ruling to the district court, which did not change the decision of the court of first instance on February 5.
Now the State Court will have to say its word.
According to Semilarski's defense attorney, attorney-at-law Oliver Nez, his client was unjustifiably suspected of bribery for about two years.
Now he is demanding that the prosecutor's office refute the false allegations against him and compensate him for moral damages.
The reason for filing a complaint with the court was the statements made by the prosecutor for special cases of the Luunas District Prosecutor's Office, Margus Gross, in October 2017, when Semilarski, along with another at the time vice-mayor of Tartu, Artem Suvorov, was detained on suspicion of having committed several crimes.
"Let us recall that when I was detained, the Security Police and the prosecutor's office immediately organized a press conference and informed the entire Republic of Estonia that the leaders of Tartu, one of the most influential local government bodies, were corrupt.
These public suspicions, hanging in the air, accompanied me for about two years.
And now that these allegations and suspicions have turned out to be false, the prosecutor's office does not want to say anything about it, "Semilarski commented in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Nez, at the press conference, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework within which the prosecutor's office should operate.
"The allegation of bribery and corruption has turned out to be false, but this is not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its rulings on Russia, as well as on Lithuania, that at the stage of the investigation, representatives of the state must be careful when choosing their words, so that suspects are not presented as criminals before sentencing.
The prosecutor's office is also bound by the presumption of innocence, which, unfortunately, was not respected in this case against Valvo Semilarski, "Nez said.
"The public portrayal of Semilarski as a serious offender and bribe-taker in circumstances where the facts underlying the suspicion of bribery are still being clarified is unacceptable, contrary to the presumption of innocence and unfair to the applicant," the lawyer added.
According to rus.err.ee, the former deputy mayor of Tartu, Valvo Semilarski, will not be prosecuted on charges of bribery - the criminal case against him was partially closed in July.
At the same time, the former official is being tried on charges of knowingly violating anti-corruption legislation when conducting transactions on a particularly large scale.
According to the indictment, between 2015 and 2017, the former deputy mayor of Tartu participated more than thirty times in meetings of the city council when making decisions related to companies operating in Tartu, with the owners or managers of which Semilarski actively communicated on a personal level during off-hours.
According to Gross, Semilarski had personal interests in all of these cases, and therefore he had to withdraw from decision-making.
Earlier, as rus.err.ee wrote, the prosecutor's office presented Semilarski with suspicions of taking bribes and violating anti-corruption legislation when conducting transactions in particularly large amounts.
This happened in October 2016, when he was detained along with another deputy mayor, Artem Suvorov (Centre Party).
At that time, the prosecutor's office and the Security Police said that there was strong evidence against the two vice-mayors.
After that, both officials resigned.
The case of Suvorov later reached the court, which fully acquitted the politician.
The judicial investigation into the Valvo Semilarski case is still ongoing.
The former soloist of the group "Hands Up" visited the Tver region
The former soloist of the group "Hands Up," and now a solo performer, businessman and actor, Sergei hukov, posted on his official Instagram account a photo from Kalyazin in the Tver region.
The photo was published a day ago, on Saturday, July 25.
"I raise my hands up to the new" Baby "and send you greetings from the heady-fresh air
Write in the comments, what is the weather in your city?
We have no rain today, but it is still not rising above 20, "hukov writes on social networks.
Probably, the singer is vacationing in the beautiful city of Tver region with his family.
Residents of the region have already thanked the performer for the visit, and also expressed hope for a meeting and personal interaction.
The new "Baby," which is referred to in the post, is probably referring to a new version of the old song, which hukov has now recorded together with blogger and musician David Manukyan (DAVA M).
At the same time, the majority of fans remain BEHIND the old version: "Sergei, the old version of the song is clearly 1,000,000 times better"
Support me with the dedicated fans of "Hands Up," "We don't need a" new baby. ""
Most people write directly that they like the original, which became a hit in its time.
The Ministry of Defense reported the successful completion of tests of the ircon hypersonic missile
The Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation reported the successful completion of tests of the hypersonic missile "Tsirkon."
On Navy Day, the Defense Ministry noted that test launches conducted from the frigate "Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union Gorshkov" confirmed the unique tactical and technical characteristics of this missile in terms of range and accuracy of fire, as well as the hypersonic speed of its flight.
According to the Ministry of Defense, testing of the hypersonic missile is proceeding as planned.
Earlier in May, Deputy Minister of Defense Aleksei Krivoruchko reported that the ship's complex with the latest hypersonic missile "Tsirkon" will enter service in 2021-2022.
You all know the truth that will be discussed today.
I think the idea of inequality as a divider and destroyer of society was in the air even before the French Revolution.
But now we can see the evidence by comparing the most and least similar societies, and by observing the consequences of inequality.
I will show you this data and explain why there are relationships that will be discussed.
But first, look at how sad we are.
(Laughter) I will start with a paradox.
It shows life expectancy as a function of GNI, or the average wealth of countries.
It can be seen that countries on the right, such as Norway and the US, are twice as rich as Israel, Greece and Portugal on the left.
But this does not affect life expectancy at all.
There are no hints of a relationship.
But, within societies, there are strong gradations in health, affecting all social strata.
Again, average life expectancy.
The chart refers to small areas of England and Wales: the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.
There is a huge difference between the poor and everyone else.
Even those who are slightly poorer than the richest are already less healthy than the very top.
So income is very important within our societies, but not between them.
The explanation for this paradox is that, within our societies, we look at relative income or social position, status - at what level we are in relation to others, and what are the distances between us.
Once you understand this idea, you will immediately think: what will happen if the margin increases or shrinks, in other words, making the income gap larger or smaller?
Now I will show you that.
All the data used are absolutely real.
I take information from the UN, and the World Bank has the same: the scale of the income gap in these rich and developed market democracies.
We estimate the difference between the richest 20 and the poorest 20 in each country.
Look, in the equal countries on the left, in Japan, Finland, Norway, and Sweden, the rich 20 are 3.5-4 times richer than the poor 20.
But in unequal countries, in the UK, Portugal, the US and Singapore, the difference is twice as big
According to these measurements, we are half as equal as other successful democracies.
And now you will see the impact this has on society.
We have collected statistics on social problems that are more common among the poor.
These are internationally comparable data on life expectancy, child literacy and numeracy, infant mortality, homicide rates, incarceration rates, teenage pregnancies, confidence levels, obesity, mental illness, which, according to the standard diagnostic classification, includes drug and alcohol addiction, and finally, data on social mobility.
We put it all in one index.
They are all of equal importance.
The country is, in a way, the average of these data.
You see the countries in terms of the inequality indicator that was shown at the beginning, and I will go back to it again and again as the presentation progresses.
Unequal countries in general have more difficulties with all these social problems.
You can see that the correlation is unusually high.
But if you look at the same index of health and social problems in relation to GDP per capita, at Gross National Income, there is no longer any correlation.
We were a bit worried that people would think that we were matching the issues with our arguments and simply "fitting" the evidence.
The index consists of 40 different parts put together by different people.
Among the criteria are: the presence of books at home, the ability of children to talk to their parents, the level of immunization, the presence of bullying at school.
That includes everything.
But this is all against the background of the same indicator of inequality.
Children are worse off in unequal societies.
And this is a statistically significant relationship.
But again, if you look at the level of child welfare in relation to national income per capita, there is no correlation, no hint.
All of the demonstrated data suggest one thing:
On average, the well-being of our societies is no longer dependent on national income and economic growth.
They are extremely important in poor countries, but not in the developed world.
The difference between us, and our position in comparison with others, is what matters.
I will show you fragments of our index.
Here, for example, is trust.
This is the part of the population that agrees that most people can be trusted.
The data comes from the World Values Survey.
Look, in unequal countries, only 15 of the population trusts others.
And in equal societies, this figure reaches 60-65.
If you look at the measurements of social activity, or social capital, you will notice very similar ratios, closely related to inequality.
You can say we did the job twice.
First, we analyzed the developed countries, and then, as a benchmark study, we repeated the procedure in the 50 American states, asking one question: Are things worse on all of our indicators in the most unequal states?
That's the credibility of inequality, according to the federal government's overall social study.
Very similar spread, compared to a similar range of confidence levels.
The same story.
Overall, we found that almost everything related to trust at the international level is manifested in the same way in our benchmark study.
This is not just a coincidence.
Here is a chart of mental illness.
The WHO, using identical diagnostic interviews conducted on random samples of the population, has collected results that allow us to compare the level of mental illness in each of the societies.
Here is the percentage of the population that suffered from any mental illness last year.
Figures start at around 8 and rise to almost 24; entire societies with a threefold rate of psychological illness.
Again, this is closely related to inequality.
But here are the crimes.
These red dots show the American states, and the blue triangles show the Canadian provinces.
But look at the scale of the differences.
It starts at 15 murders per million and goes up to 150.
This is the proportion of prisoners.
This is a tenfold difference expressed on a logarithmic scale.
The numbers rise from 40 to 400 in terms of the number of prisoners in prisons.
These connections are not simply explained by higher crime.
Yes, in some cases this is partly true.
But for the most part, they are associated with tougher sentences.
Unequal societies are more likely to support the retention of the death penalty.
It shows the percentage of children dropping out of school.
Again, a pretty big difference.
It is incredibly harmful when it comes to the use of talents.
But here is social mobility.
This is a measure of mobility based on income.
Basically, the question is: do rich fathers have rich sons, and poor fathers have poor sons, or is there no dependency?
Among unequal countries, in the UK and the US, the father's income is many times more important.
And in the Scandinavian countries, income is already much less significant.
As a result, there is greater social mobility.
And as we often like to say - I know there are many Americans in the audience - if Americans want to realize the American dream, they should go to Denmark.
(Laughter) (Applause) I showed just a couple of things in italics.
A number of other problems could be demonstrated.
All kinds of problems that become more significant among the lower social classes.
But there are endless problems with social gradients, which are much worse in unequal countries; and not just a little, but 2, 10 times worse.
Think about the costs, about what it costs people.
Let me go back to the previously shown chart, where all the data are put together.
First, chart by chart, the less prosperous countries, regardless of the outcome, end up being unequal, while the better performing countries are the Scandinavian countries and Japan.
Thus, we see a general social dysfunction against the backdrop of inequality.
This is not one, not two separate problems. It is a trend.
Another important note about this chart: Let's take a look below: Sweden and Japan: countries are literally different in everything.
The situation of women, how closely they are connected to the family, is directly opposite, in the context of developed countries.
Another very important difference is how they achieve greater equality.
In Sweden, income gaps are huge, but they are narrowing through taxation, social programs, generous benefits, etc.
In Japan, things are different.
The wage gap is initially small.
Taxes are lower.
There are fewer social programs.
And in our analysis of American states, we find the same contrast.
Some states thrive on income redistribution, others on smaller differences in net income before taxes.
We believe that it does not matter by what means equality is achieved, as long as it is achieved.
I am not talking about full equality, but about the one that exists in rich and developed market democracies.
Another surprising observation is that it is not just the poor who are affected by this inequality.
There seems to be some truth in the words of John Donne: "Man is not an island."
A number of studies compare how people in more and less equal countries do well at every step of the social ladder.
One such example is:
Mortality among newborns.
A group of Swedes have classified many cases of infant mortality according to the British General Socio-Economic Classification Register.
Rather, it is an anachronistic classification according to the father's profession, so that single parents are not counted.
And by "low social level" we mean unskilled professions.
Then there are skilled manual workers, then white-collar workers of the lowest level and up to the highest level with highly qualified professions: doctors, lawyers, directors of large companies.
You see, things are doing better in Sweden than in Britain at all levels of society.
The biggest difference at the lower levels,
but even for the higher levels there are benefits from a more equal society.
We have shown this in five different sets of data affecting educational outcomes and health in the U.S. and internationally.
And this seems to be the big picture: greater equality makes a big difference at the bottom, but it is also good for the top.
But I still have to explain what is happening.
I think we are talking about the psychosocial consequences of inequality everywhere.
About the feeling of superiority and inferiority, about the feeling of one's worth and vice versa, about the feeling of self-respect and vice versa.
And, of course, the sense of competition that these feelings generate is fueling consumerism in our society.
It also leads to fear for your status.
We are more concerned about how others think about us, whether they think we are attractive, intelligent - this is what worries us.
The more public assessments, the greater the fear of them.
Interestingly, parallel work is being carried out in social psychology: 208 different studies were reviewed with the participation of volunteers, who were tested in psychological laboratories for stress hormones, for reactions to stressful tasks.
Overall, they wanted to observe the types of stress that raise levels of cortisol, the main stress hormone.
As a result, these factors turned out to be situations that included a potential threat to social evaluation, a threat to self-esteem or social status, and situations where other people could give a negative assessment.
It is these stressors that have a particular impact on the physiology of stress.
There has also been criticism of us.
Of course, there will be dissenters or people who find it surprising.
I have to tell you, in response to the criticism over the collection of data, that we do not choose this data.
Our main rule is that if the data source has the necessary indicators for one of the analyzed countries, we include it in our analysis.
It is the source of information that decides whether the data is real, but not us.
Otherwise, we would have created a systematic error.
What about other countries?
There are 200 studies of health in relation to income and equality in academic journals.
And they are not limited to these countries, but we have excluded others for the sake of clarity.
The same countries, the same dimensions of inequality, problem after problem.
Why do we not control other factors?
Well, we have shown you that GDP per capita does not matter.
And, of course, others, using more sophisticated methods, controlled poverty, the level of education, and so on.
And what about causality?
Correlation alone does not prove causality.
We spent a lot of time on it.
Indeed, for some of these situations, the cause-and-effect relationship is well known.
A big change in our understanding of the causes of chronic health effects in the developed world has been the significance of chronic social stress and its effects on the immune and cardiovascular systems.
For example, violence is becoming more common in unequal societies because people are more sensitive to contempt.
It must be said that in order to solve this problem, we need to work on pre-tax and post-tax revenues.
We need to limit the earnings and additional bonuses of the top ranks.
I think it is necessary to make our bosses take responsibility for employees in every possible way.
I want you to leave here with the knowledge that we can improve the real quality of human life by reducing the income gap between us.
Now we have a foothold to influence the psychological wellbeing of entire societies, and this is truly incredible.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Clubs claiming the star of Lokomotiv Miranchuk and his salary in Italy became known.

Any club that makes such an offer will receive priority.
Lokomotiv is determined to sell its main star and make money from it.
Otherwise, the club will face serious costs in extending its contract with the halfback.
Note that Milan expects to include left-back Diego Laxalt in the deal.
In the 2019 / 20 season, Miranchuk played 32 matches for railway workers, scored 16 goals and made 5 assists.
Together with Lokomotiv, the halfback became the champion of Russia (2017-18), won the National Cup three times (2014-15, 2016-17, 2018-19) and once the Russian Super Cup (2019).
U.S. calls on atar and its neighbors to end the dispute
It is necessary to restore trust and unity between atar and other states, believes U.S. Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook.
He said the conflict between the emirate and other countries in the region has been going on for too long and is damaging regional interests in stability, prosperity and security.
So far, the US has unsuccessfully tried to mediate a dispute that Washington views as "a threat to efforts to contain Iran."
Diplomatic relations with atar were severed three years ago by the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain.
They imposed a transport blockade, accusing atar of supporting terrorism.
In response, Doha said that its neighbors are simply jealous of atar's economic success - according to the IMF, atar has been leading in terms of GDP per capita for several years by a wide margin.
The Emirate is the third largest exporter of natural gas, the sixth largest exporter of natural gas and a major exporter of oil and petroleum products.

Russian Proton is ready to conquer the open space
The Proton-M rocket is ready for launch, during which it will put into orbit two telecommunications satellites of the Express series.
A state commission came to this conclusion.
On July 26, the device will be launched at the launch pad of the Baikonur Cosmodrome.
The direct launch of the rocket is scheduled for July 30.
The original launch date was pushed back after a number of faults were discovered among the launch vehicle components.

Denis Remenyako rushed forward again, and Alexander Vayntrub was forced to repel the attacks of Alexander Maslennikov on KTM, which broke from last place to third.
Despite a tight fight in the first part of the race, closer to the middle, Vayntrub picked up the pace, showing the best lap time in the race - and, although unable to catch up with the extremely stable Remenyako, guaranteed himself silver.
The Cayman group has fallen behind the leaders, but has been fighting hard.
The best of the pilots on the Porsche was Aleksei Bashmakov, who was fourth in the standings, but Andrei Fedotov and Konstantin akharevsky also gave him a few moments.
And at the intermediate finish in the middle of the race, Fedotov and akharevsky were completely separated by 0.001 seconds.
Two more motorways entered the list of federal roads
The Russian government has added two more highways to the list of federal highways.
According to the Cabinet of Ministers, one of these roads, which is more than 663 kilometers long, connects Vologda and Arkhangelsk regions with the Republic of Komi.
Another highway with a length of more than 388 kilometers leads from Barnaul through Pavlovsk to the border with the Republic of Kazakhstan.
On this road, you can drive from the capital of the Altai Territory to the Kulunda checkpoint.
Obtaining the new status will make it possible to bring these roads to a standard state with funds from the Federal Road Fund.
Major repairs and reconstruction of individual sections will be carried out, and the quality of the road surface will be improved.
In Tatarstan, it was allowed to hold film screenings in the open air
The Cabinet of Ministers of Tatarstan has published a decree according to which, from July 27, it is possible to hold film screenings in open areas in the republic - in parks, squares and on embankments, writes "Tatar-inform."
Also, the document states that for citizens over 65 years of age, the mandatory self-isolation regime has been extended until August 9.
They can leave the house to go to the store, take out the garbage or take a walk with the dog.
But indoor cinemas are not planning to open until the third stage of lifting restrictions, the agency recalls.
Washington is looking forward to the playoffs.
We missed them
Russian hockey player "Washington Capitals" Alexander Ovechkin spoke about the club's preparations for the upcoming resumption of the season in the NHL.
The 34-year-old Caps striker noted the readiness of his partners for the matches.
Psychologically, all the guys are ready.
We are heading to Toronto with joy, because we have been without a game for a long time and have missed hockey in the playoffs, "the Russian-language version of the NHL.Com website quotes Ovechkin as saying.
- Right now we are fresh, we don't have any injuries or any kind of soreness.
However, Ovechkin also admitted that he and his partners have yet to recall some of the tactical combinations: "We don't have much time to win the majority and remember the March experience of how to move the puck in such situations.
But there is still time: I am sure that in Toronto we will devote part of our training to this.
Majorities and minorities are important in the playoffs.
And I am confident in our special teams. "
Recall that the restart of the "Washington Capitals" is scheduled for August 3, when the "capital" will play against the "Tampa Bay Lightning."
After that, the Caps will also play against the Philadelphia Flyers (August 6) and the Boston Bruins (August 9).
A Russian man refused to pay for parking and beat a parking worker
In Vladivostok, a man refused to pay for parking and hit a parking employee, police are conducting an inspection.
This is reported by the vl.ru portal with reference to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia for the city.
The incident occurred on Friday, July 24, in a parking lot near a shopping center.
The driver of the car refused to pay for parking, which led to a conflict with the parking employee.
The verbal dispute escalated into physical assault.
The man hit the employee in the face, he fell unconscious.
He was hospitalized.
According to the source of the publication, the victim suffered a moderate head injury and was taken to the neurosurgery department.
The police are currently investigating all the circumstances surrounding the incident.
Earlier, the Russian was charged with beating a disabled man who later died in hospital.
According to investigators, the victim was visiting his friend - a 45-year-old local resident.
The men drank alcohol together, after which there was a conflict between the friends.
The landlord beat the guest, he went home.
Two days later, the man became ill and was hospitalized.
He died of his injuries.
Recently, cyber attacks on the business world have become more frequent.
Access to data from companies such as JP Morgan, Yahoo, Home Depot and Target has cost them hundreds of millions and, in some cases, billions of dollars.
Too many such attacks are not needed to damage the global economy.
The public sector is also not immune to such problems.
From 2012 to 2014, there was a significant data leak at the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.
Access to security and fingerprint data for 22 million employees was compromised.
There are known attempts by government-sponsored hackers to influence election results in a number of countries using stolen data.
Two recent cases of large amounts of data disclosure concern the Bundestag, Germany's federal parliament, and the theft of US Democratic National Committee emails.
The cyber threat affects our democratic processes.
The situation is even getting worse.
As computer technology advances, data protection systems are becoming increasingly vulnerable.
There is also concern about a new kind of computer technology - computing on quantum computers, which use the microscopic properties of nature to vastly increase computing power.
It is so powerful that it will be able to crack many modern encryption systems.
Is the situation so hopeless?
Maybe it's time to pack our vital data and prepare for an imminent digital apocalypse?
I would say, "It's not the time yet."
uantum computers are still in development, and it will take many years before they can be put into practice.
More importantly, major breakthroughs are taking place in the area of encryption.
For me, this is a particularly exciting time in the history of secure communications.
About 15 years ago, when I learned about the new possibility of creating quantum effects that do not exist in nature, I was very excited.
I was intrigued by the idea of using the fundamental laws of physics to create more secure encryption.
Today, a number of companies and laboratories around the world, including mine, are working on these technologies to put them into practice.
Right.
Now we are preparing to fight quantum with the help of quantum.
So how does it all work?
First, let's take a short tour of the world of encryption.
To do this, we will need a briefcase, some important documents we want to send to our friend, James Bond, and a lock to keep everything safe.
Since our information is top secret, we need a special portfolio.
It has a special code lock: when it is closed, it converts all text in documents into random numbers.
You put the documents in the briefcase, close the lock - at this very moment all the documents are converted to random numbers - and send the briefcase to James.
While the briefcase is on its way, you call James to provide the code.
After receiving the briefcase, he enters the code, the documents are decrypted, and voila - you just sent an encrypted message to James Bond.
(Laughter) A funny example, but it illustrates three important elements of coding.
Code - we call it the "encryption key."
It is like a password.
Call James to tell him the lock combination code.
This is called a "key exchange" -
guarantee that you securely get the encryption key from the right place.
And a lock that encodes and decodes a document.
This is called a "coding algorithm."
Using a key, it converts text in documents into random numbers.
A good algorithm will encode in such a way that without a key, a document is very difficult to decrypt.
The importance of encryption is that if someone takes possession of a portfolio and hacks it without the help of an encryption key and encoding algorithm, they will still not be able to read its contents.
The information will look like a set of random numbers.
Most security systems rely on a secure key exchange method to transfer the encryption key to the right place.
However, the rapid development of computing power threatens a number of modern methods of key exchange.
Consider one of the most widely used systems today - RSA.
When it was invented in 1977, it was estimated that it would take 40 quadrillion years to hack the 426-bit RSA key.
In 1994, just 17 years later, the code was hacked.
As computers became more powerful, we had to use more complex codes.
Today, we usually use 2,048 or 4,096 bits.
As you can see, code creators and hackers are engaged in an ongoing battle, trying to outwit each other.
And when quantum computers appear in the next 10-15 years, they will be able to hack even faster the complex mathematics that underlies many modern encryption systems.
The quantum computer is likely to turn our current reliable fortress into a simple house of cards.
We have to find a way to defend our fortress.
In recent years, there has been an increasing amount of research into the use of quantum effects to enhance cryptosecurity.
Some interesting discoveries have been made.
Remember the three main elements of encryption: high-quality keys, secure key exchange, and a sophisticated algorithm?
Advances in science and technology threaten two of these three elements.
First, the keys themselves.
Random numbers are the fundamental building blocks of encryption keys.
But to date, they are not entirely random.
Today, we create encryption keys from sequences of random numbers generated from software, so-called pseudo-random numbers.
In the numbers generated by the program or mathematical formula, somehow there is a certain pattern.
The less random numbers are - in scientific terms: the less entropy they contain - the easier it is to predict them.
Recently, several casinos have fallen victim to an inventive attack.
The output combinations of the slot machines were recorded for some time before being analyzed.
This allowed cybercriminals to redesign the pseudo-random number generator that controls the reels.
That, in turn, made it possible to predict the spins of the reels with high accuracy and get a big win.
Encryption keys can also be exposed to similar risks.
A truly random number generator is needed for secure encryption.
For many years, scientists have been looking for the possibility of creating such a generator.
But most attempts to date are either not random enough, not fast enough, or difficult to repeat.
But the quantum world is based on chance.
So it makes sense to take advantage of this fact.
Devices that can measure quantum effects can also create an infinite stream of random numbers at high speed,
which will thwart all of these potential criminals at the casino.
A number of top universities and companies around the world are engaged in creating truly random number generators.
The first quantum generator created at my company was one by two meters in size and was placed on an optical table.
Later we were able to reduce it to the size of the server box.
Today it is the size of a PCI card connected to a standard computer.
It is the fastest truly random number generator in the world.
Its output is a billion random numbers per second.
Today, cloud providers, banks, and government agencies around the world are using it to strengthen security.
(Applause) But even with such a generator, the second big problem remains unresolved: the threat to the secure exchange of keys.
Modern methods of key exchange are not compatible with a quantum computer.
The quantum solution to this problem is called "quantum key distribution" or D, which is based on the fundamental, paradoxical characteristic of quantum mechanics.
The quantum particle changes depending on its observation.
Let me give you an example of how this works.
Let's go back to exchanging codes for the castle with James Bond.
Only this time, instead of calling James with a code message, we will use quantum effects on the laser to create a code and send it to James over a regular optical fiber.
We believe that Dr. No will try to hack access to the data exchange.
Fortunately, his attempts to catch quantum keys along the way will leave fingerprints that James and you can detect.
This will eliminate the intercepted keys.
And the remaining keys can be used for enhanced data protection.
Because such security is based on the fundamental laws of physics, a quantum computer, or even any supercomputer of the future, will not be able to hack it.
My team and I are working with leading universities as well as the defence sector to develop this promising technology into next-generation security tools.
The Internet of Things heralds an era in which 25-30 billion devices are expected to interact by 2020.
Trust in the systems that support these devices is vital to the proper functioning of our society in the world of the Internet of Things.
I bet that quantum technology can provide that trust, allowing us to take full advantage of the amazing innovations that will enrich our lives.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Video of cats helping a wounded dog cross the road
A video of two cats who helped an injured dog cross the road in Krasnodar Krai is becoming popular online.
A touching procession was recorded by the video recorder of one of the drivers.
The events took place in the dark, the man noticed traffic on the road and slowed down.
"Look, the whole delegation is rushing," the driver sneers at first.
And then he notices that the dog is moving with great difficulty.
The company safely reached the roadside, after which it headed towards the forest.
"There is something people can learn from animals," they write in the comments.
On Sunday, parades in honor of the Day of the Russian Navy were held in Saint Petersburg and near all major naval bases, including in Tartus, Syria.
They were attended by 219 different ships and 15 thousand personnel.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, who hosted the main parade in St. Petersburg, said that in 2020, the Navy will be enlarged with 40 new vessels of different classes, as well as the latest weapons - including hypersonic strike systems and unmanned underwater vehicles.
In 2020, the parade was held for the first time in Kaspiysk, where the base of the Caspian fleet was relocated from Astrakhan.
In addition to Saint Petersburg, parades were held in Baltiysk, Kaspiysk, Severomorsk, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Vladivostok, as well as in the annexed Sevastopol and on the roadside of the Syrian port of Tartus.
The main parade in the waters of the Neva River and the Gulf of Finland was attended by 4,000 military personnel and 46 vessels, including nuclear and diesel submarines, as well as helicopters and naval aircraft.
Before the start of the parade, Putin, accompanied by Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, Admiral Nikolai Yevmenov, and the Commander of the Western Military District, Colonel-General huravlev, toured several ships stationed on the Kronstadt Raid and in the Gulf of Finland, welcoming the personnel.
The parade was also decorated with a copy of the first Russian battleship, Poltava, recreated according to archival drawings.
Emperor Peter I took part in its design.
In his speech, Putin recalled that this year marks the 200th anniversary of the discovery of Antarctica as a result of an expedition by Russian sailors Faddei Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev.
Snipers providing security were seen on the roof of the Senate and Synod buildings during the parade.
More than 46 warships and more than 1.5 servicemen took part in the parade in Baltiysk, where the Baltic Fleet is based, and the large warship "Kaliningrad" made an amphibious landing.
In the annexed Sevastopol, a parade was held with the participation of 30 ships and a performance dedicated to the history of the Black Sea Fleet, which included the departure of a group of divers from underwater.
The parade in Severomorsk was attended by the new strategic nuclear-powered submarine Prince Vladimir, which was admitted to the Northern Fleet in June.
In Vladivostok, the holiday ended with fireworks.
The Russian Navy will receive 40 ships and vessels this year
Forty ships and vessels will join the Russian Navy this year, Russian President Vladimir Putin said.
"The level of equipment of our military fleet is constantly growing.
This year, it will include 40 ships and vessels of various classes, "he said, speaking at the main parade in honor of the Navy Day in Saint Petersburg.
Putin also recalled that a few days ago, six new ships of the far sea zone were laid down at three shipyards in Russia.
Earlier it was reported that a parade in honor of Navy Day began in Saint Petersburg.
A four-year-old child was injured in an accident near Volgograd

Northern Fleet officers receive state awards
The commander of the Northern Fleet, Hero of Russia, Vice Admiral Alexander Moiseev, presented state awards to distinguished officers.
This is stated in a statement on the official website of the Ministry of Defence.
As noted in the report, the orders and medals were received by 12 senior and senior officers from the submarine forces, the army corps, the air force and air defense army, the White Sea naval base, military units and the headquarters of the Northern Fleet.
The head of the technical department of the Northern Fleet, Rear Admiral Sergei Grishko, was thanked by the President of the Russian Federation.
How will the decision of the Central Bank to reduce the key rate affect the economy?
The Bank of Russia expectedly cut its key rate again.
It dropped another 0.25 percentage points, to 4.25 per annum - formally the next historical low.
Judging by the return of the short rate cut, as well as the tone of the Central Bank's statements and updated forecasts for the Russian economy, the regulator is looking at economic prospects more optimistically than before.
This means that the current cycle of monetary easing may soon come to a halt.
"We have continued to soften the monetary policy, especially given that there are still risks of inflation falling below 4 in 2021," the head of the Bank of Russia, Elvira Nabiullina, said.
They are associated with a significant decline in economic activity and a fall in domestic and external demand.
Economic recovery, according to Nabiullina, will take more than a year and a half.
At the same time, she noted that after the lifting of restrictions due to the pandemic, economic processes have revived: energy consumption, consumer and investment demand have recovered, construction and production of consumer goods have expanded, and the annual rate of decline in the turnover of transport and industrial production has slowed.
According to the updated forecast of the Central Bank, in 2020 the economy will shrink by 4.5-5.5 (previously it was expected to be 4-6), and the recovery growth of the economy in 2021 will be 3.5-4.5, and in 2022 - 2.5-3.5.
In addition, the Bank of Russia has revised its forecast for annual oil prices to 38 and 40 per barrel of Urals in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
Previously, the Central Bank expected 27 and 35 dollars per barrel.
Finally, the Bank of Russia's inflation forecast for 2020 was 3.7-4.2, compared to the previously expected 3.8-4.8.
The Bank of Russia's view of the situation in the economy is becoming more optimistic, which brings us closer to the end of the cycle of easing, according to Renaissance Capital economists for Russia and the CIS, Sofia Donets and Andrei Melashchenko.
Thus, the Bank of Russia has been consistently lowering its key rate for more than a year; since the beginning of last summer, it has already dropped by 3.5 percentage points.
And at the last meeting in June, the Central Bank lowered it by one percentage point at once because of low inflation rates due to depressed demand and the need to stimulate the economy, which has been slowing down due to the pandemic and related restrictions.
The chances of fine-tuning the monetary policy remain (at the next meeting on September 18 and before the end of the year), but the limit is already close, agrees the chief analyst of Rosbank, Evgeny Koshelev.
The combination of pro-inflationary risks also points to a near pause in interest rate policy easing - disrupted supply chains, possible cost increases due to epidemic prevention measures, and a faster-than-expected recovery in demand, he says.
On top of that, the Bank of Russia's subsequent actions will require greater attention to inflationary processes during the harvest season, as well as external volatility, which has increased amid geopolitical conflicts, points out Koshelev.
One way or another, a reduction in the key rate will lead to a further reduction in rates for the most reliable borrowers, as well as, possibly, on mortgages, says Maksim Petronevich, senior economist at the analytical department of Otkritie Bank.
The adjustment of rates will be less pronounced than the reduction of the key rate, he clarifies.
Rates on consumer loans could fall by another 0.3-0.6 percentage points during the second half of the year, mortgage rates could end the year in the range of 6.2-7, says Anton Pokatovich, an economist at BKS Premier.
Average interest rates on deposits, in his opinion, will also fall - in the coming months they could fall to 4.2-4.5 (now barely above 4.5).
Further, they could drop to 4 if the Central Bank lowers the key rate in the autumn, believes Pokatovich.
Centre Party promises to pay all its debts by the end of the year
The Secretary General of the Centrist Party, Mikhail Korb, spoke about this in an interview with ERR.
According to him, the total amount of payments to be made by the party is about 300,000 euros.
"According to today's financial projections, the Centre Party will pay off its current debts and liabilities by the end of this year," Korb said.
Earlier, it became known that the party of the prime minister returned 110,100 euros to the state, which were recognized as a prohibited donation.
A car and a caravan collided in Harju County: four people were injured
According to police, the accident occurred at 13: 50 in the village of Soodla, where a Mercedes-Benz car driven by a 31-year-old woman collided with a Fiat caravan with a 48-year-old man behind the wheel.
As a result of the incident, the drivers of both vehicles were injured, as well as passengers who were in the house on wheels: a 10-year-old child and a 48-year-old woman who was taken to hospital.
The rest of the victims were given first aid on the spot, they did not need hospitalization.
The exact circumstances of the incident are being clarified.
Ukrainian military will monitor ceasefire in Donbass
The Ukrainian military has begun preparations for a ceasefire on the demarcation line in Donbass, and military personnel with experience in peacekeeping missions will monitor the implementation of the agreements, reports the headquarters of the Joint Forces on Facebook.
"Units from the Joint Forces have begun preparations for a full and comprehensive ceasefire on the demarcation line, which will take effect from July 27, 2020," the statement said.
It is noted that, starting at 00: 01 on July 27, at each of the Ukrainian positions, additional monitoring of the ceasefire will be carried out by specially seconded Ukrainian military personnel, most of whom have combat experience and were directly involved in relevant issues during their participation in peacekeeping missions under the auspices of the UN.
Such a step will allow "not to distract the personnel of the units of the Joint Forces from carrying out combat missions and to prevent possible provocations," the statement said.
At a meeting of the contact group on Donbass held on Wednesday, the parties agreed on a set of additional measures to monitor the ceasefire, which, among other things, includes a ban on the activities of subversive reconnaissance groups and a ban on firing, including sniper fire.
13 patients with coronavirus died in Moscow
Another 13 patients with coronavirus have died in Moscow over the past 24 hours.

Psychologist: "Yemelyanenko still can't forget the parting with his beloved woman."
Psychologist Veronika Stepanova, who has more than 1 million subscribers on YouTube, spoke about MMA fighter Aleksandr Yemelyanenko, who is the former husband of her sister.
Olga met with Sasha, they began to have a stormy love, Stepanova said in a video on her Youtube channel.
- It was a very beautiful story, they instantly gave birth to a baby, everything was beautiful and wonderful.
At some point, Sasha was fed up with all this, he wanted to walk a little bit.
And if any other woman treats it normally (well, you think, went for a walk, danced a little), then this is not about Olya.
She does not tolerate such things.
And his story about a little walk ended with his sister instantly marrying another person and immediately giving birth to his child.
When Sasha recovered from what had happened, he could not believe it.
He tried to crawl on his knees, to give diamonds.
His lion pride blew his head.
He wanted to get everything back, but he didn't understand how to get it back.
They are friends, they have a common child, but he still cannot recover.
His destructive behavior is a cry of despair, an attempt to either kill or get her attention.
Karolina Avenue will leave to play in Sweden.
The Carolina prospectus, Jack Drury, will compete in the Swedish championship next season, reports The Hockey News journalist Ryan Kennedy on Twitter.
The player of the U.S. youth team last season played in the NCAA for Harvard.
In 28 matches, he scored 39 (20 19) points.
Drury was drafted 42nd overall by Carolina in the 2018 draft.
Albert Proza has signed a contract with Legion Tallinn
Proza's last club was Tammeka Tartu, for which he competed last season.
"Because of the injury, I was out of football for more than a year.
On April 30, he underwent surgery.
But now everything is fine - I am ready to play again.
However, while my form is far from optimal.
When will I make my debut for Legion?
It is quite possible that on July 29 I will play a certain amount of time for the Estonian Cup, and on August 1 I will be included in the squad for the championship match against Paide.
But everything depends on the decision of the coach, he will decide whether I am ready or not.
I myself believe that I still have a lot to recruit, "Albert Proza said in an interview with ERR on Sunday.
In the current Estonian football championship, Legion, after 14 rounds, occupies ninth place in the standings with 10 points.
"At the moment, if you look at the table, we can't talk about the fight for high places, but Legion is an ambitious team, we have a fairly good squad.
I think that next year we will have better results.
And the goal for this year is to maintain a place in the top league and play more confidently, "added Proza.
"I do not set any personal goals for myself.
Returning to football after such a long pause is not easy.
Now my main task is to help the team stay in the top league and climb the table as high as possible, "said the striker.
Previously, Proza also played for the capital's Flora and Infonet, the Finnish RoPS and TPS, and the Maltese Valletta.
Proza played 7 matches for the Estonian national team.

Moscow has a negative average daily growth rate of new COVID-19 cases over the month
The headquarters for the control and monitoring of the coronavirus situation in Moscow reports that 683 new cases of coronavirus infection have been confirmed in the capital.
The average daily growth rate of new COVID-19 cases for the month is about -0.57.
Among the newly identified cases - 49.2 - are in people aged between 18 and 45 years, 30.6 - from 46 to 65 years, 9.6 - from 66 to 79, and another 3.3 - over 80 years.
Of these, 7.3 per cent were children.
The main naval parade was marked by new ships and shooting technologies
At the Main Naval Parade in Saint Petersburg, a new shooting technology was applied: a video camera "passed" under one of the ships, showing it "from the inside."
In this perspective, the passage of the newest serial small missile ship, Sovetsk, along the Admiralty Embankment was filmed.
The main naval parade was broadcast by the Russia 1 television channel and the Russia.tv website.
Earlier, on June 24, at the parade in honor of the 75th anniversary of the Great Victory, the camera, during the transition from one plan to another, "passed" through the barrel of a tank inside an armored vehicle, and during the flight of the fighters of the "Russian Knights" and "Strizhi" aerobatic groups, the camera "flew" from the nozzle of the aircraft's engine.
The main naval parade, consisting of 46 warships, boats and submarines, 41 airplanes and helicopters of naval aviation and more than 4,000 military personnel, ended in the waters of Kronstadt.
In particular, the parade was attended by the large anti-submarine ship Vice-Admiral Kulakov, the corvette Stoyky, the large landing ships Minsk and Patriot, the nuclear-powered submarine missile-carrying cruiser Orel, the submarine Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, the patrol ship Vasily Bykov, the small anti-submarine ships Kazanets and Urengoy, the small missile ships Liven and Passat, and the missile boat Chuvashia.
On the Kronstadt road in the Gulf of Finland, it was possible to see for the first time the large landing ship "Peter Morgunov," built according to the project of 11711 of the Nevsky PKB at the Baltic plant "Yantar."
The lead ship of this series, Ivan Gren, is already serving in the Northern Fleet, reports TASS.
Among the other newcomers who have recently entered service with the Navy was the first production frigate, the Admiral of the Kasatonov Fleet, built according to the project 22350 at the Severnaya Verf plant.
Another newcomer to the Navy is the diesel-electric submarine "Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky" of project 636.3 of the Central Design Bureau of Marine Equipment "Rubin," built at the "Admiralty Shipyards."
It joined the Russian Pacific Fleet in December 2019.
Other new ships that have recently become part of the Navy are the small missile ships "Sovetsk" and "Mytishchi" of project 22800 ("Karakurt"), developed by the TsMKB "Almaz."
Small missile ships "Veliky Ustyug" and "Serpukhov" of project 21631 "Buyan-M" also participated in the parade on the Neva River.
And the largest participants were the nuclear-powered submarine missile cruiser "Orel" and the large anti-submarine ship "Vice-Admiral Kulakov" - they could be seen in the Gulf of Finland.
In recognition of the great contribution of the Russian fleet to the exploration of the world's oceans, two new hydrographic boats, "Georgy ima" and "Mikhail Kazansky," took place along the Neva River, while the oceanographic research vessel "Admiral Vladimirsky," which, in June, completed a joint scientific round-the-world expedition with the Russian Geographical Society to the shores of Antarctica in honor of the 200th anniversary of its discovery by Russian navigators, Faddey Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev, stood on the Kronstadt Raid.
At the Palace Bridge, you could see the first Russian battleship of the 16th century, Poltava, recreated at the historic shipyard.
This 54-gun sailboat was launched in 1712, took part in the war with the Swedes, and in 1717 provided a landing on the island of Gotland.
In 1725, the ship was withdrawn from the Baltic Fleet, and after its reconstitution, it was launched in Saint Petersburg on May 27, 2018.
Travel to Kronstadt this year was restricted for the duration of the parade due to the prevention of the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus, RIA Novosti reports.
One person killed during protests in the United States
Protests took place in Seattle, Portland, Louisville and Denver, the "Actual Camera" reported on Sunday.
In Austin, Texas, a person died during a protest.
The protester was shot with a rifle while sitting in his car.
The suspect has already been detained.
In other cities, demonstrators clashed with law enforcement officers.
The protesters staged a riot and the police were forced to use tear gas and stun grenades.
Poll: Lithuania's ruling Union of Farmers and Greens again tops party ratings
The Union of Peasants and Greens of Lithuania, which heads the ruling coalition of the Seimas, headed the rating of parties.
This was shown by a survey conducted by the sociological research company Vilmorus since the order of the newspaper Lietuvos rytas.
After winning the 2016 parliamentary elections, the "peasants" lost first place and, for a long time, the main critic of Russia in Lithuania, the opposition Fatherland Union - Christian Democrats (Conservatives), was in the lead.
However, recently, the President of Lithuania, Gitanas Nauseda, assessing the electoral capabilities of the parties, said that the Union of Peasants and the Greens, after this year's parliamentary elections, will probably be able to form a coalition again.
The announcement sparked outrage among the Conservatives.
The latest poll showed that if parliamentary elections were held today, 17.6 percent of voters would vote for the peasants and 17.2 percent for the Conservatives.
According to the director of Vilmorus, Vladas Gaidis, the gap is within the margin of error, and yet the ruling party has stopped lagging behind the conservatives.
According to Gaidis, the news that Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis will head their electoral list contributed to the sociological success of the "peasants."
This politician was also the first on the list of "peasants" in the 2016 elections.
In third place is the Social Democratic Party, for which 7.1 percent of respondents are now ready to vote.
In a month, it unexpectedly lost 2 percent.
The fourth is the Labour Party, headed by a Russian-born businessman, Viktor Uspaskikh (6.2 percent).
According to the poll, other political organizations will not be able to overcome the 5 per cent electoral threshold.
Putin spoke about the unique advantages of the Russian fleet
Russian President Vladimir Putin said at the main naval parade in Saint Petersburg that the unique advantages and increased combat capabilities of the Russian fleet will be achieved through the introduction of advanced digital technologies.
As the head of state specified, domestic hypersonic strike systems and unmanned underwater vehicles have no analogues in the world.
In addition, the Russian leader drew attention to the most effective means of defense of the Russian Federation.
According to the Russian leader, the level of equipment of the Russian Navy is constantly growing, for example, this year it will receive 40 ships and vessels of various classes.
At the same time, it is noted that the emphasis will be placed on equipping unique hypersonic strike systems.
Today, the Navy is armed with the latest ships equipped with precision weapons, strategic submarines and multipurpose submarines, as well as unique models of special equipment, the president added.
Putin also stressed that naval personnel perform the most difficult tasks with dignity, serving the Fatherland with distinction.
The Emergencies Ministry has warned residents of the Moscow region about a thunderstorm
Thunderstorms and winds are expected in the Moscow region with gusts of up to 15 m / s. The regional department of the Ministry of Emergency Situations reported this on Sunday, July 26.
Residents are advised to remove household items from the yards and trim dry trees that could damage the home.
The car should be placed in a garage or parked away from trees or weakly fortified structures.
To avoid a lightning strike, it is recommended not to heat the stove in the house in a thunderstorm and not to use electrical appliances, and not to hide outside under trees (especially lonely ones), not to swim in water bodies.
Those in the car are advised to close the windows and stay inside.
On July 24, the Emergencies Ministry also warned residents of the Moscow region about the storm.
Unnecessary requirements for public procurement applications will be eliminated by law
The law may establish exhaustive requirements for applications to participate in the procurement.
In the autumn session, at a plenary session of the State Duma, it is planned to consider in the second reading a bill establishing requirements for the content and composition of an application for participation in the procurement, which only small and medium-sized businesses can participate in.
Amendments are being made by the government to the law "On the procurement of goods, works and services by certain types of legal entities."
The bill is designed to implement the roadmap for the implementation of the Strategy for the Development of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises in the Russian Federation until 2030, approved by the government.
It provides for the preparation of a draft law on an exhaustive list of documents that customers are entitled to demand as part of an application from procurement participants - small and medium-sized businesses.
And also about the list of requirements for these documents.
Currently, the law "On the procurement of goods, works and services by certain types of legal entities" provides a framework for regulating the procurement activities of certain types of legal entities.
The requirements for the content, form, design and composition of the application for participation in the procurement are established by the customers themselves in the procurement documentation.
"As a result, customers are setting excessive requirements for the content, registration of the application, the mandatory presence of certificates, certificates, and extracts in its composition, the deadline for receiving them in the authorized bodies is comparable to the deadline for submitting applications, which leads to the impossibility of participating in such a procurement and a reduction in the number of participants in the procurement," reads the explanation to the bill.
The new bill provides for the establishment of an exhaustive list of documents that customers have the right to demand as part of an application from procurement participants who are small and medium-sized businesses.
"The adoption of the document will prevent customers from arbitrarily establishing requirements for the composition and content of applications by participants who are small and medium-sized businesses," the explanatory note reads.
As an artist, the relationship is very important to me.
In my works I try to show that people are inseparable from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I first visited Antarctica almost 10 years ago, where I saw icebergs.
I was in awe.
My heart beat faster, my head dizzy, trying to understand what had opened up in front of me.
The icebergs around me swam almost 200 feet out of the water, and I couldn't help but be surprised that it was one snowflake on top of another, year after year.
Icebergs are born when they break off glacier ice or break off ice shelves.
Each iceberg has its own personality.
Everyone interacts with the environment in their own way and accumulates their own experience.
Some refuse to give up and hold on to the bitter end, while others can no longer fight and die in a fit of intense passion.
Looking at the iceberg, it is easy to think that it is isolated, that it is closed and alone, just as we humans often see ourselves.
But things are very different in life.
When the iceberg melts, I breathe in its ancient atmosphere.
When the iceberg melts, it releases fresh, mineral-rich water that feeds many life forms.
I approach photographing these icebergs as creating portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these individual moments they exist in such a way, and that it will never happen again.
They don't die when they melt; it's not the end, but the continuation of their journey in the life cycle.
Sometimes the ice in the icebergs I photograph is very young - it is only a couple thousand years old.
And some icebergs are older than 100,000 years.
The last photos I want to show you are of an iceberg I photographed in Kirtartivatziak, Greenland.
It is a very rare occasion to see an iceberg spin.
So here it is.
On the left is a small boat.
It is approximately 4.5 metres long.
Please note the shape of the iceberg and where it comes into contact with water.
Here you can see how it starts to spin, and the boat swam to the other side, and there is a man standing there.
It is a medium-sized Greenland iceberg.
It protrudes from the water about 120 feet or 40 meters.
But this recording is in real time.
(Music) And just like that, the iceberg shows us the other side of his personality.
Thank you.
(Applause)
One winter morning a few years ago, I was driving to work in Johannesburg, South Africa, and noticed a fog looming over the city.
I drive there almost every day, so I wouldn't have noticed it before.
Johannesburg is known for its special horizons, which I could barely see that morning.
I soon realised it was a huge cloud of polluted air.
The contrast between my usual scenic environment and the smog-shrouded sky stirred something in me.
I was terrified that this city of colorful and picturesque sunsets would be swallowed up by the darkness.
At that moment, I had a strong desire to do something, but I did not know what.
What I knew was that I could not stand aside.
The main difficulty was that I was not very familiar with ecology, air quality management or atmospheric chemistry.
I am a computer engineer and I was sure I couldn't handle this problem with code.
(Laughter) Who am I to make a difference?
But I was a resident of this city.
In the years that followed, I learned one very important lesson - a lesson that needs to be taken seriously if we want a better future.
Even if you are not an expert in any field, your outside experience can be the key to solving complex problems in this area.
Sometimes your unique vision can turn into an extraordinary idea that will get things off the ground, but you have to be brave enough to try it.
This is the only way out.
Even then, I realised that in order to even try to make a difference, I would first have to deal with air pollution, so I became a student again.
At the very beginning of my research, I learned that air pollution is a major environmental hazard.
According to the World Health Organization, nearly 14 per cent of deaths worldwide in 2012 were caused by indoor air pollution and ambient air pollution, which is particularly prevalent in low- and middle-income countries.
Air pollution alone causes more deaths each year than malaria or HIV / AIDS.
In Africa, the number of premature deaths due to unsafe sanitation or malnutrition among children does not match the number of deaths due to air pollution, and it costs a huge economic cost: more than 400 billion as of 2013, according to a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
Now, in my work, I am exploring new possibilities in the field of artificial intelligence, where the symbiotic relationship between man and machine will help find a favorable basis for making the right decisions.
In the process of studying the problem of air pollution, it has become clear that we need to find a way to make better decisions to control air pollution, and given the magnitude of the problem, we need to do it together.
So I decided to meet people who work in this area.
I started to meet with officials from Johannesburg and other nearby cities, I also engaged the local scientific community, and also made some cold calls.
The networking process that I took on helped me gain a deeper understanding of the problem.
It also helped me avoid the trap that my colleagues often fall into when trying to innovate, when we quickly apply the technology before we clearly understand the problem.
I started thinking about what I could do to improve the situation.
I just started asking myself how I could effectively combine all my programming and artificial intelligence skills with the experiences of the people I met.
I wanted to create an online air quality management platform that would identify patterns in pollution, look to the future and determine what we should expect.
I was determined to put my idea into practice, but faced uncertainty, I had no guarantee of success.
I only had a certain set of engineering skills, skills that I had acquired in my profession (Laughter) and that people dealing with air pollution have not had for years.
I realized that sometimes just one fresh look, some new skills create the conditions for the emergence of something outstanding.
Willpower and imagination are our guiding light, giving us the ability to find new paths and overcome challenges.
Armed with a deep understanding of the problem of air pollution and having studied decades of information on pollutant concentrations and meteorological conditions in Johannesburg and beyond, my colleagues from South Africa and China and I have created a decision support system for air that is in the cloud.
The software system analyzes historical data and data in real time to identify spatial and temporal trends.
We then used new machine learning technology to predict pollution levels for different pollutants several days in advance.
This means that residents can make better decisions about their movements and the choice of residence for their families.
We will be able to predict pollution events in advance, and we will be able to identify those responsible for pollution, who will be forced to reduce their activities by order of the authorities.
With the help of scenario planning, urban planners will be able to make the right decisions in the development of infrastructure, such as residential settlements, industrial zones.
We have completed testing of our technology, which lasted about 120 days, covering the whole of South Africa.
The results were approved when we demonstrated a close relationship between the forecast data and the data we received on the ground.
Thanks to our leadership, we have created cutting-edge, groundbreaking technologies that will be able to predict air quality with unprecedented accuracy, improving a city that, not so long ago, I drove through one winter morning and thought: "Something is wrong here.
And here's my conclusion: what if I hadn't started to study the problem of air pollution then?
What if I didn't express concern about the state of the environment and just hoped that someone somewhere is already dealing with this problem?
That's what I've learned: when we embark on a complex venture that contributes to what we strongly believe in, it's important to focus on success and consider the consequences of inaction.
We must not lose our way in the face of obstacles and difficulties, and this should motivate us even more.
Wherever you are, when you realise that your natural curiosity is something that excites you and that's what you care about, and you have crazy and bold ideas, and maybe that's beyond your competence, ask yourself: why not?
Why not take action and solve the problem as you can in your own way?
And maybe you will be pleasantly surprised.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Republicans will offer another 1 trillion to support the U.S. economy
Republicans will propose spending another 1 trillion to support the United States economy, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin confirmed on Sunday, July 26, on Fox News.
"Within the 1 trillion package, there are the most priority and urgent things," the head of the U.S. Department of the Treasury noted.
The support package includes new direct payments to Americans.
The proposal should be adopted by Congress and signed by US President Donald Trump.
Representatives of the U.S. Democratic Party believe that the proposed funds are insufficient.
In the spring, the US allocated about 3 trillion to support the economy.
On April 24, Trump signed a bill on financial assistance to the American economy in the amount of almost half a trillion dollars to fight the coronavirus and its consequences.
According to analysts, US GDP in the second quarter of 2020 will fall by 25 in annual terms, which will be the strongest decline in the history of the country.
Microsoft will forcibly update older versions of Windows 10
Microsoft has confirmed the transition to the next stage of distribution of the May 2020 Update for the Windows 10 operating system, writes the BetaNews portal on July 25.
Package not needed: FAS has questioned the legality of Microsoft's anti-virus proposal
Having received software for remote work from an American corporation, government agencies may violate the law
The company will expand the range of users with the new version of the OS.
To do this, computers with older versions of the system are automatically updated.
It is assumed that the algorithm specially developed by the company will identify devices with older versions of the software platform, whose support period will soon end, and will automatically install Windows 10 May 2020 Update on them.
In the near future, this will affect computers with Windows 10 (1809) and Windows 10 (1903), whose support will expire on November 10 and December 8, respectively, the publication notes.
On July 21, it was reported that after the update to the Windows 10 operating system, users faced problems connecting to the Internet - there was no access to the network.
The difficulties were not related to the connection to the network itself, but to the status of the connection.
Dr Myasnikov named the main indicators of human health
In the "deadly quartet," one of the main criteria turned out to be excess of waist volume
Doctor and TV presenter Aleksandr Myasnikov spoke about key indicators that can be used to determine human health.
His so-called "death quartet" includes four criteria - an increase in blood pressure, cholesterol, sugar and waist volume, the doctor said on the air of the television channel Russia 1.
Butchers urged everyone to pay attention to these factors.
Moreover, according to him, controlling the volume of the waist is even more important than weight.
For men, this parameter should not exceed 102 centimeters, for women - 88 centimeters.
Exceeding these standards may indicate that health is at risk.
First of all, we are talking about the condition of the heart - the volume of the waist above normal is a risk factor for stroke, heart attack, as well as cancer and diabetes.
Earlier, Myasnikov explained why you can eat candy at night.
The doctor explained that sugar itself is not dangerous to health, dessert will only become harmful when there is such food in large quantities, and candy at night, according to him, is not the worst snack.
Igor Drive has determined the winners in Turing and Super Production
At the Igora Drive autodrome, where the main stage of the Russian series of circuit races takes place, the Touring and Super Production competitions have ended.
This was reported by Channel Five on Sunday, July 26.
The leaders in Turing were Kirill Ladygin, Dmitry Bragin, Aleksei Dudukalo, Pavel Kalmanovich, and Ivan Lukashevich.
Andrey Petukhov, Vladislav Nezvankin, Nikolai Vikhansky, Vadim Antipov, Dmitry Lebedev won the Super Production.
Rustam Fatkhutdinov was the best in the Trophy of the RSCG SMP, and the winners were Lev Tolkachev and Pavel Yashin.
The documentary, "John Lewis: Good Trouble," was released online.
The film-biography, which was supposed to be a kind of visual greeting to Congressman John Lewis, who celebrated his 80th birthday at the beginning of the year, became a full-fledged epitaph.
On July 17, the prominent human rights activist and politician passed away after a long battle with pancreatic cancer.
Numerous funeral events are taking place in the United States these days in memory of him.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows have pushed for legislation that focuses on several topics, including federal unemployment benefits, which expire on Friday.
It is proposed that the remaining issues be dealt with later.
Moderna Inc said on Sunday that it received an additional 472 million from the U.S. Office of Higher Life Sciences to develop a vaccine against the novel coronavirus.
The U.S.-based drug manufacturer explained that the additional funding is intended to help the company operate at an advanced stage of clinical trials.
Without any warning, the UK removed Spain from its list of safe countries for travel and imposed a two-week quarantine on anyone entering the country from Spain.
British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab did not apologize for the sudden decision, attributing it to the recent spike in the incidence of COVID-19 in Spain.
Protests
Protests have been held in a number of U.S. cities to draw attention to the issue of racial injustice.
In Seattle, police fired stun grenades and tear gas and arrested 45 people after demonstrations in support of protests in Portland turned violent.
Police said more than 20 police officers were injured.
In Austin, Texas, a man was killed Saturday when someone shot at a Black Lives Matter march.
According to media reports, the man may have approached the car with a rifle when he was shot.
US experts call Pompeo the worst secretary of state in the country's history
International affairs experts Aaron David Miller and Richard Sokolski have named Mike Pompeo the worst secretary of state in the history of the United States.
The article with their opinion was published by CNN on July 23.
"In just two short years, Mike Pompeo - with an eye on the presidency in 2024 and support for President Donald Trump - has become not only the worst secretary of state in U.S. history, but also the most politically biased," the text says.
Experts accused Pompeo of "politicizing the office of Secretary of State and desecrating the institution he runs" in order to advance his personal political agenda and protect Trump "from accountability and the rule of law."
According to them, the Secretary of State, in particular, is covering up "Trump's blackmail of Ukraine" and is ready to substitute employees of the American foreign policy department for their cooperation with Congress on this case.
In addition, Pompeo was reminded that he was pretty friendly with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who claimed partial responsibility for the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashqaji.
Trump announced the decision to appoint Mike Pompeo to head the State Department on March 13, 2018, following the dismissal of former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.
Prior to that, Pompeo headed the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
In Tikhoretsk, a foreign car drove into a store
Today, on July 26, in Tikhoretsk, on Menshikov Street, a Land Cruiser SUV drove at speed into the shopping area of a chain supermarket.
Surveillance cameras were recorded by the emergency.
As a result of the accident, a boy was injured, who was in the store at the time.
The child was hospitalized with injuries and cuts.
In the hall of the shopping facility, shop windows and counters were destroyed.
Eyewitnesses say the driver of the foreign car was intoxicated.
Do you know how many species of flowering plants exist?
A quarter of a million - at least those we know - a quarter of a million species of flowering plants.
Flowers are a real problem for plants:
they are hard to create,
they require huge amounts of energy and resources.
Why do plants go to such difficulties?
The answer to this, as well as many other questions, is sex.
I know what you are thinking about when you look at these pictures.
The reason sexual reproduction is so important is that there are many other ways of reproducing plants.
They can be propagated by cuttings; they can fertilize themselves or pollinate themselves.
But it is very important for them to spread their genes in order to mix them with the genes of other plants - so they can adapt to natural niches.
This is how evolution works.
Plants transmit genetic information through pollen.
Some of you may have seen some of these images before.
As I like to say, every home should have a raster electron microscope to look at these things.
There are as many different types of pollen as flowering plants.
By the way, this can be applied in criminology and beyond.
Basically, the pollen that causes the allergy is pollen from plants that use the wind to spread it, which is a very inefficient process, which is why it clogs so much into our noses.
Plants have to throw out huge amounts of pollen in the hope that the germ cells, the male germ cells that are contained in the pollen, will somehow accidentally get to another flower, completely by accident.
The pollen of all grasses, and therefore of all crops, and the pollen of most trees, is carried by the wind.
However, most species use insects for this. To some extent, this is more reasonable because less pollen is required.
Insects and other species can take pollen and transport it to where it is needed.
It is clear that we know the relationship between insects and plants.
It's a symbiotic relationship: whether it's flies, birds, or bees, they all get something in return, and it's something that is usually nectar.
In some cases, this symbiosis has led to amazing adaptations - for example, the hawk-moth hummingbird is beautiful in its adaptation.
The plant gets its way - the hawk moth spreads pollen elsewhere.
Plants have evolved to create small landing strips in different places for bees to keep them from getting lost.
Many plants have colours that make them look like insects.
These are lily anthers, cleverly made so that when an unsuspecting insect sits on them, the anther turns over and hits it on the back, showering it with plenty of pollen, with which the insect then travels to another plant.
But an orchid that looks like it has jaws. In a sense, it has them, which forces the insect to crawl out, covering itself with pollen, which it then spreads.
There are at least 20,000 species of orchids - and they are all amazingly diverse.
They go for a variety of tricks.
They are forced to attract pollinators to breed.
This orchid, known as Darwin's orchid, because it was he who studied it and made a startling prediction when he saw it.
You see the middle of the flower: the insect has to put the proboscis right in the middle and get to the bottom of the tube to get the nectar.
Darwin said, looking at the flower, "I guess something has evolved with it."
And indeed, here is the insect.
Usually his proboscis is rolled up, but in his straightened form he looks like this.
One might think that if nectar - so valuable and expensive to produce - attracts so much attention from pollinators, then, as with sex in humans, deception could begin.
A flower might say: "I have some nectar.
Will you look? "Here's a plant.
This is a plant adored by insects in South Africa, which, in the process of evolution, acquired a long proboscis to extract nectar from the bottom.
And this is an imitation.
This plant imitates the previous one.
And here's the long-tailed fly, which didn't get a drop of nectar from the counterfeit. Because the imitating plant didn't give her anything.
But not only did the fly not get the nectar from the counterfeit plant, but - to put it closer - in the area of the lower part of the head, it grabbed some pollen, which it will transfer to another plant, unless some botanist appears and pins it on a blue cardboard.
(Laughter) Deception is spreading in the plant kingdom.
This flower has black dots: they seem black to us, but for male insects of a certain species, they look like two females ready for anything.
(Laughter) When an insect reaches this flower and lands on it, it dips itself in pollen, which, of course, will transfer to another plant. If you look at the same raster electron microscope that every house should have, you can see here a certain three-dimensional layout of the pattern.
So it probably even brings pleasant feelings to the insect, except that it looks attractive.
The image from the electron microscope - an orchid that imitates an insect - shows that different parts of this structure have different colors and textures, but insects can perceive them in a completely different way.
This plant has adapted to imitate the shiny metallic surface of the body of some beetles.
Under the raster electron microscope, it can be seen that the surface is very different from the surfaces we looked at.
Sometimes the whole plant imitates an insect, even from our point of view.
I think it looks like some kind of flying creature.
It is a striking, amazing flower.
And clever. It's called obsidian.
I call it chitrodian.
For a certain species of bee, it resembles another very aggressive bee, and it flies up and hits its head many times to drive away the "bee," and of course is covered with pollen.
This plant also mimics another orchid that has a wonderful store of insect food.
And this one has nothing for them.
So she is cheating on two levels - just unheard of.
(Laughter) Here is ylang-ylang, a component of many perfumes.
I recently smelled someone who strangled them.
In principle, flowers do not need to be so fragrant.
They emit a striking range of odors for any insects with a sense of smell.
But it does not smell so good.
It is a flower that smells very, very bad and has evolved to look like a carrion.
The flies really like it.
They fly in and pollinate.
Here is this one, helicodiceros, also known as the "dead horse lily."
I don't know how a dead horse really smells, but this one definitely smells very similar.
It's really awful.
And meat flies simply cannot resist.
They fly inside and reach the bottom.
There they lay eggs, thinking it's a great piece of falling and not realizing there is no food for the larvae and the larvae will die, but in the meantime the plant has benefited because the bristles relax and the fly flies away to pollinate the next flower.
Here is an arum, an arum maculatum, or in the United States, an aronnik is spotted.
I photographed him the previous week in Dorset.
It heats up about 15 degrees above ambient temperature - amazing.
If you look at it from above, you can see something that looks like a dam behind the cob. The flies are attracted by the heat - evaporation of volatile compounds - and they get stuck in the bottom of the container.
They drink divine nectar and become sticky.
Overnight, they are covered with pollen flowing around them from above, and then the bristles we saw above loosen and release the pollen-covered flies.
If you think it's amazing, then here is one of my favorites.
Philodendron Sello.
Those from Brazil should know about this plant.
This is the most striking thing.
This phallic thing is about 30 centimetres long.
It does something that no other plant I know does: when it blooms - here in the middle of the cob - for about two days, its metabolism is similar to that of mammals.
Instead of starch, which is food for plants, it takes something similar to brown fat and burns it at such a speed, digests it in the same way as a small-sized cat.
This energy return, in equivalent weight, is twice as high as that of a hummingbird - quite astounding.
And it also does something else, also unusual.
Not only does it warm itself up to 115 Fahrenheit, or 43-44 Celsius, for two days, but it also keeps the temperature constant.
It has a thermoregulation mechanism that maintains a constant temperature.
You ask, "Why does he do this?"
Well, as if you didn't know that there are beetles that just love making love at this temperature.
They get inside, and there it starts.
(Laughter) And the plant showers them with pollen, and they go to pollinate.
Surprisingly invented.
Most of the pollinators we know are insects, but in the tropics, many birds and butterflies also pollinate.
Many tropical flowers are red, and it seems to us that this is because butterflies and birds have a similar vision to ours, and that they see red very well.
But if you look at the spectrum, man and bird see red, green and blue - they see the spectrum.
Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet light, and they distinguish between different shades of ultraviolet light,
which are at this end of the spectrum.
You probably think, "It would be great if we could see them."
Yes, we can.
So what does the insect see?
Last week I took these photos of the sunflower, the frankincense family, in Dorset.
These are the very small yellow flowers that we see everywhere.
This is how it looks in daylight.
But this is how it looks, if you remove the red.
Most bees do not see red.
Then I put ultraviolet filters on the camera and did a very, very long exposure with certain ultraviolet frequencies, and that's what happened.
Most of all, there is a "bullseye."
Of course, we know exactly what the bees see, no more than you know what I see when I call it red.
We can't say what's going on in the mind of a neighbor, we don't talk about an insect.
But the picture will be about the same contrast, which stands out strongly in the background.
Here is another small flower - a different range of ultraviolet frequencies, different filters, to match pollinators.
They will see something like this.
In case you think this applies to all the yellow flowers - not a single flower was hurt during the shooting, this one was just attached to a tripod and not ripped off - when they are in ultraviolet light, then take a look at this one.
By the way, it could serve as the basis for sunscreen, because such creams work by absorbing ultraviolet light.
Maybe this compound would be useful.
Finally, here is one of the enothers that Bjorn Rorslett from Norway sent me - a fantastic hidden pattern.
I like the idea of something hidden.
These photos were taken with an ultraviolet filter, which is mostly used by astronomers to capture Venus - actually the clouds of Venus.
This is the main purpose of this filter.
Venus, of course, is the goddess of love and fertility, and this is in consonance with flowers.
Not only do flowers put a lot of effort into attracting pollinators, they also somehow managed to convince us to plant whole fields of flowers and give them to each other at the moments of birth and death, and in particular at the wedding, which, if you think, is the moment that epitomizes the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another.
Many thanks.

In China, the third flood in a year occurred on the Yangtze River
After heavy rainfall in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, the longest waterway in China, flooding occurred for the third time in a year.
The flooding was caused by a rise in the water level in the tributaries of the river upstream, which led to a rapid increase in the flow of water into the reservoir of China's Sanxia hydroelectric power station (Three Gorges).
At 14: 00 on July 26, an inflow of 50 thousand cubic meters per second was observed in the reservoir, which is expected to reach its maximum of 60 thousand cubic meters per second in the evening of July 27, the Committee for Water Management of the Yangtze River under the Ministry of Water Management of China reported.
The committee today issued alerts about flooding in one section of the upper Yangtze River and overflowing of the Sanxia Hydroelectric Power Plant reservoir.
My job is to help computers communicate about the world around them.
There are many ways to do this, but I like to help computers talk about what they see and understand.
For example, in this picture, a modern computer vision algorithm can recognize that this is a woman and this is a dog.
He can say the woman is smiling.
He is even able to say that the dog is unusually sweet.
I work on this by thinking about how people understand and process data about the world.
What thoughts, memories and stories such a picture can awaken in people.
Everything that is connected with such situations.
You may have seen a similar dog before or spent time running along the beach as well, and this in turn evokes thoughts and memories of a past vacation, of time spent on the beach, or of a time when you were running somewhere with other dogs.
One of my main principles is to help computers understand what it means to have this kind of experience, to understand what we share, what we believe and what we feel, because then we will be ready to start involving computer technology in processes that complement our own experience.
To dig deeper, a few years ago I started helping computers write stories based on a series of images.
And one day, while working, I asked the computer what he thought about going to Australia.
He looked at the pictures and saw the koala.
He did not know what a koala was, but said he considered it a curious creature.
Then I shared with him a series of images about burning houses.
He looked at the pictures and said: "Amazing view Awesome"
Goosebumps ran down my back.
He looked at the horrible, life-destroying event and thought it was something positive.
I realized that he recognized the contrasts, the shades of red and yellow, and thought it deserved a positive assessment.
In part he did it because most of the images I gave him were positive.
Because people tend to share positive images when they talk about their experiences.
When was the last time you saw a selfie at a funeral?
I realized that by perfecting artificial intelligence, task by task, data by array, I had created huge gaps, holes and gaps in what he could understand.
And in doing so, I have encoded every possible kind of prejudice.
Gaps that reflect human biases encoded in the data, such as bias and stereotypes.
I thought about the evolution of technology that led me to where I was then - how the first color photos were calibrated by the skin of white women, which meant the color photos were not adapted to dark faces.
And the same prejudice, the same gap, was observed in the 1990s.
And the same information gap we still have today is how well we can recognize a variety of human faces using facial recognition technology.
I was thinking about the latest research, where we tend to limit our thinking to one set of data and one problem.
And by doing so, we were creating more gaps and biases that AI could develop even more.
I realized that we needed to think more about how the technologies we are working with today will look like in 5 and 10 years.
Humanity is evolving slowly, over time correcting problems in the interaction between humans and the environment.
Artificial intelligence, by contrast, is evolving at an incredible rate.
And that means it's really important to think carefully about it right now - to reflect on our own gaps, our own prejudices, and how it affects the technologies we create, and to discuss what modern technologies will mean in the future.
Top managers and scientists around the world are talking about what they think artificial intelligence will be like in the future.
Stephen Hawking warns: "AI can end humanity."
Elon Musk warns that this is one of the greatest existential risks our civilization has ever faced.
Bill Gates is perplexed: "I don't understand why people are not concerned."
But these opinions are only part of the story.
Mathematics, models, and the fundamental building blocks of artificial intelligence are what we call access and what we work with.
We have open source tools for machine learning and intelligence that we are willing to share.
And beyond that, we can share our experiences.
Share your knowledge about technology and how we are concerned about it and how we are concerned about it.
We can discuss what we love.
We can anticipate which aspects of technology may become the most useful and which the most problematic over time.
If we all focus on an open dialogue about AI for the future, it will help create an atmosphere of shared awareness of what AI is now, what it can become, and what we need to do to get the most appropriate outcome for us.
We already see and know all this about the technologies used today.
We use smartphones, digital assistants and robot vacuum cleaners.
Are they evil?
Maybe sometimes.
Are they useful?
Absolutely.
And they are all different.
And in them you already see a beam of light illuminating our future.
The future begins with what we are creating and building right now.
We are launching a domino effect that will determine the path of AI development.
Right now, we are shaping the AI of the future.
Technologies that immerse us in augmented realities are bringing past worlds back to life.
Technologies that help people share experiences when they have difficulty communicating.
Technologies based on understanding streaming visual worlds are being used for unmanned vehicles.
Technologies based on image understanding and language generation are evolving into technologies that help visually impaired people better access the visual world.
But we also see how technology can lead to problems.
Today, we have technologies that analyze our innate physical characteristics - such as skin color or facial features - to determine whether we can be criminals or terrorists.
We have technology that analyzes data about us, even data such as gender or race, to determine whether we can get a loan.
All we see now is just one shot from the evolution of artificial intelligence.
Because where we are now is just a moment in this evolution.
This means that everything we do today will have an impact on our future.
If we want AI to evolve to help people, we need to define the goals and strategies that will set that path now.
I would like to see something that fits well with people, blends with our culture and environment.
Technologies that help those of us who suffer from neurological or other diseases to make life equally difficult for everyone.
Technologies that work regardless of your skin color or demographic characteristics.
Today, I am focused on the technologies that will be with us tomorrow and in 10 years.
AI can become anything.
But in this case, it is not a self-driving machine with no final destination.
We control this machine.
We choose when to accelerate and when to slow down.
We choose when we need to turn.
We choose what the AI of the future will be like.
There are countless things that artificial intelligence can become.
And it will become a lot of things.
And our task today is to find out exactly what we need to invest in AI so that the results obtained become the best for all of us.
Thank you
(Applause)
Almost 9,500 cases of CoViD-19 infection have been recorded in the Arctic

In total, the total number of confirmed cases of the new coronavirus infection in the region is 9,469.
The head of Dagestan discussed with Khabib Nurmagomedov the construction of several sports facilities.
The head of Dagestan Vladimir Vasilyev held a meeting with the current UFC lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov, the website of the head of the republic reports.
The reason was the sports facilities, in the construction of which the late father of the champion, the honored coach of Russia, Abdulmanap Nurmagomedov, showed great interest.
We are talking about a sports complex in the village of Dubki, Kazbekovo district, and the Centre for Martial Arts Training in the village of Sildi, Tsumadinsky district.
First of all, Vladimir Vasilyev noted that now the construction of these sports facilities is also a tribute to the memory of the great coach.
The father of the baby kidnapped in Salsk revealed details of the incident
The father of the newborn, who was abducted from a maternity hospital in Salsk, Rostov region, revealed the details of the incident.
Aleksandr Rusikov told the 360 television channel that the kidnapper had entered his wife's room when she was about to go to the toilet.
The mother of the kidnapped baby could not have thought that a person with malicious intent could be in the maternity hospital.
The woman walked away from the room just a couple of meters when she heard a neighbor scream.
The baby was no longer in the room.
According to Rusikov, everything happened between three and four in the morning.
He also said that the wife's room is located between two medical posts, but at the time of the incident, there were no nurses on site.
Also, the father of the kidnapped baby said that there were no comments or apologies from the hospital staff.
Recall that the newborn boy, who was abducted on Saturday from a maternity hospital in Salsk, was found on the same day in the Republic of Kalmykia.
Police detained a 40-year-old suspect in the kidnapping.
The child has already been returned to her mother.
Doctors took tests from the baby to make sure he was healthy and not hurt.

The accident occurred at 12: 25 local time (13: 25 Moscow time) in the area of the Glecherspitz mountain peak in the municipality of Blatten.
According to law enforcement officials, the victims of the crash were two Swiss men aged 66 and 50, as well as two Austrians aged 50 and 46.
Their names and details are not disclosed.
Earlier in the day, a small plane crashed into an apartment building in the German city of Wesel.
Three people died.
Expert assessed the role of vitamins in the formation of immunity
Chief freelance specialist in primary health care for adults at the Moscow Department of Healthcare, Andrei Tyazhelnikov, assessed the role of vitamins in the formation of immunity.
"It is impossible to create a stable immune system in a very short period of time with the extradoses of some drugs, vitamins or foodstuffs," he said in an interview with the radio station "Govorit Moskva."
According to him, there are certain rules.
For example, in summer it is better to spend more time outdoors, including under the sun.
He also noted that in the summer, if possible, it is necessary to consume a large amount of seasonal fresh vegetables and fruits.
"It generally strengthens immunity, provides a certain supply of vitamins and a certain supply of health," he added.
Earlier, Tyazhelnikov named several differences between influenza and coronavirus.
In Russia, 5,765 COVID-19 patients were registered per day
In Russia, 5,765 new cases of coronavirus infection were detected over the course of a day by July 26, according to the website stopcoronavirus.rf, according to data from the Federal Operational Headquarters.
Over the entire period of observation, 812,485 cases of COVID-19 have been recorded in Russia.
Over the course of a day, 77 people with confirmed coronavirus died, and the total number of COVID-19-related deaths in Russia reached 13,269.
The number of COVID-19 cases in the world has exceeded 16 million, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
More than 4.1 million of them are in the United States, and more than 2.3 million are in Brazil.
Russia ranks fourth in the world in terms of the total number of cases, and third behind India (1.3 million cases).
In total, more than 644,000 people have died from the coronavirus worldwide, and more than 9.2 million have recovered.
The head of the region, Igor Kobzev, met with the mayors of the Ust-Orda Buryat district
During the workshop, which took place today, July 24, the government of Irkutsk region discussed the main directions for the development of remote agricultural areas.
During working visits to the districts of the Ust-Orda Buryat District, the head of the region gave a number of instructions.
Today, the mayors reported on their performance.
First of all, the construction of the Sports House in Ust-Orda has been resumed.
The instruction for this facility was given by the President of the Russian Federation fourteen years ago.
But only now has the situation been broken.
866 million rubles will be spent on construction.
The completion date for the construction is 2022.
And already this year, a school in the village of Bayandai should be put into operation.
At the moment, the finishing of the premises has been completed.
Of the remaining work - landscaping.
In general, the programme for the construction of preschool and secondary education facilities is of particular importance for the region.
For your district in particular.
The demographic situation here is the best in the region.
And we are obliged to create all conditions for the education and leisure of children of all ages, said the acting Governor of Irkutsk Region, Igor Kobzev.
At the meeting, the head of the region instructed all mayors to actively engage in the work on the development of master plans for human settlements.
This is one of the main conditions for the comprehensive development of the district.
All settlements must have established boundaries and a master plan.
This is necessary for the development of the territory, for the construction of socially significant facilities, as well as infrastructure and cultural heritage, the head of the region stressed.
Also, during the conversation, a problematic issue was raised with the reduction of milk intake from cooperatives by 30.
This was due to the redistribution by the processing company of the purchase of milk in favor of peasant farms.
Because of this, the share of production intake from cooperatives has declined.
The head of the region instructed the acting minister of agriculture to visit the site, study the structure of milk sales, analyze the experience of other territories and identify options for solving the problem.
Kuzminov won two races of the second stage of the SMP RSKG at Igora Drive.
The second race of the second stage of the RSCG SMP championship took place at Igora Drive.
Pavel Kuzminov won his second consecutive victory.
He started fifth, but was already in the lead on the first lap.
Alexander Dudarev, who became second, rose from sixth position.
Sergei Tikhomirov lost his position, repulsed the attacks of Alexander Chernyak and first consolidated in third place, but received a drive-through penalty and, after driving through the pitlane, dropped out of the fight for the podium.
The third was Ivan Pugachev, who played five positions.
Moscow region authorities told about the fate of closed landfills
In the Moscow region, solid waste landfills continue to be closed.
This year, the authorities promise to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 existing landfills in the region are being upgraded into modern waste processing facilities.
But this option is not possible for every landfill - many of them are overgrown with dense residential development.
After the landfill is closed, it is reclaimed - the body of the landfill is filled with soil, degassing and infiltration removal systems are installed.
This makes it possible to stop chemical processes inside the landfill, so that it does not ignite, emit stench, or poison the soil and groundwater.
And then the former landfill is left to rise in a useless heap among the residential buildings surrounding it.
Why not make it something useful?
For example, in Ruza, where the recultivation of the Annino landfill was just recently completed, the authorities are considering the option of making a ski slope out of a pile.
The landfill, which operated from 1976 to 2016, has grown beyond the boundaries of the land allocated to it.
Therefore, during recultivation, it was necessary to buy out the neighboring areas, which, in fact, have long been clogged with garbage to the eyeballs.
"Some time will pass, the site will" settle down, "and we will think about what can be done to make it useful.
It is a ski resort that catches the eye, "the head of the Ruz district, Nikolai Parfyonov, told journalists.
Two landfills will become sites for the production of renewable energy sources
The Torbeevo landfills in Lyubertsy and Timokhovo in Bogorodsky District will become sites for the production of renewable energy sources from landfill and biological gases.
By the end of the year, a gas piston power plant capable of generating up to 8 million kilowatt-hours of electricity and about 0.95 gigacalories of thermal energy per year will be launched on the territory of Torbeev, which will provide the landfill with its own needs - heat supply for administrative and industrial premises.
Timokhovo will produce 72.5 million kilowatt-hours and will continue to operate as a waste treatment facility.
And a museum could be created at the Balashikha Kuchino training ground, which was closed after residents complained about the "direct line" with the president of the country.
"There was such an idea - to create a museum of recultivation of landfills in the Moscow region," said Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Ecology and Natural Resources of the region Dmitry Kurakin.
Israel reports drone crash in southern Lebanon
An Israeli army unmanned aerial vehicle crashed in southern Lebanon.
The military said it collapsed "during operational activity."
The causes of the crash were not reported.
"Some time ago, during operational activities near the border with Lebanon, an unmanned aerial vehicle of the Israeli army fell on Lebanese territory.
There is no risk of information leakage, "the Israeli army said on Twitter.
Recall that this week the Israeli army decided to reinforce its military units on the border with Lebanon, fearing retaliation by the Lebanese Hezbollah movement for the killing of its fighters in Syria.
The leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, promised not to let the death of any of his "brothers" go unanswered.
For more information on the situation, see Kommersant's article: "Israel is waiting for Hezbollah's revenge."
Furgal's replacement first came out to the protesters
The acting governor of Khabarovsk Krai, Mikhail Degtyarev, for the first time since his appointment, took part in protests in support of the arrested former head of the region, Sergei Furgal.
The meeting was broadcast on his Instagram page.
"Moscow is listening to everyone, so it has sent you an interim so that the region does not slide without power... I repeat about Furgal once again: he is my comrade, he is a fellow party member, and I am very worried about his fate, the party is helping him, giving him food, and Zhirinovsky is knocking on all offices," the acting governor said.
According to Degtyarev, now the Khabarovsk Territory cannot remain without a leader, so he was appointed to the post of head of the region by decree of President Vladimir Putin, so that "the wonderful building (the regional government) functions, everything works, the budget is spent on social needs."
The acting governor explained that he had not gone to the protesters before because he could not communicate with thousands of demonstrators.
That is why he broadcasts on social media and reads all the comments on them.
On July 25, two consecutive protests took place in Khabarovsk.
Rallies in support of the former governor have been held in the region since July 11.
On the eve of the next rally, Mikhail Degtyarev announced that he would leave the city on the day of the rally.
His motorcade was stopped by protesters and urged to speak out about the fate of the arrested former governor of Furgal.
Degtyarev had previously refused to come out to the protesters.
"There's a lot to do for the executive, something to go out and talk to those who are shouting under the windows," the acting governor said.
Today I would like to show you how we will do different things in the future.
I believe that soon our buildings and machines will be self-assembling, will reproduce and repair themselves.
So, I'm going to show you what I think is the current stage of industrial development, and then compare it to some natural systems.
So, at the current stage of industrial development, we have skyscrapers - 2.5 years, from 500,000 to a million parts, quite sophisticated, new and amazing technologies in steel, concrete and glass.
We have amazing machines that can take us into space - 5 years, 2.5 million pieces.
But on the other hand, if we look at natural systems, we see proteins of two million species that can be collected in 10,000 nanoseconds, or a DNA chain with three billion base pairs that we can copy in about an hour.
So, natural systems, in all their complexity, are extremely efficient, far more efficient than anything we can build, far more complex than anything we can build.
They are much more energy efficient.
They are almost never wrong.
And they can regenerate themselves over a long life.
So there is something very interesting about natural systems.
And if we can bring that into our man-made environment, our way of creating things will have tremendous potential.
And I think the key is self-assembly.
So, if we want to use self-assembly in our physical environment, I think there are four key factors to consider.
First, we need to decipher the complexity of what we want to build - our buildings and machines.
And we need to break them down into a simple sequence - the basic DNA of construction processes.
Then we need programmable parts that can understand this sequence and use it to curl up or reconfigure.
We will need a certain amount of energy that will allow us to activate all of this, make the parts able to assemble according to the program.
And we need some kind of back-up error correction system to ensure the successful construction of what we want.
I'm going to show you some of the projects we're working on with our colleagues at MIT to achieve this self-assembling future.
The first two are MacroBot and DeciBot.
These are projects - large-scale reconfigurable robots - 2.5 and 3.5 meter proteins.
Mechanical electrical devices and sensors are built into them.
You paint what you need to curl up into a sequence of angles - minus 120, minus 120, 0, 0, 120, minus 120 - something like that; a sequence of angles or turns, and you send that sequence over the cord.
Each block receives its own message - minus 120. It turns to this corner, checks if everything is correct and passes the information to the neighbor.
And these are the brilliant scientists, engineers, designers who worked on this project.
And I think it really raises the question: is there a possibility of a different scale here?
I mean, thousands of dollars, lots of man-hours to make this 2.5 meter robot.
Will we really be able to scale up? Will we really be able to integrate robotics into every part?
The next project addresses this issue, looks at the passive nature, or tries to get modification programmability passively.
But he goes one step further and tries to get a real calculation.
Basically, it has the most fundamental building block of computing, the logical element of a digital integrated circuit directly in each part.
This is the "AND-NOT" element.
You have one tetrahedron - the element that will do all the calculations, and two tetrahedrons for input.
One for user input, this is the way you put bricks.
Another is for information from previous laid bricks.
And then it displays information in three-dimensional space.
So, this means that the user can start moving the bricks in the right direction.
His calculations are based on what was done before and what you told him to do.
And now it starts to move in three-dimensional space - up or down.
On the left side, the 1,1 input equals 0 at the output, moving down.
On the right side, the 0,0 input is 1 at the exit, which means moving upwards.
And what really matters is that our structures now contain blueprints of what we want to build.
They contain all the information about what was built.
So, it means that we have some form of self-reproduction.
In this case, I call it self-directed reproduction, because the structures contain clear blueprints.
If errors appear, you can replace the part.
All local information is stored so you know how to correct it.
So you can have something that moves and reads information and can pass it from one part to another.
It is built directly inside, without external control.
The latest project I'll show you is called Offset Chains, and this is perhaps the most exciting example of what we have now of passive self-assembling systems.
It combines reconfiguration and programming capabilities and creates a completely passive system.
Basically, we have a chain of elements.
All elements are completely identical and biased.
So every chain or every element wants to turn right or left.
And when you build a chain, you essentially program it.
You tell each block where it should turn: right or left.
So when you shake the chain, it folds into the configuration you have programmed - in this case, into a spiral, or in this case, two cubes next to each other.
So, in general, you can program any three-dimensional form - or one-dimensional, two-dimensional - from these absolutely passive circuits.
So what does this tell us about the future?
I think it tells us that there are new possibilities for self-assembly, replication, repair in our physical structures, buildings, machines.
New programming is possible in these parts.
And from here, you have new possibilities in computing.
We will have spatial computers.
Imagine that our buildings, bridges, cars, all our bricks could make calculations.
This is an amazing parallel and distributed computing power, new design possibilities.
This is an incredible potential.
I think the projects that I have shown you are only a small step towards the future, if we introduce these new technologies, towards a new self-assembling future.
Thank you.
(Applause)

The number of deaths from coronavirus in the world exceeds 640,000
More than 15.7 million people are infected
The number of coronavirus victims in the world has exceeded 640,000, and almost 15.7 million cases of infection have been confirmed.
The World Health Organization (WHO) cited such data on Sunday, July 26.
According to the information provided, over the past 24 hours, 200,625 new cases of coronavirus infection and 4,823 deaths were detected in the world.
Over the entire period of the pandemic, 15,785,641 cases of coronavirus infection have already been recorded in the world, and the number of deaths has risen to 640,016.
The United States remains the leader in terms of the number of infected and dead, with more than 4.3 million people infected and more than 149,000 deaths.
In second place in the anti-rating is Brazil, where the number of cases has now exceeded 2.4 million, and 86,500 patients with coronavirus have already died.
Next comes India, with 1.4 million infected and almost 33,000 dead.
Recall that a day earlier, the number of people infected with coronavirus in the world during the day broke a new record.
In 24 hours, doctors identified 284,196 new cases.
The previous record was 247,225 people infected.
what linked the Vatican and Nazi Germany
This week, another date is the 87th anniversary of the signing of the treaty between the Vatican and Nazi Germany.
The document, signed a few months after Hitler came to power, became the basis on which relations between the Holy See and the fascists were built.
One of those who prepared the treaty was Cardinal Pacelli, who, six years before the outbreak of the Second World War, became pontiff Pius II.
In Sochi, a dump truck body collapsed onto a truck's cabin, killing the driver.
Footage of an accident that occurred last Saturday, July 25, at a construction site in Sochi has appeared online.
The recording shows how, during unloading operations, the raised body of the dump truck collapsed down, hitting directly into the truck's cabin.
According to the Emergencies Ministry, the 59-year-old man, who was driving, died on the spot from his injuries.
Rescuers were needed to retrieve the body of the deceased.
Beautiful high minarets only decorated Ayia Sofia
Once again, about Hagia Sophia, there was a text by Fr. Vladimir elinsky, which, they say, should be protested.
First of all, there was a free entrance - cheers
I haven't been to Istanbul, but free admission to the House of God is better than a paid one.
Secondly, the Muslims have just as honestly conquered this land as the Orthodox have conquered the Volga-Oka region, the Muslim Caucasus (and set up a church in Grozny) and planted apple trees on Mars.
God is to help
Jews conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans conquered America.
Will we return everything to everyone?
Do you think there will be no pagans who will demand the return of their temple, in the place of which the Tithe Church?
Thirdly, the Muslims improved the building and invested in it.
That is, it belongs to the Leninists - Putin and other nomenklatura - just like the factories and estates that the Leninists took from the bourgeoisie as their property.
They have improved everything - from the Kremlin to Angara, so it's all their rightful progressors.
The beautiful tall minarets decorated Ayia Sofia very much, very much.
There was a silly inkwell, there was a silly inkwell with beautiful minarets.
Fourth, there are no "Islamic" or "Orthodox" civilizations.
There are believers, there are hypocrites, there are hypocrites who combine faith and hypocrisy.
The believer does not think in terms of civilization.
This is the mindset of British Foreign Office official Toynbee, who is ashamed to think like this.
And there is a place of prayer for believers everywhere.
And always.
The believer does not pray only where he is asked to leave - he leaves for another place and prays there.
He is a believer, not a defender.
We are koloboks, not sullen stones.
The working week in Saint Petersburg will begin with warm and dry weather
On Monday, July 27, it will be cloudy in Saint Petersburg, with no precipitation expected.
This was reported by the press service of the State Department of the Ministry of Emergency Situations in the city, citing the forecast of the North-West Directorate for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring.
At night, an alternating wind of 1-4 meters per second is expected.
In the afternoon, a south-easterly wind at a speed of 2-7 meters per second.
The air temperature at night will be 13... 15 degrees.
In the afternoon, it will warm up to 24... 26 degrees.
Atmospheric pressure will rise during the day.
During the broadcast of the parade on Navy Day, the camera "passed under the ship"
Also on Victory Day, the camera flew through the barrel of a tank
Today, on July 26, a parade is being held in Saint Petersburg in honor of Navy Day.
During filming, one of the cameras filming the equipment "passed under the ship."
The use of new shooting technology allowed viewers to see the underwater part of the parade.
In the same perspective, the progress of the newest production small missile ship, Sovetsk, was shown.
It passed along the Admiralty Embankment.
Recall that at the parade on June 24, dedicated to the 75th anniversary of Victory, the camera passed through the barrel into the tower of one of the tanks and showed what equipment is inside the grandiose military machine.
At that time, a record amount of military equipment - 234 combat vehicles - took part in the anniversary Victory Parade.
They showed a lot of new products that went to the main square of the country for the first time, for example, the modernized main battle tanks T-90M and T-80BVM.
On June 24, the updated BMP-2M infantry fighting vehicles with the Berezhok combat module also passed through Red Square for the first time.
Almost half of Britons believe in Kremlin interference in Brexit referendum
Almost half of Britons - 49 - believe that Russia tried to influence the course of the 2016 referendum on Britain's exit from the European Union.
The Guardian newspaper writes about this, citing the results of a survey conducted by Opinium.
It is reported that 23 of those surveyed hold the opposite opinion on this issue.
47 of respondents also believe that the Kremlin also interfered in the last general election in the UK in 2019.
July will leave with heat, August will start with coolness
Over the weekend, Moscow and the region experienced the coldest night of July.
Of course, there was no freezing apocalypse in the body and soul.
But for the top of the summer - chilly.
Before you talk about the weather in Moscow from July 27 to August 2, 2020, it is worth noting that on the night of Saturday, July 25, the air cooled to 8.8 degrees in the capital.
In Kolomna, a new temperature record has even been set: 7 degrees (the previous minimum for July 25 was held since 1964, more than half a century).
The cold pole near Moscow was Cherusti, where the thermometers showed 3.9 degrees.
However, during the day and on Saturday and Sunday it was quite comfortable.
Although, in comparison with climate norms, it is still 2 to 3 degrees cooler.
On weekdays, not just warmth, but real heat will return to Moscow.
On Monday, July 27, the Russian Hydrometeorological Center promises 26 degrees, on Tuesday and Wednesday 28... 29, and on Thursday, July 30, 26 degrees.
Short rains - every day, in the middle of the week with thunderstorms.
The last day of July and the first days of August (i.e. the next weekend) will be cool, not above 19... 24 degrees.
And it will not do without rainfall.
The native of Rwanda admitted that he set fire to the cathedral in Nantes
A native of Rwanda, who worked at the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul in the French city of Nantes on a voluntary basis, confessed to his arson a week after the fire.
This was reported on Sunday by the France-3 television channel.
According to him, the man, who was already detained on July 19, the day after the fire, was detained again the day before.
He appeared before an investigating judge on Saturday night.
After being charged with intentional damage to property, the man admitted that he had organized the arson attacks in three places - under a large organ, under a small organ and near an electric panel.
Now he faces up to 10 years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros.
The motives for the actions of the 39-year-old native of Rwanda have not yet been disclosed.
It is only known that he volunteered to help in the cathedral and had to close its doors on the day of the fire.
However, according to CCTV footage, he left the religious institution 15 minutes after receiving calls about a fire in the building.
The fire in the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul occurred on July 18.
More than 200 firefighters fought for several hours for a monument of Gothic architecture.
However, they were unable to save the stained glass windows of the Louis II era and the unique organ of the Baroque era.
The situation was brought under control only three hours after the start of the fire.
No one was injured in the incident.
The current fire is not the first in the history of the church.
In 1972, a fire destroyed its roof.
It took 13 years to clean up the consequences of that fire.
The cathedral was only reopened for parishioners in 1985.
The legendary goalkeeper-traveler Pfannenstiel could become a scout for Inter.
Former German goalkeeper Lutz Pfannenstiel may enter the headquarters of Inter.
According to Kicker, the 47-year-old specialist was offered the position of head of the scouting department.
Pfannenstiel held a similar position at Fortuna Dsseldorf from December 2018 to May 2020, and previously worked at Hoffenheim.
When he was a footballer, Pfannenstiel became famous for his frequent crossings.
He is the only professional player to have competed in all six FIFA confederations, having replaced more than 20 clubs, including representatives of the championships of Singapore, South Africa, New ealand, Canada, Namibia and a number of other countries.
It is believed that only sighted people can drive a car.
Until recently, it was believed that safe and independent driving was an impossible task for a blind person.
Hello, I am Denis Hong, and we are giving the blind freedom and independence by developing cars for the visually impaired.
Before talking about this car for the blind, I will briefly talk about another project I have been working on, called DARPA Urban Challenge.
The project was to create a self-driving robot car.
The driver presses "start," and without his participation the car reaches its destination.
In 2007, our team won half a million dollars, finishing third in this competition.
Around the same time, the National Federation of the Blind, or NFB, tasked a research committee with developing a car that could be operated independently and safely by a blind person.
We decided to try our hand at it because we thought, "Hey, what's the hard part of it?
We already have an autonomous car.
Let's put a blind man in it - and the case is over, right? "
(Laughter) But we were deeply mistaken.
The NFS wanted not just a car that would transport the blind, but a car that the blind could drive on their own.
So we had to scrap everything and start from scratch.
So, to test this crazy idea, we developed a small prototype of a buggy car to test the feasibility of the project.
And in the summer of 2009, we invited blind young people from all over the country and gave them the opportunity to test this car.
It was an amazing experience.
But the catch is that the car was designed to operate in a strictly controlled environment, namely in a flat, enclosed car park, where even traffic lanes are restricted by red signal cones.
Due to this success, we decided to take the next big step and develop a real car that could be driven on real roads.
So, how does it work?
Well, it's a pretty complicated system, but let me explain, maybe even simplify it.
So, it has three components.
This is tactile perception, calculation and non-visual interfaces.
Since the driver does not see anything, the system must perceive the environment and collect information for the driver.
For this purpose, an initial parameter meter is used.
It measures acceleration, angular acceleration, like the inner ear of a person.
This information is then transmitted to a GPS device to assess the location of the vehicle.
Two cameras are used to detect lanes on the road
and three laser rangefinders.
Lasers scan the space around the vehicle to detect various objects: an approaching oncoming or overtaking vehicle, any obstacles encountered on the road or around the vehicle.
Then all this huge amount of information is fed into the computer, and the computer performs two stages.
First of all, it is processing this information in order to get an idea of the space: identifying traffic lanes on the road, identifying obstacles, and then communicating this information to the driver.
The system is also smart enough to calculate the safest way to drive.
So, we can also give advice on how to operate the machine.
But the problem is how to get this information and instructions across to a blind person who does not have the quick and accurate response needed to drive?
For this purpose, we have developed a range of interface technologies for the blind:
A three-dimensional ping sound system, a vibrating vest, a steering wheel with sound signals, a special prosthetic leg, and even shoes that put pressure on the leg.
But today we will only talk about three types of these special interfaces.
The first interface is called DriveGrip.
This is a pair of gloves with motorized finger joints, instructing the driver how to steer: direction and angle of turn.
Another device is SpeedStrip.
Initially, this is a massage chair.
The vibration is used to provide the driver with speed information as well as guidance on the use of gas and brake pedals.
So, here you can see how the computer perceives the space around the car. And since the vibration cannot be seen, red LEDs are installed on the driver to demonstrate the process.
This is sensory data, it is transmitted to devices via a computer.
DriveGrip and SpeedStrip devices are very effective.
But the problem is that these are instructional prompting devices.
They don't actually give you the freedom to govern, don't they?
The on-board computer gives the driver commands: "left," "right," "speed up," "stop."
We call him "an annoying backseat passenger."
That's why we're moving away from teaching prompts and concentrating our attention on informative devices.
An excellent example of such an interface is AirPix.
This is a kind of monitor for the blind.
A small panel with many holes through which compressed air escapes, thereby creating images.
A blind person can bring a palm to this panel and "see" traffic lanes on the roadway and obstacles.
The driver can also change the frequency at which the air is released and possibly the air temperature.
That is, it is an interface for displaying multidimensional data.
So here you see the left and right camera of the car and how the computer processes and sends this information to the AirPix panel.
Here we showcase a simulator, a blind person driving a car using AirPix.
This simulator has proven to be very useful for training blind drivers, as well as for quickly testing ideas for using different types of special interfaces.
This is how the system works briefly.
After all, this is a prototype car for the blind, and it will not be released on the roadway until they are convinced of its absolute safety.
And I sincerely believe that it is quite possible.
Still, will society accept such a radical idea?
How much will auto insurance rules change?
What are the conditions under which a driver's license will be issued?
Beyond the technological challenges, there are so many pitfalls to overcome before this becomes a reality.
Of course, the main goal of this project is to develop a car for the blind.
However, it is possible that the spin-off technologies developed during this project will prove to be an invaluable contribution to our lives.
Our sensors work regardless of time of day, fog and rain.
We can use these technologies together with new special interfaces to improve vehicle safety for the sighted.
Or for the blind. Find their use in everyday household appliances, in educational institutions, in offices.
Just imagine: a teacher in the classroom writes on a blackboard, and a blind student can see and read what is written using these special interfaces.
This is priceless.
So what I showed you today is just the beginning.
Many thanks.
(Applause)
Bill and Ted's second trailer with Keanu Reeves released
The second trailer for the third installment of the Bill Ted franchise has appeared on Orion Pictures' YouTube channel.
The trailer reveals some of the details of the current life of the bosom friends: they have settled in a suburban area, are married to their girlfriends Joanna (Jaime Mays) and Elizabeth (Erinn Hayes) from "The Incredible Adventures of Bill and Ted" (1989), and, in fact, the restless adventurers have long been raising daughters.
Brigitta Lundy-Payne ("Glass Castle," "Atypical") plays Billy, Ted's daughter, and Samara Weaving ("I'm Going to Search") plays Thea, Bill's daughter (yes, Bill and Ted named their daughters Billy and Thea, such a pun).
On top of that, they have another great adventure: they have to go into the future to steal their own song - the only way they can save the world.
The trailer also features American rapper Kid Cudi and William Sadler ("August Rush," "Death Contrary," "Green Mile") reprising the role of Death.
The film was originally scheduled to be released on August 21, but the date was pushed back to September 1.
It is reported that the creators do not plan to reschedule the release date of the film.
The film will also be immediately available online.
Earlier, we wrote that Keanu Reeves would become a screenwriter for comics about the demigod Berserk.
I want you to think for a moment that almost all of our knowledge about the universe comes from light.
We stand on Earth and see stars in the night sky with the naked eye.
A bright sun can burn the retina of the eye,
but we see the same light in the reflection of the Moon.
Since the time of Galileo, who observed celestial bodies with his primitive telescope, we have been contemplating the universe thanks to the light passing through the vast ages of cosmic history.
With the help of modern telescopes, we were able to collect a stunning silent film about the universe, covering our entire history up to the Big Bang.
However, the movie is not without sound, because the universe is not silent.
I want to prove to you that the universe has its own soundtrack, and it is "reproduced" by the cosmos itself, because outer space vibrates like a drum.
It has distinctive sounds that accompany the brightest events as they happen.
Today, we would like to complement the luxurious visual image of the universe that we have with a soundtrack.
Until now, we have never heard sounds from space, but in the near future we should listen carefully to what is happening there.
So, in order to record the "song" of the universe, we focused on black holes as the most promising objects, because they "beat" spacetime like a bell and give a distinctive sound.
Maybe one day we will see the shadow that a black hole casts when it comes to a bright background, but so far we have not seen this.
However, a black hole, though invisible, can be heard as it "hits" spacetime like a drum.
The assumption that space is like a drum membrane belongs to Albert Einstein, to whom we owe so much.
Einstein concluded that if space were empty, if the universe were empty, it would look like in this drawing, except, of course, for such a visual grid.
If we were to fall freely through the cosmos, even without a convenient coordinate grid, we could mentally represent it ourselves, as we would notice that we are moving in a straight line, in a straight line through the universe.
Einstein also understood - and this is the point - that if energy or mass is placed in the universe, it will lead to a curvature of space, and a free-falling object will circle, for example, the Sun, bending along natural curves in space.
It was Einstein's great general theory of relativity.
Even light is bent along such a path.
The bend can be so extreme that the object simply falls into orbit, and orbits the Sun like the Earth, or like the Moon around the Earth.
These are natural curvatures in space.
But Einstein didn't understand this - if you take our Sun and compress it to 6 kilometers in diameter, that is, the mass is 1 million times heavier than the Earth to fit in an object with a diameter of 6 km, then you will get a black hole, so dense that the light that has passed too close to it will never escape.
However, he always regarded black holes as just a mathematical curiosity.
Einstein did not believe they existed in reality.
He believed that nature itself should protect us from their appearance.
Decades passed before the term "black hole" was invented, and people realised that they were real astrophysical objects - in fact, they were very massive stars in a post-mortem state, catastrophically destroyed at the end of their life cycle.
Our Sun will not turn into a black hole.
Its mass is not enough for this.
But we will do a little thought experiment - Einstein loved them very much - and imagine the Sun shrinking to 6 kilometers in diameter, and a tiny Earth revolving around it, about 30 kilometers from the sun's black hole.
This Earth is glowing, the Sun is no longer there, and there is no other source of light, so we will make our little Earth self-luminous.
It turns out we can put the Earth in a very close orbit, just 30km from that black hole.
It is not much larger than Manhattan.
Perhaps it would have hooked Hudson a bit before destroying the Earth.
But the scale is about that.
We are talking about a facility that would occupy approximately 1 / 2 of Manhattan's area.
So, if we put this Earth very close - just 30km away - we will notice that it perfectly revolves around a black hole.
It's a kind of myth that black holes consume everything indiscriminately - in order to get into it, you have to come very close.
But what is astonishing is that from our point of view we will see the Earth all the time.
It cannot hide behind a black hole.
Some of the light that the Earth emits is absorbed by the hole, but some of it seems to go around it and come back to us.
So there is nothing to hide behind a black hole.
If you suddenly get into the series "Battlestar Galactica" and fight the Cylons - do not hide behind a black hole.
They will see you.
Our Sun won't turn into a black hole - it's not massive enough for that - but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
And if one of them had overshadowed the Milky Way, that's how it would have looked.
We would see the shadow of a black hole amid hundreds of billions of stars and glowing dust.
If we were on the verge of falling into this black hole, we would see all this light around it, and even already entering this shadow, we would not notice the near catastrophe.
It would be useless to start the engines and try to get out, because nothing, including light, can escape it.
Although the black hole looks like it is on the outside, it is not dark inside as all the light falls into it with us.
According to the relativistic effect known as the stretching of time, our clock would seem to have slowed down relative to general galactic time, but we would instead have seen the evolution of the galaxy in accelerated mode a moment before its death inside the black hole.
It would be like a near-death experience, where you see the light at the end of the tunnel, but not "about," but absolutely mortal.
(Laughter) And you won't tell anyone about the light at the end of the tunnel.
Scientists have not yet been able to see the shadow of the black hole, but we can hear it, albeit invisible.
Imagine a real astrophysical situation - two black holes that lived together for a long time.
They may have been stars at first and then turned into black holes, each 10 times heavier than the Sun.
We will compress them to 60 km in diameter.
They can spin fast: hundreds of revolutions per second.
At the end of their life cycle, they spin around each other almost at the speed of light.
They cover thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second, and not only distort space in this way, but also leave behind a trace: they cause vibrations, a wave trace in spacetime.
Space shrinks and stretches, freeing itself from these black holes swaying in the universe.
And they travel through space at the speed of light.
This computer simulation was done by the Goddard group at NASA studying the theory of relativity.
For almost 30 years, scientists around the world have struggled with this problem.
It was one of the groups.
You see two black holes spinning around each other - and again, the curves are clearly depicted here.
If you see - a little pale - they emit red waves, gravitational waves.
These are the sounds of vibrating space, and they will come from these black holes at the speed of light as they subside and merge into one rotating, quiet black hole - that's the outcome.
If you stood close enough, your ear would resonate as space shrinks and stretches.
You would actually hear the sound.
Of course, your head would also shrink and stretch, so it would be difficult for you to understand what was going on.
But I would like to play that sound to you as we predict it.
This is the work of my group, so the schedule here is more modest.
Imagine a light black hole falling into a very heavy one.
The sound you hear emits a light hole, bending the space, approaching the end step by step.
If it is removed, the sound becomes quieter.
But it is like a hammer "hitting" a space that vibrates like a membrane.
And we can predict what that sound will be like.
We know that as the hole absorbs, it gets faster and louder.
At the end, we will hear a small hole just falling into a big one.
I haven't heard the record so loud yet - really, quite impressive.
At home, it turns out much more modest.
Just quiet clicks.
It's a different sound created by my band.
Here I am not showing you a picture, since the black holes leave no visible traces behind them, there are no visible curves in space.
If you went on a space cruise and heard such a sound, I would recommend flying away quickly.
(Laughter) Away from that sound.
Both black holes are moving.
They are getting closer to each other.
In this case, they are both very hesitant.
And now there will be a merger.
This "chirping" is very characteristic of merging black holes, this is the acceleration at the end.
We assume that it would sound like that.
Fortunately, we are now at a safe distance, in Long Beach, California.
Undoubtedly, somewhere in the universe, two black holes are merging.
And without a doubt, the space around us is vibrating, and these vibrations may have passed millions of light years, that is, a million years have moved towards us at the speed of light.
But the sound is too quiet, we cannot hear it.
Today, there is a very complex project: LIGO (Laser Interferometric Gravitational-Wave Observatory) - it tracks deviations in space fluctuations, the smallest - by the size of the atomic nucleus at 4 kilometers.
This is an extremely ambitious experiment, and over the next few years it will be dedicated to capturing such waves.
There is also a planned space programme, which I hope will be launched in the next 10 years: LIKA (Laser Interferometric Space Antenna).
It will be able to see super heavy black holes, millions and billions of times more massive than the Sun.
In this image from the Hubble telescope, we see two galaxies.
They look as if they are frozen in a kind of "hug,"
and each of them probably contains a super heavy black hole in its core.
But they are not frozen. In fact, they are merging.
These two black holes collide, and it will last more than a billion years.
It is beyond our perception to hear a song of such length.
But LIKA can see the final merger of two super-heavy black holes, which began a long time ago: the last 15 minutes of this action.
We are talking not only about black holes, but also about any serious trouble in the universe, and the most important of them is the Big Bang.
When the phrase was invented, it was ironic - "who would believe in the Big Bang?"
This animation from my friend at Proton Studios shows the Big Bang from the outside.
Any observer would like to be inside at this moment, because it is impossible to be outside the universe.
Imagine you are inside the Big Bang.
It's all around you, and the space is chaotically vibrating.
Fourteen billion years have passed, and this song still sounds around us.
Galaxies are born, and there are generations of star forms in them, and there is an inhabited planet around one star, at least one.
And here we persistently carry out these experiments, make calculations, write programs.
Imagine - a billion years ago, two black holes collided.
All the while, their song sounds in space.
We have not even been born yet.
The sound is approaching, closer and closer - 40,000 years ago, we are still making rock paintings.
If we were going to "hear" the Big Bang, it would sound like this.
Noise in its purest form.
This is white noise, just chaotic sounds.
But it probably surrounds us everywhere, unless it has been drowned out by other processes in the universe.
And if we catch it, it will be the most pleasant music for us, because it is a quiet echo of the moment of our creation, the birth of the observable universe.
Over the next few years, we will be able to add a bit of volume and hear the universe in sound.
But if we catch the echoes of those early events, it will bring us much closer to understanding the Big Bang, and it will already allow us to ask some of the most difficult, elusive questions.
Scrolling backwards on a movie about our universe, we learn that there was a Big Bang in the past, and maybe we will even hear its cacophony, but was this the only explosion?
I mean - did it happen before that?
Will it not happen again?
In the spirit of TED urging us to regain faith in miracles, we can now ask questions that have always eluded us.
But we have to ask: is it possible that our universe is just a trace of some more significant history?
Or - aren't we just one of the branches of the multiverse - each of which has had its own Big Bang in the past? Maybe, with black holes and their "songs," or without them, maybe with intelligent life, or perhaps without - they are not in our past, not in our future, but in some way connected to us?
We will ask - in such a multiverse, in its other branches, is there life there?
Here are my brethren in the multiverse.
But are there other creatures out there who think about us and their origins?
And, if they are, I can imagine them, making calculations like us, building instruments, trying to detect that faint sound of the moment of their creation, and thinking - who else is there but us?
Thank you. Thank you.
(Applause)
Residents of Minneapolis create squads to patrol the streets
The Wall Street Journal reports that squads are being created in Minneapolis to patrol the streets.
Local residents want to help law enforcement officers.
Some of the militiamen carry weapons.
Armed citizens assure that they will not open fire, this is possible only in case of extreme necessity.
According to journalists, the creation of patrols is associated with a reduction in the police budget.
Law enforcement agencies will receive 10 million less per year (this amount may be reduced).
The previous budget of law enforcement agencies was 193 million.
The decision was made by the Minneapolis City Council in connection with the death of George Floyd and protests against police brutality over the past two months.

Earlier, Dinamo Moscow presented a uniform for the next season.
City and Real will be able to play the second leg of the 1 / 8 finals of the Champions League in Manchester
The British newspaper The Guardian reports that Manchester City and Real Madrid will still be able to play the second leg of the 1 / 8 finals of the Champions League in Manchester at the Etihad Stadium on August 7.
Yesterday, July 25, the UK government issued a decree that all people arriving in the UK from Spain must undergo a 14-day quarantine due to the new outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.
For Real, however, an exception will be made.
Earlier, Secretary of the UK Ministry of Culture Oliver Dowden announced the possibility of relaxing quarantine rules for sports teams and film crews.
In February, Real lost 1-2 to Manchester City at home.
The return match is scheduled for August 7.
Presidents of Russia and Ukraine discussed implementation of the ceasefire in Donbass
Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr elensky discussed the implementation of the ceasefire agreements in Donbass, reached during the Normandy summit in December 2019, the press services of the Kremlin and the office of the President of Ukraine reported.
The telephone conversation between Vladimir Putin and Vladimir elensky took place at the initiative of the Ukrainian side, according to the Kremlin press service.
The interlocutors welcomed the agreement reached at the meeting of the Minsk Contact Group on July 22 on a full and comprehensive ceasefire in Donbas, which starts at 00: 01 on July 27, 2020; the President of Russia supported this agreement.
The leaders agreed on the need to urgently implement additional measures to support the ceasefire in Donbas.
At the same time, Putin criticized the resolution adopted by the Verkhovna Rada on July 15 on the organization of local elections in the autumn, which, according to the Russian side, ignores the Minsk agreement.
The situation created by the coronavirus pandemic was also discussed.
The July 22 agreement provides for a complete renunciation of any military action, including reconnaissance, the sending of sabotage and reconnaissance groups and a sniper war.
Tinkov showed a video of a bone marrow transplant
Oleg Tinkov, a Russian entrepreneur and founder of the Tinkoff group, published a video in which he described how he was transplanted with a bone marrow.
To recap, the businessman is fighting leukemia.
On the record, the businessman lies in the room, the bone marrow is transplanted using a dropper.
Tinkov noted that the same is true of the collection of donor material.
"The skull is not cut," he added.
Judging by his posture during the operation, he feels comfortable and relaxed.
His donor was a girl from Germany.
The businessman expressed regret over the fact that there are only 130,000 bone marrow donors in Russia, while there are about 8 million in Germany.
Bone marrow transplantation for Oleg Tinkou was performed in a London clinic.
The destruction of Russian "Pantsirei" in Ethiopia became known
Two Russian-made Pantsir-S1 anti-aircraft missile and gun systems, which were in service with the Ethiopian army, were destroyed.
This was reported to the Telegram channel "Military Observer" on Sunday, July 26.
According to the channel, two vehicles that provided security for the Hidase hydroelectric plant on the Blue Nile River were put out of action by lightning.
Other details of the incident are not given.
In May, the Turkish agency Anadolu reported the destruction of nine Russian-made Pantsir-S1 air defence systems in Libya.
They belonged to the forces of the commander of the Libyan National Army (LNA), Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, and were destroyed by the Turkish tactical multi-purpose unmanned aerial systems Bayraktar TB2.
At that time, Defense Express called the incident "a real genocide."
Another Pantsir-S1 in Libya was destroyed by an attack drone in early July.
In Warsaw, 1.5 thousand people are evacuated because of a bomb
About 1,500 residents of Warsaw are being evacuated because of a bomb found during the construction of the metro, RIA Novosti reports, citing a representative of the capital's mayor's office, Karolina Galetskaya.
She said that an unexploded ordnance weighing 250 kg and about 2 meters long was found at the construction of the second line of the metro in the area of Bazilianska Street in the Warsaw district of Brody.
In this regard, about 1,500 people are being evacuated from eight adjacent neighborhoods.
Only then will the engineers begin their work.
Lokomotiv is close to signing a contract with a Belarusian national football player
Shakhtar and Belarus national football team striker Vitaly Lisakovich is preparing to move to Lokomotiv Moscow.
According to the source, soon the 22-year-old footballer will undergo a medical examination for Lokomotiv, after which he will sign a four-year contract.
Lisakovic scored nine goals in 18 matches in the current season of the Belarusian championship.
He has five games for the Belarusian national team, in which he never scored.
Earlier, the media announced Miranchuk's wishes for a contract with Serie A clubs.
Putin spoke with Shoigu in the cabin:
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke with the head of the Defense Ministry, Sergei Shoigu, and the commander-in-chief of the Navy, Nikolai Yevmenov.
Journalists from the Kremlin pool, RIA Novosti, published the relevant footage on Sunday, July 26, in their Telegram channel.
A short meeting took place in the cabin of the boat, where the head of state, together with Shoigu and Yevmenov, was heading to the parade of ships in the Gulf of Finland before the parade dedicated to the Day of the Russian Navy.
They exchanged a couple of phrases while sitting at the table.
Earlier it was reported that Putin arrived in Kronstadt to take part in the celebrations.
From there, the president headed to Saint Petersburg, where he is to host a festive parade.
On July 26, parades are held throughout Russia on the occasion of the celebration of Navy Day.
The main naval parade takes place in Saint Petersburg.
It involves more than 4,000 military personnel, 46 ships, submarines and boats, as well as naval aviation.
A call to take part in the "Buy from my grandmother" campaign appeared in one of the Tyumen publics.
The organizers are urging them to buy vegetables, flowers and berries from grandmothers, which they grew in their gardens, and not to bargain.
The author of the post even gave an example, indicating the specific address at which the grandmother sells cherries.
But Tyumen residents suddenly burst into angry comments.
I saw for myself how a merchant from neighboring countries immediately approaches this grandmother and gives a new portion of goods "from the grandmother's garden" for sale.
Watch carefully what you are buying - Nadezhda Grigoryeva shared her observations.
More than once I saw when greens were taken from merchants from neighboring countries and sold.
There is no trust, Larisa Kharlamova agreed.

The actor of the Russian TV series responded to accusations of "propaganda of LGBT and feminism"
The actor of the Russian TV series "Chiki," whose creators were accused of "promoting LGBT and feminism," responded to the complaints about the film.
The authors "understood the severity of the issues raised and did not want to offend anyone," American Stephen Thomas Oxner said in an interview with the publication "The Rise."
"It seems to me that this is a story about strength and general aspects of human life.
It has nothing to do with LGBT and feminism, "said the actor, who played the boy's father, who was dressed as a woman.
He stressed that he was "proud of the work" and did not consider it propaganda.
At the same time, the American added, he is frightened by the reaction of some people to the storyline of the series: for example, there was a case when "a man in deep binge shot the set and said it was not true."
"Then there were a couple of cases when we met disgruntled locals who did not understand what we were doing.
But we were open, so people who initially came with complaints began to help us, "he concluded.
The shooting incident, the publication explains, occurred in September 2019 in Kabardino-Balkaria: a drunken man attacked a camera crew vehicle with a weapon, after which he was detained by police officers.
Earlier it was reported that the public commissioner for the protection of the family, Olga Baranets, filed a complaint with the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Roskomnadzor against the service more.tv, which hosted the Russian series "Chiki."
Baranets accused the creators of the series of "promoting non-traditional sexual relations and feminism," drawing attention to the fact that the main characters of the film work as prostitutes, and the series itself contains "scenes of physical and psychological violence."
The ombudsman was also outraged by the fact that "the series pays a lot of attention to the homosexual sexual orientation" of the minor character.
The comedy drama "Chiki" tells the story of three prostitutes who started a new life and started a business on the advice of a friend.
