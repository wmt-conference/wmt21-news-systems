There is no need to demonize the people of Khabarovsk
The acting head of Khabarovsk Krai spoke about his trip to the region in an exclusive interview with "Komsomolskaya Pravda"
The interim governor of Khabarovsk Krai, Mikhail Degtyarev, urged "Komsomolskaya Pravda" columnist Alexander Gamov not to demonize Khabarovsk residents amid rallies in support of the arrested former head of the region, Sergei Furgal.
I would like to appeal to all political commentators, political scientists, participants of all sorts of talk shows.
There is no need to demonize the people of Khabarovsk Krai.
Hardworking and wonderful people live here, Mikhail Degtyarev shared.
In an interview, Degtyarev recalled that he is a member of the LDPR and a party member of Furgal, adding that he wishes him good luck in court, and that the party and Vladimir Zhirinovsky personally will support him in court.
The full text of the interview was published on the KP.ru website.
Earlier, the website KP.ru reported that Mikhail Degtyarev called for an open trial of Sergei Furgal and considers it fair to hold it in Khabarovsk.
Two Mexican states declare alarm over Hurricane Hanna
Mexico's National Civil Defense Authority has declared an "orange" (high) alert level in the two eastern states of Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon due to the approaching Hurricane Hanna, TASS reports.
The hurricane will bring heavy downpours to Mexico, with between 150 and 250 litres of rain per square metre forecast in some areas.
The authorities have prepared about 800 shelters for the population.
10,000 people will be helping people, including rescuers, National Guard soldiers and military personnel.
At the moment, the hurricane has reached the coast of the US state of Texas with a wind speed of 150 km / h.
Hannah's arrival in Mexico is expected on Sunday morning.
Semilarski against the prosecutor's office: the cassation of the former deputy mayor of Tartu will be considered on August 4
This means that a decision on it is likely to be made in early September.
The first two courts refused to consider Semilarski's claim, but in April his cassation appeal was accepted into proceedings by the Supreme Court.
On 12 December 2019, the Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the applicant, since its resolution is not within its competence of the administrative court.
The court order stated that the complaint contains a claim for compensation for damages caused during criminal proceedings.
"The prosecutor's office and the county court should regulate such issues," Anett Kreitsmann, spokesperson for Tartu courts, explained to ERR earlier.
According to her, Valvo Semilarski appealed the decision in the district court, which on February 5 did not change the decision of the court of first instance.
Now the Supreme Court will have to say its word.
According to Semilarski's defense lawyer, sworn lawyer Oliver Nyaes, his client was unreasonably suspected of bribery for about two years.
Now he is demanding that the prosecutor's office refute the incorrect allegations against him and compensate him for moral damages.
The reason for filing the complaint in court was the statements made by the prosecutor for special cases of the Lyunas District Prosecutor's Office, Margus Gross, in October 2017, when Semilarski, along with another then vice mayor of Tartu, Artem Suvorov, was detained on suspicion of committing several crimes.
"Recall that when I was detained, the Security Police and the Prosecutor's Office immediately organized a press conference and informed the whole Republic of Estonia that the leaders of Tartu - one of the most influential local government bodies - are corrupt.
These public suspicions hanging in the air accompanied me for about two years.
And now that these allegations and suspicions have turned out to be false, the prosecutor's office doesn't want to say anything about it, "Semilarski commented in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Nyaes, at the press conference the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework within which the prosecutor's office should operate.
"The allegations of bribes and salesmanship turned out to be false, but this is not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly emphasized in its decisions on Russia, as well as on Lithuania, that at the stage of the investigation representatives of the state should be careful when choosing words, so that suspects are not presented as criminals before sentencing.
The prosecutor's office is also obliged to this by the presumption of innocence, which, unfortunately, was not observed in this case against Valvo Semilarski, "Nyaes said.
"The public representation of Semilarski as a serious offender and bribe in circumstances where the facts underlying the suspicion of bribery are still being investigated is unacceptable, which contradicts the presumption of innocence and is unfair to the applicant," the lawyer added.
As rus.err.ee wrote, the former deputy mayor of Tartu Valvo Semilarski will not be held liable on charges of bribery - the criminal case initiated against him in July was partially closed.
At the same time, the former official is being tried on charges of knowingly violating anti-corruption legislation during transactions on a particularly large scale.
According to the indictment, between 2015 and 2017, the former deputy mayor of Tartu participated more than thirty times in City Council meetings when making decisions related to companies operating in Tartu, with whose owners or managers Semilarski actively communicated on a personal level outside working hours.
According to Gross, in all of these cases Semilarski had personal interests, and therefore he had to withdraw from participation in decision-making.
Earlier, as rus.err.ee wrote, the prosecutor's office suspected Semilarski of taking bribes and violating anti-corruption legislation during transactions on a particularly large scale.
This happened in October 2016, when he was detained along with another deputy mayor, Artem Suvorov (Centre Party).
At that time, the prosecutor's office and the Security Police stated that there was strong evidence against both vice mayors.
After that, both officials resigned.
Suvorov's case later reached the court, which fully justified the politician.
The trial of Valvo Semilarski is still ongoing.
Ex-soloist of the group "Hands Up" visited Tver region
Former soloist of the group "Hands Up," and now solo performer, businessman and actor Sergey Zhukov posted on his official Instagram account a photo from Kalyazin, Tver region.
The photo was published a day ago, on Saturday, July 25.
"I raise my hands up under the new" Little "and say hello to you from the drunkenly fresh air!
Write in the comments, what is the weather in your city?
Today we have no rain, but it doesn't rise above + 20 yet ...," Zhukov writes in social networks.
Probably, the singer is vacationing in the beautiful city of Tver region with his family.
Residents of the region have already thanked the performer for the visit, and also expressed hope for a meeting and personal communication.
The new "Little" in question in the post - this is probably referring to a new version of an old song, which Zhukov now recorded together with blogger and musician David Manukyan (DAVA M).
At the same time, the majority of fans remain for the old version: "Sergey, the old version of the song is clearly 1 000 times better!
Support me loyal fans of "Hands Up," "We don't need a" new crumb "."
Most people write directly that they like the original, which once became a hit.
The Ministry of Defense reported the successful completion of tests of the Zircon hypersonic missile
The Russian Ministry of Defense reported the successful completion of tests of the Zircon hypersonic missile.
On Navy Day, the Defense Ministry noted that test launches conducted from the frigate "Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union Gorshkov" confirmed the unique tactical and technical characteristics of this missile in terms of range and accuracy of fire, as well as the hypersonic speed of its flight.
According to the Ministry of Defense, testing of the hypersonic missile is proceeding as planned.
Earlier in May, Deputy Defense Minister Alexei Krivoruchko reported that the ship complex with the latest Zircon hypersonic missile will enter service in 2021 - 2022.
You all know very well the truth that will be discussed today.
I think the idea of inequality as a separator and destroyer of society was in the air even before the French Revolution.
But now we can see evidence by comparing the most and least similar societies, and by observing the consequences of inequality.
I will show you this data and explain why there are relationships in question.
But first, look at how dull we are.
(Laughter) I'll start with a paradox.
It shows life expectancy depending on GND, or the average level of welfare of countries.
It can be seen that countries on the right, such as Norway and the United States, are twice as rich as Israel, Greece and Portugal on the left.
But this has absolutely no impact on life expectancy.
There is no hint of a relationship.
But within societies, strong gradations in the state of health are noticeable, affecting all social strata.
Again, the average life expectancy.
The chart refers to small areas of England and Wales: the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.
There's a huge difference between the poor and everyone else.
Even those slightly poorer than the richest are already less healthy than the very top.
So income is very important within our societies, but not between them.
The explanation for this paradox is this: within our societies, we look at relative income or social position, status - at what level we are in relation to others, and what are the distances between us.
Having understood this idea, you will immediately think: what will happen when the difference increases or shrinks, in other words, making the difference in income greater or less?
Now I'll show you that.
All the data used is absolutely real.
I take information from the UN, the World Bank has the same: the scale of income differences in these rich and developed market democracies.
We count the difference between 20% of the richest and 20% of the poorest citizens in each country.
Look, in equal countries on the left, in Japan, Finland, Norway, and Sweden, the rich 20% are 3.5-4 times richer than the 20% of the poor.
But in unequal countries, in Great Britain, Portugal, USA and Singapore, the difference is twice as big!
According to these measurements, we are twice as equal as other successful democratic states.
And now you will see what impact this has on society.
We have collected statistics on social issues that are more common among the poor.
These are internationally comparable data on life expectancy, level of literacy and mathematical training of children, mortality of newborns, murder rate, number of prisoners, teenage pregnancy, level of trust, obesity, mental illness, which, according to the standard diagnostic classification, include drug and alcohol addiction, and finally, data on social mobility.
We put it all in one index.
They all have the same importance.
The country is a kind of average value of this data.
You see countries in relation to the inequality indicator that was shown at the very beginning. I will return to it again and again during the presentation.
Unequal countries as a whole have more difficulties with all these social problems.
You see that the correlation is unusually high.
But if you look at the same index of health and social problems in relation to GNP per capita, the Gross National Income, there is no correlation.
We were a bit worried that people would think that we were selecting problems according to our arguments and just "fitting" the evidence. So we also wrote an article in the British Medical Journal about the UNICEF Child Wellbeing Index.
The index consists of 40 different parts, put together by different people.
Among the criteria: the presence of books at home, the ability of children to talk to their parents, the level of immunization, the presence of bullying at school.
Everything is included there.
But this is against the background of the same indicator of inequality.
The situation for children is worse in unequal societies.
And this is a statistically significant relationship.
But again, if you look at the level of children's well-being in relation to national income per capita, there is no relationship, no hint.
All the data demonstrated suggests one thing:
On average, the welfare of our societies no longer depends on national income and economic growth.
They are extremely important in poor countries, but not in the developed world.
The difference between us and our position against others is what makes a huge difference.
I will show you fragments of our index.
For example, trust.
It's a part of the population that agrees that most people can be trusted.
The data is taken from the World Values Study.
Look, in unequal countries, only 15% of the population trusts others.
And in equal societies this figure reaches 60-65%.
If you look at the measurements of social activity, or social capital, you will notice very similar ratios, closely related to inequality.
We did the work twice.
First we analyzed developed countries, and then, as a control study, we repeated the procedure in 50 US states, asking one question: is things worse by all our indicators in the most unequal states?
Here's trust in inequality, according to a general social survey of the federal government.
A very similar spread compared to the same range of confidence levels.
It's the same story.
Overall, we found that almost everything related to trust internationally manifests itself in the same way in our control study.
It's not just a coincidence.
Here is a chart of mental illness.
WHO, using identical diagnostic interviews conducted on random samples of the population, collected results that allow us to compare the level of mental illness in each society.
Here you can see the percentage of the population who suffered from any mental illness last year.
The figures start at around 8% and rise to almost 24%; entire societies with three times the level of psychological illness.
Once again, this is closely linked to inequality.
But here are the crimes.
These red dots show American states, and the blue triangles show Canadian provinces.
But look at the scale of the differences.
It starts at 15 murders per million and reaches 150.
This is the proportion of prisoners.
We are talking about a tenfold difference expressed on a logarithmic scale.
The figures are rising from 40 to 400 in terms of the number of prisoners in prisons.
These relationships are not explained simply by higher crime.
Yes, in some cases it is partly so.
But for the most part, they involve tougher sentences.
Unequal societies are more likely to advocate preserving the death penalty.
The percentage of children dropping out of school is shown here.
Again, quite a big difference.
It is incredibly harmful when it comes to using talents.
But social mobility.
This is a measurement of mobility depending on income.
Basically, the question is: do the rich fathers have rich sons and the poor have poor sons, or is there no dependence here?
Among unequal countries, in Great Britain and the United States, the father's income is many times more important.
And in Scandinavian countries, income is already much less significant.
The result is greater social mobility.
And as we often like to say - I know there are many Americans among the audience - if Americans want to realize the American dream, they should go to Denmark.
(Laughter) (Applause) I showed only a couple of moments marked in italics.
A number of other problems could be demonstrated.
All sorts of problems that become more significant among the lower social strata.
But there are endless problems with social gradients, which are much worse in unequal countries; and not a little bit, but 2, 10 times worse.
Think about the costs, what it costs people.
Let me return to the previously shown chart, where all the data is collected together.
First, schedule after schedule, the less successful countries, regardless of the result, turn out to be unequal, while the Scandinavian countries and Japan are doing well.
Thus, we see a general social dysfunction against the background of inequality.
This is not one or two separate problems.
Let's see below: Sweden and Japan: the countries are different in literally everything.
The situation of women, how closely they are connected with the family, is exactly the opposite, in the conditions of developed countries.
Another very important difference is how they achieve greater equality.
In Sweden, income differences are huge, but they are reduced through taxation, through social programs, generous benefits, etc.
In Japan, however, everything is different.
The difference in salaries is initially small.
Taxes are lower.
There are fewer social programs.
And in our analysis of US states we find the same contrast.
Some states succeed by redistributing income, others by making less difference in net income before tax.
We believe that it doesn't matter by what means equality is achieved, as long as it is achieved.
I am not talking about full equality, but about what exists in rich and developed market democracies.
Another surprising observation is that it's not just the poor who are affected by this inequality.
There seems to be some truth in John Donna's words: "Man is not an island."
A number of studies compare how people succeed in more or less equal countries at each step of the social ladder.
One such example:
Deaths among newborns.
A group of Swedes classified many infant mortality cases according to the British register of general socio-economic classification.
This is rather an anachronistic classification according to the profession of fathers, so that single parents are not counted.
And by "low social level" we mean unqualified professions.
Then there are skilled manual workers, then lower-level white-collar workers up to the highest level with highly qualified professions: doctors, lawyers, directors of large companies.
You see, things are going better in Sweden than in Great Britain in all segments of society.
The biggest difference is at lower levels,
But even for the higher levels there are benefits from a more equal society.
We showed this in five different collections of data affecting educational outcomes and health in the United States and internationally.
And this seems to be the overall picture: greater equality changes things more at the bottom, but is also beneficial for the top.
But I still have to explain what is happening.
It seems to me that everywhere we are talking about the psychosocial consequences of inequality.
A sense of superiority and inferiority, a sense of one's value and vice versa, a sense of self-respect and vice versa.
And, of course, the sense of competition that is born of these feelings inflames consumerism in our society.
It also leads to fear for one's status.
We are more worried about how others think about us, whether they consider us attractive, smart - this worries us.
The more public assessments, the greater the fear of them.
Interestingly, parallel work is being conducted in social psychology: 208 different studies were considered with the participation of volunteers, who were tested in psychological laboratories for stress hormones, for reaction to stress tasks.
Overall, they wanted to observe types of stress that increase levels of cortisol, the main stress hormone.
As a result, such factors turned out to be situations that included a potential threat to social assessment, a threat to self-esteem or social status, and situations where other people could give a negative assessment.
Just such stress factors have a special effect on the physiology of stress.
There was criticism against us.
Of course, there will be dissenters or people who find it surprising.
I must tell you, in response to criticism for the selection of data, that we do not choose this data.
Our main rule is that if a data source has the necessary indicators for one of the countries analyzed, we include it in our analysis.
This source of information decides whether this data is real, but not us.
Otherwise we would have created a systematic error.
What about other countries?
There are 200 studies of health in relation to income and equality in academic journals.
And they are not limited to these countries, but we have excluded other ones for clarity.
The same countries, the same dimensions of inequality, problem after problem.
Why don't we control other factors?
Well, we showed you that GNP per capita does not matter.
And, of course, others, using more complex methods, controlled poverty, the level of education, and so on.
And what about causality?
Correlation itself does not prove causality.
We spent a lot of time doing this.
Indeed, for some of these situations, causal relationships are well known.
A big change in our understanding of the causes of chronic health effects in the developed world was how significant chronic stress of a social nature and its impact on the immune and cardiovascular systems is.
For example, violence is becoming more common in unequal societies, because people are more sensitive to contempt.
I must say that to solve this problem, we need to work on income before and after tax deduction.
We must limit the income and additional bonuses of senior executives.
I think it's necessary to make our bosses responsible for employees in every possible way.
I want you to leave here with the realization that we can improve a person's real quality of life by reducing the income difference between us.
Now we have a foothold to influence the psychological well-being of entire societies, and this is really incredible.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Clubs claiming Lokomotiv star Miranchuk and his salary in Italy have become known.
According to "SE," at the moment the teams of Serie A "Milan," "Lazio," "Fiorentina" and "Atalanta" apply for the midfielder of "Lokomotiv" Alexei Miranchuk.
The 24-year-old would like to receive a four-year contract with a salary of at least 2 million euros a year with bonuses.
Any club that makes such an offer will receive priority.
Lokomotiv is determined to sell its main star and make money from it.
Otherwise, the club will face serious spending to extend their contract with the centre-back.
Note that Milan expects to include left-back Diego Laxalt in the deal.
In the 2019 / 20 season Miranchuk played 32 matches for the railroad, scored 16 goals and made 5 assists.
Together with Lokomotiv, the centre-back became Russian champion (2017 / 18), won the Country Cup three times (2014 / 15, 2016 / 17, 2018 / 19) and the Russian Super Cup once (2019).
US calls on Qatar and its neighbours to end dispute
It is necessary to restore trust and unity between Qatar and other states, US Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook believes.
He stated that the conflict between the emirate and other countries in the region has been going on for too long and is damaging regional interests in the sphere of stability, prosperity and security.
So far, the US has tried unsuccessfully to mediate a settlement of the dispute, which Washington sees as a "threat to efforts to contain Iran."
The UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain broke off diplomatic relations with Qatar three years ago.
They established a transport blockade, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorism.
In response, Doha said that its neighbours are simply jealous of Qatar's economic success: according to the IMF, Qatar has been leading by a wide margin in terms of GDP per capita for several years.
The Emirate is the third largest natural gas reserve, the sixth exporter of natural gas and a major exporter of oil and petroleum products.

Russia's Proton is ready to conquer space
The Proton-M rocket is ready for launch, during which it will launch two telecommunications satellites of the Express series into orbit.
The state commission came to this conclusion.
As early as July 26, the device will be launched at the launch site of the Baikonur Cosmodrome.
The direct launch of the rocket is planned for July 30.
The initial launch date was shifted after a number of malfunctions were detected among the components of the launch vehicle.
According to Roscosmos, the defective parts were manufactured at the Ust-Katava plant in Chelyabinsk in 2015-2016.
Remenyako won the second race in the SMP GT4 RUSSIA class.
Evgeny Kulikov, whose Porsche Cayman was injured in the first race, was unable to start.
Therefore Alexey Bashmakov was on the reverse pole - however, by the second round the pilots on Mercedes had already pulled ahead.
Denis Remenyako again raced ahead, and Alexander Vaintrub was forced to repel Alexander Maslennikov's attacks on KTM, which broke from last place to third.
Despite a tight fight in the first part of the race, closer to the middle Vainpipe increased his pace, showing the best lap time in the race - and, although he could not catch up with the extremely stable Remenyako, secured silver.
The Kaymanov group fell behind the leaders, but fought hard among themselves.
The best of the pilots on Porsche was Alexey Bashmakov, who became fourth in the standings, but also Andrey Fedotov and Konstantin Zakharevsky lost to him a few moments.
And at the intermediate finish in the middle of the race, Fedotov and Zakharevsky split 0.001 seconds.
Two more highways are included in the list of federal roads
The Russian government has included two more highways in the list of federal highways.
According to the Cabinet of Ministers, one of these roads with a length of more than 663 kilometers Chekshino - Totma - Kotlas - Kuratovo connects Vologda and Arkhangelsk regions with the Komi Republic.
Another highway with a length of more than 388 kilometers leads from Barnaul through Pavlovsk to the border with the Republic of Kazakhstan.
On this road you can drive from the capital of the Altai Territory to the Kulunda checkpoint.
Obtaining the new status will make it possible to bring these roads to a normative state with the funds of the Federal Road Fund.
Overhaul and reconstruction of individual sections will be carried out, and the quality of the road surface will be improved.
Open air film screenings allowed in Tatarstan
The Cabinet of Ministers of Tatarstan published a decree according to which from July 27 in the republic it is possible to hold film screenings in open areas - in parks, squares and on embankments, writes Tatar-inform.
Also, the document states that the mandatory self-isolation regime for citizens over 65 has been extended until August 9.
They can leave their homes to go to the store, take out the trash, or walk their dog.
But indoor cinemas are not planning to open until the third stage of lifting restrictions, the agency recalls.
Washington is happy with playoff games.
We missed them
Russian Washington Capitals hockey player Alexander Ovechkin spoke about the club's preparations for the upcoming resumption of the NHL season.
The 34-year-old Caps striker noted the readiness of his partners for matches.
Psychologically, all the guys are ready.
We are going to Toronto joyful, because we were without a game for a long time and missed hockey in the playoffs, Ovechkin was quoted as saying by the Russian version of the NHL.Com website.
- Now we are fresh, we have no injuries and various ailments.
Nevertheless, Ovechkin also admitted that he and his partners still have to remember some of the tactical combinations: "We don't have much time to play the majority and remember March's achievements on how to move the puck in such situations.
But there is still time: I am sure that in Toronto we will devote part of our training to this.
The majority and the minority are important in the playoffs.
And I am confident in our special teams. "
Recall that the restart of the Washington Capitals is scheduled for August 3, when the Capitals will play the Tampa Bay Lightning.
After that, the Caps will also play Philadelphia Flyers (August 6) and Boston Bruins (August 9).
Russian refused to pay for parking and beat a parking worker
In Vladivostok, a man refused to pay for parking and hit a parking worker, and police are conducting an inspection.
This is reported by the portal vl.ru with reference to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia in the city.
The incident occurred on Friday, July 24, in a parking lot near the shopping center.
The driver refused to pay for parking, which caused a conflict with the parking worker.
Verbal dispute turned into handiwork.
The man hit the employee in the face, he fell unconscious.
He was hospitalized.
A source told the publication that the victim suffered a moderate head injury and was taken to the neurosurgery department.
Currently, the police are establishing the full circumstances of what happened.
Earlier, a Russian man was charged with beating a disabled man who later died in hospital.
According to investigators, the victim was visiting his friend - a 45-year-old local resident.
The men drank alcohol together, after which a conflict arose between the friends.
The owner of the apartment beat the guest, he went home.
Two days later, the man became ill and was hospitalized.
He died from his injuries.
Recently, cyberattacks on the business world have become more frequent.
Access to data from companies such as JP Morgan, Yahoo, Home Depot, and Target caused them losses of hundreds of millions, and in some cases even billions of dollars.
It doesn't take too many such attacks to damage the global economy.
Nor is the public sector protected from such problems.
From 2012 to 2014, there was a significant data leak at the US Human Resources Department.
Access to data on security checks and fingerprints of 22 million employees was disrupted.
Attempts by hackers sponsored by government agencies to influence election results in a number of countries using stolen data are known.
The last two cases of disclosure of a large amount of data concern the Bundestag, the federal parliament of Germany, and the theft of emails of the Democratic National Committee of the United States.
The cyber threat affects our democratic processes.
The situation is even getting worse.
As computer technology develops, data protection systems become increasingly vulnerable.
A new type of computer technology is also of concern: computing on quantum computers that use the microscopic properties of nature to dramatically increase computing power.
It is so powerful that it can hack many modern encryption systems.
Is the situation so hopeless?
Maybe it's time to pack our vital data and prepare for the imminent digital apocalypse?
I would say, "It's not yet time."
Quantum computers are still in development, and it will take many years before they are put into practice.
More importantly, there are major breakthroughs in encryption.
For me, this is a particularly exciting time in the history of secure communications.
About 15 years ago, when I learned about the new possibility of creating quantum effects that do not exist in nature, I was very inspired.
I was intrigued by the idea of applying the fundamental laws of physics to create more secure encryption.
Today, a number of companies and laboratories around the world, including mine, are working on these technologies to put them into practice.
True.
Now we are preparing to fight quantum using quantum.
So how does it all work?
First, let's take a short tour of the encryption world.
To do this, we need a briefcase, some important documents that we want to send to our friend, James Bond, and a lock to keep everything safe.
Since our information is top secret, we need a special portfolio.
It has a special code deputy: when it is closed, it converts the entire text in documents into random numbers.
You put the documents in the portfolio, close the deputy - at which point all the documents are converted into random numbers - and send the portfolio to James.
While the briefcase is on the way, you call James to report the code.
After receiving the briefcase, he enters the code, the documents are decrypted, and voila - you just sent an encrypted message to James Bond.
(Laughter) A funny example, but it illustrates three important coding elements.
Code - we call it "encryption key."
It's like a password.
Call James to tell him the lock combination code.
This is called "key exchange" -
Guarantee that you will safely receive the encryption key from the right place.
And the deputy who encodes and decodes the document.
This is called a "coding algorithm."
Using a key, it converts text in documents into random numbers.
A good algorithm will encode in such a way that it is very difficult to decrypt a document without a key.
The importance of encryption is that if someone takes possession of a portfolio and breaks it without the help of an encryption key and a coding algorithm, they will still be unable to read its contents.
The information will look like a set of random numbers.
Most security systems rely on a secure method of exchanging keys to transfer the encryption key to the desired location.
However, the rapid development of computing power jeopardizes a number of modern methods of key exchange.
Consider one of the most widely used systems today - RSA.
When it was invented in 1977, it was assumed that it would take 40 quadrillion years to hack the 426-bit RSA key.
In 1994, just 17 years later, the code was hacked.
As computers became more powerful, we had to use more complex codes.
Today we usually use 2,048 or 4,096 bits.
As you can see, code creators and hackers are engaged in an ongoing battle, trying to outwit each other.
And when quantum computers appear in the next 10 to 15 years, they will be able to hack even faster the complex mathematics that underpins many modern encryption systems.
A quantum computer is likely to turn our current reliable fortress into a simple house of cards.
We must find a way to defend our fortress.
In recent years, the number of studies in the field of using quantum effects to strengthen cryptoprotection has increased.
Some interesting discoveries were made.
Remember the three main encryption elements: high-quality keys, secure key exchange, and a complex algorithm?
Advances in science and technology put two of these three elements at risk.
First, the keys themselves.
Random numbers are the fundamental building blocks of encryption keys.
But today they are not entirely random.
Today, we are creating encryption keys from random number sequences generated from software, so-called pseudo-random numbers.
In numbers generated by a program or a mathematical formula, one way or another there is a certain pattern.
The less random the numbers are - in scientific terminology: the less entropy they contain - the easier it is to predict them.
Recently, several casinos fell victim to an inventive attack.
Combinations at the output of slot machines were recorded for some time, after which they were analyzed.
This allowed cybercriminals to redesign the pseudo-random number generator that controls the drums.
That, in turn, made it possible to accurately predict the spin of the drums and get a big win.
Encryption keys may also be exposed to similar risks.
A truly random number generator is required for secure encryption.
For many years now, scientists have been looking for the possibility of creating such a generator.
But most attempts today are either not accidental enough, not fast enough, or difficult to repeat.
But the quantum world is based on chance.
So it makes sense to take advantage of this fact.
Devices that can measure quantum effects can also create an endless stream of random numbers at high speed,
Which will prevent all these potential criminals in the casino.
A number of the best universities and companies around the world are engaged in creating generators of truly random numbers.
The first quantum generator created in my company was one by two meters in size and was placed on an optical table.
Later we were able to reduce it to the size of a server box.
Today it is the size of a PCI card connected to a standard computer.
It is the world's fastest generator of truly random numbers.
Its performance is one billion random numbers per second.
Today, it is used to strengthen the security system by cloud providers, banks, and government agencies around the world.
(Applause) But even with such a generator, the second big problem remains unresolved: the threat to secure key exchange.
Modern methods of key exchange are not compatible with a quantum computer.
The quantum solution to this problem is called "quantum key distribution" or QKD, which is based on the fundamental, paradoxical characteristic of quantum mechanics.
The quantum particle changes depending on its observation.
Here is an example of how it works.
Let's go back to exchanging codes for James Bond.
Only this time, instead of calling James with a code message, we will use quantum effects on the laser to create the code and send it to James using conventional optical fiber.
We believe that Dr Nou will try to hack access to data exchange.
Fortunately, his attempts to catch quantum keys along the way will leave fingerprints that James and you can detect.
This will eliminate the intercepted keys.
And the remaining keys can be used for enhanced data protection.
Since such security is based on the fundamental laws of physics, a quantum computer or even any supercomputer of the future will not be able to hack it.
My team and I are working with leading universities, as well as the defence sector, to develop this promising technology into next-generation security.
The Internet of Things heralds an era when 25-30 billion devices will interact, which are projected to appear by 2020.
Trust in the systems that support these devices is vital for the proper functioning of our society in the world of the Internet of Things.
I am ready to argue that quantum technologies can secure this trust, allowing us to take full advantage of the amazing innovations that will enrich our lives.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Video of cats helping injured dog cross road
A video with two cats that helped a wounded dog cross a road in Krasnodar Krai is becoming popular online.
The touching procession was recorded by the video recorder of one of the drivers.
The events took place in the dark, the man noticed traffic on the road and slowed down.
"Look, the whole delegation is rushing," the driver said ironically at first.
And then he notices that the dog moves with great difficulty.
The company safely reached the roadside, after which it headed towards the forest.
"People have a lot to learn from animals," they wrote in the comments.
On Sunday, parades in honor of Russian Navy Day were held in St. Petersburg and near all major fleet bases, including in Tartus, Syria.
219 different ships and 15 thousand personnel took part in them.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, who hosted the main parade in St. Petersburg, said that in 2020 the Navy will be replenished with 40 new vessels of different classes, as well as the latest weapons - including hypersonic attack systems and unmanned underwater vehicles.
In 2020, the parade was held for the first time in Kaspiysk, where the Caspian fleet base was relocated from Astrakhan.
In addition to St. Petersburg, parades were held in Baltiysk, Kaspiysk, Severomorsk, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Vladivostok, as well as in the annexed Sevastopol and on the raid of the Syrian port of Tartus.
The main parade in the waters of the Neva River and the Gulf of Finland was attended by 4,000 military personnel and 46 vessels, including nuclear and diesel submarines, as well as helicopters and aircraft of the Marine Aviation.
Before the parade, Putin, accompanied by Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, Navy Commander-in-Chief Admiral Nikolai Evmenov, and Western Military District Commander Colonel-General Zhuravlev, toured several ships that were on the Kronstadt raid and in the Gulf of Finland, greeting the personnel.
The decoration of the parade was also a copy of the first Russian line ship, Poltava, recreated according to archival drawings.
Emperor Peter I took part in its design.
In his speech, Putin recalled that this year marks the 200th anniversary of the discovery of Antarctica as a result of an expedition by Russian sailors Faddey Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev.
Snipers providing security were seen on the roof of the Senate and Synod buildings during the parade.
More than 46 warships and more than 1.5 servicemen took part in the parade in Baltiysk, where the Baltic fleet is based, and the large warship Kaliningrad landed a naval landing.
A parade with the participation of 30 ships and a performance dedicated to the history of the Black Sea Fleet took place in the annexed Sevastopol, including the exit of a group of divers from under the water.
The parade in Severomorsk featured a new strategic nuclear submarine, Prince Vladimir, which was accepted into the Northern Fleet in June.
In Vladivostok the holiday ended with fireworks.
This year the Russian Navy will receive forty ships and vessels
Forty ships and vessels will join the Russian Navy this year, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced.
"The level of equipment of our military fleet is constantly growing.
This year, it will consist of forty ships and vessels of various classes, "he said, speaking at the main parade in honor of Navy Day in St. Petersburg.
Putin also recalled that six more new ships from the far sea zone were laid at three shipyards in Russia a few days ago.
Earlier it was reported that a parade in honor of Navy Day began in St. Petersburg.

How the Central Bank's decision to cut the key rate will affect the economy
The Bank of Russia was expected to cut its key rate again.
It fell by another 0.25 percentage points to 4.25% per annum - formally another historic low.
Judging by the return of the short rate cut step, as well as the tone of the Central Bank's statements and updated forecasts for the Russian economy, the regulator is more optimistic about the economic outlook than before.
This means that the current monetary policy easing cycle may soon stop.
"We continued easing monetary policy, primarily given that there are still risks of inflation falling down from 4% in 2021," said Bank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina.
They are associated with a significant decline in economic activity, a fall in domestic and external demand.
According to Nabiullina, economic recovery will take more than a year and a half.
At the same time, she noted that after the lifting of restrictions due to the pandemic, economic processes revived: energy consumption, consumer and investment demand recovered, construction and output of consumer goods expanded, and the annual rate of decline in freight turnover of transport and industrial production slowed.
According to the updated forecast of the Central Bank, in 2020 the economic contraction will be 4.5-5.5% (previously 4-6% was expected), and economic recovery growth in 2021 will be 3.5-4.5%, in 2022 - 2.5-3.5%.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised its forecast for annual oil prices to $38 and $40 per barrel of Urals in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
Previously, the Central Bank expected $27 and $35 per barrel.
Finally, the Bank of Russia's inflation forecast for 2020 was 3.7-4.2%, compared to the previously expected 3.8-4.8%.
The Bank of Russia's view on the economic situation is becoming more optimistic, which brings us closer to the end of the easing cycle, Renaissance Capital economists Sophia Donets and Andrey Melashchenko believe.
For example, the Bank of Russia has been consistently reducing its key rate for more than a year; since the beginning of last summer, it has already dropped by 3.5 percentage points.
And at the last meeting in June, the Central Bank lowered it immediately by one percentage point due to low inflation rates due to depressed demand and the need to stimulate the economy, which slowed down due to the pandemic and related restrictions.
Chances of fine-tuning monetary policy remain (at the next meeting on September 18 and until the end of the year), but the limit is already close, agrees Evgeny Koshelev, chief analyst at Rosbank.
A set of pro-inflationary risks also indicates the proximity of a pause in easing interest rates - broken supply chains, possible cost increases due to epidemic prevention measures, and a faster (compared to expectations) recovery in demand, he says.
To top it off, the Bank of Russia's subsequent actions will require more attention to inflation processes during the harvest season, as well as external volatility that has increased amid geopolitical conflicts, Koshelev points out.
One way or another, a reduction in the key rate will lead to a further reduction in rates for the most reliable borrowers, as well as, possibly, mortgages, says Maxim Petronevich, senior economist at the analytical department of Otkritie Bank.
The rate correction will be less pronounced than the key rate reduction, he clarifies.
Consumer loan rates may fall by another 0.3-0.6 percentage points during the second half of the year, mortgage rates may end the year in the range of 6.2-7%, BKS Premier economist Anton Pokatovich does not exclude.
Average deposit rates, in his opinion, will also fall - in the coming months they may fall to 4.2-4.5% (now barely above 4.5%).
Then they could fall to 4% if the Central Bank cuts its key rate in the fall, Pokatovich believes.
The centrist party promises to pay all its debts by the end of the year
The general secretary of the Centre Party Mikhail Korb spoke about this in an interview with ERR.
According to him, the total amount of payments that the party will have to make is about 300 000 euros.
"According to today's financial forecasts, the Centre Party will pay off its current debts and liabilities by the end of this year," Korb said.
Earlier it became known that the prime minister's party returned 110,100 euros to the state, which were recognized as a prohibited donation.
A car and a caravan collided in Harjumaa: four people were injured
According to police, the accident happened at 13: 50 in the village of Soodla, where a Mercedes-Benz car driven by a 31-year-old woman collided with a Fiat car caravan with a 48-year-old man driving.
The drivers of both vehicles were injured as a result of the incident, as well as passengers who were on wheels in the house: a 10-year-old child and a 48-year-old woman who was taken to hospital.
The rest of the victims were given first aid on the spot, and they did not need hospitalization.
The exact circumstances of what happened are being investigated.
Ukrainian military to monitor ceasefire in Donbass
The Ukrainian military has begun preparations for a ceasefire on the demarcation line in Donbass, and military personnel with experience in peacekeeping missions will monitor the implementation of the agreements, the United Forces headquarters said on Facebook.
"Units from the United Forces have begun preparations for a full and comprehensive ceasefire on the demarcation line, which comes into effect from 27 July 2020," the statement said.
It is noted that, starting at 00: 01 on July 27, at each of the Ukrainian positions, additional control over the ceasefire will be carried out by specially sent Ukrainian soldiers, the majority of whom have combat experience and were directly engaged in relevant issues during their participation in peacekeeping missions under the auspices of the UN.
Such a move would "not distract the personnel of United Forces units from carrying out combat missions and prevent possible provocations," the report says.
At a meeting of the contact group on Donbass held on Wednesday, the parties agreed on a set of additional measures to control the truce, which, among other things, includes a ban on the activities of subversive and reconnaissance groups and a ban on conducting fire, including sniper fire.

Psychologist: "Emelianenko still can't forget parting ways with his beloved woman."
Psychologist Veronika Stepanova, who has more than 1 million subscribers on Youtube, spoke about MMA fighter Alexander Emelianenko, who is her sister's ex-husband.
Olya met Sasha, they started to love violently, Stepanova said in a video on her Youtube channel.
"It was a very beautiful story, they instantly gave birth to a child, everything was beautiful and wonderful.
At some point Sasha was fed up with it all, he wanted to take a little walk.
And if any other woman treats it normally (well, you think, I went for a walk, to dance a little), then this is not about Olya.
She doesn't tolerate such things.
And his story about a little walk ended with his sister instantly marrying another person and immediately giving birth to a child.
When Sasha recovered from what had happened, he couldn't believe it.
He tried to crawl on his knees and give diamonds.
His lion's pride blew up his head.
He wanted to return everything, but he didn't understand how to return it.
They maintain friendly relations, they have a common child, but he still can't recover.
His destructive behaviour is a cry of despair, an attempt to either get killed or get her attention.
Carolina Avenue will leave to play in Sweden.
Carolina Avenue Jack Drury will compete in the Swedish championship next season, The Hockey News journalist Ryan Kennedy said on Twitter.
The USA youth team player played in the NCAA for Harvard last season.

Albert Proza signed a contract with Tallinn Legion
Proza's last club was Tartu's Tammeka, for which he played last season.
"I have been out of football for more than a year due to my injury.
He underwent surgery on April 30.
But now everything is fine - I am ready to play again.
However, so far my form is far from optimal.
When will I make my debut for Legion?
It is quite possible that on July 29 I will play some amount of time for the Estonian Cup, and on August 1 I will get into the bid for the championship match against Paide.
But everything depends on the decision of the coach, he will decide whether I am ready or not.
I myself believe that I still need to recruit quite a lot, "Albert Proza said in an interview with ERR on Sunday.
In the current Estonian football championship, Legion takes ninth place in the standings after 14 rounds with 10 points.
"At the moment, if you look at the table, we can't talk about fighting for high places, but Legion is an ambitious team, we have a fairly good squad.
I think that next year we will have better results.
And the task for this year is to keep a place in the top league and play more confidently, "Proza added.
"I don't set any personal goals for myself.
Returning to football after such a long pause is not easy.
Now my main task is to help the team stay in the top league and rise in the table as high as possible ," - said the striker.
Previously, Prose also played for the capital's Flora and Infonet, Finnish RoPS and TPS, and Maltese Valetta.
Proza played 7 matches for the Estonian national team.

The main naval parade was marked by new ships and shooting technologies
New shooting technology was used at the Main Naval Parade in St. Petersburg: a video camera "passed" under one of the ships, showing it "from the inside out."
From this perspective, the passage of the newest serial small rocket ship, Sovetsk, along the Admiralty Embankment, was captured.
The main naval parade was broadcast by the channel "Russia 1" and the site Russia.tv.
Earlier, on June 24, at a parade in honor of the 75th anniversary of the Great Victory, the camera "passed" through the barrel of a tank inside an armored car during the transition from one plan to another, and during the flight of fighters from the Russian Knights and Strizhi aerobatic groups, the camera "took off" from the nozzle of the aircraft's engine.
The main naval parade consisting of 46 warships, boats and submarines, 41 aircraft and helicopters of naval aviation and more than 4 thousand military personnel ended in the waters of Kronstadt.
The parade, in particular, involved the large anti-submarine ship Vice Admiral Kulakov, the corvette Stoyky, the large landing ships Minsk and Patriot, the nuclear submarine missile-carrying cruiser Orel, the submarine Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, the patrol ship Vasily Bykov, the small anti-submarine ships Kazanets and Urengoy, the small missile ships Liven and Passat, and the missile boat Chuvashia.
At the Kronstadt raid in the Gulf of Finland, it was possible to see for the first time the large landing ship, Pyotr Morgunov, built according to the project 11711 of the Nevsky PCB at the Baltic plant, Yantar.
The head ship of this series, Ivan Green, is already serving in the Northern Fleet, reports TASS.
Other newcomers to the Navy recently entered service included the first serial frigate, Admiral Kasatonov, built under Project 22350 at the Northern Shipyard.
Another newcomer to the Navy is the Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky diesel-electric submarine of Project 636.3 of the Rubin Marine Engineering Central Design Bureau, built at Admiralty Shipyards.
It joined Russia's Pacific Fleet in December 2019.
Other newest ships that have recently become part of the Navy are the small missile ships Sovetsk and Mytishchi of Project 22800 (Karakurt), developed by the Almaz Central Bank.
Small missile ships Veliky Ustyug and Serpukhov of Project 21631 Buyan-M also took part in the parade on the Neva River.
And the biggest participants were the nuclear submarine missile cruiser Orel and the large anti-submarine ship Vice Admiral Kulakov - they could be seen in the Gulf of Finland.
In recognition of the great contribution of the Russian fleet to the exploration of the World Ocean, two of the newest hydrographic boats, Georgy Zima and Mikhail Kazansky, passed along the Neva River along with warships. And on the Kronstadt raid, the oceanographic research vessel Admiral Vladimirsky, which completed in June a joint round-the-world scientific expedition with the Russian Geographical Society to the shores of Antarctica in honor of the 200th anniversary of its discovery by Russian sailors Faddey Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev.
And at the Palace Bridge you could see the first Russian line ship of the 16th century, Poltava, recreated at the historic shipyard.
This 54-gun sailboat was launched in 1712, participated in the war with the Swedes, and in 1717 provided landing on the island of Gotland.
In 1725, this ship was withdrawn from the Baltic Fleet, and after its reconstruction, it was launched in St. Petersburg on May 27, 2018.
Travel to Kronstadt this year was restricted for the duration of the parade due to the prevention of the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus, RIA Novosti reports.
1 person killed during US protests
Protests took place in Seattle, Portland, Louisville and Denver, "Actual Camera" reported on Sunday.
In Austin, Texas, a person died during a protest.
The protester was shot with a rifle while he was sitting in his car.
The criminal suspect has already been detained.
Demonstrators clashed with law enforcement officers in other cities.
Protesters rioted and police were forced to use tear gas and stun grenades.
Poll: Lithuania's ruling Union of Peasants and Greens tops party rating again
The Lithuanian Union of Peasants and Greens, which heads the ruling coalition of the Seimas, topped the rating of parties.
This was shown by a survey conducted by the sociological research company Vilmorus, commissioned by the newspaper Lietuvos rytas.
After winning the 2016 parliamentary elections, the "peasants" lost first place and for a long time the main critic of Russia in Lithuania, the opposition "Fatherland Union - Christian Democrats (conservatives), was leading.
Nevertheless, recently the President of Lithuania Gitanas Nauseda, assessing the electoral possibilities of the parties, stated that after this year's parliamentary elections the Union of Peasants and Greens could probably form a coalition again.
This statement caused indignation among conservatives.
The latest poll showed that if parliamentary elections were held today, 17.6 percent of voters would vote for farmers, and 17.2 percent for conservatives.
According to Vilmorus director Vladas Gaidis, the gap is within the margin of error, and yet the ruling parties have stopped lagging behind the conservatives.
According to Gaidis, the sociological success of the "peasants" was facilitated by the news that Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis will head their electoral list.
This politician was the first on the list of "peasants" in the 2016 elections.
In third place is the Social Democratic Party, for which 7.1 percent of respondents are now ready to vote.
During the mess, it suddenly lost 2 percent.
The fourth is the Labour Party, headed by businessman of Russian origin Viktor Uspasskikh (6.2 percent).
According to the poll, other political organizations will not be able to overcome the 5% electoral barrier yet.
Putin spoke about the unique advantages of the Russian fleet
Russian President Vladimir Putin said at the Main Naval Parade in St. Petersburg that the unique advantages and increased combat capabilities of the Russian fleet will be achieved through the introduction of advanced digital technologies.
As the head of state specified, domestic hypersonic attack systems and unmanned underwater vehicles have no analogues in the world.
In addition, the Russian leader drew attention to the most effective means of defence of the Russian Federation.
According to the Russian leader, the level of equipment of the Russian Navy is constantly growing, so this year it will accept 40 ships and vessels of various classes.
It is noted that the emphasis will be placed on equipping unique hypersonic shock systems.
Today, the Navy is armed with the latest ships equipped with high-precision weapons, strategic submarine cruisers and multipurpose submarines, as well as unique models of special equipment, the President added.
Putin also stressed that sailors perform the most difficult tasks with dignity, serving the Fatherland impeccably.
The Ministry of Emergency Situations warned residents of the Moscow region about a thunderstorm
Thunderstorm and wind gusts of up to 15 m / s are expected in the Moscow region. This was reported by the regional department of the Ministry of Emergency Situations on Sunday, July 26.
Residents are advised to remove household items from their yards and cut off dry trees that could cause damage to their homes.
The car must be placed in a garage or parked away from trees or poorly fortified structures.
To avoid a lightning strike, it is recommended not to heat the furnace in the house in a thunderstorm and not to use electrical appliances, and not to hide under trees (especially lonely ones) outside, not to swim in reservoirs.
Those in the car are advised to close their windows and stay inside.
On July 24, the Ministry of Emergency Situations also warned residents of the Moscow region about a thunderstorm.
Excess requirements for applications for public procurement will be excluded by law
The legislation may establish comprehensive requirements for applications for participation in procurement.
In the autumn session, at a plenary session, the State Duma plans to consider in the second reading a bill establishing requirements for the content and composition of an application for participation in a purchase, the participants of which can only be small and medium-sized businesses.
Amendments are being made by the government to the law "On procurement of goods, works, services by certain types of legal entities."
The bill was developed in pursuance of the roadmap for the implementation of the Strategy for the Development of Small and Medium Enterprises in the Russian Federation until 2030, approved by the government.
It provides for the preparation of a draft law on an exhaustive list of documents that customers have the right to demand as part of an application from procurement participants - small and medium-sized businesses.
And also - about the list of requirements for these documents.
Currently, the law "On procurement of goods, works, services by certain types of legal entities" regulates the procurement activities of certain types of legal entities.
Requirements for the content, form, registration and composition of an application for participation in a purchase are established by customers independently in the procurement documentation.
"As a result, customers establish excessive requirements for the content, registration of an application, the mandatory presence of certificates, certificates, extracts in its composition, the period of receipt of which in the authorized bodies is comparable to the period of submission of applications, which leads to the impossibility of participation in such a purchase and a reduction in the number of participants in the purchase," reads the explanation to the bill.
The new bill provides for the establishment of an exhaustive list of documents that customers have the right to demand as part of an application from procurement participants who are small and medium-sized businesses.
"The adoption of the document will eliminate the arbitrary establishment by customers of requirements for the composition and content of applications of participants who are small and medium-sized businesses," the explanatory note says.
As an artist, the relationship is very important to me.
In my works, I try to show that people are inseparable from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I first visited Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and there I saw icebergs.
I experienced reverent awe.
My heart beat faster, my head spun, trying to understand what opened up in front of me.
Icebergs around swam almost 200 feet out of the water. And I couldn't help but be surprised that it's one snowflake on top of another, year after year.
Icebergs are born when they break off from gletblack ice or break off from offshore glaciers.
Each iceberg has its own identity.
Everyone interacts with the environment in their own way and accumulates their own experience.
Some refuse to give up and hold on to the bitter end, while others can no longer fight and die in a fit of bright passion.
Looking at an iceberg, it's easy to think that it's isolated, that it's closed and alone, just as we humans often see ourselves.
But in life everything is very different.
When an iceberg melts, I inhale its ancient atmosphere.
When an iceberg melts, it releases fresh, mineral-enriched water that feeds many life forms.
I approach photographing these icebergs as creating portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these individual moments they exist in this image, and that it will never happen again.
They do not die when they melt; this is not the end, but the continuation of their path in the cycle of life.
Sometimes the ice in the icebergs I photograph is very young - it's only a couple of thousand years old.
And some icebergs are older than 100,000 years.
The last photos I want to show you show an iceberg I photographed in Kirtartivatziak, Greenland.
It's a very rare case to see an iceberg spin.
So here it is.
To the left you can see a small boat.
It is about 4.5 meters long.
Please pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and its place of contact with the water.
Here you can see how it starts to spin, and the boat swam to the other side, and there stands a man.
It's a medium-sized Greenland iceberg.
It protrudes from the water at about 120 feet or 40 meters.
But this recording is in real time.
(Music) And just like that, the iceberg shows us the other side of its personality.
Thank you.
(Applause)
One winter morning a few years ago, I was driving to work in Johannesburg, South Africa, and noticed fog hanging over the city.
I go there almost every day, so I hardly would have noticed it before.
Johannesburg is known for its special horizons, which I could hardly see that morning.
Soon I realized that it was a huge cloud of polluted air.
The contrast between my usual picturesque environment and that smog-shrouded sky stirred up something in me.
I was terrified that this city of colorful and picturesque sunsets would be swallowed up in darkness.
At that moment, I had a strong desire to do something, but I didn't know what.
I only knew that I could not stay away.
The main difficulty was that I didn't really understand ecology, air quality management or atmosphere chemistry.
I am a computer engineer and I was sure that I could not deal with this problem using code.
(Laughter) Who am I to somehow make a difference?
But I was a resident of this city.
In the following years, I learned one very important lesson: a lesson that needs to be taken seriously if we are to achieve a better future.
Even if you are not an expert in any field, your experience from the outside can be the key to solving complex problems in this area.
Sometimes your unique vision can result in an extraordinary idea that will move everything from a dead point, but you have to be brave enough to try to do it.
This is the only way out.
Back then, I realized that in order to at least try to make a difference, first I would have to understand air pollution, so I became a student again.
At the very beginning of my research, I learned that air pollution is the most important danger to the state of the environment.
According to the World Health Organization, almost 14 percent of deaths worldwide in 2012 were caused by air pollution in homes and air pollution, which is especially common in low- and middle-income countries.
Air pollution alone causes more deaths each year than malaria or HIV / AIDS.
In Africa, the number of premature deaths due to unsafe sanitary conditions or malnutrition among children cannot be compared to the number of deaths due to air pollution, and this costs huge economic costs: more than 400 billion US dollars as of 2013, according to a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
Now, in my work, I am exploring new opportunities in the field of artificial intelligence, where the symbiotic relationship between man and machine will help to find a favorable basis for making the right decisions.
In the process of studying the problem of air pollution, it became clear that we need to find a way to make more correct decisions to control air pollution, and given the scale of this problem, we need to do it through joint efforts.
So I decided to meet people who work in this field.
I started meeting with officials from Johannesburg and other nearby cities, I also got involved with the local scientific community, and also made some cold calls.
The process of establishing contacts that I started helped me get a deeper understanding of the problem.
It also helped me not to fall into the trap that my colleagues often fall into when trying to innovate, when we quickly apply technology before we clearly realize the problem.
I started thinking about what I could do to improve the situation.
I just started asking myself how I could effectively combine all my programming and artificial intelligence skills with the experience of the people I met.
I wanted to create an online platform to regulate air quality, which will identify patterns in pollution, look to the future and determine what we should expect.
I intended to put my idea into practice, but faced with uncertainty, I had no guarantees of success.
I only had a certain set of engineering skills, skills that I had acquired in my profession (Laughter) and that people dealing with air pollution for many years did not have.
I realized that sometimes just one fresh look, some new skills create the conditions for the emergence of something outstanding.
Willpower and imagination are our guiding star, giving us the ability to find new ways and bypass difficulties.
Armed with a deep understanding of the problem of air pollution and studying information accumulated for decades about the concentration of pollutants and meteorological conditions in Johannesburg and beyond, my colleagues from South Africa and China and I created a support system for making decisions about the air that is in the cloud.
The software system analyzes historical data and data in real time to identify spatial and temporal trends.
We then used new machine learning technology to predict pollution levels for different pollutants several days in advance.
This means that residents can make better decisions about their movements and their choice of residence for their families.
We will be able to predict cases of pollution in advance, to calculate the culprits of pollution, who, by order of the authorities, will be forced to reduce the scale of their activities.
With the help of scenario planning, urban planners will be able to make the right decisions in the development of infrastructure, such as residential settlements and industrial zones.
We completed testing of our technology, which lasted about 120 days, covering all of South Africa.
The results were approved when we demonstrated a close relationship between forecast data and on-site data.
Thanks to our leadership, we have created advanced, innovative technologies that can predict air quality with unprecedented accuracy, improving the city, which not so long ago I was driving one winter morning and thought: "Something is wrong here.
And here's my conclusion: what if I hadn't studied the problem of air pollution then?
What if I hadn't expressed concern about the state of the environment and just hoped that someone somewhere is already dealing with this problem?
Here's what I learned: when we embark on a complex enterprise that promotes something we firmly believe in, it's important to focus on success and take into account the consequences of inaction.
We should not go out of the way in the face of obstacles and difficulties, it should motivate us even more.
Wherever you are, when you realize that your natural curiosity is excited by something and that's what excites you, and you have crazy and bold ideas, and perhaps that's beyond your competence, ask yourself: why not?
Why not start acting and solve the problem, as you can, in your own way?
And, perhaps, you will be pleasantly surprised.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Republicans will propose to issue another $1 trillion to support the US economy
Republicans will propose spending another $1 trillion to support the United States economy, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin confirmed on Fox News on Sunday, July 26.
"Inside the $1 trillion package there are the most priority and urgent things ," the head of the US Treasury noted.
The support package includes new direct payments to Americans.
The proposal must be accepted by Congress and signed by US President Donald Trump.
Representatives of the US Democratic Party believe that the proposed funds are insufficient.
In the spring, the United States allocated about $3 trillion to support the economy.
On April 24, Trump signed a bill to help the American economy in the amount of almost half a trillion dollars to fight the coronavirus and its consequences.
According to analysts, US GDP will fall by 25% in annual terms in the second quarter of 2020, which will be the strongest decline in the country's history.
Microsoft will forcibly update old versions of Windows 10
Microsoft confirmed the transition to the next stage of distribution of the May 2020 Update for the Windows 10 operating system, BetaNews reported on July 25.
No package needed: FAS questioned the legality of Microsoft's antivirus offer
Having received software for remote work from an American corporation, government agencies may violate the law
The company will expand the range of users with the new OS version.
To do this, it was decided to automatically update computers with older versions of the system.
It is assumed that an algorithm specially developed by the company will identify devices with older versions of the software platform, whose support period will soon end, and will automatically install Windows 10 May 2020 Update on them.
In the near future, this will affect computers with Windows 10 (1809) and Windows 10 (1903), whose support expires on November 10 and December 8, respectively, the publication notes.
On July 21, it was reported that after updating the Windows 10 operating system, users faced problems connecting to the Internet - there was no access to the network.
The difficulties were not related to the connection itself, but to the status of the connection.
Dr Butcher named the main indicators of human health
In the "deadly quartet" one of the main criteria was exceeding waist volume
Doctor and TV host Alexander Myasnikov spoke about the key indicators by which it is possible to determine a person's health.
His so-called "death quartet" included four criteria - an increase in blood pressure, cholesterol, sugar and waist volume, the doctor said on the TV channel "Russia 1."
Butcher urged everyone to pay attention to these factors.
Moreover, according to him, controlling waist volume is even more important than weight.
For men this parameter should not exceed 102 centimeters, for women - 88 centimeters.
Exceeding these norms may indicate that health is at risk.
First of all, we are talking about the state of the heart: waist volume above normal is a risk factor for stroke, heart attack, and cancer and diabetes.
Earlier, Butcher explained why you can eat candy overnight.
The doctor explained that sugar itself is not dangerous to health, dessert will only become harmful when there is such food in large quantities, and candy overnight, in his words, is not the worst snack.
The winners in Touring and Super Production were determined at Igor Drive
Touring and Super Production competitions ended at the Igora Drive circuit, where the main stage of the Russian ring race series takes place.
Channel 5 reported this on Sunday, July 26.
The leaders in Touring were Kirill Ladygin, Dmitry Bragin, Alexey Dudukalo, Pavel Kalmanovich, Ivan Lukashevich.
Andrey Petukhov, Vladislav Nezvankin, Nikolay Vikhansky, Vadim Antipov, Dmitry Lebedev won Super Production.
Rustam Fathutdinov became the best in the NSR RSCG Trophy, Lev Tolkachev and Pavel Yashin became the winners.
The documentary "John Lewis: Good Trouble" was released online.
The film biography, which was supposed to be a kind of visual greeting to Congressman John Lewis, who celebrated his 80th birthday at the beginning of the year, became a detailed epitaph.
On July 17, the prominent human rights activist and politician died after a long battle with pancreatic cancer.
Numerous funeral events in memory of him are being held in the United States these days.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows have put forward the idea of passing a law focused on several topics, including federal unemployment payments that expire on Friday.
The rest of the issues are proposed to be dealt with later.
Moderna Inc said on Sunday it received an additional $472 million from the U.S. Department of Higher Biomedical Research to develop a vaccine for the new coronavirus.
The US-based drug company explained that the additional funding is intended to help the company work in late stage clinical trials.
Without any warning, the UK removed Spain from the list of countries safe for travel and introduced a two-week quarantine for everyone entering the country from Spain.
British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab did not apologize for the sudden decision, explaining it as a recent jump in COVID-19 cases in Spain.
Protests
Protests have taken place in several cities in the United States in order to draw attention to the problem of racial injustice.
In Seattle, police used stun grenades and tear gas and arrested 45 people after demonstrations in support of protests in Portland turned into violence.
Police said more than 20 police officers were injured.
A man died in Austin, Texas, on Saturday when someone shot at Black Lives Matter marchers.
According to media reports, the man may have approached the car with a rifle when he was fired upon.
US experts call Pompeo the worst secretary of state in the country's history
International affairs experts Aaron David Miller and Richard Sokolsky named Mike Pompeo as the worst secretary of state in the history of the United States.
The material with their opinion was published by CNN on July 23.
"In just two short years, Mike Pompeo - with an eye to the presidency in 2024 and support for President Donald Trump - has become not only the worst secretary of state in US history, but also the most politically biased," the text says.
Experts accused Pompeo of "politicizing the position of secretary of state and desecrating the institution he runs" to advance his personal political agenda and protect Trump "from responsibility and the rule of law."
According to them, the Secretary of State, in particular, is covering up the "Trumpian blackmail of Ukraine" and is ready to substitute employees of the American foreign policy department for their cooperation with Congress in this case.
Furthermore, Pompeo was reminded that he was pretty friendly with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who claimed partial responsibility for the killing of The Washington Post columnist Jamal Hashkaji.
Trump announced the decision to appoint Mike Pompeo as head of the State Department on March 13, 2018, following the dismissal of former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.
Prior to this, Pompeo headed the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
A foreign car entered a shop in Tikhoretsk
Today, July 26, in Tikhoretsk on Menshikov Street, a Land Cruiser SUV drove into the sales hall of a chain supermarket at speed.
The emergency was recorded by surveillance cameras.
A boy who was in the shop at that time was injured as a result of the accident.
The child was hospitalized with injuries and cuts.
Showcases and counters were destroyed in the hall of the shopping facility.
Eyewitnesses claim that the driver of the foreign car was intoxicated.
Do you know how many species of flowering plants exist?
A quarter of a million - at least those we know - a quarter of a million species of flowering plants.
Flowers are a real problem for plants:
It's hard to create them,
They require a huge amount of energy and resources.
Why do plants go to such difficulties?
The answer to this, like many other questions, is sex.
I know what you're thinking when you look at these pictures.
The reason sexual reproduction is so important is that there are many other ways plants breed.
They can be multiplied by cuttings; they can fertilize themselves or pollinate themselves.
But it's very important for them to spread their genes in order to mix them with those of other plants - so they can adapt to natural niches.
This is how evolution works.
Plants transmit genetic information through pollen.
Some of you may have seen some of these images before.
As I like to say, every house has to have a raster electron microscope to look at these things.
There are as many different types of pollen as flowering plants.
By the way, this can be applied in criminology and beyond.
Basically, the pollen that causes allergies is the pollen of plants that use the wind to spread it. It's a very inefficient process, that's why it gets so badly clogged in our noses.
Plants have to eject huge masses of pollen in the hope that the germ cells, the male germ cells contained in the pollen, somehow accidentally reach another flower, absolutely by accident.
The pollen of all herbs, and therefore all crops, and the pollen of most of the trees, is carried by the wind.
To some extent, this is more reasonable because less pollen is required.
Insects and other species can take pollen and transfer it to where it is needed.
Clearly, we know the relationship between insects and plants.
It's a symbiotic relationship - whether it's flies, birds or bees - they all get something in return, and that something is usually nectar.
In some cases, this symbiosis has led to amazing adaptations - for example, the mole hawk hummingbird is beautiful in its adaptation.
The plant gets its own - the hawk moth spreads pollen elsewhere.
The plants evolved so that they created small landing strips in different places for the bees not to get lost.
Many plants have a colour that makes them look like insects.
These are lily dusters, cleverly made so that when an unsuspecting insect sits on them, the duster flips over and hits it on the back, showering with a large amount of pollen, with which the insect then goes to another plant.
In a sense, it has them, which forces the insect to crawl out, covered in pollen, which it will then spread.
There are at least 20 thousand species of orchids - and they are all surprisingly diverse.
They go for a variety of tricks.
They are forced to attract pollinators in order to multiply.
This orchid, known as Darwin's orchid, because it was he who studied it and made a startling prediction when he saw it. You can see a very long tube with nectar falling from the orchid.
You see the middle of a flower: the insect must stick its proboscis directly into the middle and reach the bottom of this tube to get nectar.
Darwin claimed, looking at this flower, "I assume something evolved with it."
Indeed, this is an insect.
Usually his proboscis is curled, but in its straightened shape it looks like this.
One might think that if nectar - so valuable and expensive to produce - attracts so much attention from pollinators, then, as with sex in humans, deceptions can begin.
A flower can say, "I have some nectar.
Take a look? "Here is a plant.
This is a plant that insects in South Africa adore. During evolution, they acquired a long proboscis to get nectar from the bottom.
And this is imitation.
This plant imitates the previous one.
And here's the long-proboscis fly, which didn't get a drop of nectar from the fake. Because the imitating plant didn't give it anything.
But the fly not only did not receive nectar from the fake plant, but also - if you bring it closer - in the area of the lower part of its head, took a little pollen, which it will transfer to another plant, unless some botanist appears and jokes it on pigeon cardboard.
(Laughter) Deception also spreads in the plant kingdom.
This flower has black dots: they seem black to us, but for male insects of a certain species, they look like two females ready for anything.
(Laughter) When an insect reaches this flower and lands on it, it dips itself into pollen, which, of course, it will transfer to another plant. If you look at the same raster electron microscope that should be in every house, you can observe here a certain three-dimensional pattern layout.
So it probably even brings a pleasant feeling to the insect, except that it looks attractive.
The picture from an electron microscope - an orchid imitating an insect - shows that different parts of this structure have different colors and textures, but insects can perceive them in a completely different way.
This plant has adapted to emulate the shiny metal surface of the body of some beetles.
A raster electron microscope shows that the surface is very different from the surfaces we looked at.
Sometimes the whole plant imitates an insect, even from our point of view.
I think it looks like some kind of flying creature.
It's an amazing, amazing flower.
And smart. It's called obsidian.
I call him a cunning.
For a bee of a certain species it resembles another very aggressive bee, and it flies up and hits its head many times to drive away the "bee," and, of course, is covered in pollen.
This plant also imitates another orchid, which has a wonderful food depot for insects.
But this one has nothing for them.
So she's cheating on two levels - just unheard of.
(Laughter) Here is ylang-ylang, a component of many perfume products.
I recently sniffed at someone who scolded them.
In principle, flowers don't need to be so fragrant.
They emit a striking range of smells for any insect with a sense of smell.
But it doesn't smell so good.
It's a flower that smells very, very bad, and it evolved to look like a fall.
The flies really like it.
They fly in and pollinate.
This one, helicodiceros, also known as the "dead horse lily."
I don't know how a dead horse really smells, but this one definitely smells very similar.
It's really horrible.
And meat flies just can't resist.
They fly inside and reach the bottom.
There they lay eggs, thinking that this is a great piece fell, and not realizing that there is no food for the larvae and the larvae will die, but in the meantime the plant has benefited because the bristles relax and the fly flies away to pollinate the next flower.
Here is arum, arum waste paper, or in the United States - aronnik spotted.
I took a picture of him the previous week in Dorset.
It warms up about 15 degrees above ambient temperature - amazing.
If you look at it from above, you can see something similar to a dam behind the cob. The flies are attracted by the heat - the evaporation of volatile compounds - and they get stuck below in this container.
They drink divine nectar and become sticky.
Overnight they are covered in pollen flowing from above and then the bristles we saw above weaken and release the flies covered in pollen.
If you think it's amazing, then here's one of my favorites.
Philodendron Sello.
Those from Brazil should know about this plant.
It's the most amazing thing.
This phallic thing is about 30 centimeters long.
It does something that no other plant I know does: when it blooms - in the middle of the cob - for about two days, its metabolism is similar to that of mammals.
Instead of starch, which is food for plants, it takes something similar to brown fat and burns it at such a rate, digests it just like a small cat.
This energy return, equivalent to weight, is twice as high as that of a hummingbird - absolutely amazing.
And it also does something else, also unusual.
It not only warms itself up to 115 Fahrenheit, or 43-44 Celsius, for two days, but also keeps the temperature constant.
It has a thermoregulation mechanism that maintains a constant temperature.
You ask, "Why is he doing this?"
Well, as if you didn't know there were beetles that just love making love at this temperature.
They climb inside and that's where it starts.
(Laughter) And the plant showered them with pollen and they went to pollinate.
Surprisingly invented.
Most of the pollinators we know are insects, but in the tropics also many birds and butterflies pollinate.
Many tropical flowers are red, and it seems to us that all this is because butterflies and birds have a similar vision to ours, and that they see red very well.
But if you look at the spectrum, man and bird see red, green and blue - they see this spectrum.
Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet light, and they distinguish between different shades of ultraviolet light,
Which are at this end of the spectrum.
You probably think, "It would be great if we could see them."
Yes, we can.
So what does the insect see?
Last week I took these photos of the sun colours, the incense family, in Dorset.
These are the very small yellow flowers that we see everywhere.
This is how it looks in daylight.
But this is how it looks if you remove the red.
Most bees do not see red.
Then I put ultraviolet filters on the camera and did a very, very long exposure with certain ultraviolet frequencies, and that's what happened.
The most "bullseye" is.
Of course, we know exactly what bees see, no more than you know what I see when I call it red.
We can't say what's going on in our neighbor's mind, we're not talking about an insect anymore.
But the picture will be about as contrasting, standing out in the background.
Here is another small flower - a different ultraviolet frequency range, different filters, to match pollinators.
They will see something like this.
In case you think it applies to all the yellows - not a single flower was damaged during the shooting, this one was just attached to a tripod, not torn - when they are in ultraviolet light, then take a look at this one.
By the way, it could serve as the basis for sunscreen, because such creams work by absorbing ultraviolet light.
Maybe this compound would be useful.
Finally, here's one of the enoters that Bjorn Rorslett from Norway sent me - a fantastic hidden pattern.
I like the idea of something hidden.
These photos were taken with an ultraviolet filter, which is mainly used by astronomers to shoot Venus - actually clouds of Venus.
This is the main purpose of this filter.
Venus, of course, is the goddess of love and fertility, and this is in tune with flowers.
Flowers not only spend a lot of effort attracting pollinators, they also somehow managed to convince us to plant whole fields of flowers and give them to each other in moments of birth and death, and, in particular, to a wedding, which, if you think about it, is a moment embodying the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another.
Many thanks.
(Applause)
The third flood in a year occurred on the Yangtze River in China
After a heavy downpour in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River - China's longest waterway - floods arose for the third time in a year.
The flooding was caused by an increase in the water level in the tributaries of the river in its upper reaches, which led to a rapid increase in the flow of water into the reservoir of the Chinese hydroelectric power station Sangxia / Three Gorges /.
At 14: 00 on July 26, an inflow of 50 thousand cubic meters / s was observed in the reservoir, which is expected to reach its maximum of 60 thousand cubic meters / s in the evening of July 27, the Yangtze River Water Management Committee under the Ministry of Water Management of China reported.
The committee today issued flood warnings in one of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and overflow of the Sangxia hydroelectric station reservoir.
My job is to help computers make messages about the world around them.
There are many ways to do this, but I like helping computers talk about what they see and understand.
For example, in this picture, a modern computer vision algorithm can recognize that it is a woman and it is a dog.
He can say that the woman is smiling.
He can even say that the dog is unusually cute.
I work on this thinking about how people understand and process data about the world.
What thoughts, memories and stories can such a picture awaken in people.
Everything related to such situations.
You may have seen a similar dog before or spent time also running along the beach, and this in turn evokes thoughts and memories of the past vacation, the time spent on the beach, or the time when you ran somewhere with other dogs.
One of my main principles is to help computers understand what it means to have such an experience, to understand what we share, what we believe and what we feel, because then we will be ready to start involving computer technology in processes that complement our own experience.
If you dig deeper, a few years ago I started helping computers write stories based on a series of images.
And one day, while working, I asked a computer what he thought about going to Australia.
He looked at the pictures and saw the koala.
He didn't know what a koala was, but he said he considered it a curious creature.
Then I shared with him a series of images of burning houses.
He looked at the pictures and said: "Amazing view! Awesome!"
Goosebumps ran down my back.
He looked at a terrible, life-destroying event and thought it was something positive.
I realized that he recognized contrasts, shades of red and yellow and thought that it deserved a positive assessment.
He did it in part because most of the images I gave him were positive.
Because people tend to share positive images when they talk about their experiences.
When was the last time you saw a selfie at a funeral?
I realized that by improving artificial intelligence, task after task, array of data after array, I created huge gaps, holes and gaps in what he could understand.
And in doing that, I encoded every possible kind of prejudice.
Prejudices that reflect a limited vision, limited to a single set of data - gaps that reflect human biases encoded in data, such as bias and stereotypes.
I thought about the evolution of technology that led me to where I ended up - how the first color photos were calibrated on the skin of white women, which means that color photos were not adapted to dark faces.
And the same prejudice, the same gap was observed in the 90s.
And we still have the same gap in information today in how well we can recognize various human faces using facial recognition technology.
I was thinking about the latest research where we tend to limit our thinking to one set of data and one problem.
And in doing so, we created more and more gaps and biases that AI could develop even more.
I realized that we need to think more about what the technologies we are working with today will look like in 5 and 10 years.
Humanity evolves slowly, eventually correcting problems in the interaction between people and the environment.
Artificial intelligence, by contrast, is evolving at an incredible rate.
And that means it's really important to think carefully about it right now - to reflect on our own gaps, our own biases and how it affects the technologies we create and to discuss what modern technologies will mean in the future.
Top managers and scientists around the world are talking about what they think artificial intelligence will be like in the future.
Stephen Hawking warns: "AI can end humanity."
Elon Musk warns that this is one of the greatest existential risks our civilization has ever faced.
Bill Gates wonders: "I don't understand why people aren't concerned."
But these opinions are only part of the story.
Mathematics, models, the fundamental bricks of artificial intelligence are what we call access and what we work with.
We have open source tools for machine learning and intelligence that we are willing to share.
And beyond that, we can share our experience.
Share your knowledge of technology and how it worries us and how it concerns us.
We can discuss what we love.
We can foresee which aspects of technology could eventually become the most useful and which the most problematic.
If we all focus on an open dialogue about AI in the future, it will help create an atmosphere of shared awareness about what AI is now, what it can become, and what we need to do to get the most suitable result for us.
We already see and know all this about the technologies used today.
We use smartphones, digital assistants and robot vacuum cleaners.
Are they evil?
Maybe sometimes.
Are they useful?
Of course.
And they're all different.
And in them you already see a ray of light illuminating our future.
The future begins with what we are creating and building right now.
We are launching a domino effect that will determine the path of AI development.
Right now, we are shaping the AI of the future.
Technologies that immerse us in augmented realities bring past worlds back to life.
Technologies that help people share experiences when they have difficulty communicating.
Technologies based on understanding streaming visual worlds are used for driverless cars.
Technologies based on image understanding and language generation are turning into technologies that help visually impaired people better access the visual world.
But we also see how technology can lead to problems.
Today we have technology that analyzes our innate physical characteristics - such as skin colour or facial features - to determine if we can be criminals or terrorists.
We have technology that analyzes data about us, even data like gender or race, to determine if we can get a loan.
All we see now is just one shot from the evolution of artificial intelligence.
Because where we are now is just a moment of this evolution.
This means that everything we do today will have an impact on our future.
If we want AI to develop to help humans, we must identify the goals and strategies that will set this path now.
I would like to see something that suits people well and combines with our culture and environment.
Technologies that help those of us who suffer from neurological or other diseases to make life equally difficult for everyone.
Technologies that work regardless of your skin color or demographic characteristics.
Today, I am focused on the technologies that will be with us tomorrow and in 10 years.
AI can become anything.
But in this case it is not a self-driving car without a final destination.
We control this machine.
We choose when to accelerate and when to slow down.
We choose when we need to turn.
We choose what the AI of the future will be like.
There are countless things that artificial intelligence can become.
And it will become a lot of things.
And our task today is to find out exactly what we need to invest in AI, so that the results obtained become the best for all of us.
Thank you

The head of Dagestan Vladimir Vasilyev held a meeting with the current UFC lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov, the website of the head of the republic reports.
The reason was the sports facilities, in the construction of which the late father of the champion, Honored Coach of Russia Abdulmanap Nurmagomedov, showed great interest.
We are talking about a sports complex in the village of Dubki, Kazbekovsky District, and a martial arts training center in the village of Sildi, Tsumadi District.
First of all, Vladimir Vasilyev noted that now the construction of these sports facilities is also a tribute to the great coach.
Father of baby kidnapped in Salsk reveals details of incident
The father of a newborn kidnapped from a maternity hospital in Salsk, Rostov region, revealed details of the incident.
Alexander Rusikov told TV channel 360 that the kidnapper entered his wife's ward when she was about to go to the toilet.
The mother of the kidnapped baby could not have thought that a person with malicious intent could be in the maternity hospital.
The woman walked just a couple of metres away from the ward when she heard a neighbor screaming.
The baby was no longer in the ward.
According to Rusikov, everything happened between three and four o'clock in the morning.
He also said that the couple's ward is located between two medical posts, but there were no nurses at the scene at the time of the incident.
Also, the father of the kidnapped baby said that there was no comment or apology from the hospital staff.
Recall that the newborn boy, who was kidnapped on Saturday from a maternity hospital in Salsk, was found on the same day in the Republic of Kalmykia.
Police have detained a 40-year-old kidnapping suspect.
The child has already been returned to his mother.
Medics took tests from the baby to make sure he was healthy and not injured.

The expert assessed the role of vitamins in the formation of immunity
Chief freelance specialist in primary health care for the adult population of the Moscow Department of Health Andrey Heavilnikov assessed the role of vitamins in the formation of immunity.
"It is impossible to create a stable immunity with extrodoses of any drugs, vitamins, or food products in a very short time ," he said in an interview with the radio station" Moscow Speaks ."
According to him, there are certain rules.
For example, in summer it is better to spend more time outdoors, including under the sun.
Heavilnikov also noted that in the summer, if possible, it is necessary to consume a large amount of seasonal fresh vegetables and fruits.
"This generally strengthens immunity, provides a certain supply of vitamins and a certain supply of health," he added.
Earlier, Heavilnikov mentioned several differences between flu and coronavirus.
Russia has registered 5,765 COVID-19 patients per day

Head of the region Igor Kobzev met with mayors of Ust-Horde Buryat district
During the working meeting, which took place today, July 24, the government of Irkutsk region discussed the main directions of development of remote agricultural areas.
During work trips to the regions of the Ust-Horde Buryat District, the head of the region gave a number of instructions.
Today the mayors reported on their implementation.
First of all, construction of the Sports House in Ust-Orda was resumed.
The order on this object was given by the President of the Russian Federation fourteen years ago.
But only now the situation has been resolved.
866 million rubles will be spent on construction.
The deadline for delivery of the structure is 2022.
A school in the village of Bayandai should be put into operation this year.
At the moment, finishing of the premises has been completed.
The remaining works include landscaping.
In general, the program for the construction of pre-school and secondary education facilities is of particular importance for the region.
For your district - especially.
The demographic situation here is the best in the region.
And we must create all the conditions for education and leisure for children of all ages, said Igor Kobzev, Acting Governor of Irkutsk Region.
At the meeting, the head of the region instructed all mayors to get actively involved in the development of general plans for settlements.
This is one of the main conditions for the integrated development of the district.
All settlements must have established borders and a master plan.
This is necessary for the development of the territory, for the construction of socially significant facilities, as well as infrastructure and cultural heritage, the head of the region emphasized.
Also, during the conversation, a problematic issue was raised with a 30% reduction in milk intake from cooperatives.
This was due to the redistribution by the processing enterprise of milk purchase in favor of peasant farms.
Because of this, the share of acceptance of products from cooperatives decreased.
The head of the region instructed the acting minister of agriculture to go to the place, study the structure of milk sales, analyze the experience of other territories and identify solutions to the problem.
Kuzminov won two races of the second stage of the NSR RSCG on Igora Drive.
The second race of the second stage of the NSR RSCG championship took place at Igora Drive.
Pavel Kuzminov won the second consecutive victory.
He started fifth, but already in the first round he took the lead.
Alexander Dudarev, who became second, rose from sixth position.
Sergei Tikhomirov lost his position, repelled Alexander Chernyak's attacks and first secured third place, but received a drive through penalty and dropped out of the podium after driving through the pitlane.
The third was Ivan Pugachev, who played five positions.
Moscow Region authorities spoke about the fate of closed landfills
Solid household waste landfills continue to be closed in the Moscow region.
This year, the authorities promise to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 landfills that existed in the region are being modernized into modern waste processing complexes.
But this option is not possible for every landfill - many of them have acquired dense residential development.
After the landfill is closed, it stands up for reclamation: the body of the landfill is covered with soil, degassing and infiltration systems are installed.
This makes it possible to stop chemical processes inside the landfill, so that it does not ignite, does not emit a stench, does not poison the soil and groundwater.
And then the former landfill is left to rise in a useless pile among the residential development surrounding it.
Why not make it something useful?
For example, in Ruza, where the reclamation of the "Annino" landfill was completed just a few days ago, the authorities are considering an option to make a ski slope out of a heap.
This landfill, which was in operation from 1976 to 2016, grew so that it went beyond the boundaries of the land allocated for it.
Therefore, during the reclamation, it was necessary to buy out neighboring areas, de facto long ago clogged with garbage.
"Some time will pass, the training ground will" sit down ," there will be fortresses, and we will think about what can be done to make it start to benefit.
A ski resort is striking, "the head of the Ruz district, Nikolai Parfenov, told reporters.
Two test sites to become renewable energy production sites
The Torbeevo landfills in Lyubertsy and Timokhovo in Bogorodsky District will become sites for the extraction of renewable energy sources from landfill and biological gases.
By the end of the year, a gas-piston power plant will be launched on the territory of Torbeyev, capable of generating up to 8 million kilowatt-hours of electricity and about 0.95 gigacalories of thermal energy per year, which will meet the landfill's own needs - heat supply to administrative and production facilities.
Timokhovo will produce 72.5 million kilowatt-hours and will continue to operate as a waste processing complex.
A museum could be created at Balashikha's Kucino training ground, which was closed after complaints from residents about Direct Line with the country's president.
"There was such an idea - to create a museum of reclamation of landfills in the Moscow region," - said the deputy chairman of the government - the minister of ecology and nature management of the region Dmitry Kurakin.
Israel reports drone crash in southern Lebanon
An Israeli army unmanned aerial vehicle fell in southern Lebanon.
The military said it collapsed "during operational activities."
The cause of the crash has not been reported.
"Some time ago, during operational activities near the border with Lebanon, an unmanned aerial vehicle of the Israeli army fell on Lebanese territory.
There is no risk of information leakage, "the Israeli army said on Twitter.
Recall that this week the Israeli army decided to strengthen its military units on the border with Lebanon, fearing revenge of the Lebanese movement "Hezbollah" for the killing of its fighters in Syria.
Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah promised not to leave unanswered the death of any of his "brothers."
Read more about the situation in the Kommersant article "Israel is waiting for Hezbollah's revenge."
Furgal's replacement comes out to protesters for the first time
For the first time since his appointment, the acting governor of Khabarovsk Krai, Mikhail Degtyarev, has reached out to protesters in support of the arrested former head of the region, Sergei Furgal.
The meeting was broadcast on his Instagram page.
"Moscow hears everyone, so it sent you acting so that the region would not slip up without power. I repeat about Furgal once again: he is" a "- my comrade," b "- a party member," c "- I am very worried about his fate, the party is helping him, handing him food, Zhirinovsky is knocking on all the offices," - said the acting governor
According to Degtyarev, now Khabarovsk Krai cannot be left without a leader, so he was appointed to the post of head of the region by decree of President Vladimir Putin, so that "the wonderful building (the government of the region) would function, everything would work, the budget would be spent on social needs."
The acting governor explained that he had not visited the protesters before, because he could not communicate with thousands of demonstrators.
Therefore, he broadcasts on social networks and reads all the comments on them.
On July 25, two consecutive protests took place in Khabarovsk.
Rallies in support of the former governor have been taking place in the region since July 11.
On the eve of the next rally, Mikhail Degtyarev announced that he would leave the city on the day of the rally.
His motorcade was stopped by protesters and called to speak about the fate of the arrested ex-governor Furgal.
Degtyarev had previously refused to go out to the protesters.
"There's something the manager really has to do here than go out and communicate with those shouting under the windows," said the acting governor.
Today I would like to show you how we will do different things in the future.
I believe that soon our buildings and cars will be self-assembling, will reproduce and fix themselves.
So, I am going to show you what I consider to be the current stage of industrial development, and then compare it with some natural systems.
So, at the current stage of industrial development, we have skyscrapers - 2.5 years, from 500,000 to one million parts, quite complex, new amazing technologies in steel, concrete and glass.
We have amazing vehicles that can take us into space - 5 years, 2.5 million parts.
But on the other hand, if you look at natural systems, we see the proteins of two million species that can gather in 10,000 nanoseconds, or a DNA chain with three billion main pairs that we can copy in about an hour.
So, natural systems, for all their complexity, are extremely effective, far more effective than anything we can build, far more complex than anything we can build.
They are much more energy-efficient.
They are almost never wrong.
And they can recover for a long life.
So, there is something very interesting about natural systems.
And if we can bring that into our man-made environment, our way of creating things will have tremendous potential.
And I think the key is self-assembly.
So, if we want to use self-assembly in our physical environment, I think we need to take into account four key factors.
First, we need to decipher the complexity of what we want to build - our buildings and cars.
And it is necessary to put them into a simple sequence - the basic DNA of construction processes.
Then we need programmable parts that can understand this sequence and use it to curl up or reassemble.
We will need some amount of energy that will enable all of this to be activated and make parts capable of gathering under the program.
And we need some kind of backup error correction system to ensure we successfully build what we want.
I am going to show you several projects that my colleagues from EmIT and I are working on to achieve this self-gathering future.
The first two are MacroBot and DeciBot.
These are projects - large-scale reconfigurable robots - 2.5 and 3.5 meter proteins.
Mechanical electrical devices and sensors are built into them.
You paint what you need to curl up into a sequence of corners - minus 120, minus 120, 0, 0, 120, minus 120 - something like that; a sequence of corners or turns, and you send that sequence by cord.
Each block receives its own message - minus 120. It turns to this angle, checks if everything is correct and transmits information to its neighbor.
And they are brilliant scientists, engineers, designers who worked on this project.
And I think it actually reveals the question: are other scales possible here?
I mean, thousands of dollars, many man-hours to make this 2.5 meter robot.
Can we actually scale up? Can we actually embed robotics in every part?
The next project solves this issue, considers it passive or tries to get modification programmability passively.
But he goes one step further and tries to get a real calculation.
It is based on the most fundamental building block of computing, the logical element of a digital integrated circuit directly in each part.
It's an "I-NOT" element.
You have one tetrahedron - an element that will do all the calculations, and two tetrahedrons for input.
One for the user to enter information is the way you put bricks.
Another for information from the previous laid brick.
And then it displays information in three-dimensional space.
So, this means that the user can start moving the bricks in the right direction.
His calculations are based on what was done before and what you told him to do.
And now it starts to move in three-dimensional space - up or down.
On the left side, [1.1] the input is 0 on the output, moving down.
On the right side, [0.0] input is 1 on the output, which means upward movement.
And what really matters is that our structures now contain drawings of what we want to build.
They contain all the information about what was built.
So, it means that we have some form of self-reproduction.
In this case, I call it self-driving reproduction, because the structures contain clear drawings.
If errors appear, you can replace the part.
All local information is stored so you know how to fix it.
So you can have something that moves and reads information and can transmit it from one part to another.
It is built directly inside, without external control.
The last project I will show you is called Displaced Chains, and this is perhaps the most exciting example of what we have now from passive self-assembling systems.
It combines reconfiguration and programming capabilities and creates a completely passive system.
We are based on a chain of elements.
All the elements are completely identical and shifted.
So every chain or every element wants to turn right or left.
And when you assemble a chain, you essentially program it.
You tell each block where it should turn: right or left.
So when you shake the chain, it collapses into the configuration you programmed - in this case into a spiral, or in this case - two cubes next to each other.
So, in general, you can program any three-dimensional form - or one-dimensional, two-dimensional - from these absolutely passive chains.
So, what does this tell us about the future?
I think it tells us that there are new opportunities for self-assembly, replication, repair in our physical structures, buildings, cars.
New software is possible in these parts.
And from here, you have new possibilities in computing.
We will have spatial computers.
Imagine that our buildings, bridges, cars, all our bricks could make calculations.
It's an amazing parallel and distributed power of cleaning, new design possibilities.
This is incredible potential.
I think that the projects I showed you are just a small step towards the future, if we introduce these new technologies, towards a new self-gathering future.
Thank you.

The previous record was 247,225 infected people.
What connected the Vatican and Nazi Germany
This week the next date is 87 years since the conclusion of the treaty between the Vatican and Nazi Germany.
The document, signed a few months after Hitler came to power, became the basis on which the Holy See's relations with fascists were built.
One of those who prepared the treaty was Cardinal Pacelli, who, 6 years before the outbreak of World War II, became Pontiff Pius XII.
In Sochi, the body of a dump truck collapsed on the cab of a truck, killing the driver.
Footage has appeared online showing an accident that occurred last Saturday, July 25, at a construction site in Sochi.
The recording shows how, during unloading operations, the raised body of the dump truck collapsed down, landing directly in the cab of the truck.
According to the Ministry of Emergency Situations, the 59-year-old man who was driving died on the spot from his injuries.
Rescue workers needed help to retrieve the body of the deceased.
Beautiful tall minarets just decorated Ayia Sophia
Once again, about Ayia Sophia, a text by Fr. Vladimir Zelinsky came across that, they say, it is necessary to protest.
First, there was free admission - cheers!
I haven <unk> t been to Istanbul, but free admission to the House of God is better than paid.
Secondly, Muslims conquered this land as honestly as Orthodox conquered the Volga-Okskoye interriver, the Muslim Caucasus (and put up a church in Grozny) and planted apple trees on Mars.
God help!
Jews conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans conquered America.
Will we return everything to everyone?
Do you think there will be no pagans who will demand the return of their church, where the Tithe Church is located?
Thirdly, the Muslims improved this building and invested in it.
That is, they, as well as the factories and estates that Leninists took from the bourgeoisie as their property, belong to Leninists - Putin and other nomenclature.
They have improved everything from the Kremlin to the Angara, so it is all of them rightfully progressive.
Beautiful tall minarets very much decorated Ayia Sophia, very much.
There was a stupid ink, there was a stupid ink with beautiful minarets.
Fourth, there are no "Islamic" or "Orthodox" civilizations.
There are believers, there are hypocrites, there are bigots who unite faith and hypocrisy.
A believer does not think in the categories of civilization.
This is the thinking of British Foreign Office official Toynbee, a believer is ashamed to think like this.
But there is a place of prayer for believers everywhere.
And always.
A believer does not pray just where he is asked to leave - he goes elsewhere and prays there.
He is a believer, not a defender.
We are kolobok, not sullen stones.

During the broadcast of the parade on Navy Day the camera "passed under the ship"
Also on Victory Day the camera flew through the barrel of a tank
Today, July 26, a parade is being held in St. Petersburg in honor of Navy Day.
During filming, one of the cameras filming the equipment "passed under the ship."
The use of the new shooting technology allowed the audience to see the underwater part of the parade.
The progress of the newest serial small rocket ship, Sovetsk, was shown from the same perspective.
It passed along the Admiralty Embankment.
Recall that at the parade on June 24, dedicated to the 75th anniversary of the Victory, the camera passed through the barrel into the tower of one of the tanks and showed what equipment is inside the grand military vehicle.
At that time, a record number of military equipment took part in the anniversary Victory Day parade: 234 combat vehicles.
They showed numb new models that left for the main square of the country for the first time, for example, modernized main battle tanks T-90M and T-80BVM.
On June 24, updated infantry fighting vehicles BMP-2M with the Berezhok combat module also passed through Red Square for the first time.
Almost half of Britons believe in Kremlin interference in Brexit referendum
Almost half of the British - 49% - believe that Russia tried to influence the course of the 2016 referendum on Britain's exit from the European Union.
The Guardian newspaper reported this with reference to the results of a survey conducted by Opinium.
It is reported that 23% of respondents hold the opposite opinion on this issue.
47% of respondents also believe that the Kremlin interfered in the last general election in Great Britain in 2019.
July will go away with heat, August will start with coolness
Over the weekend, Moscow and the region experienced the coldest night of July.
Of course, there was no chilling apocalypse with frost.
But for the top of summer - chilly.
Before talking about the weather in Moscow on July 27-August 2, 2020, it should be noted that on the night of Saturday, July 25, the air in the capital cooled to + 8.8 degrees.
Kolomna even set a new temperature record: + 7 degrees (the previous low for July 25 was held since 1964, more than half a century).
Cherusti became the cold pole near Moscow: thermometers showed + 3.9 degrees there.
However, in the afternoon both Saturday and Sunday were quite comfortable.
Although, compared to climate standards, it is still 2-3 degrees cooler.
On working days, not just heat will return to Moscow, but real heat.
On Monday, July 27, the Hydrometcenter of Russia promises + 26 degrees, on Tuesday and Wednesday + 28... + 29, on Thursday, July 30, + 26 degrees.
Short rains - every day, in the middle of the week with thunderstorms.
The last day of July and the first days of August (that is, next weekend) will be cool, no higher than + 19... + 24 degrees.
And it won't do without precipitation.
Rwandan native admitted setting fire to Nantes cathedral
A Rwandan native who worked at the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul in the French city of Nantes on a voluntary basis admitted to setting it on fire a week after the fire.
The France-3 TV channel reported this on Sunday.
According to him, the man, who was already detained on July 19, the day after the fire, was detained again the day before.
He appeared before the investigating judge on Saturday evening.
After being charged with intentionally damaging property, the man admitted to setting fires in three places - under a large organ, under a small organ, and at an electric shield.
He now faces up to 10 years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros.
The motives for the actions of the 39-year-old from Rwanda have not yet been reported.
It is only known that he voluntarily helped in the cathedral and had to close its doors on the day of the fire.
However, according to recordings from CCTV cameras, he left the religious institution 15 minutes after receiving calls about a fire in the building.
The fire in the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul occurred on July 18.
More than 200 firefighters fought for the Gothic architectural monument for several hours.
Nevertheless, they failed to save the stained glass windows of Louis XII and the unique Baroque organ.
It was only possible to bring the situation under control three hours after the fire started.
No one was injured as a result of the incident.
The current fire is not the first during the existence of the church.
In 1972, a fire destroyed its roof.
It took 13 years to eliminate the consequences of that fire.
The cathedral was reopened to parishioners only in 1985.
Legendary travel goalkeeper Pfannenstil could become an Inter scout.
Former German goalkeeper Lutz Pfannenstil may join Inter's headquarters.
According to Kicker, the 47-year-old specialist was given the position of head of the scout department.
Pfannenstil held a similar position at Fortuna from Dsseldorf from December 2018 to May 2020, and previously worked at Hoffenheim.
When he was a football player, Pfannenstil became famous for his frequent transitions.
He is the only professional player to play in all six FIFA confederations, replaced more than 20 clubs, including representatives from the championships of Singapore, South Africa, New Zealand, Canada, Namibia and several other countries.
It is believed that only sighted people can be driving a car.
Until recently, it was believed that safe and independent driving was an impossible task for the blind.
Hello, I am Denis Hong, and we give the blind freedom and independence by developing cars for the visually impaired.
Before talking about this car for the blind, I will briefly talk about another project I was working on, called the DARPA Urban Challenge.
The project was to create a self-driving robot car.
The driver presses "start" and without his participation the car reaches its destination.
In 2007, our team won half a million dollars, finishing third in this competition.
Around the same time, the National Federation of the Blind, or NSF, tasked the research committee with developing a vehicle that the blind can independently and safely drive.
We decided to try our hand because we thought, "Hey, what's difficult here?
We already have an autonomous car.
Let's put a blind man in it - and it's over, right? "
(Laughter) But we were deeply mistaken.
The NSF wanted to get not just a car that would carry the blind, but a car that the blind could independently drive.
So we had to reject everything and start from scratch.
So, to test this crazy idea, we developed a small prototype of a car buggy to test the feasibility of the project.
And in the summer of 2009, we invited blind youth from all over the country and gave them the opportunity to test this car.
It was an amazing experience.
But the catch is that this car was designed to operate in a strictly controlled environment, namely in a flat, closed car park, where even lanes are restricted by red signal cones.
With this success, we decided to take the next big step and develop a real car that could be driven on real roads.
So, how does that work?
Well, it's a rather complicated system, but let me clarify, perhaps even simplify it.
So, it includes three components.
These include tactile perception, calculation, and non-visual interfaces.
Since the driver sees nothing, the system must perceive the environment and collect information for the driver.
For this purpose, an initial parameter meter is used.
It measures acceleration, angular acceleration, like the inner ear of a person.
This information is then transmitted to a GPS device to assess the location of the car.
Two cameras are used to detect traffic on the road
And three laser rangefinders.
Lasers scan the space around the car to detect various objects: an approaching oncoming or overtaking car, any obstacles encountered on the road or around the car.
Then all this huge amount of information is fed into the computer, and the computer performs two stages.
First of all, it is processing this information to get an idea of space: determining traffic lanes on the road, identifying obstacles, and then bringing this information to the driver.
The system is also smart enough to calculate the safest way to drive a car.
So, we can also make recommendations on how to operate the machine.
But the problem is how to convey this information and instructions to a blind person who does not have the quick and accurate response needed to drive?
For this purpose, we have developed a whole range of interface technologies for the blind:
A three-dimensional ping sound system, a vibrating vest, a steering wheel with sound signals, a special prosthetic leg, and even shoes that put pressure on the leg.
But today we will only talk about three types of these special interfaces.
The first interface is called DriveGrip.
They are a pair of gloves with engines on the joints of the fingers, instructing the driver how to steer: direction and angle of rotation.
Another device is SpeedStrip.
Initially, it is a massage chair.
The vibration is used to transmit speed information to the driver, as well as to guide the use of gas pedals and brakes.
So, here you can see how the computer perceives the space around the car. And since the vibration cannot be seen, red LEDs are installed on the driver to demonstrate the process.
This is sensor data, it is transmitted to devices via a computer.
The DriveGrip and SpeedStrip devices are very effective.
But the problem is that these are training prompts.
They don't actually give freedom of governance, do they?
The on-board computer gives the driver commands: "left," "right," "add speed," "stop."
We call him "annoying passenger from the back seat."
That is why we are moving away from training prompts and focusing on informing devices.
An excellent example of this interface is AirPix.
It is a kind of monitor for the blind.
A small panel with many holes through which compressed air comes out, thereby creating images.
A blind person can bring their palm to this panel and "see" lanes on the roadway and obstacles.
The driver can also change the frequency at which the air comes out and possibly the air temperature.
That is, it is an interface for displaying multidimensional data.
So, here you can see the left and right cameras of the car, and how the computer processes and sends this information to the AirPix panel.
Here we demonstrate a simulator, a blind person driving a car using AirPix.
This simulator proved very useful for training blind drivers, as well as for quickly testing ideas for using different types of special interfaces.
This is how this system works briefly.
After all, it is a prototype of a car for the blind, and it will not be released onto the roadway until they are convinced of its absolute safety.
And I sincerely believe that this is quite likely.
Still, will society accept such a radical idea?
How much will car insurance rules change?
On what terms will a driver's license be issued?
Apart from technological challenges, there are so many pitfalls that need to be overcome before this becomes a reality.
Of course, the main goal of this project is to develop a car for the blind.
However, it is possible that the side technologies developed during this project will prove to be an invaluable contribution to our lives.
Our sensors work regardless of the time of day, fog and rain.
We can use these technologies together with new special interfaces to improve the safety of cars for the sighted.
Find their use in everyday household appliances, in educational institutions, in offices.
Just imagine: a teacher in a class writes on a blackboard, and a blind student can see and read what is written using these special interfaces.
It's priceless.
So what I showed you today is just the beginning.
Many thanks.
(Applause)
Second trailer for Bill & Ted with Keanu Reeves released
The second trailer for the third part of the "Bill and Ted" franchise has appeared on the YouTube channel of the film studio Orion Pictures.
The trailer reveals some details from the current life of bosom friends: they settled in a suburban area, married to their girlfriends Joanna (Jaima Mays) and Elizabeth (Erinn Hayes) from "The Incredible Adventures of Bill & Ted" (1989), moreover, restless adventurers have long been raising daughters.
Brigitte Landy-Payne ("Glass Castle," "Untypical") plays Billy, Ted's daughter, and Samara Weaving ("I'm going to look") - Thea, Bill's daughter (yes, Bill and Ted named their daughters Billy and Thea, such a pun).
On top of that, another great adventure awaits them: they must enter the future to steal their own song - the only way they can save the whole world.
In the trailer you can also see the American rapper Kid Cudi and William Sadler ("August Rush," "Death in spite," "Green Mile"), once again playing the role of Death.
The film was originally planned to be released on 21 August, but the date was moved to 1 September.
It is reported that the creators do not plan to re-postpone the release date of the film.
The picture will also be immediately available online.
Earlier we wrote that Keanu Reeves will become a screenwriter for comics about the demigod Berserk.
I want you to think for a second that almost all of our knowledge about the Universe is gained through light.
We stand on Earth and see stars in the night sky with the naked eye.
A bright Sun can burn the retina,
But we see the same light in the reflection of the Moon.
Since the time of Galileo, who observed celestial bodies through his primitive telescope, we have been contemplating the universe thanks to light passing through the boundless ages of cosmic history.
With the help of modern telescopes, we were able to collect a stunning silent film about the Universe, covering all our history up to the Big Bang.
However, this movie is not without sound, because the Universe is not silent.
I want to prove to you that the Universe has its own soundtrack, and it is "reproduced" by the cosmos itself, because outer space vibrates like a drum.
It carries peculiar sounds that accompany the most striking events as they take place.
Today we would like to complement the luxurious visual image of the universe that we have with a soundtrack.
Until now, we have never heard sounds from space, but in the near future we should listen carefully to what is happening there.
So, in order to record the "song" of the Universe, we focused on black holes as the most promising objects, because they "beat" in space-time like a bell, and give a characteristic sound.
Maybe one day we will see a shadow that the black hole casts, appearing against a bright background, but so far we have not seen this.
However, the black hole, albeit invisible, can be heard as it "beats" in space-time like a drum.
The assumption that space is like a drum membrane belongs to Albert Einstein, to whom we owe so much.
Einstein concluded that if space were empty, if the universe was empty, it would look like this picture, except, of course, for such a visual grid.
If we fell freely through space, even without a convenient coordinate grid, mentally we could portray it ourselves, since we would notice that we are moving in a straight line, strictly in a straight line through the universe.
Einstein also understood - and this is the very essence - that if you put energy or mass into the universe, it will lead to a curvature of space, and a free-falling object will bypass, for example, the Sun, deviating along natural curves in space.
It was Einstein's great general theory of relativity.
Even light warps along this trajectory.
The deviation can be so strong that the object will simply enter orbit and will spin around the Sun like the Earth, or like the Moon - around the Earth.
These are natural curvature in space.
But Einstein didn't understand this: if you take our Sun and compress it to 6 kilometers in diameter, that is, a mass 1 million times heavier than the Earth to fit in an object with a diameter of 6 km, you will get a black hole, so dense that the light that passed too close from it will never escape.
However, he always considered black holes to be just a mathematical curiosity.
Einstein did not believe that they exist in reality.
He believed that nature should protect us from their appearance.
Decades passed before the term "black hole" was invented and people realized that they are real astrophysical objects - in fact, they are very massive stars in a posthumous state, catastrophically destroyed at the end of their life cycle.
Our Sun will not turn into a black hole.
Its mass is insufficient for this.
But we will conduct a small thought experiment - Enstein loved them very much - and imagine how the Sun shrinks to 6 kilometers in diameter, and around it rotates a tiny Earth, about 30 km from the sun's black hole.
This Earth is shining, because there is no more Sun, as well as another light source, so we will make our little Earth self-luminous.
It turns out that we can place the Earth in a very close orbit, just 30 km from this black hole.
It does not exceed Manhattan in size.
Perhaps it would have caught Hudson a little before destroying the Earth.
But the scale is roughly that.
We are talking about an object that would occupy about 1 / 2 of Manhattan's area.
So, by placing this Earth very close - only 30 km away - we will notice that it rotates perfectly around the black hole.
It's a kind of myth that black holes absorb everything indiscriminately - to get into it, you have to come very close.
But what is striking is that from our point of view we will always see the Earth.
She can't hide behind a black hole.
Some of the light that the Earth emits is absorbed by the hole, but some of it seems to circle it and return back to us.
So, nothing can be hidden behind the black hole.
If you suddenly get into the series "Star Cruiser" Galaxy ," and fight the Cylons - do not hide behind the black hole.
They will see you!
Our Sun won't turn into a black hole - it's not massive enough for this. But there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
And if one of them obscured the Milky Way, that's what it would look like.
We would see the shadow of a black hole against the background of hundreds of billions of stars and luminous dust.
If we were on the verge of falling into this black hole, we would see all this light circling it, and even entering this shadow, we would not notice a near catastrophe.
It would be useless to start the engines and try to get out, because nothing, including light, can escape from it.
Although the black hole looks like this from the outside, it is not dark inside, since all the light falls into it with us.
According to the relativistic effect known as time stretching, our clock seemed to slow down relative to galactic time, but we, on the contrary, would see the evolution of the galaxy in an accelerated mode a moment before death inside the black hole.
It would be like a near-death experience where you see light at the end of a tunnel, but not "near," but absolutely mortal.
(Laughter) And you can't tell anyone about the light at the end of the tunnel.
Scientists have not yet been able to see the shadow of the black hole, but we can hear it, albeit invisible.
Imagine a real astrophysical situation - two black holes that lived a long life together.
They may have been stars first and then turned into black holes, each 10 times heavier than the Sun.
Let's squeeze them up to 60 km in diameter.
They can spin quickly: hundreds of revolutions per second.
At the end of their life cycle, they spin around each other at almost the speed of light.
They cover thousands of km in a split second, and not only warp space, but also leave a mark: they cause fluctuations, a wave trail in space-time.
Space shrinks and stretches, freeing itself from these black holes oscillating in the universe.
And they travel through space at the speed of light.
This computer simulation was made by Goddard's group at NASA studying the theory of relativity.
For almost 30 years, scientists around the world have been fighting over this problem.
It was one of the groups.
You see two black holes orbiting each other - and again, curves are clearly depicted here.
If you see - it turned out a little pale - they emit red waves, gravitational waves.
These are the sounds of vibrating space, and they will come from these black holes at the speed of light, while they subside and merge into one rotating, quiet black hole - this is the outcome.
If you stood close enough, your ear would resonate as space shrinks and stretches.
You would actually hear the sound.
Of course, your head would also shrink and stretch, so it would be difficult for you to understand what is going on.
But I would like to lose this sound to you, as we predict it.
This is the work of my group, so the schedule here is more modest.
Imagine a light black hole falling into a very heavy one.
The sound you hear makes a light hole, bending space, coming step by step to the end.
If it is removed, the sound becomes quieter.
But it is like a hammer "hitting" a space that vibrates like a membrane.
And we can predict what that sound will be like.
We know that as a hole is absorbed, it gets faster and louder.
At the end we will hear a small hole just fall into a big one.
I haven't heard the recording so loudly yet - really, quite impressive.
At home it turns out to be much more modest.
Just quiet clicks.
It's a different sound created by my band.
Here I am not showing you the picture, since black holes do not leave behind visual traces, there are no visible curves in space.
If you went on a space cruise and heard such a sound, I would recommend flying away as soon as possible.
(Laughter) Further from that sound.
Both black holes are moving.
They are approaching each other.
In this case, they both hesitate a lot.
And now there will be a merger.
This "rumbling" is very characteristic of merging black holes, it is an acceleration at the end.
We assume that this would sound like this.
Fortunately, we are now at a safe distance, in Long Beach in California.
Undoubtedly, two black holes merge somewhere in the universe.
And without a doubt, the space around us is vibrating, and these fluctuations may have passed millions of light-years, that is, a million years were moving towards us at the speed of light.
But the sound is too quiet, we can't hear it.
There is a very complex project today: LIGO (Laser Interferometric Gravitational-Wave Observatory) - it tracks deviations in fluctuations in space, the smallest - by the size of the nucleus of an atom by 4 kilometers.
This is an extremely ambitious experiment, and in the next few years it will be devoted to catching such waves.
One space program is also planned, which I hope will be launched in the next 10 years: LIKA (Laser Interferometric Space Antenna).
It will be able to see super-heavy black holes, millions and billions of times more massive than the Sun.
In this image from the Hubble telescope we see two galaxies.
They look like they have frozen in a kind of "embrace,"
And each of them probably contains a super-heavy black hole in its core.
But they haven't frozen. In fact, they are merging.
These two black holes collide and it will last more than a billion years.
It is beyond our perception to hear a song of such duration.
But the LIC may see the final merger of two super-heavy black holes, which began a long time ago: the last 15 minutes of this action.
We are talking not only about black holes, but also about any serious troubles in the universe, and the most important of them is the Big Bang.
When this expression was invented, it was ironic - "they say, who will believe in the Big Bang?"
This animation from my friend from Proton Studios shows the Big Bang from the outside.
Any observer would like to be inside at this moment, because it is impossible to be outside the universe.
Imagine being inside the Big Bang.
It is everywhere, around you, and the space vibrates chaotically.
14 billion years have passed, and this song still sounds around us.
Galaxies are born, and generations of stellar forms are born in them. And there is a habitable planet around one star, at least one.
And here we persistently conduct these experiments, make calculations, write programs.
Imagine that two black holes collided a billion years ago.
All the while, their song sounds in space.
We haven't even been born yet.
The sound is approaching, closer and closer - 40,000 years ago, we are still making rock paintings.
If we were going to "hear" the Big Bang, it would sound like this.
The noise is pure.
It's white noise, just chaotic sounds.
But it probably surrounds us everywhere, if it wasn't drowned out by some other processes in the universe.
And if we catch it, it will be the most pleasant music for us, because it is a quiet echo of the moment of our creation, the birth of the observed Universe.
Over the next few years, we can add a little volume and hear the universe in sound.
But if we catch an echo of those early events, it will bring us much closer to understanding the Big Bang, and it will already allow us to ask some of the most difficult, elusive questions.
By spinning a film about our universe backwards, we learn that there was a Big Bang in the past, and perhaps we will even hear its cacophony, but was this the only one?
I mean, has it not happened before?
Will it happen again?
In the spirit of TED calling on us to regain faith in miracles, we can now ask questions that have always eluded us.
But we must ask: is it possible that our Universe is just a trace of some more significant history?
Or - are we just one of the branches of the multiuniverse - each of which had its own Big Bang in the past? Maybe with black holes and their "songs," or without them, maybe with intelligent life, and possibly without - they are not in our past, not in our future, but somehow connected to us?
We will ask: in such a multiuniverse, in its other branches, is there life?
Here are my fellow multiuniverses.
But are there any other creatures out there that think about us and their origin?
And, if they are, I can imagine them making calculations like us, building instruments, trying to detect that weak sound of the moment of their creation, and thinking - who else is there but us?
Thanks. Thank you.
(Applause)
Minneapolis residents set up street patrol units
The Wall Street Journal reports that units are being set up in Minneapolis to patrol the streets.
Local residents want to help the guards.
Some of the vigilantes carry weapons.
Armed citizens assure that they will not open fire, this is only possible if absolutely necessary.
According to journalists, the creation of patrols is connected with the reduction of the police budget.
Law enforcement agencies will receive $10 million less per year (this amount may be reduced).
The previous budget for law enforcement is $193 million.
The Minneapolis City Council made this decision in connection with the death of George Floyd and rallies against police brutality over the past two months.

The British newspaper The Guardian reports that Manchester City and Real Madrid will still be able to play the return leg of the 1 / 8 Champions League final in Manchester at the Etihad Stadium on August 7.
Yesterday, July 25, the UK government adopted a decree that all persons arriving in the UK from Spain are required to undergo a 14-day quarantine due to the new outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.
For Real, however, an exception will be made.
Earlier, Secretary of the Ministry of Culture of Great Britain Oliver Dowden announced the possibility of easing quarantine rules for sports teams and film crews.
In February Real lost to Manchester City with a score of 1-2.
The return match is scheduled for August 7.
Presidents of Russia and Ukraine discussed implementation of truce in Donbass
Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky discussed the implementation of agreements on a truce in Donbass, reached during the Normandy summit in December 2019, the press services of the Kremlin and the office of the President of Ukraine reported.
The telephone conversation between Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky took place at the initiative of the Ukrainian side, according to the Kremlin press service.
The interlocutors welcomed the achievement on July 22 at a meeting of the Minsk Contact Group of an agreement on a full and comprehensive ceasefire in Donbass, which begins at 00: 01 on July 27, 2020; the President of Russia supported this agreement.
The leaders agreed on the urgent need to implement additional measures to support the ceasefire in Donbass.
At the same time, Putin criticized the decision adopted by the Verkhovna Rada on July 15 to organize local elections in the fall, which, in the opinion of the Russian side, ignores the Minsk agreement.
The situation in connection with the coronavirus pandemic was also discussed.
The July 22 agreement provides for a complete rejection of any military action, including reconnaissance, sending subversive reconnaissance groups, and sniper warfare.
Tinkov showed a video of a bone marrow transplant
Russian entrepreneur and founder of the Tinkoff group Oleg Tinkov published a video in which he told how his bone marrow was transplanted.
The businessman is fighting leukemia.
On the recording the businessman lies in the ward, bone marrow is transplanted using a drip.
Tinkov noted that donor material is taken in the same way.
"The skull is not cut," he added.
Judging by his position during the operation, he feels comfortable and relaxed.
His donor was a girl from Germany.
The businessman expressed regret that there are only 130,000 bone marrow donors in Russia, while there are about 8 million in Germany.
Oleg Tinkou's bone marrow transplantation was carried out at a London clinic.
The destruction of Russian Pantsirei in Ethiopia has become known
Two Russian-made Pantsir-C1 anti-aircraft missile and gun systems, which were in service with the Ethiopian army, were destroyed.
This was reported to the Telegram channel "Military Observer" on Sunday, July 26.
According to the channel, two vehicles providing security for the Hidase hydroelectric power plant on the Blue Nile River were disabled as a result of lightning.
No other details of the incident were given.
In May, Turkey's Anadolu Agency reported the destruction of nine Russian-made Pantsir-C1 air defense systems in Libya.
They belonged to the forces of the commander of the Libyan National Army (LNA), Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, and were destroyed with the help of Turkish tactical multipurpose unmanned aerial systems Bayraktar TB2.
At that time, Defense Express called what happened "real genocide."
Another Pantsir-C1 in Libya was destroyed by a drone strike in early July.
1,500 people evacuated in Warsaw due to bomb

Putin talked to Shoigu in the cabin:
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke with Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Navy Chief Nikolai Evmenov.
The corresponding footage was published by journalists from the Kremlin pool RIA Novosti on their Telegram channel on Sunday, July 26.
The short meeting took place in the cabin of the boat, on which the head of state, along with Shoigu and Evmenov, was heading to the parade of ships in the Gulf of Finland before the parade dedicated to the Day of the Russian Navy.
They exchanged a couple of phrases while sitting at a table.
Earlier it was reported that Putin arrived in Kronstadt to participate in the celebrations.
From there, the president headed to St. Petersburg, where he is to host a festive parade.
On July 26, parades are held throughout Russia to celebrate Navy Day.
The main naval parade takes place in St. Petersburg.
It involves more than 4 thousand military personnel, 46 ships, submarines and boats, as well as naval aviation.
In one of the Tyumen public there was a call to take part in the action "Buy from your grandmother."
Organizers are urging grannies to buy vegetables, flowers and berries they grew in their gardens and not to bargain.
The author of the post even gave an example, specifying the specific address at which my grandmother sells cherries.
But Tyumen residents suddenly burst into angry comments.
I saw for myself how a merchant from neighboring countries immediately approached this grandmother and gave a new portion of goods "from my grandmother's garden" for sale.
Look carefully at what you are buying!! - Nadezhda Grigorieva shared her observations.
I have seen more than once when greens were taken from traders from neighboring countries and sold.
There is no trust, Larisa Kharlamova agreed.
It's been a long time already, I look, granny has a quiz - "glitter," but in our garden it wasn't born, I ask: "Is it from your garden?"
"Yes!"
I bought a taste of rags, well, not fresh garden, then I look at these "yes" on every corner, my granny deceived me, and took me to implement it from someone, Tatyana Krasilnikova said about her experience.
At the same time, users emphasize that they do not urge them not to shop with their grandmothers, but only share their opinions and advise them to pay attention to the quality of their products.

Decision to expand the RPL would not be supported by either UEFA or FIFA
Russian Football Union (RFU) president Alexander Dyukov believes that expanding the Russian Premier League (RPL) to 18 teams is currently wrong.
"First, it was the decision of the RPL, but I will agree with it, because it is wrong to change the rules after the tournament is completed.
This violates the integrity of the tournament and the sporting principle.

Russian series actor responds to accusations of "promoting LGBT and feminism"
The actor of the Russian series "Chiki," whose creators were accused of "promoting LGBT and feminism," responded to the claims against the film.
The authors "understood the sharpness of the topics raised and did not want to offend anyone," said American Stephen Thomas Oxner in an interview with the publication "Rise."
"It seems to me that this is a story about the strength and general aspects of human life.
It has nothing to do with LGBT and feminism, "said the actor, who played the boy's father, who changed into women's clothing.
He stressed that he is "proud of the work" and does not consider it propaganda.
At the same time, the American added, he is frightened by the reaction of some people to the plot line of the series: for example, there was a case when "a man in a deep binge shot a set and said that all this is not true."
"Then there were a couple of cases when we met dissatisfied local people who didn't understand what we were doing.
But we were open, so people who first came with claims started helping us, "he concluded.
The shooting incident, the publication explains, occurred in September 2019 in Kabardino-Balkaria: a drunk man attacked a film crew car with a weapon, after which he was detained by police officers.
Earlier it was reported that the public commissioner for family protection Olga Baranets sent a complaint to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Roskomnadzor about the more.tv service, which posted the Russian series "Chiki."

The Ombudsman was also outraged by the fact that "the series pays a lot of attention to the homosexual sexual orientation" of the minor character.
The comedy drama "Chiki" tells the story of three prostitutes who started a new life and started a business on the advice of a friend.
