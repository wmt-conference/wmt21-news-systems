In two Mexican states announced the alarm because of hurricane "Hannah"
The Mexican National Directorate of Civil Defense announced an "orange" (high) level of alarm in the two eastern states of Tamaulipas and Nuevo León due to the approaching hurricane Hanna, TASS reports.
The hurricane will bring heavy rains to Mexico, in some areas predict falling from 150 to 250 liters of precipitation per square meter.
The authorities have prepared about 800 shelters for the population.
10 thousand people will provide assistance to people, including rescuers, national guard soldiers and military.
At the moment, the hurricane reached the coast of the US state of Texas with a wind speed of 150 km / h.
Hannah's arrival in Mexico is expected on Sunday morning.
Semilarski vs prosecutor's office: cassation of former vice-mayor of Tartu to be considered on August 4
This means that a decision on it is likely to be made in early September.
The courts of the first two instances refused to consider Semilarski's claim, but in April his cassation appeal was accepted by the Supreme Court.
On 12 December 2019, the Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the applicant, as its resolution was not within its competence of the Administrative Court.
The court's ruling stated that the complaint contained a claim for compensation for damage caused in the course of criminal proceedings.
"Such matters should be regulated by the prosecutor's office and the county court," Tartu Courts spokeswoman Anette Kreitsmann previously told ERR.
According to her, Valvo Semilarski appealed this decision to the district court, which on February 5 did not change the decision of the court of first instance.
Now the State Court will have to say its word.
According to Semilarski's lawyer, a sworn lawyer Oliver Nyaes, his client was unreasonably suspected of bribery for about two years.
Now he demands from the prosecutor's office to refute the incorrect allegations against him and compensate him for moral damage.
The reason for filing a complaint with the court was the statements of the Prosecutor for Special Cases of the Lüuna District Prosecutor's Office Margus Gross, made by him in October 2017, when Semilarski, together with another at that time Vice-Mayor of Tartu Artem Suvorov, was detained on suspicion of committing several crimes.
"Recall that when I was detained, the Security Police and the Prosecutor's Office immediately organized a press conference and informed the whole Republic of Estonia that the leaders of Tartu - one of the most influential local government bodies - are corrupt.
These public suspicions hanging in the air accompanied me for about two years.
And now that these allegations and suspicions have turned out to be false, the prosecutor's office does not want to say anything about it," Semilarsky commented in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Nyaes, at the press conference, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework in which the prosecutor's office should operate.
"The allegation of bribery and venality has proven to be false, but that's not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its rulings on Russia as well as lithuania that during the investigation phase, state representatives must be careful when choosing words so that suspects are not presented as criminals before sentencing.
The prosecutor's office is also bound by the presumption of innocence, which, unfortunately, was not observed in this case against Valvo Semilarski," Nyaes said.
"The public representation of Semilarski as a serious offender and bribe-taker in circumstances where the facts underlying the suspicion of bribery are still being clarified is unacceptable, which is contrary to the presumption of innocence and unfair to the applicant," the lawyer added.
As rus.err.ee wrote, the former vice-mayor of Tartu, Valvo Semilarski, will not be prosecuted on charges of bribery - the criminal case opened against him in July was partially closed.
At the same time, the former official is being tried on charges of deliberate violation of anti-corruption legislation when conducting transactions on an especially large scale.
According to the indictment, between 2015 and 2017, the former Deputy Mayor of Tartu participated in city council meetings more than thirty times in making decisions related to companies operating in Tartu, with whose owners or managers Semilarski actively communicated on a personal level outside of working hours.
According to Gross, in all these cases, Semilarski had personal interests, and therefore he had to withdraw from participation in decision-making.
Earlier, as rus.err.ee wrote, the prosecutor's office presented Semilarski with suspicions of taking a bribe and violating anti-corruption legislation when conducting transactions on an especially large scale.
This happened in October 2016, when he was detained along with another deputy mayor, Artem Suvorov (Centre Party).
At that time, the prosecutor's office and the Security Police said that there was strong evidence against both vice-mayors.
After that, both officials resigned.
Suvorov's case later reached the court, which fully acquitted the politician.
The judicial investigation into the case of Valvo Semilarski is still ongoing.
Ex-soloist of the group "Hands Up" visited the Tver region
Ex-soloist of the group "Hands Up", and now a solo performer, businessman and actor Sergei Zhukov posted in his official Instagram account a photo from Kalyazin, Tver region.
Photo published a day ago, saturday, July 25.
"I raise my hands up under the new "Crumb" and say hello to you from the heady-fresh air!
Write in the comments, what is the weather in your city?
We have no rain today, but above +20 is not yet rising"..., - writes Zhukov in social networks.
Probably, the singer rests in the beautiful city of the Tver region with his family.
Residents of the region have already thanked the performer for the visit, and also expressed hope for a meeting and personal communication.
The new "Baby" in question in the post is probably referring to a new version of the old song that Zhukov has now recorded with blogger and musician David Manukyan (DAVA M).
At the same time, most fans remain FOR the old version: "Sergey, the old version of the song is clearly 1,000,000 times better!
Support me loyal fans of "Hands Up", "We don't need a "new baby"".
Most write directly that the original, which became a hit at one time, they like more.
The Ministry of Defense reported on the successful completion of tests of the hypersonic missile "Zircon"
The Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation reported on the successful completion of tests of the Zircon hypersonic missile.
On the Day of the Navy, the Defense Ministry noted that the test launches conducted from the frigate "Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union Gorshkov" confirmed the unique tactical and technical characteristics of this missile in terms of range and accuracy of fire, as well as the hypersonic speed of its flight.
According to the Ministry of Defense, the tests of the hypersonic missile are in a planned manner.
Earlier in May, Deputy Defense Minister Alexei Krivoruchko reported that the ship complex with the latest hypersonic missile "Zircon" will enter service in 2021 - 2022.
You are all well aware of the truth that will be discussed today.
I think the idea of inequality as a divider and destroyer of society was in the air even before the French Revolution.
But now we can see the evidence by comparing the most and least similar societies, and by observing the consequences of inequality.
I'll show you this data and explain why there are relationships that will be discussed.
But first, look at how dull we are.
(Laughter) I'll start with a paradox.
It shows life expectancy depending on GNI, or the average level of well-being of countries.
It can be seen that countries on the right, such as Norway and the United States, are twice as rich as Israel, Greece and Portugal on the left.
But this does not affect life expectancy at all.
There is no hint of interconnection.
But within societies, there are strong gradations in the state of health, affecting all social strata.
Again, average life expectancy.
The graph refers to small areas of England and Wales: the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.
There's a huge difference between the poor and everyone else.
Even those who are slightly poorer than the richest are already less healthy than the very top.
So income is very important within our societies, but not between them.
The explanation for this paradox is that within our societies we look at relative income or social position, status — at what level we are in relation to others, and what are the distances between us.
Once you understand this idea, you will immediately think: what will happen if the difference increases or shrinks, in other words, making the difference in income more or less?
I'll show you that now.
All the data used is absolutely real.
I take the UN information, the World Bank has the same: the scale of income disparities in these rich and developed market democracies.
The indicator used by our team is very simple, you can download it. We count the difference between the richest 20% and the poorest 20% in each country.
Look, in equal countries on the left, Japan, Finland, Norway and Sweden, the rich 20% are 3.5-4 times richer than the poor 20%.
But in unequal countries, in the UK, Portugal, USA and Singapore, the difference is more than twice!
According to these dimensions, we are half as equal as other successful democracies.
And now you will see the impact this has on society.
We have collected statistics on social problems that are more frequent among the poor.
These are internationally comparable data on life expectancy, literacy and mathematical training of children, newborn mortality, homicide rate, number of prisoners, teenage pregnancy, trust level, obesity, mental illness, which, according to the standard diagnostic classification, include drug and alcohol dependence, and finally, data on social mobility.
We put it all in one index.
They are all equally important.
The country is, in a way, the average value of these data.
You see countries in terms of the inequality indicator that was shown at the very beginning. I'll come back to it again and again as the presentation progresses.
Unequal countries in general have more difficulties with all these social problems.
It's an unusually close connection. You can see that the correlation is unusually high.
But if you look at the same index of health and social problems in relation to GNP per capita, gross national income, there is no correlation.
We were a little worried that people would think that we were matching the problems to our arguments and just "fitting" the evidence. So we also wrote an article in the British Medical Journal about the UNICEF Child Wellbeing Index.
The index consists of 40 different parts put together by different people.
Among the criteria: the availability of books at home, the ability of children to talk to their parents, the level of immunization, the presence of bullying at school.
Everything goes in.
But this is all against the background of the same indicator of inequality.
Children's situation is worse in unequal societies.
And that's a statistically significant relationship.
But again, if you look at the level of child well-being in relation to national per capita income, there is no correlation, no hint.
All the data demonstrated say one thing:
on average, the well-being of our societies is no longer dependent on national income and economic growth.
They are extremely important in poor countries, but not in the developed world.
The difference between us and our position against the background of others is what makes a huge difference.
I'll show you snippets of our index.
That's trust, for example.
It's a part of the population that agrees that most people can be trusted.
The data is from the World Values Survey.
Look, in unequal countries, only 15% of the population trusts others.
And in equal societies, this figure reaches 60-65%.
If you look at the measurements of social activity, or social capital, you will notice very similar relationships closely related to inequality.
You could say we've done the job twice.
First, we analyzed developed countries, and then as a control study, we repeated the procedure in 50 American states, asking one question: are things worse for all our indicators in the most unequal states?
Here's trust in relation to inequality, according to the federal government's general social research.
Very similar spread, compared to the same range of trust levels.
Same story.
Overall, we found that almost everything related to trust at the international level is also manifested in our control study.
It's not just a coincidence.
Here's a graph of mental illness.
WHO, using identical diagnostic interviews conducted on random samples of the population, has collected results that allow us to compare the rate of mental illness in each of the societies.
Here is the percentage of the population who suffered from any mental illness in the past year.
The numbers start at about 8% and rise to almost 24%; entire societies with triple levels of psychological illness.
And again, this is closely related to inequality.
And here are the crimes.
These red dots show the American states, and the blue triangles represent the Canadian provinces.
But look at the scale of the differences.
It starts with 15 murders per million and reaches 150.
This is the proportion of prisoners.
We are talking about a tenfold difference, expressed in a logarithmic scale.
The numbers rise from 40 to 400 in prisons.
These relationships are not simply explained by higher crime.
Yes, in some cases this is partly true.
But for the most part, they are associated with harsher sentences.
Unequal societies are more likely to advocate retaining the death penalty.
It shows the drop-out rate.
Again, quite a big difference.
It's incredibly harmful when it comes to using talent.
And here's social mobility.
It's a measurement of mobility based on income.
Basically, it's about the following: Do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons, or is there no addiction here?
Among unequal countries, in the UK and the US, the father's income is much more important.
And in the Scandinavian countries, income is much less significant.
As a result, there is greater social mobility.
And as we often like to say — I know there are a lot of Americans in the audience — if Americans want to pursue the American dream, they should go to Denmark.
(Laughter) (Applause) I only showed a couple of points in italics.
A number of other problems could be demonstrated.
All sorts of problems that become more significant among the lower social strata.
But there are endless problems with social gradients that are much worse in unequal countries; and not a little bit, but 2, 10 times worse.
Think about the costs, what it costs people.
Let me go back to the graph shown earlier, where all the data is put together. Let's draw two conclusions.
first. Schedule after schedule, less prosperous countries, regardless of the result, are from unequal, and the Scandinavian countries and Japan are doing well.
Thus, we see in front of us a general social dysfunction against the background of inequality.
These are not one, not two separate problems. It's a trend.
Another important note about this schedule. Let's see below: Sweden and Japan: the countries are different in literally everything.
The position of women, as closely connected with the family, is exactly the opposite, in the conditions of developed countries.
Another very important difference is how they achieve greater equality.
In Sweden, income dissity is huge, but it is reduced through taxation, social programs, generous benefits, etc.
in Japan, it's different.
The difference in salaries is initially small.
Taxes are lower.
There are fewer social programs.
And in our analysis of American states, we find the same contrast.
Some states do well by redistributing income, others by smaller differences in net pre-tax income.
We believe that it does not matter by what means equality is achieved, as long as it is achieved.
I'm not talking about full equality, but about the one that exists in rich and developed market democracies.
Another surprising observation is that it's not just the poor who are affected by this inequality.
There seems to be some truth in John Donne's words: "Man is not an island."
A number of studies can compare how people do in more and less equal countries at every rung of the social ladder.
One example is:
Mortality among newborns.
A group of Swedes classified many infant deaths according to the British Register of General Socio-Economic Classification.
It's more of an anachronistic classification according to the profession of fathers, so single parents are not counted.
And by "low social level" we mean unskilled professions.
Next - skilled manual workers, then - white collar lower level and to the highest level with highly qualified professions: doctors, lawyers, directors of large companies.
You see, Sweden is doing better than the UK is doing well in all walks of life.
The biggest difference at the lower levels,
but even for the higher ranks there are benefits from a more equal society.
We showed this in five different data sets that touch on educational outcomes and health in the U.S. and internationally.
And that seems to be the big picture: greater equality is more of a difference at the bottom, but it's also good for the top.
But I have to explain what's going on.
I think it's about the psychosocial consequences of inequality everywhere.
About feeling superior and inferior, about feeling worth and vice versa, about feeling respect for yourself and vice versa.
And, of course, the sense of competition that these feelings create fuels consumerism in our society.
It also leads to fear for your status.
We worry more about how others think about us, whether they consider us attractive, smart - this worries us.
The more public assessments, the greater the fear of them.
Interestingly, parallel work is carried out in social psychology: 208 different studies were considered with the participation of volunteers who were tested in psychological laboratories for stress hormones, for a reaction to stressful tasks.
Overall, they wanted to observe types of stress that increase levels of cortisol, the main stress hormone.
As a result, such factors were situations that included a potential threat to social assessment, a threat to self-esteem or social status, situations where other people could give a negative assessment.
Just such stress factors have a special effect on the physiology of stress.
Not without criticism in our address.
Of course, there will be dissenters or people who find this surprising.
I have to tell you, in response to criticism for the compilation of data, that we don't choose that data.
Our main rule is that if the data source has the necessary indicators for one of the analyzed countries, we include it in our analysis.
It's the source of the information that decides whether that data is real, but not us.
Otherwise, we would have created a systematic error.
What about other countries?
There are 200 studies of health in relation to income and equality in academic journals.
And they are not limited to these countries, but we have excluded others for clarity.
The same countries, the same dimensions of inequality, problem after problem.
Why don't we control other factors?
Well, we've shown you that GNP per capita doesn't matter.
And, of course, others, using more sophisticated methods, controlled poverty, educational attained levels, and so on.
What about causality?
Correlation alone does not prove causality.
We spent a lot of time doing that.
Indeed, for some of these situations, causal relationships are well known.
A big change in our understanding of the causes of chronic health effects in the developed world has been how significant chronic social stress and its impact on the immune and cardiovascular systems is.
For example, violence is becoming more common in unequal societies because people are more sensitive to contempt.
I must say that to solve this problem, we should work on pre-tax and post-tax revenues.
We must limit the income and additional bonuses of the top levels.
I think we need to get our bosses to be responsible for employees in every way possible.
I want you to leave here with the realization that we can improve a person's real quality of life by reducing the income gap between us.
Now we have a foothold for influencing the psychological well-being of entire societies, and this is really incredible.
Thank you.
(Applause)

U.S. urges Qatar and its neighbors to end dispute
It is necessary to restore trust and unity between Qatar and other states, said US Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook.
He said that the conflict between the emirate and other countries in the region has been going on for too long and is detrimental to regional interests in stability, prosperity and security.
So far, the U.S. has tried unsuccessfully to mediate the dispute, which Washington views as a "threat to efforts to contain Iran."
Diplomatic relations with Qatar were severed three years ago by the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain.
They imposed a transport blockade, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorism.
In response, Doha said that the neighbors are simply jealous of Qatar's economic success - according to the IMF, Qatar has been leading in GDP per capita by a large margin for several years.
The emirate is the third largest natural gas reserve, the sixth exporter of natural gas and a major exporter of oil and petroleum products.

Denis Remenyako again rushed forward, and Alexander Vaintrub was forced to repel the attacks of Alexander Maslennikov on KTM, who broke through from the last place to the third.
Despite a tight fight in the first part of the race, towards the middle Weintrub picked up the pace, showing the best lap time in the race - and, although he could not catch up with the extremely stable Remeniako, guaranteed himself silver.
The Cayman group lagged behind the leaders, but waged a close struggle among themselves.
The best of the pilots on the Porsche was Alexei Bashmakov, who became the fourth in the standings, but Andrei Fedotov and Konstantin Zakharevsky lost a few moments to him.
And at the intermediate finish in the middle of the race, Fedotov and Zakharevsky were completely separated by 0.001 seconds.
Two more highways were included in the list of federal roads
The government of the Russian Federation included in the list of federal roads two more highways.
According to the Cabinet of Ministers, one of these roads with a length of more than 663 kilometers Chekshino - Totma - Kotlas - Kuratovo connects the Vologda and Arkhangelsk regions with the Republic of Komi.
Another highway with a length of over 388 kilometers leads from Barnaul through Pavlovsk to the border with the Republic of Kazakhstan.
On this road you can drive from the capital of the Altai Territory to the checkpoint "Kulunda".
Obtaining a new status will bring these routes to a regulatory state at the expense of the Federal Road Fund.
Major repairs and reconstruction of individual sections will be carried out, the quality of the road surface will improve.
In Tatarstan, allowed to hold film screenings in the open air
The Cabinet of Ministers of Tatarstan published a resolution according to which from July 27 in the republic it is possible to hold film screenings in open areas - in parks, squares and embankments, Tatar-inform writes.
Also, the document indicates that for citizens over 65 years of age, the regime of mandatory self-isolation has been extended until August 9.
They can leave the house to go to the store, take out the garbage or walk the dog.
But cinemas in the premises do not plan to open until the third stage of lifting restrictions, the agency reminds.
Washington is excited about the playoffs.
We missed them.
Russian hockey player "Washington Capitals" Alexander Ovechkin spoke about the preparation of the club for the upcoming resumption of the season in the NHL.
The 34-year-old Caps forward noted his teammates' readiness for games.
Psychologically, all the guys are ready.
We go to Toronto joyful, because we were without a game for a long time and missed hockey in the playoffs, - quotes Ovechkin Russian version of the NHL website. Com.
- Now we are fresh, we do not have injuries and various sores.
However, Ovechkin also admitted that he and his partners have yet to remember some of the tactical combinations: "We don't have much time to play the majority and remember the March practices of how to move the puck in such situations.
But there is still time: I am sure that in Toronto we will devote part of the training to this.
Majority and minority are important in the playoffs.
And I'm confident in our special teams."
Recall that the restart of the "Washington Capitals" is scheduled for August 3, when the "capital" will play with the "Tampa Bay Lightning".
After that, the Caps will also play the Philadelphia Flyers (August 6) and Boston Bruins (August 9).
The Russian refused to pay for parking and beat a parking worker
In Vladivostok, a man refused to pay for parking and hit a parking employee, the police are checking.
This is reported by the portal vl.ru with reference to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia in the city.
The incident occurred on Friday, July 24, in the parking lot near the shopping center.
The driver of the car refused to pay for the parking of the car, which is why there was a conflict with the employee of the parking lot.
A verbal argument escalated into assault.
The man hit the employee in the face, he fell unconscious.
He was hospitalized.
According to the source of the publication, the victim received a head injury of moderate severity and was taken to the department of neurosurgery.
Currently, the police are establishing all the circumstances of the incident.
Earlier, the Russian was charged with beating a disabled person who died later in the hospital.
According to investigators, the victim was visiting his friend - a 45-year-old local resident.
The men drank alcohol together, after which a conflict occurred between the friends.
The owner of the apartment beat the guest, he went home.
Two days later, the man became ill, he was hospitalized.
He died of his injuries.
Recently, cyber attacks on the business world have become more frequent.
Access to data from companies such as JP Morgan, Yahoo, Home Depot and Target has caused them losses of hundreds of millions, and in some cases even billions of dollars.
It doesn't take too many such attacks to damage the global economy.
The public sector is also not protected from such problems.
From 2012 to 2014, there was a significant data breach at the U.S. Office of Human Resources.
Access to trustworthiness and fingerprint data of 22 million employees was disrupted.
There are known attempts by hackers sponsored by government agencies to influence the results of elections in a number of countries with the help of stolen data.
The last two cases of disclosure of a large amount of data concern the Bundestag, the Federal Parliament of Germany, and the theft of the files of the Democratic National Committee of the United States.
The cyber threat affects our democratic processes.
The situation is even getting worse.
As computer technology evolves, data protection systems become increasingly vulnerable.
A new kind of computer technology is also of concern – computing on quantum computers, which use the microscopic properties of nature to enormously increase computing power.
It is so powerful that it will be able to crack many modern encryption systems.
Is the situation so hopeless?
Maybe it's time to pack our vital data and prepare for the imminent digital apocalypse?
I'd say, "It's not time yet."
Quantum computers are still in development, and it will take many years before they are put into practice.
More importantly, there are major breakthroughs in encryption.
For me, this is a particularly exciting time in the history of secure communications.
About 15 years ago, when I learned about the new possibility of creating quantum effects that do not exist in nature, I was very excited.
I was intrigued by the idea of applying the fundamental laws of physics to create more secure encryption.
Today, a number of companies and laboratories around the world, including mine, are working on these technologies to put them into practice.
faithfully.
Now we are preparing to fight the quantum with the help of the quantum.
So how does it all work?
First, let's take a little digression into the world of encryption.
To do this, we will need a briefcase, some important documents that we want to send to our friend, James Bond, and a castle to keep everything safe.
Since our information is top secret, we need a special portfolio.
It has a special code lock: when it is closed, it converts all the text in documents into random numbers.
You put the documents in the briefcase, close the lock — at this very moment all the documents are converted to random numbers — and send the briefcase to James.
While the briefcase is on the way, you call James to tell him the code.
When he receives the briefcase, he enters the code, the documents are decrypted, and voil – you just sent an encrypted message to James Bond.
(Laughter) It's a funny example, but it illustrates three important elements of coding.
Code – we call it an "encryption key.
It's like a password.
Call James to tell him the lock combination code.
It's called "key exchange" —
Ensure that you securely receive the encryption key from the right location.
And the lock that encodes and decodes the document.
This is called a "coding algorithm."
Using a key, it converts text in documents to random numbers.
A good algorithm will encode in such a way that without a key, the document is very difficult to decipher.
The importance of encryption is that if someone takes possession of a portfolio and cracks it without the help of an encryption key and an encoding algorithm, they will still not be able to read its contents.
The information will look like a set of random numbers.
Most security systems rely on a secure way to exchange keys to pass the encryption key to the right place.
However, the rapid development of computing power threatens a number of modern key exchange methods.
Consider one of the most widely used systems today, RSA.
When it was invented in 1977, it was assumed that it would take 40 quadrillion years to crack the 426-bit RSA key.
In 1994, just 17 years later, the code was cracked.
As computers got more powerful, we had to use more complex codes.
Today, we usually use 2,048 or 4,096 bits.
As you can see, code creators and hackers are engaged in an ongoing battle, trying to outwit each other.
And when quantum computers emerge in the next 10 to 15 years, they will be able to crack the complex mathematics that underpin many modern encryption systems even faster.
A quantum computer is likely to turn our current reliable fortress into a simple house of cards.
We must find a way to protect our fortress.
In recent years, there has been an increasing number of studies in the use of quantum effects to enhance crypto protection.
Some interesting discoveries have been made.
Remember the three main elements of encryption: high-quality keys, secure key exchange, and a sophisticated algorithm?
Advances in science and technology threaten two of these three elements.
First, the keys themselves.
Random numbers are the fundamental building blocks of encryption keys.
But to date, they are not entirely random.
Today, we create encryption keys from sequences of random numbers generated from software, so-called pseudo-random numbers.
In the numbers generated by a program or mathematical formula, one way or another there is a certain regularity.
The less random the numbers— in scientific terminology: the less entropy they contain — the easier it is to predict them.
Recently, several casinos have fallen victim to an inventive attack.
Combinations at the output of slot machines were recorded for some time, after which they were analyzed.
This allowed cybercriminals to redesign the pseudo-random number generator that controls the drums.
Which, in turn, made it possible to predict the rotation of the reels with high accuracy and get a big win.
Encryption keys may be subject to similar risks.
Secure encryption requires a truly random number generator.
For many years, scientists have been looking for the possibility of creating such a generator.
But most attempts today are either not random enough, not fast enough, or difficult to repeat.
But the quantum world is based on chance.
Therefore, it makes sense to take advantage of this fact.
Devices that can measure quantum effects can also create an infinite stream of random numbers at high speed,
which will prevent all these potential criminals in the casino.
A number of the best universities and companies around the world are engaged in the creation of generators of truly random numbers.
The first quantum generator created in my company was one by two meters in size and was placed on an optical table.
Later, we were able to reduce it to the size of a server box.
Today, it's the size of a PCI card connected to a standard computer.
It's the world's fastest truly random number generator.
Its performance is a billion random numbers per second.
Today, it is used to strengthen the security system by cloud providers, banks, government agencies around the world.
(Applause) But even with such a generator, the second big problem remains unsolved: the threat to secure key exchange.
Modern key exchange methods are not compatible with a quantum computer.
The quantum solution to this problem is called "quantum key distribution" or QKD, which is based on a fundamental, paradoxical characteristic of quantum mechanics.
A quantum particle changes depending on its observation.
I'll give you an example of how it works.
Let's get back to exchanging codes for the castle with James Bond.
Only this time, instead of calling James with a code message, we will use quantum effects on the laser to create code and send it to James over a regular optical fiber.
We believe that Dr. Nou will try to hack access to data exchange.
Fortunately, his attempts to catch quantum keys on the way will leave fingerprints that James and you can detect.
This will eliminate the intercepted keys.
And the remaining keys can be used for enhanced data protection.
Since such security is based on the fundamental laws of physics, a quantum computer or even any supercomputer of the future will not be able to crack it.
My team and I are working with leading universities, as well as the defense sector, to develop this promising technology into next-generation security tools.
The Internet of Things foreshadows an era when 25-30 billion devices will interact, which are projected to appear by 2020.
For our society to function properly in the world of the Internet of Things, trust in the systems that support these devices is vital.
I bet quantum technologies can provide that trust by allowing us to take full advantage of the amazing innovations that will enrich our lives.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Video of cats helping an injured dog cross the road
On the Internet, a video with two cats that helped an injured dog get across the road in the Krasnodar Territory is becoming popular.
A touching procession was recorded by the DVR of one of the drivers.
The events took place in the dark, the man noticed traffic on the road and slowed down.
"Look, the whole delegation is jumping," the driver ironically at first.
And then he notices that the dog moves with great difficulty.
The company safely reached the side of the road, after which it headed towards the forest.
"There is something for people to learn from animals," they write in the comments.
On Sunday, parades in honor of the Day of the Russian Navy were held in St. Petersburg and near all major fleet bases, including tartus, Syria.
They were attended by 219 different ships and 15 thousand personnel.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, who hosted the main parade in St. Petersburg, said that in 2020 the Navy will be replenished with 40 new vessels of different classes, as well as the latest weapons - including hypersonic strike systems and unmanned underwater vehicles.
In 2020, the parade was held for the first time in Kaspiysk, where the base of the Caspian Fleet was relocated from Astrakhan.
In addition to St. Petersburg, parades were held in Baltiysk, Kaspiysk, Severomorsk, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Vladivostok, as well as in the annexed Sevastopol and on the roadstead of the Syrian port of Tartus.
The main parade in the waters of the Neva and the Gulf of Finland was attended by 4 thousand servicemen and 46 vessels, including nuclear and diesel submarines, as well as helicopters and aircraft of naval aviation.
Before the start of the parade, Putin, accompanied by Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy Admiral Nikolai Evmenov and Commander of the Western Military District Colonel-General Zhuravlev, walked around several ships that were on the Kronstadt raid and in the Gulf of Finland, greeting the personnel.
The decoration of the parade was a copy of the first Russian battleship "Poltava", recreated according to archival drawings.
Emperor Peter I took part in its design.
In his speech, Putin recalled that this year marks the 200th anniversary of the discovery of Antarctica as a result of the expedition of Russian navigators Thaddeus Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev.
And on the roof of the building of the Senate and Synod during the parade were seen snipers providing security.
The parade in Baltiysk, where the Baltic Fleet is based, was attended by more than 46 warships and more than 1.5 servicemen, and the large warship "Kaliningrad" landed a naval landing.
In the annexed Sevastopol, a parade was held with the participation of 30 ships and a performance dedicated to the history of the Black Sea Fleet, which included the exit of a group of divers from under the water.
The parade in Severomorsk was attended by a new nuclear submarine "Prince Vladimir" of strategic purpose, which was accepted into the Northern Fleet in June.
In Vladivostok, the holiday ended with a salute.
The Russian Navy this year will receive forty ships and vessels
Forty ships and vessels will replenish this year the Russian Navy, said Russian President Vladimir Putin.
"The level of equipment of our navy is constantly growing.
This year, forty ships and vessels of various classes will be accepted into its composition," he said, speaking at the main parade in honor of Navy Day in St. Petersburg.
Putin also recalled that a few days ago at three shipyards in Russia were laid six new ships of the far sea zone.
Earlier it was reported that in St. Petersburg began a parade in honor of the Day of the Navy.
In an accident near Volgograd injured four-year-old child
On Saturday, July 25, at 11:28 a.m., an accident occurred on a dirt road five kilometers from the Medvedev farm.
73-year-old pensioner was driving vAZ-21083 in the direction of the village of Shiroki.
At some point, the motorist failed to control, and the car overturned on the roof.
- As a result of the accident, a 4-year-old girl was injured, - the press service of the regional Central Board of the Ministry of Internal Affairs said.
- The child was hospitalized with injuries.
18 children died since the beginning of summer in the Volgograd region
In the Volgograd region disappeared without a trace pensioner
Officers of the Northern Fleet received state awards
Commander of the Northern Fleet Hero of Russia Vice-Admiral Alexander Moiseev presented state awards to distinguished officers.
This is stated in a statement on the official website of the Ministry of Defense.
As noted in the message, orders and medals were received by 12 senior and senior officers from the submarine forces, the army corps, the air force and air defense army, the White Sea naval base, weapons units and the headquarters of the Northern Fleet.
The head of the technical department of the Northern Fleet, Rear Admiral Sergei Grishko, was thanked by the President of the Russian Federation.
How will the central bank's decision to reduce the key rate affect the economy?
The Bank of Russia is expected to again reduce the key rate.
It fell another 0.25 percentage points, to 4.25% per annum - formally another historical low.
Judging by the return of a short step of rate cuts, as well as the tone of the Central Bank's statements and updated forecasts for the Russian economy, the regulator looks at the economic prospects more optimistically than before.
This means that the current cycle of monetary easing may soon stop.
"We continued to ease monetary policy, primarily given that there are still risks of inflation deviation down from 4% in 2021," said the head of the Bank of Russia Elvira Nabiullina.
They are associated with a significant decline in economic activity, a drop in domestic and external demand.
Economic recovery, according to Nabiullina, will take more than a year and a half.
At the same time, she noted that after the lifting of restrictions due to the pandemic, economic processes revived: energy consumption, consumer and investment demand were restored, construction and production of consumer goods expanded, the annual rate of decline in transport turnover and industrial production slowed down.
According to the updated forecast of the Central Bank, in 2020 the contraction of the economy will be 4.5-5.5% (before that 4-6% was expected), and the recovery growth of the economy in 2021 will be 3.5-4.5%, in 2022 - 2.5-3.5%.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised its forecast for annual oil prices to $ 38 and $ 40 per barrel of Urals in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
Earlier, the Central Bank expected 27 and 35 dollars per barrel.
Finally, the Bank of Russia's inflation forecast for 2020 was 3.7-4.2% against the previously expected 3.8-4.8%.
The Bank of Russia's view of the situation in the economy is becoming more optimistic, which brings us closer to the end of the easing cycle, according to Renaissance Capital economists for Russia and the CIS Sofia Donets and Andrey Melaschenko.
Thus, the Bank of Russia has been consistently reducing the key rate for more than a year, since the beginning of last summer it has already fallen by 3.5 percentage points.
And at the last meeting in June, the Central Bank lowered it by one percentage point at once due to low inflation rates due to suppressed demand and the need to stimulate the economy that has slowed down due to the pandemic and related restrictions.
The chances of adjusting monetary policy remain (at the next meeting on September 18 and until the end of the year), but the limit is already near, agrees the chief analyst of Rosbank Evgeny Koshelev.
The combination of pro-inflation risks also points to the proximity of a pause in interest rate policy easing — disrupted supply chains, possible cost increases due to epidemic prevention measures and a faster (compared to expectations) recovery in demand, he says.
To top it off, the subsequent actions of the Bank of Russia will require more attention to inflationary processes during the harvest season, as well as external volatility increased against the background of geopolitical conflicts, Koshelev points out.
One way or another, a reduction in the key rate will lead to a further reduction in rates for the most reliable borrowers, as well as, possibly, on mortgages, says Maxim Petronevich, senior economist at the analytical department of Otkritie Bank.
The correction of rates will be less pronounced than the reduction of the key rate, he said.
Rates on consumer loans may fall by another 0.3-0.6 percentage points during the second half of the year, mortgage rates can end the year in the range of 6.2-7%, does not exclude the economist of "BCS Premier" Anton Pokatovich.
Average rates on deposits, in his opinion, will also fall - in the coming months they may fall to 4.2-4.5% (now barely above 4.5%).
Further, they can drop to 4% if the Central Bank reduces the key rate in the fall, Pokatovich believes.
The Centrist Party promises to pay off all its debts by the end of the year
This was told in an interview with ERR by the Secretary General of the Centre Party Mikhail Korb.
According to him, the total amount of payments that the party has to make is about 300,000 euros.
"According to today's financial forecasts, the Centre Party will pay off its current debts and liabilities by the end of this year," Korb said.
Earlier it became known that the party of the Prime Minister returned to the state 110 100 euros, which were recognized as a prohibited donation.
In HarjuMaa, a car and a caravan collided: four people were injured
According to police, the accident occurred at 13:50 in the village of Soodla, where a Mercedes-Benz car driven by a 31-year-old woman collided with a Fiat car park with a 48-year-old man at the wheel.
As a result of the incident, the drivers of both vehicles were injured, as well as passengers who were in the mobile home: a 10-year-old child and a 48-year-old woman who was taken to the hospital.
The rest of the victims were given first aid on the spot, they did not need hospitalization.
The exact circumstances of the incident are being clarified.
The Ukrainian military will control the ceasefire in the Donbass
The Ukrainian military began preparations for a ceasefire on the demarcation line in the Donbass, control over the implementation of the agreements will be carried out by servicemen with experience in peacekeeping missions, the headquarters of the Joint Forces reports on Facebook.
"Units from the Joint Forces have begun preparations for a full and comprehensive ceasefire on the demarcation line, which comes into force on July 27, 2020," the report said.
It is noted that, starting from 00:01 on July 27, at each of the Ukrainian positions, additional control over the ceasefire will be carried out by specially seconded Ukrainian servicemen, most of whom have combat experience and directly dealt with specialized issues during participation in peacekeeping missions under the auspices of the UN.
Such a step will allow "not to distract the personnel of the Joint Forces units from performing combat missions and prevent possible provocations," the report said.
At Wednesday's meeting of the contact group on Donbass, the parties agreed on a set of additional measures to control the truce, which, among other things, includes a ban on the activities of sabotage and reconnaissance groups and a ban on firing, including sniper fire.
In Moscow, died 13 patients with coronavirus
In Moscow, over the past day, another 13 patients with coronavirus have died.
Thus, the total number of deaths in the Russian capital reached 4411.
Earlier, the head of the Ministry of Health Mikhail Murashko called the number of Russians in intensive care with coronavirus.
For all the time in Russia was recorded 812.5 thousand cases of infection with coronavirus.
Of these, 13.3 thousand people died, another 600.3 thousand were cured.

Psychologist: "Emelianenko still can not forget parting with his beloved woman."
Psychologist Veronika Stepanova, who has more than 1 million subscribers on Youtube, told about MMA fighter Alexander Emelianenko, who is the ex-husband of her sister.
Olya met with Sasha, they began a stormy love, - said Stepanova in a video on her Youtube channel.
- It was a very beautiful story, they instantly gave birth to a child, everything was beautiful and wonderful.
At some point, Sasha was fed up with all this, he wanted to walk a little.
And if any other woman reacts to this normally (well, you think, went for a walk, dance a little), then this is not about Olya.
She doesn't tolerate such things.
And his story about a little walk ended with the fact that his sister instantly married another man and immediately gave birth to his child.
When Sasha recovered from what had happened, he couldn't believe it.
He tried to crawl on his knees, give diamonds.
His lion's pride blew his head.
He wanted to return everything, but he did not understand how to return it.
They maintain friendly relations, they have a common child, but he still can not recover.
His destructive behavior is a cry of despair, an attempt to either kill or get her attention.
The Carolina prospect will go to play in Sweden.
Carolina prospect Jack Drury will compete in the Swedish championship next season, Hockey News journalist Ryan Kennedy said on Twitter.
The U.S. Youth Team player played in the NCAA for Harvard last season.
In 28 matches, he scored 39 (20+19) points.
Drury was selected by Carolina in the 2018 NFL Draft with the 42nd overall pick.
Albert Proza signed a contract with Legion Tallinn
Prose's last club was Tammeka Tartu, for which he played last season.
"Because of the injury, I was out of football for more than a year.
On April 30, he underwent surgery.
But now it's okay - ready to play again.
However, while my form is far from optimal.
When will I make my debut for Legion?
It is quite possible that on July 29 I will play some time for the Estonian Cup, and on August 1 I will get into the application for the championship match against Payde.
But it all depends on the decision of the coach, he will decide whether I am ready or not.
I myself believe that I still need to recruit quite a lot," Albert Proza said in an interview with ERR on Sunday.
In the current Estonian football championship , "Legion" after 14 rounds occupies the ninth place in the standings, gaining 10 points.
"At the moment, if you look at the table, we can't talk about the struggle for high places, but legion is an ambitious team, we have a fairly good squad.
I think that next year we will have better results.
And the task for this year is to maintain a place in the top league and play more confidently," Proza added.
"I do not set any personal goals for myself.
Returning to football after such a big pause is not easy.
Now my main task is to help the team stay in the top league and climb as high in the table as possible," the striker said.
Previously, Proza also played for the capital's Flora and Infonet, Finnish RoPS and TPS, Maltese Valletta.
Proza played 7 matches for the Estonian national team.

The average daily growth rate of new COVID-19 cases for the month is about -0.57%.
Among the newly diagnosed cases, 49.2% were in people aged 18 to 45 years, 30.6% were between 46 and 65 years old, 9.6% were 66 to 79, and another 3.3% were over 80 years of age.
Children among them - 7.3%.
The main naval parade was marked by new ships and shooting technologies
At the Main Naval Parade in St. Petersburg, a new shooting technology was applied: a video camera "passed" under one of the ships, showing it "from the wrong side".
In this perspective, the passage of the newest serial small missile ship "Sovetsk" along the Admiralty embankment was filmed.
The main naval parade was broadcast by the TV channel "Russia 1" and the website of the Russia.tv.
Earlier, on June 24, at the parade in honor of the 75th anniversary of the Great Victory, the camera during the transition from one plan to another "passed" through the muzzle of the tank inside the armored vehicle, and during the flight of the fighters of the aerobatic teams "Russian Knights" and "Swifts", the camera "flew out" of the nozzle of the aircraft engine.
The main naval parade consisting of 46 warships, boats and submarines, 41 aircraft and helicopters of naval aviation and more than 4 thousand servicemen ended in the waters of Kronstadt.
The parade, in particular, was attended by a large anti-submarine ship "Vice-Admiral Kulakov", the corvette "Stoyky", large landing ships "Minsk" and "Patriot", the nuclear submarine missile cruiser "Eagle", the submarine "Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky", the patrol ship "Vasily Bykov", small anti-submarine ships "Kazanets" and "Urengoy", small missile ships "Rain" and "Passat", missile boat "Chuvashia".
On the roadstead of Kronstadt in the Gulf of Finland it was possible for the first time to see a large landing ship "Peter Morgunov", built according to the project 11711 of the Nevsky Design Plant at the Baltic plant "Yantar".
The lead ship of this series "Ivan Gren" is already serving in the Northern Fleet, reports TASS.
Among other newcomers recently entered service with the Navy was the first serial frigate "Admiral of the Fleet Kasatonov", built according to project 22350 at the Plant "Northern Shipyard".
Another newcomer of the Navy is the diesel-electric submarine "Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky" of project 636.3 of the Central Design Bureau of Marine Equipment "Rubin", built at the "Admiralty Shipyards".
It joined Russia's Pacific Fleet in December 2019.
Other new ships that have recently joined the Navy are the small missile ships Sovetsk and Mytishchi of Project 22800 (Karakurt), developed by the Almaz Central Design Bureau.
The parade on the Neva river was also attended by small missile ships "Veliky Ustyug" and "Serpukhov" of project 21631 "Buyan-M".
And the largest participants were the nuclear submarine missile cruiser "Eagle" and a large anti-submarine ship "Vice-Admiral Kulakov" - they could be seen in the Gulf of Finland.
In recognition of the great contribution of the Russian Navy to the exploration of the World Ocean, two of the newest hydrographic boats "Georgy Zima" and "Mikhail Kazansky" passed along the Neva River together with warships. And on the Kronstadt raid stood the oceanographic research vessel "Admiral Vladimirsky", which completed in June a joint scientific round-the-world expedition with the Russian Geographical Society to the shores of Antarctica in honor of the 200th anniversary of its discovery by Russian navigators Thaddeus Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev.
And at the Palace Bridge you could see the first Russian battleship of the XVI century "Poltava" recreated at the historical shipyard.
This 54-gun sailing ship was launched in 1712, participated in the war with the Swedes, and in 1717 provided the landing on the island of Gotland.
In 1725, this ship was withdrawn from the Baltic Fleet, and after its reconstruction - launched in St. Petersburg on May 27, 2018.
Travel to Kronstadt this year was limited for the duration of the parade in connection with the prevention of the spread of the coronavirus COVID-19, RIA Novosti reports.
During protests in the United States killed 1 person
Protests took place in Seattle, Portland, Louisville and Denver, the Actual Camera reported Sunday.
In Austin, Texas, a man died during a protest.
The protester was shot with a rifle while he was sitting in his car.
The suspect in the crime has already been detained.
In other cities, there were clashes between demonstrators and law enforcement officers.
Protesters staged riots and the police were forced to use tear gas and stun grenades.
Poll: The ruling Union of Peasants and Greens of Lithuania again topped the rating of parties
The Union of Peasants and Greens of Lithuania, which heads the ruling coalition of the Seimas, topped the rating of the parties.
This was shown by a survey conducted by the sociological research company Vilmorus and ordered the newspaper Lietuvos rytas.
After winning the parliamentary elections in 2016, the "peasants" lost first place and for a long time the main critic of Russia in Lithuania, the opposition "Union of the Fatherland - Christian Democrats (Conservatives), was in the lead.
However, recently, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda, assessing the electoral capabilities of the parties, said that the Union of Peasants and Greens after this year's parliamentary elections is likely to be able to form a coalition again.
This statement caused indignation of conservatives.
The latest poll showed that if parliamentary elections were held today, 17.6 percent of voters would vote for the peasants, and 17.2 percent for the conservatives.
According to Vilmorus director Vladas Gaidis, the gap is within the margin of error, and yet the ruling ones have ceased to lag behind the conservatives.
According to Gaidis, the sociological success of the "peasants" was facilitated by the news that their electoral list will be headed by Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis.
This politician was the first in the list of "peasants" in the elections of 2016.
In third place is the Social Democratic Party, for which 7.1 percent of respondents are now ready to vote.
She unexpectedly lost 2 percent.
The fourth is the Labor Party, headed by Russian-born businessman Viktor Uspasskikh (6.2 percent).
The rest of the political organizations, judging by the poll, will not yet be able to overcome the 5% electoral barrier.
Putin spoke about the unique advantages of the Russian fleet
Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Main Naval Parade in St. Petersburg said that the unique advantages and increase in the combat capabilities of the Russian fleet will be achieved through the introduction of advanced digital technologies.
As the head of state specified, domestic hypersonic strike complexes, unmanned underwater vehicles have no analogues in the world.
In addition, the Russian leader drew attention to the most effective means of defense of the Russian Federation.
According to the Russian leader, the level of equipment of the Russian Navy is constantly growing, so, this year 40 ships and vessels of various classes will be accepted into its composition.
At the same time, it is noted that the emphasis will be placed on equipping with unique hypersonic strike complexes.
Today, the Navy is armed with the latest ships equipped with high-precision weapons, strategic submarine cruisers and multi-purpose submarines, as well as unique samples of special equipment, the president added.
Putin also stressed that military sailors adequately perform the most difficult tasks, impeccably serving the Fatherland.
The Ministry of Emergency Situations warned residents of the Moscow region about the thunderstorm
In the Moscow region is expected thunderstorm and wind gusts up to 15 m / s. This was reported by the regional Department of the Ministry of Emergency Situations on Sunday, July 26.
Residents are advised to remove household items from yards and prune dry trees that can damage the home.
The car should be placed in a garage or parked away from trees or weakly fortified structures.
To avoid a lightning strike, it is recommended not to heat the stove in the house in a thunderstorm and not to use electrical appliances, and on the street not to hide under trees (especially lonely), not to swim in ponds.
Those who are in the car are advised to close the windows and stay inside.
On July 24, the Ministry of Emergency Situations also warned residents of the Moscow region about a thunderstorm.
Unnecessary requirements for applications for public procurement will be excluded by law
The legislation may establish exhaustive requirements for applications for participation in procurement.
In the autumn session, at the plenary session of the State Duma, it is planned to consider in the second reading a bill establishing requirements for the content and composition of the application for participation in the procurement, the participants of which can only be small and medium-sized businesses.
Amendments are made by the government to the law "On procurement of goods, works, services by certain types of legal entities".
The bill was developed in pursuance of the roadmap for the implementation of the Strategy for the Development of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises in the Russian Federation until 2030, approved by the government.
It provides for the preparation of a draft law on an exhaustive list of documents that customers have the right to require as part of an application from procurement participants - small and medium-sized businesses.
And also - about the list of requirements for these documents.
To date, the law "On procurement of goods, works, services by certain types of legal entities" framework regulates the procurement activities of certain types of legal entities.
Requirements for the content, form, design and composition of the application for participation in the procurement are established by customers independently in the procurement documentation.
"As a result, customers establish excessive requirements for the content, execution of the application, the mandatory presence in its composition of certificates, certificates, extracts, the period for obtaining which in the authorized bodies is comparable to the deadline for submitting applications, which leads to the impossibility of participating in such a purchase and reducing the number of procurement participants," the explanatory note to the bill says.
The new draft law provides for the establishment of an exhaustive list of documents that customers have the right to require as part of the application from procurement participants who are small and medium-sized businesses.
"The adoption of the document will eliminate the arbitrary establishment by customers of requirements for the composition and content of applications of participants who are small and medium-sized businesses," the explanatory note says.
As an artist, interconnection is very important to me.
In my works, I try to show that people are inseparable from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I first visited Antarctica almost 10 years ago, where I saw icebergs.
I was in awe.
My heart beat faster, my head spinning, trying to understand what had opened up in front of me.
Icebergs around floated out of the water for almost 200 feet. And I couldn't help but be surprised that it's one snowflake on top of another, year after year.
Icebergs are born when they break away from glacier ice or break off from ice shelves.
Each iceberg has its own personality.
Everyone interacts with the environment in their own way and accumulates their own experience.
Some refuse to give up and hold on to the bitter end, while others can no longer fight and die in a fit of bright passion.
Looking at an iceberg, it's easy to think that it's isolated, that it's closed and lonely, just as we humans often see ourselves.
But life is very different.
When an iceberg melts, I breathe in its ancient atmosphere.
When an iceberg melts, it releases fresh, mineral-rich water that nourishes many life forms.
I approach photographing these icebergs as creating portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these individual moments they exist in this image, and that it will never happen again.
They don't die when they melt; it is not the end, but a continuation of their journey in the cycle of life.
Sometimes the ice in the icebergs I photograph is very young — it's only a couple thousand years old.
And some icebergs are older than 100,000 years.
The last photos I want to show you show you show you are of an iceberg I photographed in Kirtartivatziak, greenland.
It is very rare to see an iceberg spinning.
So here it is.
On the left you can see a small boat.
It is approximately 4.5 meters long.
Please pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and the place of its contact with water.
Here you can see how it begins to rotate, and the boat swam to the other side, and there is a man standing there.
It's a medium-sized Greenland iceberg.
It protrudes from the water for about 120 feet or 40 meters.
And here's this real-time recording.
(Music) And so simply, the iceberg shows us the other side of his personality.
Thank you.
(Applause)
One winter morning a few years ago, I was driving to work in Johannesburg, South Africa, and noticed fog overhanging the city.
I go there almost every day, so I probably wouldn't have paid attention to it sooner.
Johannesburg is known for its special horizons, which I could barely see that morning.
I soon realized it was a huge cloud of polluted air.
The contrast between my usual picturesque environment and that sky shrouded in smog stirred something in me.
I was terrified that this city of colorful and picturesque sunsets would be swallowed up by the mist.
At that moment, I had a strong desire to do something, but I did not know what.
All I knew was that I couldn't stand aside.
The main difficulty was that I was not very versed in ecology, air quality management or atmospheric chemistry.
I'm a computer engineer, and I was sure I couldn't handle it with code.
(Laughter) Who am I to make a difference?
But I was a resident of this city.
In the years that followed, I learned one very important lesson — a lesson that needs to be taken seriously if we are to pursue a better future.
Even if you are not an expert in any field, your experience from the outside can be the key to solving complex problems in this area.
Sometimes your unique vision can result in an extraordinary idea that will move everything from the dead point, but you have to be brave enough to try to do it.
That's the only way out.
Even then, I realized that in order to at least try to change the situation for the better, first I would have to understand air pollution, so I became a student again.
Already at the very beginning of my research, I learned that air pollution is the main danger to the state of the environment.
According to the World Health Organization, nearly 14 percent of deaths worldwide in 2012 were caused by home air pollution and ambient air pollution, which is particularly common in low- and middle-income countries.
Air pollution alone causes more deaths each year than malaria or HIV/AIDS.
In Africa, the number of premature deaths due to unsafe sanitation or malnutrition among children is nothing compared to the number of deaths due to air pollution, and it comes at a huge economic cost: more than $400 billion as of 2013, according to a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
Now in my work I am exploring new opportunities in the field of artificial intelligence, where the symbiotic relationship between man and machine will help to find a favorable basis for making the right decisions.
In the process of studying the problem of air pollution, it became clear that we need to find a way to make better decisions to control air pollution, and given the scale of the problem, it is necessary to do so through joint efforts.
So I decided to meet people who work in this field.
I started meeting with officials from Johannesburg and other nearby cities, I also attracted the local scientific community, and also made a few cold calls.
The networking process I was engaged in helped me gain a deeper understanding of the problem.
It also helped me avoid falling into the trap that my colleagues often fall into trying to innovate when we quickly apply the technology before we are clearly aware of the problem.
I started thinking about what I could do to improve the situation.
I just started asking myself how I could effectively combine all my programming and ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE skills with the experiences of the people I met.
I wanted to create an online air quality management platform that would identify patterns in pollution, look to the future, and determine what we should expect.
I was going to put my idea into practice, but faced uncertainty, I had no guarantee of success.
I only had a certain set of engineering skills, skills that I had acquired in my profession (Laughter) that people who had been dealing with air pollution for many years did not have.
I realized that sometimes just one fresh look, some new skills create the conditions for the emergence of something outstanding.
Willpower and imagination are our guiding star, giving us the ability to find new paths and circumvent difficulties.
Armed with a deep understanding of air pollution and decades of information on pollutant concentrations and meteorological conditions in Johannesburg and beyond, my colleagues from South Africa and China and I have created an air decision support system that resides in the cloud.
The software system analyzes historical and real-time data to identify spatial and temporal trends.
We then used new machine learning technology to predict pollution levels for different pollutants a few days in advance.
This means that residents can make better decisions about their movements and choosing a place of residence for their families.
We will be able to predict cases of pollution in advance, to identify the culprits of pollution, who, by order of the authorities, will be forced to reduce the scale of their activities.
With the help of scenario planning, urban planners will be able to make the right decisions in the development of infrastructure, such as residential settlements, industrial zones.
We completed testing of our technology, which lasted about 120 days, covering all of South Africa.
The results were approved when we demonstrated a strong relationship between the forecast data and the data we obtained on site.
Thanks to our leadership, we have created advanced, groundbreaking technologies that can predict air quality with unprecedented accuracy, improving the city I was driving through one winter morning not so long ago and thinking, "Something is wrong here. What can be done?"
And here's my takeaway: What if I hadn't started studying air pollution then?
What if I hadn't expressed concern about the environment and just hoped that someone somewhere was already dealing with the problem?
Here's what I've learned: When we decide on a complex venture that contributes to what we firmly believe in, it's important to focus on success and consider the consequences of inaction.
We must not go astray in the face of obstacles and difficulties, it should motivate us even more.
Wherever you are, when you realize that your natural curiosity is excited by something and that's what excites you, and you have crazy and bold ideas, and maybe it's beyond your purview, ask yourself: why not?
Why not act and solve the problem as you can in your own way?
And you may be pleasantly surprised.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Republicans will offer to give out another $ 1 trillion to support the US economy
Republicans will offer to spend another $ 1 trillion to support the economy of the United States, confirmed on Sunday, July 26, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Fox News.
"Within the package of $ 1 trillion there are the most priority and urgent things," said the head of the US Treasury.
The support package includes new direct payments to Americans.
The proposal must be adopted by Congress and signed by US President Donald Trump.
Representatives of the US Democratic Party believe that the proposed funds are not enough.
In the spring, about $ 3 trillion was allocated to support the economy in the United States.
On April 24, Trump signed a bill on financial assistance to the American economy in the amount of almost half a trillion dollars to combat the coronavirus and its consequences.
According to analysts, US GDP in the second quarter of 2020 will fall by 25% in annual terms, which will be the strongest recession in the history of the country.
Microsoft will forcibly update older versions of Windows 10
Microsoft has confirmed the transition to the next stage of distribution of the May 2020 Update for the Windows 10 operating system, the BetaNews portal writes on July 25.
The package is not needed: FAS doubted the legitimacy of Microsoft's antivirus offer
Having received software for remote work from an American corporation, government agencies can violate the law
The company will expand the circle of users with a new version of the OS.
To do this, computers with old versions of the system decided to automatically update.
It is assumed that a specially developed algorithm will identify devices with older versions of the software platform, whose support period will soon end, and automatically install Windows 10 May 2020 Update on them.
In the near future, this will affect computers with Windows 10 (1809) and Windows 10 (1903), support for which expires on November 10 and December 8, respectively, the newspaper notes.
On July 21, it was reported that after updating the Windows 10 operating system, users encountered problems when connecting to the Internet - there was no access to the network.
The difficulties were not related to the connection to the network itself, but to the connection status.
Dr. Myasnikov called the main indicators of human health
In the "deadly quartet" one of the main criteria was the excess of the waist
Doctor and TV presenter Alexander Myasnikov spoke about the key indicators by which you can determine human health.
His so-called "deadly quartet" included four criteria - this is an increase in pressure, cholesterol, sugar and waist volume, the doctor said on the air of the TV channel "Russia 1".
Myasnikov urged everyone to pay attention to these factors.
And according to him, to control the volume of the waist is even more important than weight.
For men, this parameter should not exceed 102 centimeters, for women - 88 centimeters.
Exceeding these norms may indicate that health is at risk.
First of all, we are talking about the condition of the heart - the waist volume above the norm is a risk factor for stroke, heart attack, as well as cancer and diabetes.
We will remind, earlier Myasnikov told why you can eat candy at night.
The doctor explained that sugar itself is not dangerous to health, dessert will become harmful only when there is such food in large quantities, and candy at night, according to him, is not the worst snack.
On "Igor Drive" the winners in Touring and Super-Production were determined
At the Igora Drive circuit, where the main stage of the Russian series of circuit races takes place, the Touring and Super Production competitions have ended.
This was reported by channel Five on Sunday, July 26.
The leaders in the Touring were Kirill Ladygin, Dmitry Bragin, Alexei Dudukalo, Pavel Kalmanovich, Ivan Lukashevich.
Andrey Petukhov, Vladislav Nezvankin, Nikolay Vikhansky, Vadim Antipov, Dmitry Lebedev won in Super-production.
In the Trophy of the SMP RSKG, Rustam Fatkhutdinov became the best, Lev Tolkachev and Pavel Yashin became the winners.
The documentary "John Lewis: Good Trouble" was released online.
The biography film, which was supposed to be a kind of visual congratulation to Congressman John Lewis, who celebrated his 80th birthday at the beginning of the year, became a detailed epitaph.
On July 17, an outstanding human rights defender and politician died after a long battle with pancreatic cancer.
These days in the United States there are numerous mourning events in memory of him.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows have floated the idea of passing a law focused on several topics, including federal unemployment payments that expire Friday.
The remaining issues are proposed to be addressed at a later date.
Moderna Inc said Sunday it has received $472 million from the U.S. Office of Advanced Biomedical Research to develop a vaccine for the novel coronavirus.
The U.S.-based drug firm explained that the additional funding is intended to help the company operate in the late stage of clinical trials.
Without any warning, the UK has removed Spain from the list of safe countries for travel and imposed a two-week quarantine for all entering the country from Spain.
British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab did not apologize for the sudden decision, explaining it by the recent spike in covid-19 cases in Spain.
Protests
In a number of US cities, protests were held to draw attention to the problem of racial injustice.
In Seattle, police fired stun grenades and tear gas and arrested 45 people after demonstrations in support of protests in Portland escalated into violence.
Police said more than 20 police officers were injured.
In Austin, Texas, a man died Saturday when someone shot at black Lives Matter marchers.
According to media reports, the man may have approached the car with a rifle when he was shot.
Experts from the United States called Pompeo the worst Secretary of State in the history of the country
International affairs experts Aaron David Miller and Richard Sokolsky called Mike Pompeo the worst secretary of state in the history of the United States.
The material with their opinion on July 23 was published by CNN.
In just two short years, Mike Pompeo – with an eye on the presidency in 2024 and support for President Donald Trump – has become not only the worst secretary of state in U.S. history, but also the most politically biased.
Experts accused Pompeo of "politicizing the position of secretary of state and desecreting the institution he runs" in order to promote his personal political agenda and protect Trump "from accountability and the rule of law."
According to them, the Secretary of State, in particular, covers up the "Trump blackmail of Ukraine" and is ready to frame the employees of the American foreign Ministry for their cooperation with Congress in this case.
In addition, Pompeo recalled that he was pretty friendly with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who claimed partial responsibility for the murder of The Washington Post columnist Jamal Khasheggi.
Trump announced the decision to appoint Mike Pompeo as head of the State Department on March 13, 2018, after the dismissal of former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.
Prior to that, Pompeo headed the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
In Tikhoretsk, a foreign car drove into the store
Today, July 26, in Tikhoretsk on Menshikov Street, the Land Cruiser SUV drove into the trading hall of a chain supermarket at speed.
The incident was recorded by surveillance cameras.
As a result of the accident, a boy was injured, who at that time was in the store.
The child was hospitalized with injuries and cuts.
In the hall of the shopping facility destroyed showcases and counters.
Eyewitnesses claim that the driver of a foreign car was in a state of alcoholic intoxication.
Do you know how many species of flowering plants there are?
A quarter of a million — at least those we know — a quarter of a million species of flowering plants.
Flowers are a real problem for plants:
they are hard to create,
they require huge amounts of energy and resources.
Why do plants go to such difficulties?
The answer to this, as well as many other questions, is sex.
I know what you think when you look at these pictures.
The reason sexual reproduction is so important is because there are many other ways plants reproduce.
They can be propagated by cuttings; they can impregnate themselves or pollinate themselves.
But it is very important for them to distribute their genes in order to mix them with the genes of other plants - so they can adapt to natural niches.
That's how evolution works.
Plants transmit genetic information through pollen.
Some of you may have seen some of these images before.
As I like to say, every home has to have a scanning electron microscope to look at these things.
There are as many different types of pollen as there are flowering plants.
By the way, this can be applied in forensics and not only.
Basically, the pollen that causes allergies is pollen from plants that use wind to spread it. It's a very inefficient process, that's why it's so clogged in our noses.
Plants have to throw out huge masses of pollen, in the hope that germ cells, male germ cells that are contained in pollen, will somehow accidentally get to another flower, absolutely by accident.
The pollen of all grasses, and therefore all cereals, and the pollen of most of the trees, is carried by the wind.
However, most species use insects for this. To some extent, this is more reasonable because less pollen is required.
Insects and other species can take pollen and carry it to where it is needed.
It is clear that we know the relationship between insects and plants.
It's a symbiotic relationship: whether it's flies, birds, or bees, they all get something in return, and it's something usually nectar.
In some cases, this symbiosis has led to amazing adaptations – for one, the hummingbird hawk moth is beautiful in its adaptation.
The plant gets its own - hawk moth spreads pollen elsewhere.
Plants evolved so that they created small planting strips in different places for bees so that they would not get lost.
Many plants have a coloration that makes them look like insects.
These are the anthers of the lily, cleverly made so that when an unsuspecting insect sits on them, the anther turns over and hits it on the back, showering it with a large amount of pollen, with which the insect then goes to another plant.
And here's an orchid that looks like it has jaws. In a sense, it has them, which forces the insect to crawl out, covered with pollen, which it will then spread.
There are at least 20,000 species of orchids — and they're all remarkably diverse.
They go to a variety of tricks.
They are forced to attract pollinators to reproduce.
This orchid, known as Darwin's orchid, because it was he who studied it and made a startling prediction when he saw it. You can see a very long tube of nectar that falls from the orchid.
You see the middle of the flower: the insect must stick the proboscis right in the middle and get to the bottom of this tube to get nectar.
Darwin claimed, looking at this flower: "I assume something evolved with it."
And really, that's the insect.
Usually its proboscis is in a coauted state, but in its straightened form it looks like this.
One might think that if nectar – so valuable and expensive to produce – attracts so much attention from pollinators, then, as with sex in humans, deceptions can begin.
A flower might say, "I have some nectar.
Will you look?" here's a plant.
Here is a plant that insects love in South Africa. In the process of evolution, they acquired a long proboscis to get nectar from the bottom.
And that's imitation.
This plant imitates the previous one.
And here is the long-trunked fly, which did not get a drop of nectar from the fake. Because the imitating plant didn't give her anything. She thought she was going to get something.
But not only did the fly not receive nectar from the fake plant, but also, if you zoom in, in the area of the lower part of the head, grabbed some pollen, which it will transfer to another plant, unless some botanist appears and pins it to a blue cardboard.
(Laughter) Deception spreads in the plant kingdom as well.
This flower has black dots: they seem black to us, but for male insects of a certain species, they look like two females ready for anything.
(Laughter) When an insect gets to this flower and lands on it, it dips itself in pollen, which, of course, will transfer to another plant. If you look into the same scanning electron microscope that should be in every house, you can see here a certain three-dimensional arrangement of the pattern.
So it probably even brings a pleasant feeling to the insect, except that it looks attractive.
In the picture from the electron microscope - here is an orchid imitating an insect - it is clear that different parts of this structure have different colors and textures, but insects can perceive them in a completely different way.
This plant has adapted to imitate the shiny metal surface of the body of some beetles.
Under the scanning electron microscope, it is clear that the surface is very different from the surfaces we were looking at.
Sometimes the whole plant imitates the insect, even from our point of view.
I think it's like some kind of flying creature.
It's a striking, amazing flower.
And smart. It's called obsidian.
I call it cunning.
For a bee of a certain species, it resembles another very aggressive bee, and it flies up and hits its head many times to drive away the "bee", and, of course, is covered with pollen.
This plant also mimics another orchid that has a wonderful warehouse of food for insects.
And this one has nothing for them.
So she's cheating on two levels — just unheard of.
(Laughter) Here's ylang-ylang, a component of many perfumes.
I recently sniffed someone who choked on it.
Flowers in principle do not need to be so fragrant.
They emit a striking range of smells for any insects with a sense of smell.
But it doesn't smell so good.
It's a flower that smells very, very bad, and it evolved to look like carrion.
Flies really like it.
They fly in and pollinate.
Here is this one, helicodiceros, also known as the "dead horse lily".
I don't know what a dead horse really smells like, but this one definitely smells very similar.
It's really terrible.
And meat flies just can't resist.
They fly inside and fly to the bottom.
There they lay eggs, thinking that this is a great piece of carrion, and not realizing that there is no food for the larvae and the larvae will die, but in the meantime the plant has benefited because the bristles relax, and the fly flies away to pollinate the next flower. It's amazing.
Here's arum, arum maculatum, or in the U.S. – aronous spotted.
I photographed him the previous week in Dorset.
It warms up about 15 degrees above ambient temperature — amazing.
If you look into it from above, you can see something behind the cob that looks like a dam. Flies are attracted to heat — the evaporation of volatile compounds — and they get stuck at the bottom of this container.
They drink divine nectar and become sticky.
Overnight, they are covered with pollen flowing around them from above, and then the bristles we saw above weaken and release pollen-covered flies. It's an awesome thing.
If you think that's amazing, here's one of my favorites.
Philodendron Sello.
Those from Brazil should be aware of this plant.
That's the most amazing thing.
This phallic thing is about 30 centimeters long.
It does something that no other plant I know of does: when it blooms — here in the middle of the cob — for about two days, its metabolism is similar to that of mammals.
Instead of starch, which is food for plants, it takes something similar to brown fat and burns it at such a rate, digests it in the same way as a small cat.
This return of energy, in equivalent weight, is twice as high as that of hummingbirds – absolutely amazing.
And it does something else, also unusual.
Not only does it warm itself up to Fahrenheit 115, or 43-44 Celsius, for two days, but it also keeps the temperature constant.
It has a thermoregulation mechanism that maintains a constant temperature.
You'll ask, "Why is he doing this?"
Well, as if you didn't know that there are beetles that just love to make love at this temperature.
They climb inside, and that's where it starts.
(Laughter) And the plant showers them with pollen, and they go to pollinate.
Surprisingly invented.
Most of the pollinators we know are insects, but in the tropics, many birds and butterflies also pollinate.
Many tropical flowers are red, and it seems to us that this is because butterflies and birds have similar vision to ours, and that they see the red color very well.
But if you look at the spectrum, man and bird see red, green and blue - they see this spectrum.
Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet, and they distinguish different shades of ultraviolet radiation,
which are at this end of the spectrum.
You're probably thinking, "It would be great if we could see them."
Yes, we can.
So what does the insect see?
Last week I took these photos of a sunflower, a family of frankincense, in Dorset.
These are the same small yellow flowers that we see everywhere.
That's what it looks like in daylight.
And that's what it looks like if you remove the red.
Most bees don't see red.
Then I put UV filters on the camera and did a very, very long exposure with certain UV frequencies, and that's what happened.
The most that neither is an "apple".
Of course, we know what bees see, no more than you know what I see when I call it red.
We can't tell what's going on in the neighbor's mind, we can't talk about an insect.
But the picture will be about the same contrasting, strongly standing out in the background.
Here's another little flower — a different range of ultraviolet frequencies, different filters, to match the pollinators.
They're going to see something like this.
In case you think this applies to all yellow flowers – no flower was damaged during the shooting, this one was just attached to a tripod rather than ripped off – when they're in ultraviolet light, then take a look at this one.
By the way, it could serve as the basis of sunscreen, because such creams work by absorbing ultraviolet radiation.
Maybe this connection would be helpful.
Finally, here's one of the enoteres that Bjorn Roarslett from Norway sent me – a fantastic hidden pattern.
I like the idea of something hidden.
I think there's something poetic about that. These photos were taken with an ultraviolet filter that is mostly used by astronomers to photograph Venus — actually the clouds of Venus.
This is the main purpose of this filter.
Venus, of course, is the goddess of love and fertility, and this is consonant with flowers.
Not only do flowers spend a lot of effort attracting pollinators, they also somehow managed to convince us to plant entire fields of flowers and give them to each other at the moments of birth and death, and, in particular, at the wedding, which, if you think about it, is the moment that personifies the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another.
Thank you very much.

In China, on the Yangtze River, there was the third flood in a year
After a heavy downpour in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River - the longest waterway in China - for the third time in a year there were floods.
The flooding was caused by an increase in the water level in the tributaries of the river in its upper reaches, which led to a rapid increase in water supply to the reservoir of the Chinese hydroelectric power station "Sanxia" /"Three Gorges"/.
At 14:00 on July 26, an influx of 50 thousand cubic meters / s was observed in the reservoir, which is expected to reach its maximum on the evening of July 27 - 60 thousand cubic meters / s, the Yangtze River Water Management Committee under the Ministry of Water Resources of the People's Republic of China reported.
The Committee today issued alerts about floods on one of the sections of the upper Yangtze River and overflow of the reservoir of the Sanxia hydroelectric power station.
My job is to help computers make messages about the world around them.
There are many ways to do this, but I love helping computers talk about what they see and understand.
For example, in this picture, a modern computer vision algorithm can recognize that this is a woman, and this is a dog.
He can tell that the woman is smiling.
He is even able to say that the dog is unusually cute.
I'm working on this thinking about how people understand and process data about the world.
What thoughts, memories and stories can awaken in people such a picture.
Everything related to such situations.
Perhaps you've seen a similar dog before or spent time running around the beach, and this, in turn, evokes thoughts and memories of a past vacation, a time spent on the beach, or a time when you ran somewhere with other dogs.
One of my main principles is to help computers understand what it means to have such experiences, to understand what we share, what we believe in and what we feel, because then we will be ready to start involving computer technology in processes that complement our own experiences.
Digging deeper, a few years ago I started helping computers write stories based on a series of images.
And one day in the course of work, I asked the computer what it thought about going to Australia.
He looked at the pictures and saw a koala.
He didn't know what a koala was, but said he thought it was a curious creature.
I then shared with him a series of images of burning houses.
He looked at the pictures and said, "Amazing view! Awesome!"
Goosebumps ran down my back.
He looked at a terrible, life-destroying event and thought it was something positive.
I realized that he recognized the contrasts, shades of red and yellow and thought it deserved a positive assessment.
In part, he did it because most of the images I gave him were positive.
Because people tend to share positive images when talking about their experiences.
When was the last time you saw a selfie at a funeral?
I realized that by perfecting artificial intelligence, task by task, data array by array, I had created huge gaps, holes, and gaps in what it could understand.
And in doing so, I encoded every possible kind of bias.
Biases that reflect a limited vision limited to a single dataset. Gaps that reflect human biases encoded in the data, such as bias and stereotypes.
I thought about the evolution of technology that led me to where I ended up then— how the first color photographs were calibrated by the skin of white women, which meant that color photographs were not adapted to dark faces.
And this same bias, the same gap was observed in the 90s.
And we have the same information gap today in how well we can recognize a variety of human faces with facial recognition technology.
I was thinking about the latest research where we tend to limit our thinking to one dataset and one problem.
And in doing so, we created more and more gaps and biases that AI could develop even more.
I realized that we needed to think more about how the technologies we're working with today will look like in 5 and 10 years.
Humanity evolves slowly, eventually correcting problems in the interaction of people and the environment.
Artificial intelligence, by contrast, is evolving at an incredible rate.
And that means it's really important to think carefully about it right now – to reflect on our own gaps, our own biases and how it affects the technologies that we're creating and discuss what modern technology will mean in the future.
Top managers and scientists around the world are talking about what they think artificial intelligence will be in the future.
Stephen Hocking warns, "AI could end humanity."
Elon Musk warns that this is one of the greatest existential risks our civilization has ever faced.
Bill Gates is perplexed, "I don't understand why people aren't worried."
But these opinions are only part of the story.
The math, the models, the fundamental building blocks of artificial intelligence are what we call access and what we work with.
We have open source tools for machine learning and intelligence that we are willing to share.
And beyond that, we can share our experiences.
Share your knowledge about technology, and how it worries us, and how it excites us.
We can discuss what we love.
We can anticipate which aspects of technology may become the most useful over time and which may become the most problematic.
If we all focus on an open dialogue about AI in the future, it will help create an atmosphere of shared awareness of what AI is now, what it can become, and what we need to do to get the most suitable result for us.
We already see and know all this about the technologies used today.
We use smartphones, digital assistants and robot vacuum cleaners.
Are they evil?
Maybe sometimes.
Are they useful?
absolutely.
And they're all different.
And in them you already see a ray of light illuminating our future.
The future begins in what we create and build right now.
We are launching the domino effect that will determine the path of AI development.
Right now, we're shaping the AI of the future.
Technologies that immerse us in augmented realities bring past worlds back to life.
Technologies that help people share experiences when they have difficulty communicating.
Technologies based on understanding streaming visual worlds are used for self-driving cars.
Technologies based on understanding images and generating language are turning into technologies that help visually impaired people better access the visual world.
But we also see how technology can lead to problems.
Today, we have technology that analyzes our innate physical characteristics — such as skin color or facial features — to determine whether we may be criminals or terrorists.
We have technology that analyzes data about us, even data such as gender or race, to determine if we can get a loan.
All we see now is just one shot from the evolution of artificial intelligence.
Because where we are now is just a moment of this evolution.
This means that everything we do today will have an impact on our future.
If we want AI to evolve to help humans, we must identify goals and strategies that will set that path now.
I'd like to see something that fits people well, blends in with our culture and environment.
Technologies that help those of us who suffer from neurological or other diseases to make life equally difficult for everyone.
Technologies that work regardless of your skin color or demographics.
Today, I'm focused on the technologies that will be with us tomorrow and in 10 years.
AI can become anything.
But in this case, it's not a self-driving car with no final destination.
We drive this car.
We choose when to accelerate and when to slow down.
We choose when we need to turn.
We choose what the AI of the future will be.
There are countless things that artificial intelligence can become.
And it's going to be a lot of things.
And our task today is to find out what exactly we need to invest in AI so that the results obtained are the best for all of us.
Thank you

The head of Dagestan discussed with Khabib Nurmagomedov the construction of several sports facilities.
The head of Dagestan Vladimir Vasiliev held a meeting with the current UFC lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov, the website of the head of the republic reports.
The reason was the sports facilities, in the construction of which the late father of the champion, honored coach of Russia Abdulmanap Nurmagomedov showed great interest.
We are talking about a sports complex in the village of Dubki of the Kazbekov district and the Center for Sports Training in Martial Arts in the village of Sildi, Tsumadinsky district.
First of all, Vladimir Vasiliev noted that now the construction of these sports facilities is also a tribute to the memory of the great coach.
The father of the baby kidnapped in Salsk revealed the details of the incident
The father of a newborn abducted from a maternity hospital in Salsk, Rostov region, revealed the details of the incident.
TV channel "360" Alexander Rusikov said that the kidnapper went to the room of his wife when she was going to go to the toilet.
The mother of the kidnapped baby could not even think that a person with malicious intent could be in the hospital.
The woman moved away from the room just a couple of meters when she heard a neighbor screaming.
The baby was no longer in the room.
According to Rusikov, everything happened between three and four o'clock in the morning.
He also said that the wife's room is located between two medical posts, but at the time of the incident the nurses were not on the scene.
Also, the father of the abducted baby said that there were no comments or apologies from the hospital staff.
Recall that the newborn boy, kidnapped on Saturday from the hospital in Salsk, found on the same day in the Republic of Kalmykia.
Police detained a 40-year-old suspect in the abduction.
The child has already been returned to his mother.
Doctors took tests from the baby to make sure that he was healthy and not injured.

The accident occurred at 12:25 local time (13:25 GMT) in the area of the mountain peak Gleccherspitz in the municipality of Blatten.
According to law enforcement officers, the victims of the crash were two Swiss aged 66 and 50 years, as well as two Austrians 50 and 46 years old.
Their names and details were not disclosed.
Earlier in the day, a small plane crashed into an apartment building in the German city of Wesel.
Three people were killed.
The expert assessed the role of vitamins in the formation of immunity
The chief freelance specialist in primary health care for the adult population of the Moscow Department of Health, Andrei Heavynikov, assessed the role of vitamins in the formation of immunity.
"It is impossible to extradose some drugs, vitamins or food in a very short time to create a stable immunity," he said in an interview with the radio station "Moscow speaking".
According to him, there are certain rules.
For example, in the summer it is better to spend more time outdoors, including under the sun.
Heavy also noted that in the summer, if possible, you need to consume a large amount of seasonal fresh vegetables and fruits.
"This generally strengthens the immune system, gives a certain supply of vitamins and a certain supply of health," he added.
Earlier, Heavy named several differences between the flu and the coronavirus.
In Russia, 5765 COVID-19 patients were registered per day
In Russia for the day to July 26 revealed 5765 new cases of infection with coronavirus, according to the website stopcoronavirus.rf according to the Federal operational headquarters.
For all the time of observations in Russia recorded 812 485 cases of COVID-19.
During the day, 77 people with confirmed coronavirus died, the total number of COVID-19-related deaths in Russia reached 13,269.
The number of COVID-19 cases in the world has exceeded 16 million, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
More than 4.1 million of them are in the United States, more than 2.3 million in Brazil.
Russia ranks fourth in the world in terms of the total number of cases, the third - behind India (1.3 million cases).
In total, more than 644,000 people have died from the coronavirus in the world, more than 9.2 million have recovered.
The head of the region Igor Kobzev met with the mayors of the Ust-Ordyn Buryat district
During the working meeting, which took place today, July 24, the government of the Irkutsk region discussed the main directions of development of remote agricultural territories.
During working trips to the districts of the Ust-Ordyn Buryat District, the head of the region gave a number of instructions.
Today, the mayors reported on their implementation.
First of all, the construction of the House of Sports in Ust-Orda was resumed.
The instruction on this object was given by the President of the Russian Federation fourteen years ago.
But only now the situation has been moved from the dead point.
866 million rubles will be spent on construction.
The deadline for the construction is 2022.
And this year a school in the village of Bayandai should be put into operation.
At the moment, the decoration of the premises has been completed.
Of the remaining works - landscaping.
In general, the program for the construction of preschool and secondary education facilities is of particular importance for the region.
For your county, especially.
The demographic situation here is the best in the region.
And we are obliged to create all conditions for the education and leisure of children of all ages, - said the Acting Governor of the Irkutsk region Igor Kobzev.
At the meeting, the head of the region instructed all mayors to actively engage in the development of general plans for settlements.
This is one of the main conditions for the integrated development of the district.
All settlements should have established boundaries and a master plan.
This is necessary for the development of the territory, for the construction of socially significant facilities, as well as infrastructure and cultural heritage, the head of the region emphasized.
Also during the conversation, a problematic issue was raised with a reduction in milk intake from cooperatives by 30%.
This was due to the redistribution by the processing enterprise of the purchase of milk in favor of peasant farms.
Because of this, the share of product intake from cooperatives has decreased.
The head of the region instructed the acting Minister of Agriculture to go to the site, study the structure of milk sales, analyze the experience of other territories and determine options for solving the problem.
Kuzminov won two races of the second stage of the SMP RSKG on "Igor Drive".
On "Igor Drive" was the second race of the second stage of the championship of the SMP RSKG.
Pavel Kuzminov won the second consecutive victory.
He started fifth, but on the first lap he took the lead.
Alexander Dudarev, who became the second, rose from the sixth position.
Sergei Tikhomirov lost his position, repelled the attacks of Alexander Chernyak and first secured third place, but received a drive through punishment and after driving through the pitlane was eliminated from the fight for the peddle.
The third was Ivan Pugachev, who played five positions.
The authorities of the Moscow region told about the fate of closed landfills
In the suburbs continue to close landfills of solid domestic waste.
This year, the authorities promise to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 landfills that existed in the region are being upgraded into modern waste processing complexes.
But this option is not possible for every landfill - many of them are overgrown with dense residential development.
After the landfill is closed, it stands up for reclamation - the body of the landfill is sprinkled with soils, degassing and infiltrate drainage systems are installed.
This allows you to stop the chemical processes inside the landfill, so that it does not ignite, does not eude a stench, does not poison the soil and groundwater.
And then the former dump is left to rise in a useless pile among the residential buildings surrounding it.
Why not make something useful out of it?
For example, in Ruza, where the reclamation of the Annino landfill was completed just the other day, the authorities are considering the option of making a ski slope out of a heap.
This landfill, operated from 1976 to 2016, has grown so that it has gone beyond the boundaries of the land allocated for it.
Therefore, during reclamation, it was necessary to buy out neighboring plots, de facto long ago clogged with garbage to the eyeballs.
"Some time will pass, the polygon will "sit down", the fortress will be recruited, and we will think what can be done so that it begins to bring benefit.
Right in the eye catches - a ski resort," - told reporters the head of the Ruza district Nikolai Parfenov.
Two landfills will become sites for the extraction of renewable energy sources
The Torbeevo landfills in Lyubertsy and Timokhovo in the Bogorodsky District will become sites for the extraction of renewable energy sources from landfill and biological gases.
By the end of the year, a gas piston power plant will be launched on the territory of Torbeev, capable of generating up to 8 million kilowatt-hours of electricity and about 0.95 gigacalories of thermal energy per year, which will provide the landfill's own needs - heat supply to administrative and industrial premises.
Timokhovo will produce 72.5 million kilowatt-hours and will continue to operate as a waste processing complex.
And at the Balashikha training ground "Kuchino", which was closed after complaints from residents about the "Direct Line" with the president of the country, a museum can be created.
"There was such an idea - to create a museum of reclamation of landfills of the Moscow region," said Deputy Chairman of the government - Minister of Ecology and Nature Management of the region Dmitry Kurakin.
Israel reports drone crash in southern Lebanon
An Israeli army drone crashed in southern Lebanon.
The armed forces said it collapsed "during operational activities."
The reasons for the fall of the device are not reported.
"Some time ago, during operational activities near the border with Lebanon, an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle of the Israeli Army fell on Lebanese territory.
There is no risk of information leakage," the Israeli army said on Twitter.
Recall that this week the Israeli army decided to strengthen its military units on the border with Lebanon, fearing revenge of the Lebanese movement "Hezbollah" for the murder of its fighters in Syria.
Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has vowed not to leave unanswered the deaths of any of his brothers.
More about the situation - in the material "Kommersant" "Israel is waiting for revenge of Hezbollah".
Furgal's replacement came out to the protesters for the first time
Acting Governor of the Khabarovsk Territory Mikhail Degtyarev for the first time after the appointment came to the participants of the actions in support of the arrested ex-head of the region Sergei Furgal.
The meeting was broadcast on his Instagram page.
"Moscow hears everyone, so it sent you an acting one so that the region does not slide down without power ... About Furgal I repeat once again: he "a" - my comrade, "b" - a fellow party member, "ts" - I am very worried about his fate, the party provides him with assistance, gives him food, Zhirinovsky knocks on all offices, "the acting governor said.
According to Degtyarev, now the Khabarovsk Territory cannot remain without a leader, so he was appointed by decree of President Vladimir Putin to the post of head of the region so that "a wonderful building (the government of the region) functions, everything works, the budget was spent on social needs."
The acting governor explained that he had not gone out to the protesters earlier because he could not communicate with thousands of demonstrators.
Therefore, he conducts broadcasts in social networks and reads all the comments to them.
On July 25, two consecutive protests were held in Khabarovsk.
Rallies in support of the former governor have been held in the region since July 11.
On the eve of the next action, Mikhail Degtyarev said that he would leave the city on the day of the rally.
His motorcade was stopped by protesters and called for a voice about the fate of the arrested ex-governor Furgal.
Degtyarev previously refused to go to the participants of the actions.
"There is something for the leader to do here, than to go out and communicate with those who shout under the windows," the acting governor said.
Today I would like to show you how we will do different things in the future.
I believe that soon our buildings and machines will be self-assembling, reproducing and repairing themselves.
So I'm going to show you what I think is the current stage of industrial development and then compare it to some natural systems.
So, at the current stage of industrial development, we have skyscrapers - 2.5 years, from 500,000 to a million parts, quite complex, new amazing technologies in steel, concrete and glass.
We have amazing machines that can take us into space – 5 years, 2.5 million parts.
But on the other hand, if you look at natural systems, we see proteins of two million species that can assemble in 10,000 nanoseconds, or a strand of DNA with three billion major pairs that we can copy in about an hour.
So, natural systems, for all their complexity, are extremely efficient, far more efficient than anything we can build, far more complex than anything we can build.
They are much more energy efficient.
They are almost never wrong.
And they can rebuild themselves over the course of a long life.
So, there's something very interesting about natural systems.
And if we can bring that into our man-made environment, our way of creating things will have tremendous potential.
And I think the key is self-in-collection.
So, if we want to use self-concassion in our physical environment, I think there are four key factors to consider.
First, we need to decipher the complexity of what we want to build – our buildings and cars.
And you need to decompose them into a simple sequence - the basic DNA of the construction processes.
Then we'll need programmable parts that can understand that sequence and use it to curl up or reassemble.
We will need some amount of energy that will allow all this to activate, make the parts able to gather according to the program.
And we need some kind of backup bug fix system to ensure that what we want is successfully built.
I'm going to show you a few projects that my colleagues at I.I.T. and I are working on to achieve this self-assembling future.
The first two are MacroBot and DeciBot.
These projects are large-scale reconfigurable robots - 2.5 and 3.5 meter proteins.
They are built-in mechanical electrical devices, sensors.
You paint what you need to curl up into, in a sequence of angles - minus 120, minus 120, 0, 0, 120, minus 120 - something like that; a sequence of angles or turns, and you send that sequence over the cord.
Each block receives its own message - minus 120. He turns to this corner, checks if everything is correct and transmits the information to the neighbor.
And these are brilliant scientists, engineers, designers who worked on this project.
And I think that actually brings out the question: Are there other scales possible here?
I mean, thousands of dollars, a lot of man-hours to make this 2.5 meter robot.
Can we actually zoom in? Can we actually build robotics into every part?
The next project solves this issue, considers a passive character or tries to obtain modifiable programmability passively.
But he goes a step further and tries to get a real calculation.
At its core, it has the most fundamental building block of computing, the logical element of a digital integrated circuit directly in each part.
It's an "AND-NOT" element.
You have one tetrahedron, an element that will do all the calculations, and two tetrahedra for input.
One for user input is how you lay bricks.
Other for information from the previous brick laid.
And then it outputs information in three-dimensional space.
So, this means that the user can start starting the movement of bricks in the right direction.
His calculations are based on what was done earlier and what you told him to do.
And now it begins to move in three-dimensional space - up or down.
On the left side, [1,1] input is equal to 0 at the output, moving down.
On the right side, [0.0] input is 1 at the output, which means upward movement.
And what's really important is that our structures now contain blueprints of what we want to build.
They have all the information about what was built.
So that means we have some form of self-replication.
In this case, I call it self-directed reproduction because the structures contain clear blueprints.
If errors occur, you can replace the part.
All local information is stored so you know how to fix it.
So you can have something that moves and reads the information and can transfer it from one part to another.
It is built directly inside, without external control.
The last project I'll show you is called Shifted Chains, and it's probably the most exciting example of what we have now from passive self-assembling systems.
It combines the possibility of reconfiguration and software and creates a completely passive system.
At the heart of it we have a chain of elements.
All elements are completely identical, and displaced.
Thus, each chain or every element wants to turn right or left.
And when you assemble a chain, you're essentially softwareing it.
You tell each block where it should turn: right or left.
So when you shake the chain, it folds into the configuration that you programmed – in this case, a spiral, or in this case , two cubes next to each other.
So in general, you can program any three-dimensional form – or one-dimensional, two-dimensional – from these absolutely passive circuits.
So, what does this tell us about the future?
I think it tells us that there are new opportunities for self-building, replication, repair in our physical structures, buildings, machines.
In these parts, a new programmability is possible.
And from here, you have new opportunities in computing.
We're going to have spatial computers.
Imagine if our buildings, bridges, cars, all our bricks could do calculations.
It's an amazing parallel and distributed force of clearing, new design possibilities.
That's incredible potential.
I think that the projects that I have shown you are only a small step towards the future if we introduce these new technologies, to a new self-assembling future.
Thank you.
(Applause)

The number of deaths from coronavirus in the world exceeded 640 thousand
More than 15.7 million people infected
The number of victims of the coronavirus in the world exceeded 640 thousand, almost 15.7 million cases of infection were confirmed.
Such data on Sunday, July 26, leads the World Health Organization (WHO).
According to the information provided, over the past day, 200,625 new cases of coronavirus infection and 4,823 deaths have been identified in the world.
For all the time of the pandemic, 15,785,641 cases of coronavirus infection have already been recorded in the world, and the number of deaths has increased to 640,016.
The leader in the number of infected and dead remain the United States, where it has already registered more than 4.3 million infected and more than 149 thousand deaths.
In second place of the anti-rating is Brazil, where the number of cases at the moment exceeded 2.4 million, and 86.5 thousand patients with coronavirus have already died.
Next comes India with 1.4 million infected and nearly 33,000 deaths.
Recall, a day earlier, the number of people infected with coronavirus in the world during the day broke a new record.
In 24 hours, doctors identified 284,196 new cases.
The previous record was 247,225 infected.
what connected the Vatican and Nazi Germany
This week marks the 87th anniversary of the conclusion of the treaty between the Vatican and Nazi Germany.
The document, signed a few months after Hitler came to power, became the basis on which the holy See's relations with the Fascists were built.
One of those who prepared the treaty was Cardinal Pacelli, who 6 years before the outbreak of World War II became Pontiff Pius XII.
In Sochi, the body of a dump truck collapsed on the cab of a truck, killing the driver.
In the Network there were shots depicting an accident that occurred last Saturday, July 25, at a construction site in Sochi.
The recording shows how during unloading operations the raised body of the dump truck collapsed down, lying directly into the cab of the truck.
According to the Ministry of Emergency Situations, a 59-year-old man who was driving died on the spot from his injuries.
To extract the body of the deceased required the help of rescuers.
Beautiful high minarets only decorated Hagia Sophia
Once again about Hagia Sophia - I came across the text of Fr. Vladimir Zelinsky, that, they say, it is necessary to protest.
First, there was free admission - hooray!
I have not been to Istanbul, but it is better to have free admission to the House of God than a paid one.
Secondly, the Muslims conquered this land as honestly as the Orthodox conquered the Volga-Oka interfluve, the Muslim Caucasus (and put a church in Grozny) and planted apple trees on Mars.
God help!
The Jews conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans conquered Americana.
Are we going to give everything back to everyone?
Do you think there will be no pagans who will demand the return of their temple, on the site of which the Church of the Tithes?
Thirdly, the Muslims have improved this building and invested in it.
That is, they, just like the factories and estates that the Leninists took from the bourgeois in their property, belong to the Leninists - Putin and other nomenclature.
They have improved everything from the Kremlin to the Angara, so it's all of them by the right of progressors.
Beautiful high minarets very decorated Hagia Sophia, very.
There was a stupid inkwell, there was a stupid inkwell with beautiful minarets.
Fourth, there are no "Islamic" and "Orthodox" civilizations.
There are believers, there are hypocrites, there are hypocrites who combine faith and hypocrisy.
The believer in the categories of civilization does not think.
This is the mindset of the British Foreign Secretary Toynbee, a believer is ashamed to think like that.
And the believer everywhere places prayer.
And always.
The believer does not pray only where he is asked to leave - he withdraws to another place and prays there.
He's a believer, not a champion.
We're koloboks, not sullen rocks.
The working week in St. Petersburg will begin with warm and dry weather

At night, a variable wind is expected at a speed of 1-4 meters per second.
In the afternoon, the south-east wind at a speed of 2-7 meters per second.
The air temperature at night will be +13...+15 degrees.
In the afternoon it will warm up to +24...+26 degrees.
Atmospheric pressure will rise throughout the day.
During the broadcast of the parade on Navy Day, the camera "passed under the ship"
Also on Victory Day, the camera flew through the muzzle of the tank.
Today, July 26, in St. Petersburg there is a parade in honor of the Day of the Navy.
During the filming, one of the cameras that filmed the equipment "passed under the ship."
The use of new shooting technology allowed viewers to see the underwater part of the parade.
In the same perspective, the course of the newest serial small rocket ship "Sovetsk" was shown.
It passed along the Admiralty Embankment.
Recall that at the parade on June 24, dedicated to the 75th anniversary of the Victory, the camera passed through the barrel into the tower of one of the tanks and showed what equipment is inside the grandiose military vehicle.
Then in the anniversary parade of the Victory took part a record number of military equipment - 234 combat vehicles.
They showed a lot of new products that went to the main square of the country for the first time, for example, modernized T-90M and T-80BVM main battle tanks.
On June 24, updated infantry fighting vehicles BMP-2M with the Berezhok combat module also passed through Red Square for the first time.
Almost half of Britons believe in the Kremlin's interference in the Brexit referendum
Almost half of Britons - 49% - believe that Russia tried to influence the course of the 2016 referendum on Britain's exit from the European Union.
This writes the newspaper Guardian with reference to the results of a survey conducted by Opinium.
It is reported that 23% of respondents hold the opposite opinion on this issue.
47% of respondents also believe that the Kremlin interfered in the last general election in the UK in 2019.
July will go away with the heat, August will start with coolness
Over the weekend, Moscow and the region experienced the coldest night of July.
No chilling soul and body apocalypse frost, of course, did not happen.
But for the top of summer - chilly.
Before talking about the weather in Moscow on July 27 - August 2, 2020, it is worth noting that on the night of Saturday, July 25, in the capital, the air cooled to +8.8 degrees.
In Kolomna, even set a new temperature record: +7 degrees (the previous minimum for July 25 was held since 1964, more than half a century).
Cherusti became the pole of cold near Moscow - there the thermometers showed +3.9 degrees.
However, in the afternoon on Saturday and Sunday it was quite comfortable.
Although compared to climatic norms still 2 - 3 degrees cooler.
On weekdays, not just warmth, but real heat will return to Moscow.
On Monday, July 27, the Hydrometeorological Center of Russia promises +26 degrees, on Tuesday and Wednesday +28...+29, on Thursday, July 30, +26 degrees.
Short rains - every day, in the middle of the week with thunderstorms.
The last day of July and the first days of August (that is, the next weekend) will be cool, not higher than +19...+24 degrees.
And without precipitation will not do.
A native of Rwanda admitted that he set fire to the cathedral in Nantes
A native of Rwanda, who worked in the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul in the French city of Nantes on a voluntary basis, admitted to setting it on fire a week after the fire.
This was reported on Sunday by the TV channel "France-3".
According to him, the man, who had already been detained on July 19, the day after the fire, was detained again the day before.
On Saturday evening, he appeared before the investigating judge.
After being charged with intentional damage to property, the man admitted to organizing arson in three places - under a large organ, under a small organ and at the electrical panel.
Now he faces up to 10 years in prison and a 150,000 euro fine.
The motives for the actions of the 39-year-old native of Rwanda have not yet been reported.
It is only known that he voluntarily helped in the cathedral and on the day of the fire had to close its doors.
However, according to CCTV footage, he left the religious institution 15 minutes after receiving calls about a fire in the building.
The fire in the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul occurred on July 18.
More than 200 firefighters fought for several hours for the monument of Gothic architecture.
Nevertheless, they failed to save the stained glass windows of the time of Louis XII and the unique organ of the Baroque era.
It was possible to take the situation under control only three hours after the start of the fire.
No one was injured in the incident.
The current fire is not the first during the existence of the temple.
In 1972, a fire destroyed its roof.
It took 13 years to eliminate the consequences of that fire.
For parishioners, the cathedral was reopened only in 1985.
Legendary goalkeeper-traveler Pfannenstiel can become a scout for Inter.
Former German goalkeeper Lutz Pfannenstiel could join Inter's staff.
According to Kicker, the 47-year-old specialist was promoted to the post of head of the scout department.
Pfannenstiel held a similar position at Fortuna Düsseldorf from December 2018 to May 2020, and before that worked at Hoffenheim.
When he was a footballer, Pfannenstiel became famous for his frequent transitions.
He is the only professional player to play in all six FIFA confederations, changing more than 20 clubs, among which were representatives of the championships of Singapore, South Africa, New Zealand, Canada, Namibia and a number of other countries.
It is believed that only sighted people can be behind the wheel of a car.
Until recently, it was believed that for a blind person, safe and independent driving is an impossible task.
Hello, I'm Denis Hong, and we give the blind freedom and independence by developing cars for the visually impaired.
Before I talk about this car for the blind, I'll briefly talk about another project I've been working on called the DARPA Urban Challenge.
The project was to create a self-driving robot car.
The driver presses "start", and without his participation the car reaches its destination.
In 2007, our team won half a million dollars, taking third place in this competition.
Around the same time, the National Federation of the Blind, or NFS, set a research committee the task of developing a car that could be independently and safely driven by a blind person.
We decided to try our hand because we thought, "Hey, what's the big part?
We already have an autonomous car.
Put a blind man in it and it's over, right?"
(Laughter) But we were deeply mistaken.
The NSF wanted to get not just a car that would transport the blind, but a car that a blind person could drive on his own.
So we had to reject everything and start from scratch.
So, to test this crazy idea, we developed a small prototype of a buggy car to test the feasibility of the project.
And in the summer of 2009, we invited blind people from all over the country and gave them the opportunity to test this car.
It was an amazing experience.
But the catch is that this car was designed to be driven in a strictly controlled environment, namely in a flat enclosed parking lot, where even lanes are limited by red signal cones.
Due to this success, we decided to take the next big step and develop a real car that could be driven on real roads.
So how does it work?
Well, it's a pretty complicated system, but let me clarify, maybe even simplify it.
So, it includes three components.
These are tactile perception, computation and non-visual interfaces.
Since the driver does not see anything, the system must perceive the environment and collect information for the driver.
To do this, use the original parameter meter.
It measures acceleration, angular acceleration, like a person's inner ear.
This information is then transmitted to a GPS device to assess the location of the vehicle.
Two cameras are used to detect lanes on the road
and three laser rangefinders.
Lasers scan the space around the car to detect various objects: an approaching oncoming or over-over-the-top car, any obstacles encountered on or around the car.
Then all this huge amount of information is fed into the computer, and the computer performs two stages.
First of all, it is the processing of this information to obtain an idea of space: determining the lanes on the road, identifying obstacles, and then bringing this information to the driver.
The system is also smart enough to calculate the safest way to drive.
So, we can also give recommendations on how to operate the machine.
But the problem is how to convey this information and instructions to a blind person who does not have the quick and accurate reaction necessary to drive?
For this purpose, we have developed a number of interface technologies for the blind:
Three-dimensional ping sound system, vibrating vest, steering wheel with sound signals, a special prosthetic leg, and even shoes that exert pressure on the leg.
But today we will talk only about three types of these special interfaces.
The first interface is called DriveGrip.
This is a pair of gloves with motors on the joints of the fingers, instructing the driver how to steer: direction and angle of rotation.
Another device is SpeedStrip.
Initially, this is a massage chair.
It was dismantled and rearranged in it vibrating elements. Vibration is used to convey speed information to the driver, as well as to guide the use of the gas and brake pedals.
So, here you can see how the computer perceives the space around the car. And since vibration cannot be seen, red LEDs are installed on the driver to demonstrate the process.
This is sensory data, it is transmitted to devices through a computer.
DriveGrip and SpeedStrip are very efficient.
But the problem is that these are training prompting devices.
They don't actually give freedom of government, do they?
The on-board computer gives the driver commands: "left", "right", "add speed", "stop".
We call it the "annoying passenger in the back seat."
Therefore, we move away from educational prompting devices and focus our attention on informing devices.
A great example of such an interface is AirPix.
This is a kind of monitor for the blind.
A small panel with many holes through which compressed air escapes, thereby creating images.
A blind person can bring his palm to this panel and "see" lanes on the roadway and obstacles.
Also, the driver can change the frequency at which the air comes out and, possibly, the temperature of the air.
That is, it is an interface for displaying multidimensional data.
So, here you see the left and right camera of the car, and how the computer processes and sends this information to the AirPix panel.
Here we demonstrate a simulator, a blind person driving a car with AirPix.
This simulator has proven to be very useful for training blind drivers, as well as for quickly testing ideas for using different types of special interfaces.
That's how this system works in a nutshell.
After all, this is a prototype car for the blind. And he will not be released on the roadway until they are convinced of his absolute safety.
And I honestly believe that's quite likely.
Still, will society accept such a radical idea?
How much will the rules of auto insurance change?
Under what conditions will a driver's license be issued?
Aside from the technological challenges, there are so many pitfalls that need to be overcome before this becomes a reality.
Of course, the main goal of this project is to develop a car for the blind.
However, it is possible that the side technologies developed during this project will prove to be an invaluable contribution to our lives.
Our sensors work regardless of the time of day, fog and rain.
We can use these technologies together with new special interfaces to improve the safety of cars for the sighted.
Or for the blind. Find them a use in everyday household appliances, in educational institutions, in offices.
Just imagine: the teacher in the classroom writes on the board, and a blind student can see and read what is written using these special interfaces.
It's priceless.
So what I showed you today is just the beginning.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
The second trailer for "Bill and Ted" with Keanu Reeves has been released
On the YouTube channel of the film studio Orion Pictures appeared the second trailer of the third part of the franchise "Bill and Ted".
The trailer reveals some details from the current life of bosom friends: they settled in a suburban area, married to their girlfriends Joanna (Jaima Mays) and Elizabeth (Erinn Hace) from "The Incredible Adventures of Bill and Ted" (1989), moreover, the tireless adventurers have long been raising daughters.
Brigitte Lundy-Payne ("Glass Castle", "Atypical") plays Billy, Ted's daughter, and Samara Weaving ("I'm going to look") - Thea, Bill's daughter (yes, Bill and Ted named their daughters Billy and Thea, such a pun).
On top of that, they are waiting for another great adventure: they must get into the future to steal their own song - the only way they can save the whole world.
In the trailer, you can also see the American rapper Kid Cudi and William Sadler ("August Rush", "Death in Spite of", "The Green Mile"), again playing the role of Death.
The film was originally scheduled to be released on August 21, but the date was pushed to September 1.
It is reported that the creators do not plan to re-postpone the release date of the film.
The picture will also be immediately available online.
Earlier we wrote that Keanu Reeves will become a screenwriter of comics about the demigod Berserk.
I want you to think for a second about the fact that almost all of our knowledge of the universe comes from light.
We stand on Earth and see stars in the night sky with the naked eye.
The bright Sun can burn the retina of the eye,
but we see the same light in the reflection of the moon.
Since the time of Galileo observing celestial bodies through his primitive telescope, we have contemplated the universe through the light passing through the boundless ages of cosmic history.
With the help of modern telescopes, we were able to assemble a stunning silent film about the Universe, covering our entire history up to the Big Bang.
However, cinema is not at all devoid of sound, because the universe is not silent.
I want to prove to you that the universe has its own soundtrack, and it is "reproduced" by the cosmos itself, because outer space vibrates like a drum.
It carries peculiar sounds that accompany the brightest events as they occur.
Today we would like to complement the luxurious visual image of the universe that we have, also with a soundtrack.
So far, we've never heard sounds from space, but in the near future we should listen carefully to what is happening there.
So, in order to record the "song" of the Universe, we focused on black holes as the most promising objects, because they "beat" into space-time like a bell, and give a characteristic sound. Now you're going to hear how we think this song will sound.
Maybe one day we will see the shadow that the black hole casts, being on a bright background, but so far we have not seen this.
However, a black hole, albeit invisible, can be heard because it "beats" into space-time like a drum.
The assumption that the cosmos is like a drum membrane belongs to Albert Einstein, to whom we owe so much.
Einstein concluded that if space were empty, if the universe were empty, it would look like this picture, except, of course, such a visual grid.
If we were to fall freely through space, even without a convenient coordinate grid, mentally we could depict it ourselves, since we would notice that we are moving in a straight line, strictly in a straight line through the universe.
Einstein also understood — and this is the very essence — that if you put energy or mass into the universe, it will lead to the curvature of space, and a freely falling object will bend around, for example, the Sun, deviating along natural curves in space.
This was Einstein's great general theory of relativity.
Even light curves along this trajectory.
The deviation can be so strong that the object will simply fall into orbit, and will revolve around the Sun as the Earth, or as the Moon - around the Earth.
These are natural curvatures in space.
But Einstein did not understand this - if you take our Sun and compress it to 6 kilometers in diameter, that is, a mass 1 million times heavier than the Earth to fit in an object with a diameter of 6 km, you will get a black hole so dense that the light that has passed too close to it will never break out. A dark shadow in the universe.
However, he always considered black holes just a mathematical curiosity.
Einstein did not believe that they existed in reality.
He believed that nature itself should protect us from their appearance.
It took decades before the term "black hole" was invented, and people realized that they were real astrophysical objects — in fact, they are very massive stars in a posthumous state, catastrophically collapsed at the end of their life cycle.
Our Sun will not turn into a black hole.
Its mass is not enough for that.
But we'll do a little thought experiment — Einstein loved them very much — and imagine the Sun shrinking to 6 kilometers in diameter, and around it revolves a tiny Earth, about 30 km from the black hole of the Sun.
This Earth is glowing, the Sun is no more, as well as another source of light, so let's make our small Earth self-luminous.
It turns out that we can put the Earth in a very close orbit, just 30 km from this black hole.
In size, it does not exceed Manhattan much.
Perhaps it would have hooked a little hudson before destroying the Earth.
But the scale is something like this.
We're talking about an object that would occupy about 1/2 of manhattan's area.
So, placing this Earth very close - only 30 km - we will notice that it perfectly revolves around a black hole.
This is a kind of myth that black holes absorb everything indiscriminately - to get into it, you need to get very close.
But what is striking is that from our point of view we will see the Earth all the time.
It can't hide behind a black hole.
Part of the light that the Earth emits is absorbed by the hole, but part of it seems to go around it and return back to us.
So, behind a black hole, nothing can be hidden.
If you suddenly get into the series "Battlestar Galactica", and will fight with the Cylons - do not hide behind a black hole.
They'll see you!
Our Sun will not turn into a black hole - for this it is not massive enough. But there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
And if one of them obscured the Milky Way, here's what it would look like.
We would see the shadow of a black hole against the backdrop of hundreds of billions of stars and glowing dust.
If we were on the verge of falling into this black hole, we would see all this light around it, and even already entering this shadow, we would not notice the imminent catastrophe.
It would be useless to start the engines and try to get out, because nothing, including the light, can escape from it.
Although the black hole looks like it from the outside, inside it is not dark, as all the light falls into it with us.
According to a relativistic effect known as time stretching, our clocks seemed to slow down relative to general galactic time, but we would, on the contrary, see the evolution of the galaxy in an accelerated mode a moment before the death inside the black hole.
It would be like a near-death experience where you see a light at the end of a tunnel, but not "about" but absolutely mortal.
(Laughter) And you can't tell anyone about the light at the end of the tunnel.
Scientists have not yet been able to see the shadow of a black hole, but we can hear it, albeit invisible.
Imagine a real astrophysical situation – two black holes that have lived together for a long life.
Perhaps they were stars at first and then turned into black holes. Each of them is 10 times heavier than the Sun.
Squeeze them to 60 km in diameter.
They can rotate quickly: hundreds of revolutions per second.
At the end of their life cycle, they orbit each other at almost the speed of light.
They cover thousands of km in a fraction of a second, and not only bend space, but also leave behind a trace: they cause oscillations, a wave trail in space-time.
Space shrinks and stretches, freeing itself from these black holes oscillating in the universe.
And they travel through space at the speed of light.
This computer simulation was made by nasa's Goddard group studying relativity.
For almost 30 years, the world's scientists have been fighting over this problem.
It was one of the bands.
You see two black holes orbiting each other — and again, the curves are clearly depicted here.
If you see — a little pale — they emit red waves, gravitational waves.
These are the sounds of vibrating space, and they will come from these black holes at the speed of light as they subside and merge into one rotating, quiet black hole — that's the outcome.
If you stood close enough, your ear would resonate as the space shrinks and stretches.
You'd actually hear the sound.
Of course, your head would shrink and stretch, so it would be difficult for you to understand what was going on.
But I'd like to play you that sound as we predict it.
This is the work of my group, so the graphics are more modest here.
Imagine a light black hole falling into a very heavy one.
The sound you hear is made by a slight hole, arching the space, approaching step by step to the end.
If it is removed, the sound becomes quieter.
But it is like a hammer "hitting" a space that vibrates like a membrane.
And we can predict what that sound will be.
We know that as the hole is absorbed, it gets faster and louder.
At the end, we'll hear a small hole just fall into a big one.
I've never heard the recording so loudly — really, very impressive.
At home it turns out much more modest.
Just quiet clicks.
It's a different sound created by my band.
Here I do not show you the picture, since black holes do not leave behind visual traces, there are no visible curves in space.
If you went on a space cruise and heard that sound, I would recommend flying away as soon as possible.
(Laughter) Away from that sound.
Both black holes are moving.
They approach each other.
In this case, they both fluctuate greatly.
And now there will be a merger.
This "chirping" is very characteristic of merging black holes, this is the acceleration at the end.
We assume that would sound like that.
Fortunately, we're now at a safe distance, in Long Beach, California.
Undoubtedly, somewhere in the universe two black holes merge.
And without a doubt, the space around us is vibrating, and these oscillations may have passed millions of light years, that is, a million years moving towards us at the speed of light.
But the sound is too quiet, we can't hear it.
There is a very complex project today: LIGO (Laser Interferometric Gravitational-Wave Observatory) - it tracks deviations in the fluctuations of space, the smallest - by the size of the nucleus of an atom by 4 kilometers.
This is an extremely ambitious experiment, and in the next few years it will be devoted to capturing such waves.
One space program is also planned, which, I hope, will be launched in the next 10 years: LIKA (Laser Interferometric Space Antenna).
It will be able to see super-heavy black holes, millions and billions of times more massive than the Sun.
In this hubble image, we see two galaxies.
They look like they're frozen in some kind of "embrace,"
and each of them probably contains a super-heavy black hole in its core.
But they didn't freeze. In fact, they merge.
These two black holes collide, and it will last more than a billion years.
It's beyond our comprehension to hear a song of this length.
But LIKA may see the finale of the merger of two super-heavy black holes, which began a long time ago: the last 15 minutes of this action.
We're not just talking about black holes, but any serious troubles in the universe, and the most important of them is the Big Bang.
When this expression was coined, it was ironic - "like, who will believe in the Big Bang?"
This animation from my friend at Proton Studios shows the Big Bang from the outside.
Any observer would like to be inside at this moment, because it is impossible to be outside the universe.
Imagine you're inside the Big Bang.
It's all around you, and the space vibrates chaotically.
It's been 14 billion years, and this song still rings all around us.
Galaxies are born, and in them - generations of stellar forms. And around one star, at least one, there is a habitable planet.
And here we persistently conduct these experiments, make calculations, write programs.
Imagine – a billion years ago, two black holes collided.
All this time, their song sounds in space.
We haven't even been born yet.
Sound is approaching, closer and closer – 40 thousand years ago, we are still making cave paintings.
If we were going to "hear" the Big Bang, it would sound like this.
Noise in its purest form.
It's white noise, just chaotic sounds.
But it's probably everywhere around us, unless it's been drowned out by some other process in the universe.
And if we catch it, it will be the most pleasant music for us, because it is a quiet echo of the moment of our creation, the birth of the observable universe.
Over the next few years, we'll be able to turn up the volume a bit, and hear the universe in sound.
But if we catch the echo of those early events, it will bring us much closer to understanding the Big Bang, and this will already allow us to ask some of the most difficult, elusive questions.
Scrolling through a movie about our universe backwards, we learn that there was the Big Bang in the past, and maybe we'll even hear its cacophony, but was that explosion the only one?
I mean, didn't it happen before?
Will it happen again?
In the spirit of TED, which calls us to regain our faith in miracles, we can now ask questions that have always eluded us.
But we must ask: Is it possible that our universe is just a trace of some more significant history?
Or aren't we just one branch of the multiverse — each of which had its own Big Bang in the past? Maybe with or without black holes and their "songs", maybe with intelligent life, and perhaps without – they are not in our past, not in our future, but somehow connected with us?
We will ask – in such a multiverse, in its other branches, is there life there?
Here are my fellow multiverses.
But are there other creatures out there that think about us and their origins?
And, if they are, I can imagine them doing calculations like us, building instruments, trying to detect that faint sound of the moment of their creation, and thinking, who else is there but us?
Thank you. Thank you.
(Applause)
Minneapolis residents create squads to patrol the streets
The Wall Street Journal reports: Minneapolis is creating squads to patrol the streets.
Local residents want to help the guards.
Some of the vigilantes have weapons with them.
Armed citizens assure: they will not open fire, this is possible only in case of emergency.
According to journalists, the creation of patrols is associated with a reduction in the police budget.
Law enforcement agencies per year will receive $ 10 million less (this amount can be reduced).
The previous budget of law enforcement officers is $ 193 million.
This decision was made by the Minneapolis City Council in connection with the death of George Floyd and rallies against police brutality over the past two months.
The original drawing of the Olympic rings sold at auction for € 185 thousand
The original drawing of the Olympic rings of the founder of the modern Olympic Games Pierre de Coubertin was sold at auction for € 185 thousand.
The drawing was made on a white canvas measuring 21 × 27.5 cm and is a weave of five rings of different colors - blue, yellow, black, green and red.
The first modern Olympic Games were held in 1896 in Athens.
"Dynamo" will not extend the contract with Panchenko
Forward Kirill Panchenko will leave Dynamo Moscow due to the end of his contract.
According to the source, the club has already notified the player of its decision.
30-year-old Panchenko spent four seasons in Dynamo, played 103 matches and scored 37 goals.
Earlier, Dynamo Moscow presented the form for the next season.
"City" and "Real" will be able to hold the second leg of the 1/8 finals of the Champions League in Manchester
The British newspaper The Guardian reports that Manchester City and Real Madrid will still be able to hold the second leg of the 1/8 finals of the Champions League in Manchester at the Etihad Stadium on August 7.
Yesterday, July 25, the UK government passed a regulation that all persons arriving in the UK from Spain are required to undergo a 14-day quarantine due to the new outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.
For Real Madrid, however, an exception will be made.
The possibility of easing quarantine norms for sports teams and film crews was previously announced by the Secretary of the Ministry of Culture of Great Britain Oliver Dowden.
In February, "Real" in his field lost to "Manchester City" with a score of 1: 2.
The second leg is scheduled for August 7.
Presidents of Russia and Ukraine discussed the implementation of the truce in the Donbass
Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky discussed the implementation of the ceasefire agreements in the Donbass reached during the Normandy summit in December 2019, the press services of the Kremlin and the office of the President of Ukraine reported.
The telephone conversation between Vladimir Putin and Vladimir Zelensky took place on the initiative of the Ukrainian side, according to the press service of the Kremlin.
The interlocutors welcomed the achievement on July 22 at the meeting of the Minsk Contact Group of an agreement on a full and comprehensive ceasefire in the Donbas, which begins at 00:01 on July 27, 2020; The President of Russia supported this agreement.
The leaders agreed on the need for urgent implementation of additional measures to support the ceasefire in the Donbas.
At the same time, Putin criticized the resolution adopted by the Verkhovna Rada on July 15 on the organization of local elections in the autumn, which, according to the Russian side, ignores the Minsk agreements.
The situation in connection with the coronavirus pandemic was also discussed.
The agreement of July 22 provides for a complete rejection of any military actions, including reconnaissance, sending sabotage and reconnaissance groups and sniper warfare.
Tinkov showed a video of a bone marrow transplant
Russian businessman, founder of the group "Tinkoff" Oleg Tinkov published a video in which he told how he transplanted bone marrow.
Recall, the businessman is fighting leukemia.
On the record, the businessman lies in the ward, the bone marrow is transplanted with a dropper.
Tinkov noted that in the same way there is a collection of donor material.
"The skull is not cut," he added.
Judging by his posture during the operation, he feels comfortable and relaxed.
His donor was a girl from Germany.
The businessman expressed regret that in Russia there are only 130 thousand bone marrow donors, while in Germany there are about 8 million.
Bone marrow transplantation to Oleg Tinkou was carried out in a London clinic.
It became known about the destruction of Russian "Shells" in Ethiopia
Two Russian-made Pantsir-S1 anti-aircraft missile and gun systems, which were in service with the Ethiopian army, were destroyed.
This became known to the Telegram channel "Military Observer" on Sunday, July 26.
According to the canal, two vehicles that provided security for the Hidase hydroelectric power plant on the Blue Nile River were disabled by lightning.
Other details of the incident are not given.
In May, the Turkish agency Anadolu reported the destruction in Libya of nine Russian-made Pantsir-S1 air defense system.
They belonged to the forces of the commander of the Libyan National Army (LNA), Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, and were destroyed with the help of Turkish operational-tactical multi-purpose unmanned aerial systems Bayraktar TB2.
Then Defense Express called the incident "a real genocide."
Another Pantsir-S1 in Libya was destroyed by an attack drone in early July.
In Warsaw, evacuated 1.5 thousand people because of the bomb
About 1.5 thousand residents of Warsaw are evacuated because of the bomb found during the construction of the subway, RIA Novosti reports with reference to the representative of the capital's mayor's office Karolina Galetskya.
She said that unexploded ordnance weighing 250 kg and a length of about 2 m was found during the construction of the second metro line in the area of Basilianska Street in the Warsaw district of Brody.
In this regard, there is an evacuation of about 1.5 thousand people from eight adjacent quarters.
Only after that the sappers will start working.
"Lokomotiv" is close to signing a contract with the football player of the national team of Belarus
Striker of Shakhtar Soligorsk and the Belarusian national football team Vitaly Lisakovich is preparing to move to Lokomotiv Moscow.
According to the source, soon the 22-year-old football player will undergo a medical examination for Lokomotiv, after which he will sign a four-year contract.
Lisakovich in the current season of the championship of Belarus scored nine goals in 18 matches.
He has five games for the Belarusian national team, in which he has not scored once.
Earlier, the media called miranchuk's wishes under the contract with the clubs of Serie A.
Putin spoke with Shoigu in the cabin:
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke with Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Navy Commander-in-Chief Nikolai Evmenov.
The corresponding footage on Sunday, July 26, was published by journalists of the Kremlin pool RIA Novosti in its Telegram channel.
A short meeting was held in the cabin of the boat, where the head of state, together with Shoigu and Evmenov, was heading to the ceremonial formation of ships in the Gulf of Finland before the parade dedicated to the Day of the Russian Navy.
They exchanged a couple of phrases while sitting at the table.
Earlier it was reported that Putin arrived in Kronstadt to participate in solemn events.
From there, the president went to St. Petersburg, where he was to host a festive parade.
On July 26, parades are held throughout Russia on the occasion of the celebration of Navy Day.

the decision to expand the RPL would not have been supported by either UEFA or FIFA.
President of the Russian Football Union (RFU) Alexander Dyukov believes that it is wrong to expand the Russian Premier League (RPL) to 18 teams at the moment.

This violates the integrity of the tournament and the sporting principle.
And, of course, this decision would not be supported by either UEFA or FIFA," Dyukov said after the final of the Russian Cup Zenit - Khimki (1: 0).

I knew bryant's ego couldn't be hurt by some trash current so as not to stimulate his athletic anger.
Kobe had a killer instinct, so on the court I tried to talk to him so that he did not perceive the game in an aggressive way.
On the set, I would give him compliments: "Oh!
Kobe, scored well, great pass!
Listening to my enthusiastic responses, he slightly forgot that it is necessary to once again pick up the ball and score another 3 - 4 points.
We communicated well with Kobi", - quotes the words of Kirilenko "Evening Moscow".
He also talked about his first game against Jordan.
"I took care of him.
For the first three minutes of the match, I ran in complete admiration for the fact that there was a legend next to me, which I had only seen on TV.
While my breath was in joy in the goiter, Michael scored a lot of points.
Soon I walked away from the excitement, a couple of times covered his throws ...
In that game, my team won, and Jordan still scored 44 points," added the head of the RFB.

The actor of the Russian TV series "Chiki", the creators of which were accused of "propaganda of LGBT and feminism", responded to the claims to the film.
The authors "understood the sharpness of the topics raised and did not want to offend anyone," said American Stephen Thomas Oxner in an interview with the publication "Rise".

It has nothing to do with LGBT and feminism," said the actor, who played the father of a boy who changed into women's clothes.
He stressed that he is "proud of the work" and does not consider it propaganda.
