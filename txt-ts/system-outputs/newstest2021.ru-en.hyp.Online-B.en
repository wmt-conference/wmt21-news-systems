No need to demonize the people of Khabarovsk
Acting head of the Khabarovsk Territory spoke about his trip to the region in an exclusive interview with "Komsomolskaya Pravda"
The interim governor of the Khabarovsk Territory Mikhail Degtyarev urged in an interview to the observer of "Komsomolskaya Pravda" Alexander Gamov not to demonize Khabarovsk residents against the background of rallies in support of the arrested ex-head of the region Sergei Furgal.
I want to appeal to all political commentators, political scientists, participants in all kinds of talk shows.
There is no need to demonize the people of the Khabarovsk Territory.
Hardworking and wonderful people live here, - Mikhail Degtyarev shared.
In an interview, Degtyarev recalled that he was a member of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia and a fellow party member of Furgala and added that he wished him luck in court, and that the party and Vladimir Zhirinovsky personally would provide support in court.
The full text of the interview is published on the KP.ru website.
Earlier, the site KP.ru reported that Mikhail Degtyarev spoke in favor of an open trial of Sergei Furgal and considers it fair to hold it in Khabarovsk.
Hurricane Hannah Raises Alert in Two Mexican States
The Mexican National Civil Defense Administration has announced an "orange" (high) alert in the two eastern states of Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon due to the approaching Hurricane Hannah, TASS reported.
The hurricane will bring heavy rainfall to Mexico, with some areas forecasting 150 to 250 liters of precipitation per square meter.
The authorities have prepared about 800 shelters for the population.
10 thousand people will provide assistance to people, including rescuers, National Guard soldiers and the military.
At the moment, the hurricane has reached the coast of the American state of Texas with a wind speed of 150 km / h.
The Hannah is expected to arrive in Mexico on Sunday morning.
Semilarski against the prosecutor's office: the appeal of the former vice-mayor of Tartu will be considered on 4 August
This means that the decision on it, most likely, will be made in early September.
The courts of the first two instances refused to consider Semilarsky's claim, but in April the Supreme Court accepted his cassation appeal.
The Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the applicant on 12 December 2019, since its resolution is not within the jurisdiction of the Administrative Court.
The court ruling stated that the complaint contained a claim for compensation for damage caused in the course of criminal proceedings.
"Such issues should be regulated by the prosecutor's office and the county court," Anette Kreitsmann, spokeswoman for the Tartu courts, told ERR earlier.
According to her, Valvo Semilarski appealed against this decision in the district court, which on February 5 did not change the decision of the court of first instance.
Now the State Court will have to say.
According to Semilarski's defense attorney, attorney at law Oliver Nääs, his client had been unreasonably suspected of bribery for about two years.
Now he demands from the prosecutor's office to refute the false statements in his address and to compensate him for moral damage.
The reason for filing a complaint with the court was the statements of the prosecutor for special cases of the Lyuna District Prosecutor's Office Margus Gross, made by him in October 2017, when Semilarski, along with another then Vice-Mayor of Tartu Artem Suvorov, was detained on suspicion of several crimes.
“As a reminder, when I was detained, the Security Police and the Prosecutor's Office immediately organized a press conference and informed the entire Republic of Estonia that the leaders of Tartu, one of the most influential local government bodies, are corrupt.
These public suspicions that were in the air accompanied me for about two years.
And now, when these allegations and suspicions have turned out to be false, the prosecutor's office does not want to say anything about it, "commented Semilarski in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Nääs, at the press conference, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework within which the prosecutor's office should operate.
“The allegation of bribery and venality turned out to be false, but this is not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly emphasized in its judgments on Russia as well as on Lithuania that during the investigation stage, representatives of the state must be careful in their choice of words so that suspects are not presented as criminals before sentencing.
The prosecutor's office is also obliged to this by the presumption of innocence, which, unfortunately, was not observed in this case against Valvo Semilarski, "Nääs said.
“The public presentation of Semilarski as a serious offender and bribe-taker in circumstances where the facts underlying the suspicion of bribery are still being clarified is unacceptable, contrary to the presumption of innocence and unfair to the applicant,” the lawyer added.
As rus.err.ee wrote, the former vice-mayor of Tartu Valvo Semilarski will not be prosecuted on charges of bribery - the criminal case against him was partially closed in July.
At the same time, the former official is being tried on charges of knowingly violating anti-corruption laws when conducting transactions on an especially large scale.
According to the indictment, between 2015 and 2017, the former Deputy Mayor of Tartu participated more than thirty times in the City Government's meetings when making decisions related to companies operating in Tartu, with whose owners or managers Semilarski actively communicated on a personal level outside of working hours.
According to Gross, in all these cases, Semilarski had personal interests, and therefore he had to withdraw from participation in decision-making.
Earlier, as rus.err.ee wrote, the prosecutor's office presented Semilarski with suspicions of accepting a bribe and violating anti-corruption laws when conducting transactions on an especially large scale.
This happened in October 2016, when he was detained along with another deputy mayor, Artem Suvorov (Center Party).
Then the prosecutor's office and the Security Police said that there was strong evidence against both vice-mayors.
After that, both officials resigned.
Suvorov's case later reached the court, which fully justified the politician.
The trial in the Valvo Semilarski case is still ongoing.
Ex-soloist of the group "Hands Up" visited the Tver region
Ex-soloist of the group "Hands Up", and now a solo performer, businessman and actor Sergei Zhukov posted a photo from Kalyazin in the Tver region on his official instagram account.
Photo posted a day ago, Saturday, July 25th.
"I raise my hands up under the new" Baby "and say hello to you from the heady fresh air!
Write in the comments, what is the weather in your city?
Today we have no rain, but it does not rise above +20 "..., - Zhukov writes in social networks.
Probably, the singer is resting in the beautiful city of the Tver region with his family.
Residents of the region have already thanked the performer for the visit, and also expressed their hope for a meeting and personal communication.
The new "Baby" mentioned in the post probably means a new version of an old song that Zhukov has now recorded together with blogger and musician David Manukyan (DAVA M).
At the same time, the majority of fans remain FOR the old version: "Sergei, the old version of the song is clearly 1,000,000 times better!
Support me loyal fans "Hands Up" "," We do not need a "new baby" ".
Most of them write directly that they like the original, which became a hit at one time, more.
The Ministry of Defense announced the successful completion of the tests of the Zircon hypersonic missile
The Russian Defense Ministry announced the successful completion of the tests of the Zircon hypersonic missile.
On the Day of the Navy, the defense department noted that test launches carried out from the frigate "Admiral of the Soviet Union Fleet Gorshkov" confirmed the unique tactical and technical characteristics of this missile in terms of range and accuracy of fire, as well as its hypersonic flight speed.
According to the Ministry of Defense, the tests of the hypersonic missile are proceeding as planned.
Earlier in May, Deputy Defense Minister Alexei Krivoruchko announced that the ship complex with the latest Zircon hypersonic missile would enter service in 2021-2022.
You are all well aware of the truth that will be discussed today.
I think the idea of inequality as a separator and destroyer of society was in the air even before the French Revolution.
But now we can see evidence by comparing the most and least similar societies and observing the consequences of inequality.
I will show you this data and explain why there are relationships that will be discussed.
But first, look at how dull we are.
(Laughter) I'll start with a paradox.
It shows life expectancy depending on GNI, or the average level of wealth of countries.
It can be seen that countries on the right, such as Norway and the United States, are twice as rich as Israel, Greece and Portugal on the left.
But this does not affect life expectancy at all.
There is no hint of a relationship.
But within societies, strong gradations in health are noticeable, affecting all social strata.
Life expectancy again.
The graph refers to small areas in England and Wales, with the poorest on the right and the richest on the left.
There is a huge difference between the poor and everyone else.
Even those slightly poorer than the richest are already less healthy than the very top.
Thus, income is very important within our societies, but not between them.
The explanation for this paradox is this: within our societies, we look at relative income or social position, status - at what level we are in relation to others, and what are the distances between us.
Once you understand this idea, you immediately think: what happens when the difference increases or contracts, in other words, makes the difference in income more or less?
I'll show you this now.
All data used is absolutely real.
I take information from the UN, the same is from the World Bank: the scale of income disparities in these rich and developed market democracies.
The metric used by our team is very simple, you can download it. We count the difference between the richest 20% and the poorest 20% in each country.
Look, in the equal countries on the left, in Japan, Finland, Norway and Sweden, the rich 20% are 3.5-4 times richer than the poor 20%.
But in unequal countries, in the UK, Portugal, USA and Singapore, the difference is twice as large!
According to these measurements, we are half as equal compared to other successful democracies.
Now you will see what impact this has on society.
We have collected statistics on social problems that are more common among the poor.
These are internationally comparable data on life expectancy, literacy and mathematical education of children, newborn mortality, homicide rate, number of prisoners, teenage pregnancy, confidence level, obesity, mental illness, which, according to the standard diagnostic classification, include drugs and alcohol. dependencies, and finally, data on social mobility.
We put it all in one index.
They are all of the same importance.
The country is, in a way, the average of these data.
You see countries in terms of the inequality score that was shown at the very beginning. I will come back to it again and again throughout the presentation.
Unequal countries in general have more difficulty with all of these social problems.
This is an unusually close bond. You can see that the correlation is unusually high.
But if you look at the same index of health and social problems in relation to GNP per capita, to Gross National Income, there is no longer any correlation.
We were a little worried that people would think that we matched the problems to our arguments and just "fitted" the evidence. Therefore, we also wrote an article for the British Medical Journal on the UNICEF Child Wellbeing Index.
The index consists of 40 different parts, put together by different people.
Among the criteria: the presence of books at home, the ability of children to talk to their parents, the level of immunization, the presence of bullying at school.
Everything goes there.
But this is all against the background of the same indicator of inequality.
The situation is worse for children in unequal societies.
And this is a statistically significant relationship.
But again, if you look at the level of child well-being in relation to national income per capita, then there is no relationship, no hint.
All the data shown speaks for one thing:
on average, the well-being of our societies is no longer dependent on national income and economic growth.
They are extremely important in poor countries, but not in the developed world.
The difference between us and our position against the background of others is what is of great importance.
I will show you fragments of our index.
Take trust, for example.
This is the segment of the population that agrees that most people can be trusted.
Data taken from the World Values Survey.
Look, in unequal countries, only 15% of the population trusts others.
And in equal societies, this figure reaches 60-65%.
If you look at measures of social activity, or social capital, you will notice very similar relationships, closely related to inequality.
We can say we did the job twice.
First, we analyzed developed countries, and then, as a control study, we repeated the procedure in 50 American states, asking one question: are things worse on all of our indicators in the most unequal states?
Here is the credibility of inequality, according to the federal government's general social survey.
A very similar range compared to a similar range of confidence levels.
The same story.
Overall, we found that almost everything related to international trust shows up in the same way in our follow-up study.
This is not just a coincidence.
Here is a graph of mental illness.
WHO, using identical diagnostic interviews conducted on random samples of the population, has collected results that allow us to compare the incidence of mental illness in each of the societies.
Shown here is the percentage of the population that suffered from some kind of mental illness in the past year.
The numbers start at around 8% and go up to almost 24%; whole societies with three times the level of psychological illness.
Again, this is closely related to inequality.
And here is the crime.
These red dots represent the American states and the blue triangles represent the Canadian provinces.
But look at the scale of the difference.
It starts at 15 kills per million and goes up to 150.
This is the proportion of prisoners.
This is a tenfold difference expressed on a logarithmic scale.
The numbers rise from 40 to 400 for the number of inmates in prisons.
These relationships are not simply explained by higher crime rates.
Yes, in some cases this is partly true.
But for the most part they are associated with harsher sentences.
Unequal societies are more often in favor of retaining the death penalty.
Shown here is the percentage of children dropping out of school.
Again, quite a big difference.
It's incredibly harmful when it comes to talent use.
And here is social mobility.
It is a measure of mobility based on income.
Basically, we are talking about the following: do rich fathers have rich sons, and poor fathers have poor sons, or is there no dependence?
Among unequal countries, in the UK and the USA, the father's income is many times more important.
And in the Scandinavian countries, income is already much less significant.
As a result, greater social mobility.
And as we often like to say - I know there are many Americans in the audience - if Americans want to fulfill the American Dream, they should go to Denmark.
(Laughter) (Applause) I've only shown a couple of points in italics.
A number of other problems could be demonstrated.
All kinds of problems that become more significant among the lower social strata.
But there are endless problems with social gradients, which are much worse in unequal countries; and not just a little, but 2, 10 times worse.
Think about the cost, what it costs people.
Let me go back to the graph shown earlier, where all the data is brought together. Let's draw two conclusions.
First. Graph by graph, the less successful countries, and regardless of the result, turn out to be unequal, and the Scandinavian countries and Japan that do well.
Thus, we see before us a general social dysfunction against the background of inequality.
These are not one, not two separate problems. This is a trend.
Another important note about this graph. Let's see below: Sweden and Japan: countries are different in literally everything.
The position of women, how closely they are connected with the family, is exactly the opposite, in the conditions of developed countries.
Another very important difference is how they achieve greater equality.
In Sweden, income gaps are huge, but they are reduced through taxation, social programs, generous benefits, etc.
in Japan, it's different.
The salary gap is initially small.
Taxes below.
There are fewer social programs.
And in our analysis of the American states, we find the same contrast.
Some states do well with income redistribution, others do better with smaller differences in net income before tax.
We believe that it does not matter by what means equality is achieved, as long as it is achieved.
I'm not talking about full equality, but about that which exists in rich and developed market democracies.
Another surprising observation is that it is not only the poor who are affected by this inequality.
There seems to be some truth in John Donne's words: "Man is not an island."
A number of studies can compare how people in more and less equal countries do well at every rung of the social ladder.
One such example:
Mortality among newborns.
A group of Swedes have classified many of the infant mortality cases according to the British register of general socio-economic classification.
This is rather an anachronistic classification according to the profession of fathers, so single parents are not counted.
And “low social level” means unskilled professions.
Further - skilled manual workers, then - white collars of the lower level and up to the highest level with highly qualified professions: doctors, lawyers, directors of large companies.
You see, Sweden is doing better than the UK in all walks of life.
The biggest difference is at the lower levels,
but even for the upper echelons there are benefits from a more equal society.
We have shown this in five different datasets affecting educational outcomes and health in the United States and internationally.
And this seems to be the big picture: more equality changes the situation at the bottom more, but it is also useful for the top.
But I still have to explain what is happening.
It seems to me that we are talking everywhere about the psychosocial consequences of inequality.
About the feeling of superiority and inferiority, about the feeling of one's worth and vice versa, about the feeling of respect for oneself and vice versa.
And, of course, the sense of competition that is born of these feelings fuels consumerism in our society.
It also leads to fear for your status.
We worry more about how others think of us, whether they consider us attractive, smart - this worries us.
The more public assessments, the greater the fear of them.
Interestingly, parallel work is underway in social psychology: 208 different studies with the participation of volunteers were reviewed, who were tested in psychological laboratories for stress hormones, for reaction to stressful tasks.
Overall, they wanted to observe the types of stress that increase levels of cortisol, the main stress hormone.
As a result, such factors turned out to be situations that included a potential threat to social assessment, a threat to self-esteem or social status, situations where other people could give a negative assessment.
It is these stress factors that have a particular influence on the physiology of stress.
Not without criticism addressed to us.
Of course, there are disagreements or people who find this amazing.
I have to tell you, in response to criticism for the data collection, that we do not select this data.
Our main rule is that if the data source has the necessary indicators for one of the analyzed countries, we include it in our analysis.
It is the source of information that decides if this data is real, but not us.
Otherwise, we would create a systematic error.
What about other countries?
There are 200 health studies in relation to income and equity in academic journals.
And they are not limited to these countries, but we have excluded others for clarity.
The same countries, the same dimensions of inequality, problem after problem.
Why don't we control other factors?
Well, we showed you that GNP per capita doesn't matter.
And, of course, others, using more sophisticated methods, controlled both poverty and the level of education, and so on.
What about causality?
Correlation by itself does not prove causality.
We spent a lot of time on this.
Indeed, for some of these situations, causation is well known.
A big change in our understanding of the causes of chronic health effects in the developed world has been how significant chronic social stress and its effects on the immune and cardiovascular systems are.
For example, violence is becoming more common in unequal societies because people are more sensitive to contempt.
I must say that in order to solve this problem, we need to work on income before and after taxes.
We need to limit income and additional bonuses for senior executives.
I think it is necessary to make our bosses responsible for employees in every possible way.
I want you to leave here knowing that we can improve the real quality of human life by reducing the difference in income between us.
Now we have a foothold for influencing the psychological well-being of entire societies, and this is truly incredible.
Thank you.
(Applause)

US calls on Qatar and its neighbors to end dispute
It is necessary to restore trust and unity between Qatar and other states, said US Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook.
He said the conflict between the emirate and other countries in the region has been going on for too long and is detrimental to regional interests of stability, prosperity and security.
So far, the US has tried unsuccessfully to mediate a dispute that Washington views as "a threat to efforts to contain Iran."
Diplomatic relations with Qatar were severed by the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain three years ago.
They imposed a transport blockade, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorism.
In response, Doha said that its neighbors are simply jealous of Qatar's economic success - according to the IMF, Qatar has been leading by a wide margin in terms of GDP per capita for several years.
The emirate is the third largest exporter of natural gas, the sixth exporter of natural gas and a major exporter of oil and petroleum products.

Denis Remenyako rushed forward again, and Alexander Vaintrub was forced to repel the attacks of Alexander Maslennikov on KTM, who had broken through from last place to third.
Despite a tight fight in the first part of the race, closer to the middle, Weintrub increased his pace, showing the best lap time in the race - and, although he could not catch up with the extremely stable Remenyako, he guaranteed himself silver.
The Cayman group lagged behind the leaders, but waged a tight fight among themselves.
Alexey Bashmakov became the best of the pilots on the Porsche, who became the fourth in the standings, but Andrey Fedotov and Konstantin Zakharevsky gave him a few moments.
And at the intermediate finish in the middle of the race, Fedotov and Zakharevsky were completely separated by 0.001 seconds.
Two more highways were included in the list of federal roads
The Government of the Russian Federation has included two more highways in the list of federal highways.
According to the Cabinet of Ministers, one of these roads, with a length of more than 663 kilometers, Chekshino - Totma - Kotlas - Kuratovo connects the Vologda and Arkhangelsk regions with the Komi Republic.
Another highway over 388 kilometers long leads from Barnaul through Pavlovsk to the border with the Republic of Kazakhstan.
You can drive along this road from the capital of the Altai Territory to the checkpoint "Kulunda".
Obtaining a new status will allow these routes to be brought to the normative state for the funds of the Federal Road Fund.
Major repairs and reconstruction of individual sections will be carried out, the quality of the road surface will increase.
Open-air film screenings allowed in Tatarstan
The Cabinet of Ministers of Tatarstan has published a decree according to which from July 27 in the republic it is possible to hold film screenings in open areas - in parks, squares and on embankments, writes "Tatar-inform".
Also, the document states that for citizens over 65, the mandatory self-isolation regime has been extended until August 9.
They can leave their homes to go to the store, take out the trash or take a walk with the dog.
But cinemas in the premises do not plan to open until the third stage of lifting restrictions, the agency recalls.
“Washington” is pleased with the playoffs.
We missed them
Russian hockey player "Washington Capitals" Alexander Ovechkin spoke about the preparation of the club for the upcoming renewal of the season in the NHL.
34-year-old striker “Caps” noted the readiness of his partners for matches.
Psychologically, all the guys are ready.
We are going to Toronto joyful, because we have been without a game for a long time and have missed hockey in the playoffs, '' Ovechkin is quoted by the Russian-language version of the NHL.Com website.
- Now we are fresh, we have no injuries and various ailments.
However, Ovechkin also admitted that he and his teammates still have to remember some of the tactical combinations: “We don't have much time to play up the majority and remember the March developments on how to move the puck in such situations.
But there is still time: I am sure that in Toronto we will devote part of our training to this.
Majority and minority are important in the playoffs.
And I am confident in our special brigades. "
Recall that the restart of the Washington Capitals is scheduled for August 3, when the capital will play with the Tampa Bay Lightning.
After that, the Caps hockey players will also play with the Philadelphia Flyers (August 6) and the Boston Bruins (August 9).
Russian refused to pay for parking and beat a parking worker
In Vladivostok, a man refused to pay for parking and hit a parking attendant, the police are checking.
This is reported by the vl.ru portal with reference to the press service of the Russian MIA Administration for the city.
The incident took place on Friday, July 24, in a parking lot near a shopping center.
The driver of the car refused to pay for parking the car, which is why there was a conflict with the parking employee.
The verbal dispute grew into assault.
The man hit the employee in the face, he fell unconscious.
He was hospitalized.
According to the source of the publication, the victim received a head injury of moderate severity and was taken to the neurosurgery department.
Currently, the police are establishing all the circumstances of the incident.
Earlier, the Russian was charged with beating a disabled person who later died in hospital.
According to the investigation, the victim was visiting his friend, a 45-year-old local resident.
The men drank alcohol together, after which a conflict arose between the friends.
The owner of the apartment beat the guest, he went home.
Two days later, the man became ill, he was hospitalized.
He died of his injuries.
Cyberattacks on the business world have become more frequent lately.
Access to data from companies such as JP Morgan, Yahoo, Home Depot and Target has caused them losses in the hundreds of millions, and in some cases even billions of dollars.
It doesn't take too many of these attacks to wreak havoc on the global economy.
The public sector is also not immune from such problems.
From 2012 to 2014, there was a significant data breach at the Office of Human Resource Services.
Access to due diligence and fingerprint data has been disrupted for 22 million employees.
There are known attempts by government-sponsored hackers to influence election results in a number of countries using stolen data.
The last two big data disclosures involve the Bundestag, the German federal parliament, and the theft of emails from the US Democratic National Committee.
The cyber threat affects our democratic processes.
The situation is even getting worse.
As computer technology advances, data protection systems become more vulnerable.
A new type of computer technology is also a matter of concern - computing on quantum computers, which use the microscopic properties of nature to dramatically increase computing power.
It is so powerful that it can break many modern encryption systems.
Is the situation so hopeless?
Maybe it's time to pack our vital data and prepare for the imminent digital apocalypse?
I would say, "It's not time yet."
Quantum computers are still in development and will take many years before they are put into practice.
More importantly, there are major breakthroughs in encryption taking place.
This is a particularly exciting time for me in the history of secure communications.
About 15 years ago, when I learned about the new possibility of creating quantum effects that do not exist in nature, I was very excited.
I was intrigued by the idea of applying fundamental laws of physics to create more secure encryption.
Today, a number of companies and laboratories around the world, including mine, are working on these technologies to put them into practice.
Right.
Now we are preparing to fight the quantum with the quantum.
So how does this all work?
First, let's take a quick excursion into the world of encryption.
For this we need a briefcase, some important documents that we want to send to our friend, James Bond, and a lock to keep everything safe.
Since our information is top secret, we need a special portfolio.
It has a special combination lock: when closed, it converts all text in documents to random numbers.
You put the documents in the briefcase, close the lock - at this very moment, all the documents are converted to random numbers - and send the briefcase to James.
While the briefcase is on the way, you call James to give him the code.
After receiving the briefcase, he enters the code, the documents are decrypted, and voila - you just sent an encrypted message to James Bond.
(Laughter) A funny example, but it illustrates three important elements of coding.
Code - we call it the "encryption key".
It's like a password.
Calling James to tell him the lock combination code.
This is called "key exchange" -
ensuring that you securely get the encryption key from the right place.
And a lock that encodes and decodes the document.
This is called the "coding algorithm".
Using a key, it converts text in documents to random numbers.
A good algorithm will encode in such a way that without the key, the document is very difficult to decrypt.
The importance of encryption is that if someone takes possession of a briefcase and breaks it without using the encryption key and encryption algorithm, they will still not be able to read its contents.
The information will look like a bunch of random numbers.
Most security systems rely on a secure key exchange method to transfer the encryption key to the right place.
However, the rapid development of computing power is jeopardizing a number of modern key exchange methods.
Consider one of the most widely used systems today - RSA.
When it was invented in 1977, it was estimated that it would take 40 quadrillion years to crack a 426-bit RSA key.
In 1994, just 17 years later, the code was cracked.
As computers got more powerful, we had to use more complex codes.
Today we usually use 2,048 or 4,096 bits.
As you can see, code creators and hackers are engaged in an ongoing battle trying to outsmart each other.
And when quantum computers arrive in the next 10-15 years, they will be able to break even faster the complex mathematics that underlies many modern encryption systems.
The quantum computer is likely to transform our current rugged fortress into a simple house of cards.
We must find a way to protect our fortress.
In recent years, there has been an increasing amount of research into the use of quantum effects to enhance crypto security.
Some interesting discoveries have been made.
Remember the three main elements of encryption: high quality keys, secure key exchange, and a sophisticated algorithm?
Advances in science and technology are jeopardizing two of these three elements.
First, the keys themselves.
Random numbers are the fundamental building blocks of encryption keys.
But today they are not entirely random.
Today we create encryption keys from sequences of random numbers generated from software, so-called pseudo-random numbers.
In the numbers generated by a program or a mathematical formula, one way or another, there is a certain pattern.
The less random the numbers - in scientific terminology: the less entropy they contain - the easier it is to predict them.
Several casinos have recently fallen victim to an ingenious attack.
The combinations at the output of the slot machines were recorded for some time, after which they were analyzed.
This allowed cybercriminals to redesign the pseudo-random number generator that drives the reels.
This, in turn, made it possible to predict the spins of the reels with high accuracy and get a big win.
Encryption keys can be subject to similar risks.
A truly random number generator is required for secure encryption.
For many years, scientists have been looking for the possibility of creating such a generator.
But most of the attempts today are either not random enough, not fast enough, or difficult to repeat.
But the quantum world is based on chance.
Therefore, it makes sense to take advantage of this fact.
Devices that can measure quantum effects can also generate an endless stream of random numbers at high speed,
which will stop all these potential casino criminals.
Some of the best universities and companies around the world are creating truly random number generators.
The first quantum generator I built was one meter by two meters and fit on an optical table.
Later we were able to shrink it down to the size of a server box.
Today it is about the size of a PCI card plugged into a standard computer.
It is the world's fastest truly random number generator.
Its performance is one billion random numbers per second.
Today it is used to strengthen the security system by cloud providers, banks, government agencies around the world.
(Applause) But even with such a generator, the second big problem remains unresolved: the threat to secure key exchange.
Modern key exchange methods are not compatible with a quantum computer.
The quantum solution to this problem is called "quantum key distribution" or QKD, which is based on a fundamental, paradoxical characteristic of quantum mechanics.
A quantum particle changes depending on its observation.
Let me give you an example of how it works.
Let's go back to exchanging the lock codes with James Bond.
Only this time, instead of calling James with the code, we'll use quantum effects on the laser to create the code and send it to James over a regular optical fiber.
We believe that Dr. No will try to hack access to data exchange.
Luckily, his attempts to trap the quantum keys along the way will leave fingerprints that James and you can find.
This will eliminate intercepted keys.
And the remaining keys can be used for enhanced data protection.
Since such security is based on fundamental laws of physics, a quantum computer or even any supercomputer of the future cannot break it.
My team and I are working with leading universities as well as the defense sector to develop this promising technology into the next generation of security.
The Internet of Things heralds an era of 25–30 billion devices projected to arrive by 2020.
Trust in the systems that support these devices is vital to the proper functioning of our society in the world of the Internet of Things.
I bet quantum technology can provide this trust, allowing us to take full advantage of the amazing innovations that will enrich our lives.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Video how cats helped a wounded dog cross the road
A video of two cats that helped a wounded dog cross the road in the Krasnodar Territory is becoming popular on the Internet.
The touching procession was recorded by the video recorder of one of the drivers.
The events took place in the dark, the man noticed movement on the road and slowed down.
“Look, the whole delegation is rushing,” the driver sneers at first.
And then he notices that the dog moves with great difficulty.
The company made it safely to the side of the road, and then headed towards the forest.
"There is something for people to learn from animals," write in the comments.
On Sunday, parades in honor of the Day of the Russian Navy were held in St. Petersburg and near all major naval bases, including in Syrian Tartus.
They were attended by 219 different ships and 15 thousand personnel.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, who hosted the main parade in St. Petersburg, said that in 2020 the Navy will be replenished with 40 new ships of different classes, as well as the latest weapons, including hypersonic strike systems and unmanned underwater vehicles.
In 2020, the parade was first held in Kaspiysk, where the base of the Caspian fleet was redeployed from Astrakhan.
In addition to St. Petersburg, parades were held in Baltiysk, Kaspiysk, Severomorsk, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Vladivostok, as well as in the annexed Sevastopol and on the roadstead of the Syrian port of Tartus.
The main parade in the water area of the Neva and the Gulf of Finland was attended by 4,000 servicemen and 46 ships, including nuclear and diesel submarines, as well as helicopters and aircraft of the Naval Aviation.
Before the start of the parade, Putin, accompanied by Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, Admiral Nikolai Yevmenov, and Commander of the Western Military District, Colonel-General Zhuravlev, walked around several ships standing in the Kronstadt roadstead and in the Gulf of Finland, greeting the personnel.
A copy of the first Russian battleship "Poltava", recreated according to archival drawings, also became the decoration of the parade.
Emperor Peter I took part in its design.
In his speech, Putin recalled that this year marks the 200th anniversary of the discovery of Antarctica as a result of the expedition of Russian sailors Thaddeus Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev.
And on the roof of the Senate and Synod building during the parade, snipers were seen providing security.
More than 46 warships and more than 1.5 servicemen took part in the parade in Baltiysk, where the Baltic Fleet is based, and the large battleship Kaliningrad made an amphibious landing.
In the annexed Sevastopol, a parade was held with the participation of 30 ships and a performance dedicated to the history of the Black Sea Fleet, which included the exit of a group of divers from under the water.
The parade in Severomorsk was attended by the new strategic nuclear submarine "Knyaz Vladimir", which was accepted into the Northern Fleet in June.
In Vladivostok, the holiday ended with fireworks.
The Russian Navy this year will receive forty ships and vessels
Forty ships and vessels will join the Russian Navy this year, said Russian President Vladimir Putin.
“The level of equipment of our navy is constantly growing.
This year, forty ships and vessels of various classes will be accepted into its composition, "he said, speaking at the main parade in honor of the Navy Day in St. Petersburg.
Putin also recalled that a few days ago, six new ships of the far sea zone were laid down at three shipyards in Russia.
Earlier it was reported that a parade began in St. Petersburg in honor of the Day of the Navy.
Four-year-old child injured in road accident near Volgograd

How will the Central Bank's decision to cut the key rate affect the economy?
The Bank of Russia, as expected, lowered its key rate again.
It dropped by another 0.25 percentage points, to 4.25% per annum - formally another historical minimum.
Judging by the return of a short step in the rate cut, as well as the tone of the Central Bank's statements and updated forecasts for the Russian economy, the regulator looks at the economic outlook more optimistically than before.
This means that the current monetary easing cycle may soon stop.
“We continued to ease our monetary policy, primarily considering that there are still risks of inflation deviating from 4% in 2021,” said the head of the Bank of Russia Elvira Nabiullina.
They are associated with a significant decline in economic activity, a drop in domestic and foreign demand.
The economic recovery, according to Nabiullina, will take more than a year and a half.
At the same time, she noted that after the restrictions were lifted due to the pandemic, economic processes revived: energy consumption, consumer and investment demand were restored, construction and production of consumer goods expanded, the annual rate of decline in transport and industrial production slowed down.
According to the revised forecast of the Central Bank, in 2020 the economy will contract 4.5-5.5% (before that it was expected 4-6%), and the recovery growth of the economy in 2021 will be 3.5-4.5%, in 2022 - 2.5-3.5%.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised its forecast for annual oil prices to $ 38 and $ 40 per barrel of Urals in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
Earlier, the Central Bank expected $ 27 and $ 35 per barrel.
Finally, the Bank of Russia's inflation forecast for 2020 was 3.7-4.2% against the previously expected 3.8-4.8%.
The Bank of Russia's view of the situation in the economy is becoming more optimistic, which brings us closer to the end of the easing cycle, according to economists for Russia and the CIS at Renaissance Capital Sofia Donets and Andrey Melashchenko.
Thus, the Bank of Russia has been consistently reducing the key rate for more than a year; since the beginning of last summer, it has already dropped by 3.5 percentage points.
And at the last meeting in June, the Central Bank lowered it immediately by one percentage point due to low inflation rates due to suppressed demand and the need to stimulate the economy that has slowed down due to the pandemic and related restrictions.
Chances for adjusting monetary policy remain (at the next meeting on September 18 and until the end of the year), but the limit is already close, agrees Rosbank chief analyst Yevgeny Koshelev.
The combination of pro-inflationary risks also points to a close pause in interest rate easing - disrupted supply chains, a possible rise in costs due to measures to prevent the epidemic and a faster (compared to expectations) recovery in demand, he says.
To top it off, subsequent actions by the Bank of Russia will require more attention to inflationary processes during the harvest season, as well as external volatility, which has increased against the backdrop of geopolitical conflicts, Koshelev points out.
One way or another, a decrease in the key rate will lead to a further decrease in rates for the most reliable borrowers, as well as, possibly, on mortgages, says Maxim Petronevich, senior economist at the analytical department of Otkritie Bank.
The rate adjustment will be less pronounced than the key rate cut, he said.
Rates on consumer loans may fall by another 0.3-0.6 percentage points during the second half of the year, mortgage rates may end the year in the range of 6.2-7%, the economist of BCS Premier Anton Pokatovich does not exclude.
Average rates on deposits, in his opinion, will also fall - in the coming months they may drop to 4.2-4.5% (now just above 4.5%).
Further, they may drop to 4% if the Central Bank cuts the key rate in the fall, Pokatovich said.

Psychologist: "Emelianenko still cannot forget parting with his beloved woman."
Psychologist Veronica Stepanova, who has over 1 million YouTube subscribers, spoke about MMA fighter Alexander Emelianenko, who is her sister's ex-husband.
Olya met with Sasha, they started a stormy love, - said Stepanova in a video on her Youtube channel.
- It was a very beautiful story, they instantly gave birth to a child, everything was fine and wonderful.
At some point, Sasha was fed up with all this, he wanted to take a little walk.
And if any other woman treats this normally (well, think about it, went for a walk, dance a little), then this is not about Olya.
She hates such things.
And his story about a little walk ended with the fact that his sister instantly married another man and immediately gave birth to his child.
When Sasha came to himself from what had happened, he could not believe it.
He tried to crawl on his knees, give diamonds.
His lion's pride blew his head off.
He wanted to return everything, but he did not understand how to return it.
They maintain friendly relations, they have a common child, but he still cannot come to his senses.
His destructive behavior is a cry of despair, an attempt either to kill himself or to get her attention.

Albert Proza has signed a contract with the Tallinn Legion
The last club of Prose was Tartu “Tammeka”, for which he played last season.
“Due to injury, I have been out of football for over a year.
On April 30 he underwent surgery.
But now everything is in order - ready to play again.
However, while my form is far from optimal.
When will I debut for Legion?
It is quite possible that on July 29 I will play a certain amount of time for the Estonian Cup, and on August 1 I will be included in the application for the championship match against Paide.
But everything depends on the coach's decision, he will decide whether I am ready or not.
I myself think that I still have a lot to recruit, "- said Albert Prose in an interview with ERR on Sunday.
In the current Estonian football championship "Legion" after 14 rounds takes the ninth place in the standings with 10 points.
“At the moment, if you look at the table, then we cannot talk about the struggle for high places, but“ Legion ”is an ambitious team, we have a fairly good composition.
I think that next year we will have better results.
And the task for this year is to maintain a place in the top league and play more confidently, "added Prose.
"I don't set any personal goals for myself.
Returning to football after such a long hiatus is not easy.
Now my main task is to help the team stay in the top league and rise in the table as high as possible, "the striker said.
Previously, Proza also played for the capital "Flora" and "Infonet", Finnish RoPS and TPS, Maltese "Valetta".

On the roadstead of Kronstadt in the Gulf of Finland one could see for the first time the large landing ship "Pyotr Morgunov", built according to the project 11711 of the Nevsky PKB at the Baltic shipyard "Yantar".
The lead ship of this series, Ivan Gren, is already serving in the Northern Fleet, TASS reports.
Among other newcomers who have recently entered service with the Navy was the first serial frigate Admiral of the Fleet Kasatonov, built according to Project 22350 at the Severnaya Verf shipyard.
Another newcomer to the Navy is the project 636.3 diesel-electric submarine Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky of the Rubin Central Design Bureau of Marine Engineering, built at the Admiralty Shipyards.
She joined the Russian Pacific Fleet in December 2019.
Other newest ships recently included in the Navy are the small missile ships Sovetsk and Mytishchi of Project 22800 (Karakurt), developed by the Almaz Central Design Bureau.
The small rocket ships Veliky Ustyug and Serpukhov of project 21631 Buyan-M also took part in the parade on the Neva.
And the largest participants were the nuclear-powered missile submarine Orel and the large anti-submarine ship Vice-Admiral Kulakov - they could be seen in the Gulf of Finland.
In recognition of the great contribution of the Russian fleet to the exploration of the World Ocean, two state-of-the-art hydrographic boats "Georgy Zima" and "Mikhail Kazansky" sailed along the Neva along with warships. And on the Kronstadt roadstead an oceanographic research vessel "Admiral Vladimirsky" stopped, which completed in June a scientific round-the-world expedition to the shores of Antarctica with the Russian Geographical Society in honor of the 200th anniversary of its discovery by Russian navigators Faddey Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev.
And at the Palace Bridge one could see the first Russian battleship of the 16th century, Poltava, recreated at the historic shipyard.
This 54-gun sailing ship was launched in 1712, took part in the war with the Swedes, and in 1717 provided the landing on the island of Gotland.
In 1725, this ship was withdrawn from the Baltic Fleet, and after its reconstruction, it was launched in St. Petersburg on May 27, 2018.
Travel to Kronstadt this year was limited for the duration of the parade in connection with the prevention of the spread of the coronavirus COVID-19, RIA Novosti reports.
1 person killed during protests in the United States
Protests have taken place in Seattle, Portland, Louisville and Denver, the Hot Camera said Sunday.
In Austin, Texas, a man was killed during a protest.
The protester was shot with a rifle while he was sitting in his car.
The suspect in the crime has already been detained.
In other cities, protesters clashed with law enforcement officers.
The protesters staged riots and the police were forced to use tear gas and stun grenades.
Poll: Ruling Union of Peasants and Greens of Lithuania tops the rating of parties again
The Union of Peasants and Greens of Lithuania, which heads the ruling coalition of the Diet, topped the rating of the parties.
This was shown by a poll conducted by the sociological research company Vilmorus for the time being ordered by the newspaper Lietuvos rytas.
After winning the 2016 parliamentary elections, the "peasants" lost first place and for a long time was led by the main critic of Russia in Lithuania, the opposition Union of the Fatherland - Christian Democrats (Conservatives).
Nevertheless, recently, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda, assessing the electoral possibilities of the parties, said that the Union of Peasants and Greens after the parliamentary elections this year will probably be able to form a coalition again.
This announcement sparked the outrage of conservatives.
The latest poll showed that if parliamentary elections were held today, 17.6 percent of voters would vote for peasants, and 17.2 percent for conservatives.
According to the director of Vilmorus, Vladas Gaidis, the gap is within the margin of error, and nevertheless, the ruling ceased to lag behind the conservatives.
According to Gaidis, the news that their electoral list will be headed by Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis contributed to the sociological success of the "peasants".
This politician was the first in the list of "peasants" in the 2016 elections.
In third place is the Social Democratic Party, for which 7.1 percent of respondents are now ready to vote.
In a month, she unexpectedly lost 2 percent.
The fourth is the Labor Party, headed by Viktor Uspaskikh, a businessman of Russian origin (6.2 percent).
The rest of the political organizations, judging by the poll, will not be able to overcome the 5% electoral threshold yet.
Putin spoke about the unique advantages of the Russian fleet
Russian President Vladimir Putin said at the Main Naval Parade in St. Petersburg that the unique advantages and increased combat capabilities of the Russian fleet will be achieved through the introduction of advanced digital technologies.
As the head of state specified, domestic hypersonic strike systems and unmanned underwater vehicles have no analogues in the world.
In addition, the Russian leader drew attention to the most effective means of defense of the Russian Federation.
According to the Russian leader, the level of equipment of the Russian Navy is constantly growing, so this year 40 ships and vessels of various classes will be accepted into its composition.
At the same time, it is noted that the emphasis will be placed on equipping with unique hypersonic strike complexes.
Today, the Navy is armed with the latest ships equipped with precision weapons, strategic submarine cruisers and multipurpose submarines, as well as unique samples of special equipment, the president added.
Putin also stressed that military sailors adequately perform the most difficult tasks, flawlessly serving the Fatherland.
Emergencies Ministry warned residents of the Moscow region about a thunderstorm
Thunderstorms and wind gusts up to 15 m / s are expected in the Moscow region. This was reported by the regional department of the Ministry of Emergency Situations on Sunday, July 26.
Residents are advised to remove household items from their yards and cut off dry trees that can damage their homes.
The car should be placed in a garage or parked away from trees or weakly reinforced structures.
To avoid a lightning strike, it is recommended not to heat the stove in the house in a thunderstorm and not to use electrical appliances, and on the street not to hide under trees (especially lonely ones), not to swim in water bodies.
Those in the car are advised to close the windows and stay inside.
On July 24, the Emergencies Ministry also warned residents of the Moscow region about a thunderstorm.
Excessive requirements for public procurement applications will be excluded by law
The legislation may establish comprehensive requirements for applications for participation in procurement.
In the autumn session, at the plenary session of the State Duma, it is planned to consider in the second reading a draft law establishing the requirements for the content and composition of the application for participation in the procurement, participants of which can only be small and medium-sized businesses.
Amendments are made by the government to the law "On the procurement of goods, works, services by certain types of legal entities."
The bill was developed in pursuance of the roadmap for the implementation of the Strategy for the Development of Small and Medium-Sized Businesses in the Russian Federation until 2030, approved by the government.
It provides for the preparation of a draft law on an exhaustive list of documents that customers have the right to require as part of an application from procurement participants - small and medium-sized businesses.
And also - about the list of requirements for these documents.
Today, the law "On the procurement of goods, works, services by certain types of legal entities" regulates the procurement activities of certain types of legal entities.
Requirements for the content, form, design and composition of the application for participation in the procurement are established by the customers independently in the procurement documentation.
"As a result, the customers establish excessive requirements for the content, execution of the application, the mandatory presence in its composition of references, certificates, extracts, the time of receipt of which in the authorized bodies is comparable to the deadline for submitting applications, which leads to the impossibility of participating in such a procurement and a reduction in the number of procurement participants" , - says the explanation to the bill.
The new bill provides for the establishment of an exhaustive list of documents that customers have the right to require as part of an application from procurement participants who are small and medium-sized businesses.
"The adoption of the document will allow to exclude the arbitrary establishment by customers of requirements for the composition and content of applications of participants who are small and medium-sized businesses," the explanatory note says.
As an artist, connection is very important to me.
In my works, I try to show that people are inseparable from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I first visited Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and there I saw icebergs.
I was in awe.
My heart was beating faster, my head was spinning, trying to understand what opened in front of me.
The icebergs around were floating out of the water nearly 200 feet. And I could not help but be surprised that this is one snowflake on top of another, year after year.
Icebergs are born when they break off glacier ice or break off ice shelves.
Each iceberg has its own personality.
Everyone interacts with the environment in their own way and gains their own experience.
Some refuse to give up and hold on to the bitter end, while others can no longer fight and die in a fit of intense passion.
Looking at an iceberg, it is easy to think that it is isolated, that it is closed and alone, just as we humans often see ourselves.
But in life, everything is completely different.
When an iceberg melts, I breathe in its ancient atmosphere.
When an iceberg melts, it releases fresh, mineral-rich water that feeds many life forms.
I approach photographing these icebergs as portraying my ancestors, knowing that in these individual moments they exist in this very image, and that it will never happen again.
They don't die when they melt; it is not the end, but the continuation of their path in the cycle of life.
Sometimes the ice in the icebergs that I photograph is very young - only a couple of thousand years old.
And some icebergs are over 100,000 years old.
The last photos I want to show you are of an iceberg I photographed in Kirtartivatziak, Greenland.
It is a very rare case when it is possible to see how an iceberg rotates.
So here it is.
A small boat is visible on the left.
Approximately 4.5 meters long.
Please pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and where it touches the water.
Here you can see how it begins to rotate, and the boat swam across to the other side, and there is a man.
This is a medium-sized Greenlandic iceberg.
It protrudes from the water about 120 feet or 40 meters.
And here is this real-time recording.
(Music) And just like that, the iceberg shows us a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
(Applause)
One winter morning several years ago, I was driving to work in Johannesburg, South Africa, and I noticed a fog hanging over the city.
I go there almost every day, so I probably wouldn't have paid attention to it before.
Johannesburg is known for its special skyline that I could barely see that morning.
I soon realized that it was a huge cloud of polluted air.
The contrast between my usual picturesque environment and that sky, shrouded in smog, stirred something in me.
I was horrified that this city of colorful and scenic sunsets would be swallowed up in darkness.
At that moment, I had a strong desire to do something, but I did not know what.
All I knew was that I could not stay away.
The main difficulty was that I did not know much about ecology, air quality management or atmospheric chemistry.
I am a computer engineer and I was pretty sure that I could not handle this problem with code.
(Laughter) Who am I to make a difference?
But I was a resident of this city.
In the years that followed, I learned one very important lesson - a lesson that must be taken seriously if we strive for a better future.
Even if you are not an expert in any field, your outside experience can be the key to solving complex problems in this area.
Sometimes your unique vision can turn into an extraordinary idea that will get things off the ground, but you have to be brave enough to try.
This is the only way out.
Even then, I realized that in order to at least try to change the situation for the better, first I would have to understand air pollution, so I became a student again.
At the very beginning of my research, I learned that air pollution is the greatest threat to the state of the environment.
According to the World Health Organization, nearly 14 percent of global deaths in 2012 were caused by indoor and outdoor air pollution, especially in low- and middle-income countries.
Air pollution alone causes more deaths each year than malaria or HIV / AIDS.
In Africa, the number of premature deaths due to unsafe sanitation or malnutrition among children is not comparable to the number of deaths due to air pollution, and this comes at a huge economic cost: more than 400 billion US dollars as of 2013, according to the study. Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
Now in my work I am exploring new possibilities in the field of artificial intelligence, where the symbiotic relationship between man and machine will help to find a favorable basis for making the right decisions.
In the process of studying the problem of air pollution, it became clear that we need to find a way to make better decisions to control air pollution, and given the magnitude of the problem, we need to do this together.
So I decided to get to know people who work in this field.
I started meeting with officials in Johannesburg and other nearby cities, I also attracted the local scientific community, and I also made some cold calls.
The networking process that I engaged in helped me gain a deeper understanding of the problem.
It also helped me avoid falling into the trap that my colleagues often fall into when trying to innovate, where we quickly apply technology before we are clearly aware of the problem at hand.
I started thinking about what I can do to improve the situation.
I just started asking myself how I can effectively combine all my programming and artificial intelligence skills with the experiences of the people I met.
I wanted to create an online platform for air quality regulation that will identify patterns in pollution, look into the future and determine what we should expect.
I intended to put my idea into practice, but faced with uncertainty, I had no guarantees of success.
I only had a certain set of engineering skills, skills that I acquired in my profession (Laughter) that people who have been dealing with air pollution have not had for years.
I realized that sometimes just one fresh look, some new skills create the conditions for the emergence of something outstanding.
Willpower and imagination are our guiding stars, empowering us to find new paths and get around difficulties.
Armed with a deep understanding of air pollution and decades of information on pollutant concentrations and meteorological conditions in Johannesburg and beyond, my colleagues from South Africa and China have created a cloud-based air decision support system.
The software system analyzes historical and real-time data to reveal spatial and temporal trends.
We then used a new machine learning technology to predict pollution levels for different pollutants days in advance.
This means that residents can make better decisions about their movements and the choice of residence for their families.
We will be able to predict pollution incidents in advance, calculate the culprits of pollution, who, by order of the authorities, will be forced to reduce the scale of their activities.
With the help of scenario planning, city planners will be able to make the right decisions in the development of infrastructure, such as residential settlements, industrial zones.
We completed testing of our technology, which lasted for about 120 days, covering all of South Africa.
Our results were welcomed when we demonstrated a strong relationship between the forecast data and the data we obtained on the spot.
Through our leadership, we have created cutting-edge, groundbreaking technologies that can predict air quality with unprecedented accuracy, improving the city I was driving through one winter morning and thinking, “Something is wrong here. What can be done? "
And here's my takeaway: what if I hadn’t looked into air pollution then?
What if I hadn’t expressed my concern for the environment and just hoped that someone, somewhere, was already tackling the problem?
Here's what I've learned: When we embark on a challenging venture that contributes to what we strongly believe in, it's important to focus on success and consider the consequences of inaction.
We should not go astray in the face of obstacles and difficulties, this should motivate us even more.
Wherever you are, when you realize that your natural curiosity is aroused by something and this is something that excites you, and you have crazy and daring ideas, and perhaps it is beyond your competence, ask yourself: why not?
Why not take action and solve the problem as best you can in your own way?
And you might be pleasantly surprised.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Republicans will offer to issue another $ 1 trillion to support the US economy
Republicans will offer to spend another $ 1 trillion to support the United States economy, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin confirmed on Sunday, July 26, on Fox News.
"Inside the package for $ 1 trillion there are top priority and urgent things," said the head of the US Treasury.
The support package includes new direct payments to Americans.
The proposal must be accepted by Congress and signed by US President Donald Trump.
Representatives of the US Democratic Party believe that the proposed funds are insufficient.
In the spring, about $ 3 trillion was allocated to support the economy in the United States.
On April 24, Trump signed a bill on financial assistance to the American economy in the amount of almost half a trillion dollars to combat the coronavirus and its consequences.
According to analysts, the US GDP in the second quarter of 2020 will fall by 25% on an annualized basis, which will be the strongest recession in the history of the country.
Microsoft will force an update on older versions of Windows 10
Microsoft has confirmed the transition to the next stage of distribution of the May 2020 Update for the Windows 10 operating system, BetaNews portal writes on July 25.
No package needed: FAS questioned the legality of Microsoft's anti-virus offer
Having received software for remote work from an American corporation, government agencies may violate the law
The company will expand the circle of users with the new OS version.
For this, computers with older versions of the system were decided to be automatically updated.
It is assumed that a specially developed by the company algorithm will detect devices with old versions of the software platform, whose support period will end soon, and will automatically install Windows 10 May 2020 Update on them.
In the near future, this will affect computers with Windows 10 (1809) and Windows 10 (1903), whose support will expire on November 10 and December 8, respectively, the newspaper notes.
On July 21, it was reported that after updating the Windows 10 operating system, users encountered problems connecting to the Internet - there was no network access.
The difficulties were not connected with the connection to the network itself, but with the connection status.
Dr. Myasnikov named the main indicators of human health
In the "deadly quartet" one of the main criteria was the excess of the waist
Doctor and TV presenter Alexander Myasnikov spoke about the key indicators by which one can determine human health.
His so-called "death quartet" included four criteria - an increase in blood pressure, cholesterol, sugar and waist volume, the doctor said on the air of the Russia 1 TV channel.
Myasnikov urged everyone to pay attention to these factors.
Moreover, according to him, controlling the waist is even more important than weight.
For men, this parameter should not exceed 102 centimeters, for women - 88 centimeters.
Exceeding these standards may indicate that health is under threat.
First of all, we are talking about the state of the heart - a waist volume above normal is a risk factor for stroke, heart attack, as well as cancer and diabetes.
We will remind, earlier Myasnikov told why you can eat candy at night.
The doctor explained that sugar in itself is not dangerous to health, the dessert will become harmful only when there is such food in large quantities, and candy for the night, according to him, is not the worst snack.
Winners in Touring and Super-production were determined at "Igor Drive"
Touring and Super-production competitions have come to an end at the Igora Drive autodrome, where the main stage of the Russian series of circuit races is taking place.
This was announced by Channel Five on Sunday, July 26.
Kirill Ladygin, Dmitry Bragin, Alexey Dudukalo, Pavel Kalmanovich, Ivan Lukashevich became the leaders in Touring.
Andrey Petukhov, Vladislav Nezvankin, Nikolay Vikhansky, Vadim Antipov, Dmitry Lebedev won Super-production.
In the Trophy of the SMP RSKG, Rustam Fatkhutdinov became the best, Lev Tolkachev and Pavel Yashin became the winners.
The documentary John Lewis: Good Trouble has been released online.
The biography film, which was supposed to become a kind of visual congratulation to Congressman John Lewis, who celebrated his 80th birthday at the beginning of the year, has become a detailed epitaph.
On July 17, a prominent human rights activist and politician passed away after a long battle with pancreatic cancer.
Numerous funeral events are held in the United States these days in memory of him.
Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows have put forward the idea of passing the law, focusing on several topics, including federal unemployment payments, which expire on Friday.
The rest of the questions are proposed to be dealt with later.
Moderna Inc said Sunday that it received an additional $ 472 million from the Office of Advanced Biomedical Research to develop a vaccine against the new coronavirus.
The US-based drug manufacturing firm explained that the additional funding is intended to help the company operate in its late-stage clinical trials.
Without warning, the UK removed Spain from the list of safe countries to travel and imposed a two-week quarantine for anyone entering the country from Spain.
British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab did not apologize for the sudden decision, explaining it by the recent spike in COVID-19 in Spain.
Protests
Protests were held in a number of US cities to draw attention to the problem of racial injustice.
In Seattle, police fired flashbangs and tear gas and arrested 45 people after demonstrations in support of protests in Portland turned violent.
Police said more than 20 police officers were injured.
In Austin, Texas, a man was killed Saturday when someone shot at Black Lives Matters marchers.
According to media reports, the man may have approached the car with a rifle when he was shot at.
US experts called Pompeo the worst Secretary of State in the history of the country
International affairs experts Aaron David Miller and Richard Sokolsky have named Mike Pompeo the worst secretary of state in United States history.
The material with their opinion was published on July 23 by CNN.
"In just two short years, Mike Pompeo - with an eye on the presidency in 2024 and the support of President Donald Trump - has become not only the worst secretary of state in US history, but also the most politically biased," the text says.
Experts accused Pompeo of "politicizing the post of secretary of state and desecrating the institution he runs" in order to advance his personal political agenda and protect Trump "from responsibility and the rule of law."
According to them, the secretary of state, in particular, covers up "Trump's blackmail of Ukraine" and is ready to expose US foreign policy officials for their cooperation with Congress on this case.
In addition, Pompeo was recalled that he was pretty friendly with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammad bin Salman, who took partial responsibility for the murder of The Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashkadzhi.
Trump announced his decision to appoint Mike Pompeo as head of the State Department on March 13, 2018, following the sacking of former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.
Prior to that, Pompeo headed the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
In Tikhoretsk, a foreign car entered the store
Today, July 26, in Tikhoretsk, on Menshikov Street, a Land Cruiser SUV drove at a speed into the sales area of a chain supermarket.
The emergency was recorded by surveillance cameras.
As a result of the accident, a boy was injured, who at that time was in the store.
The child was hospitalized with injuries and cuts.
Showcases and counters were destroyed in the hall of the shopping facility.
Eyewitnesses claim that the driver of the foreign car was intoxicated.
Do you know how many types of flowering plants there are?
A quarter of a million — at least as we know it — a quarter of a million species of flowering plants.
Flowers are a real problem for plants:
they are hard to create,
they require enormous amounts of energy and resources.
Why do plants go to such difficulties?
The answer to this, like many other questions, is sex.
I know what you are thinking when you look at these pictures.
The reason sexual reproduction is so important is that there are many other ways to reproduce plants.
They can be propagated by cuttings; they can fertilize themselves or pollinate themselves.
But it is very important for them to distribute their genes in order to mix them with the genes of other plants so that they can adapt to natural niches.
This is how evolution works.
Plants transmit genetic information through pollen.
Some of you may have seen some of these images before.
As I like to say, every home should have a scanning electron microscope to look at these things.
There are as many different types of pollen as there are flowering plants.
By the way, this can be applied in forensic science and not only.
Basically, the pollen that causes allergies is pollen from plants that use the wind to spread it. This is a very inefficient process, which is why it clogs up so hard in our noses.
Plants have to throw out huge masses of pollen, in the hope that the germ cells, the male germ cells that are contained in the pollen, will somehow accidentally get to another flower, completely by accident.
The pollen of all grasses, and therefore of all crops, and the pollen of most of the trees, is carried by the wind.
However, most species use insects for this. To some extent, this is more reasonable because less pollen is required.
Insects and other species can take pollen and carry it where it is needed.
It is clear that we know the relationship between insects and plants.
This is a symbiotic relationship: be it flies, birds or bees - they all get something in return, and that something is usually nectar.
In some cases, this symbiosis has led to amazing adaptations - for example, the moth-hawk hummingbird is beautiful in its adaptation.
The plant gets its own - the hawk moth spreads pollen elsewhere.
Plants have evolved to create small landing strips in different places for the bees to keep them from getting lost.
Many plants have a coloration that makes them look like insects.
These are the anthers of a lily, cleverly designed so that when an unsuspecting insect lands on them, the anther flips over and hits him on the back, showering a large amount of pollen, with which the insect then goes to another plant.
And here's an orchid that looks like it has jaws. In a sense, she has them, which forces the insect to crawl out, covered with pollen, which it will then spread.
There are at least 20,000 orchid species - and they are all surprisingly diverse.
They go to all kinds of tricks.
They are forced to attract pollinators in order to reproduce.
This orchid is known as Darwin's orchid because it was he who studied it and made an amazing prediction when he saw it. One can see a very long tube of nectar that falls from the orchid.
You can see the middle of the flower: the insect has to stick its proboscis right in the middle and get to the very bottom of this tube to get nectar.
Darwin said, looking at this flower: "I suppose something evolved with him."
And indeed, here is the insect.
Usually its proboscis is collapsed, but in its erect form it looks like this.
You might think that if nectar - so valuable and expensive to produce - attracts so much attention from pollinators, then, as with sex in humans, deception could begin.
The flower may say, “I have some nectar.
Will you drop by? " Here is the plant.
This is the plant that insects adore in South Africa. In the process of evolution, they acquired a long proboscis in order to get nectar from the bottom.
And this is imitation.
This plant imitates the previous one.
And here is the long-probed fly, which did not get a drop of nectar from the fake. Because the mimic plant didn't give her at all. She thought she was going to get something.
But the fly not only did not receive nectar from the fake plant, but also - if you zoom in - in the area of the lower part of the head, grabbed some pollen, which it will transfer to another plant, unless some botanist appears and pin it on a blue cardboard ...
(Laughter) Deception is spreading in the plant kingdom as well.
This flower has black dots: they seem black to us, but for male insects of a certain species, they look like two females, ready for anything.
(Laughter) When an insect gets to this flower and lands on it, it dips itself into pollen, which, of course, will transfer to another plant. If you look through the same scanning electron microscope, which should be in every home, you can observe here a certain three-dimensional arrangement of the pattern.
So it probably even makes the insect feel good, besides looking attractive.
In the electron microscope picture - here is an orchid mimicking an insect - you can see that different parts of this structure have different colors and textures, but insects can perceive them in a completely different way.
This plant has adapted to imitate the shiny metal surface of the body of some beetles.
Under a scanning electron microscope, it can be seen that the surface is very different from the surfaces we were looking at.
Sometimes the whole plant mimics an insect entirely, even from our point of view.
I think it looks like some kind of flying creature.
This is an amazing, amazing flower.
And smart. It's called obsidian.
I call him chitrodian.
For a certain kind of bee, it resembles another very aggressive bee, and it flies up and hits its head many times to drive the "bee" away, and, of course, is covered with pollen.
This plant also mimics another orchid that has a wonderful store of food for insects.
And this one has nothing for them.
So she cheats on two levels - just unheard of.
(Laughter) Here is ylang-ylang, a component of many perfumery products.
I recently smelled someone who smelled it.
In principle, flowers do not need to be so fragrant.
They emit a striking spectrum of odors for any insect with a sense of smell.
This doesn't smell so good.
This is a flower that smells really, really bad, and it has evolved to look like carrion.
Flies like this very much.
They fly in and pollinate.
This one, Helicodiceros, also known as the "lily of the dead horse".
I don't know what a dead horse really smells like, but this one definitely smells very similar.
This is really awful.
And the flies just can't resist.
They fly inside and fly to the very bottom.
There they lay their eggs, thinking that this is a great piece of falling, and not realizing that there is no food for the larvae and the larvae will die, but in the meantime the plant has benefited because the bristles relax and the fly flies away to pollinate the next flower. This is amazing.
Here is arum, arum waste, or in the USA - spotted arum.
I photographed him the previous week in Dorset.
It heats up about 15 degrees above ambient temperature - amazing.
If you look into it from above, then behind the cob you can see something that looks like a dam. The flies are attracted by the heat - the volatiles evaporate - and they get stuck at the bottom of this container.
They drink divine nectar and become sticky.
During the night, they become covered with pollen flowing around them from above, and then the bristles, which we saw above, weaken and release flies covered with pollen. Awesome thing.
If you think this is amazing, then here is one of my favorites.
Philodendron Sello.
Those from Brazil should be aware of this plant.
This is the most amazing thing.
This phallic thing is about 30 centimeters long.
It does something that no other plant I know of does: when it blooms - right in the middle of the ear - for about two days, its metabolism is similar to that of mammals.
Instead of starch, which is food for plants, it takes something similar to brown fat and burns it at such a speed, digests it just like a small cat.
This energy output, in equivalent weight, is twice that of a hummingbird - absolutely amazing.
And it also does something different, also unusual.
It not only warms itself up to 115 Fahrenheit, or 43-44 Celsius, for two days, but it also keeps the temperature constant.
It has a thermoregulatory mechanism that maintains a constant temperature.
You ask: "Why does he do this?"
Well, as if you didn't know that there are beetles that just love to make love at this temperature.
They climb inside, and that's where it starts.
(Laughter) And the plant showered them with pollen, and they went to pollinate.
Surprisingly thought up.
Most of the pollinators we know are insects, but in the tropics, many birds and butterflies also pollinate.
Many tropical flowers are red, and it seems to us that this is because butterflies and birds have a similar vision to ours, and that they see red very well.
But if you look at the spectrum, then a person and a bird see red, green and blue - they see this spectrum.
Insects, on the other hand, see green, blue and ultraviolet light, and they distinguish different shades of ultraviolet light,
which are at this end of the spectrum.
You're probably thinking, "It would be great if we could see them."
Yes we can.
So what does the insect see?
Last week I took these photographs of the Cistus flowers in Dorset.
These are the very little yellow flowers that we see everywhere.
This is how it looks in daylight.
And this is how it looks if you remove the red.
Most bees cannot see red.
Then I put the UV filters on the camera and took a very, very slow shutter speed with certain UV frequencies, and this is what happened.
The most that neither is the "bull's-eye".
Of course, we know exactly what the bees see, no more than you know what I see when I call this red.
We cannot say what is going on in the mind of a neighbor, we do not speak about an insect.
But the picture will be about the same contrast, strongly stand out against the background.
Here is another small flower - a different range of ultraviolet frequencies, different filters, to match the pollinators.
They will see something like this.
In case you think that this applies to all yellow flowers - not a single flower was harmed during the shooting, this one was simply attached to a tripod, not ripped off - when they are in ultraviolet light, then take a look at this one.
By the way, it could serve as the basis for sunscreen, because such creams work by absorbing ultraviolet radiation.
Maybe this connection would be useful.
Finally, here is one of the evening primrose that Bjorn Rorslett from Norway sent me - a fantastic hidden pattern.
I love the idea of something hidden.
I think there is something poetic about it. These photographs were taken with an ultraviolet filter, which is mainly used by astronomers to photograph Venus - actually the clouds of Venus.
This is the main purpose of this filter.
Venus, of course, is the goddess of love and fertility, and this is consonant with flowers.
Flowers not only spend a lot of effort attracting pollinators, they also somehow managed to convince us to plant whole fields of flowers and give them to each other at moments of birth and death, and in particular at a wedding, which, if you think about it, is a moment that personifies transfer of genetic material from one organism to another.
Many thanks.

China's Yangtze River experiences its third flood in a year
After a heavy downpour, the upper reaches of the Yangtze River - China's longest waterway - flooded for the third time in a year.
The flooding was caused by an increase in the water level in the upstream tributaries of the river, which led to a rapid increase in water inflow into the reservoir of the Chinese hydropower plant Sanxia / Three Gorges /.
At 14:00 on July 26, an inflow of 50 thousand cubic meters was observed in the reservoir. m / s, which is expected to reach its maximum on the evening of July 27 - 60 thousand cubic meters. m / s, according to the Yangtze River Water Management Committee under the PRC Ministry of Water Resources.
The committee today issued alerts on floods in one of the sections of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and the overflow of the Sanxia HPP's reservoir.
My job is to help computers make messages about the world around them.
There are many ways to do this, but I love helping computers communicate what they see and understand.
For example, in this picture, a modern computer vision algorithm can recognize that this is a woman, and this is a dog.
He can tell that the woman is smiling.
He is even able to say that the dog is unusually cute.
I am working on this by thinking about how people understand and process data about the world.
What thoughts, memories and stories can this picture evoke in people.
Everything related to similar situations.
You may have seen a similar dog before, or spent time running on the beach in the same way, and this, in turn, brings up thoughts and memories of your past vacation, time on the beach, or time when you were running with others. dogs.
One of my main principles is to help computers understand what it means to have such an experience, to understand what we share, what we believe and how we feel, because then we will be ready to start involving computer technology in processes that complement our own experience.
Digging deeper, a few years ago I started helping computers write stories based on a series of images.
And one day while working, I asked the computer what it thinks about the trip to Australia.
He looked at the pictures and saw a koala.
He did not know what a koala was, but said that he considered her a curious creature.
Then I shared with him a series of images of houses on fire.
He looked at the pictures and said, “Amazing view! Awesome! "
Goose bumps ran down my spine.
He looked at a terrible, life-destroying event and thought it was something positive.
I realized that he recognized contrasts, shades of red and yellow and thought that this deserves a positive assessment.
He did it in part because most of the images I gave him were positive.
Because people tend to share positive images when they share their experiences.
When was the last time you saw a selfie at a funeral?
I realized that by improving the artificial intelligence, task by task, dataset by dataset, I had created huge gaps, holes and gaps in what it could understand.
And in doing this, I have coded all kinds of prejudices.
Biases reflecting a limited vision, limited to a single set of data. Gaps that reflect human biases encoded in the data, such as bias and stereotypes.
I thought about the evolution of technology that led me to where I ended up then - how the first color photographs were calibrated to the skin of white women, which meant that color photographs were not adapted to dark faces.
And the same prejudice, the same gap, was observed in the 90s.
And we still have this same information gap today in how well we can recognize a variety of human faces using face recognition technology.
I thought about the latest research, where we tend to limit our thinking to one set of data and one problem.
And in doing so, we created more and more gaps and biases that AI could develop even more.
I realized that I need to think more about how the technologies we work with today will look like in 5 and 10 years.
Humanity is evolving slowly, over time correcting problems in the interaction of people and the environment.
Artificial intelligence, on the other hand, is evolving at an incredible rate.
And that means it's really important to think about it carefully right now - to reflect on our own gaps, our own biases and how this affects the technologies we create, and discuss what modern technologies will mean in the future.
Top managers and scientists around the world are talking about what they think artificial intelligence will be in the future.
Stephen Hawking warns: "AI can end humanity."
Elon Musk warns that this is one of the greatest existential risks our civilization has ever faced.
Bill Gates wonders: "I don't understand why people are not worried."
But these opinions are only part of the story.
Mathematics, models, fundamental building blocks of artificial intelligence are what we call access and what we work with.
We have open source machine learning and intelligence tools to share.
And beyond that, we can share our experiences.
Share your knowledge about technology, and how it worries us, and how it worries us.
We can discuss what we love.
We can anticipate which aspects of technology can become most useful over time and which ones are most problematic.
If we all focus on open dialogue about AI in the future, it will help create an atmosphere of shared awareness of what AI is now, what it can become, and what we need to do to get the best outcome for us.
We already see and know all this about the technologies used today.
We use smartphones, digital assistants and robotic vacuum cleaners.
Are they evil?
Maybe sometimes.
Are they helpful?
Certainly.
And they are all different.
And in them you already see a ray of light that illuminates our future.
The future begins in what we create and build right now.
We are launching the domino effect that will determine the path of development of the AI.
We are shaping the AI of the future right now.
Technologies that immerse us in augmented reality bring past worlds back to life.
Technologies that help people share experiences when they have difficulty communicating.
Technologies based on understanding streaming visual worlds are being used for self-driving cars.
Technologies based on image comprehension and language generation are turning into technologies that help visually impaired people better access the visual world.
But we also see how technology can lead to problems.
Today we have technology that analyzes our innate physical characteristics - such as skin color or facial features - to determine if we might be criminals or terrorists.
We have technology that analyzes data about us, even data such as gender or race, to determine if we can get credit.
All that we see now is just one frame from the evolution of artificial intelligence.
Because where we are now is just a moment of this evolution.
This means that everything we do today will have an impact on our future.
If we want AI to evolve to help humans, we must define goals and strategies that will set that path now.
I would like to see something that suits people well, blends in with our culture and our environment.
Technologies that help those of us who suffer from neurological or other diseases to make life equally difficult for everyone.
Technology that works no matter your skin color or demographic.
Today I am focused on technologies that will be with us tomorrow and 10 years from now.
AI can be anything.
But in this case, it is not a self-driving car with no final destination.
We drive this car.
We choose when to accelerate and when to slow down.
We choose when we need to turn.
We choose what the AI of the future will be.
There are countless things that artificial intelligence can become.
And it will become a multitude of things.
And our challenge today is to figure out exactly what we need to invest in AI so that the results obtained are the best for all of us.
Thank you

Almost 9.5 thousand cases of CoViD-19 infection were recorded in the Arctic
In the Murmansk region, 158 new cases of coronavirus infection were detected.
In the city of Murmansk, 135 new cases of CoViD-19 infection were recorded.
In total, in the region, the total number of confirmed cases of the new coronavirus infection is 9469.
The head of Dagestan discussed with Khabib Nurmagomedov the construction of several sports facilities.
The head of Dagestan, Vladimir Vasiliev, met with the reigning UFC lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov, the website of the head of the republic reports.
The reason was sports facilities, in the construction of which the late father of the champion, Honored Coach of Russia Abdulmanap Nurmagomedov showed great interest.
We are talking about a sports complex in the village of Dubki, Kazbekovsky district and the Center for sports training in martial arts in the village of Sildi, Tsumadinsky district.
First of all, Vladimir Vasiliev noted that now the construction of these sports facilities is also a tribute to the memory of the great coach.
The father of the kidnapped baby in Salsk revealed the details of the incident
The father of the newborn kidnapped from the maternity hospital in Salsk, Rostov region, disclosed the details of the incident.
Alexander Rusikov told the 360 TV channel that the abductor entered his wife's room when she was about to go to the toilet.
The mother of the kidnapped baby could not even think that a person with malicious intent could be in the hospital.
The woman walked away from the ward literally a couple of meters when she heard the cry of a neighbor.
The baby was no longer in the ward.
According to Rusikov, everything happened between three and four in the morning.
He also said that the wife's ward is located between two medical posts, but at the time of the incident, the nurses were not on the spot.
Also, the father of the kidnapped baby said that there were no comments or apologies from the hospital staff.
Recall that a newborn boy, kidnapped on Saturday from a maternity hospital in Salsk, was found on the same day in the Republic of Kalmykia.
Police detained a 40-year-old kidnapping suspect.
The child has already been returned to the mother.
Doctors took tests from the baby to make sure that he was healthy and not injured.

The expert assessed the role of vitamins in the formation of immunity
Andrey Tyazhelnikov, chief freelance specialist in primary health care for adults of the Moscow Department of Health, assessed the role of vitamins in the formation of immunity.
“It is impossible to create stable immunity by extradoses of some drugs, vitamins or food products in a very short time,” he said in an interview with the radio station “Moscow Says”.
According to him, there are certain rules.
For example, it is better to spend more time outdoors in summer, including under the sun.
Tyazhelnikov also noted that in summer, if possible, you need to consume a large amount of seasonal fresh vegetables and fruits.
"This generally strengthens the immune system, provides a certain supply of vitamins and a certain supply of health," he added.
Earlier Tyazhelnikov named several differences between influenza and coronavirus.
5765 COVID-19 patients registered in Russia per day
In Russia, 5765 new cases of coronavirus infection were detected per day by July 26, according to the stopkoronavirus.ru website, according to the federal operational headquarters.
Over the entire observation period in Russia, 812,485 cases of COVID-19 were recorded.
During the day, 77 people died with confirmed coronavirus, the total number of deaths associated with COVID-19 in Russia reached 13,269.
The number of COVID-19 cases in the world has exceeded 16 million, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
More than 4.1 million of them are in the United States, more than 2.3 million in Brazil.
Russia ranks fourth in the world in the total number of cases, the third - behind India (1.3 million cases).
In total, more than 644,000 people have died from the coronavirus in the world, more than 9.2 million have recovered.
The head of the region Igor Kobzev met with the mayors of the Ust-Orda Buryat District
During the working meeting, which took place today, on July 24, the government of the Irkutsk region discussed the main directions for the development of remote agrarian territories.
During his working trips to the districts of the Ust-Orda Buryat District, the head of the region gave a number of instructions.
Mayors reported on their implementation today.
First of all, the construction of the Sports House in Ust-Orda has been resumed.
The order for this facility was given by the President of the Russian Federation fourteen years ago.
But only now the situation has been moved off the ground.
The construction will cost 866 million rubles.
Completion date of the facility is 2022.
And already this year, a school in the village of Bayandai should be commissioned.
At the moment, the finishing of the premises has been completed.
The remaining work is the improvement of the territory.
In general, the program for the construction of preschool and secondary education facilities is of particular importance for the region.
Especially for your district.
The demographic situation here is the best in the region.
And we are obliged to create all conditions for education and leisure for children of all ages, - said the Acting Governor of the Irkutsk Region Igor Kobzev.
At the meeting, the head of the region instructed all mayors to actively participate in the development of general plans for settlements.
This is one of the main conditions for the integrated development of the district.
All settlements must have established boundaries and a master plan.
This is necessary for the development of the territory, for the construction of socially significant objects, as well as infrastructure and cultural heritage, - said the head of the region.
Also during the conversation, a problematic issue was raised with a 30% reduction in milk intake from cooperatives.
This happened due to the redistribution of milk purchases by the processing enterprise in favor of peasant farms.
Because of this, the share of receiving products from cooperatives has decreased.
The head of the region instructed the acting minister of agriculture to go to the site, study the structure of milk sales, analyze the experience of other territories and identify options for solving the problem.
Kuzminov won two races of the second stage of the SMP RSKG at Igora Drive.
Igora Drive hosted the second race of the second stage of the SMP RSKG Championship.
Pavel Kuzminov won the second consecutive victory.
He started fifth, but on the first lap he took the lead.
Alexander Dudarev, who became the second, rose from the sixth position.
Sergei Tikhomirov lost his position, repulsed the attacks of Alexander Chernyak and at first settled in third place, but received a drive through punishment and after driving through the pitlane dropped out of the fight for the podium.
The third was Ivan Pugachev, who won back five positions.
Moscow region authorities told about the fate of closed landfills
In the Moscow region, solid waste landfills continue to be closed.
This year, the authorities promise to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 existing landfills in the region are being modernized into modern waste processing facilities.
But this option is not possible for every landfill - many of them are overgrown with dense residential buildings.
After the landfill is closed, it gets up for reclamation - the body of the landfill is covered with soils, degassing and drainage systems are installed.
This allows you to stop the chemical processes inside the landfill so that it does not ignite, does not exude stench, and does not poison the soil and groundwater.
And then the former dump is left to rise as a useless heap among the surrounding residential development.
Why not make something useful out of it?
For example, in Ruza, where the reclamation of the "Annino" landfill was completed just a few days ago, the authorities are considering an option to make a ski slope out of a heap.
This landfill, which was operated from 1976 to 2016, has grown so much that it has gone beyond the boundaries of the land allocated for it.
Therefore, during the reclamation, it was necessary to buy out the neighboring plots, de facto, which had long been clogged with garbage to the eyeballs.
"Some time will pass, the test site will" settle down ", the fortresses will accumulate, and we will think what can be done to make it start to be useful.
A ski resort strikes the eye directly, "Nikolai Parfenov, head of the Ruzsky district, told reporters.
Two landfills will become sites for the extraction of renewable energy sources
The Torbeevo landfills in Lyubertsy and the Timokhovo landfills in the Bogorodsky District will become sites for the extraction of renewable energy sources from landfill and biological gases.
By the end of the year, a gas piston power plant will be launched on the Torbeev territory, capable of generating up to 8 million kilowatt-hours of electricity and about 0.95 gigacalories of thermal energy per year, which will meet the landfill's own needs - heat supply for administrative and industrial premises.
Timokhovo will produce 72.5 million kilowatt-hours and will continue to operate as a waste processing complex.
A museum may be set up at the Kuchino training ground in Balashikha, which was closed after residents complained about the Direct Line with the President of the country.
“There was such an idea - to create a museum for reclamation of landfills in the Moscow region,” said Dmitry Kurakin, Deputy Prime Minister - Minister of Ecology and Nature Management of the Region.
Israel reports drone crash in southern Lebanon
An Israeli army unmanned aerial vehicle crashed in southern Lebanon.
The military said it collapsed "during operational activities."
The reasons for the fall of the device are not reported.
"Some time ago, during operational activities near the border with Lebanon, an unmanned aerial vehicle of the Israeli army fell on Lebanese territory.
There is no risk of information leakage, "the Israeli army said on Twitter.
We will remind, this week the Israeli army decided to strengthen its military units on the border with Lebanon, fearing revenge of the Lebanese Hezbollah for the murder of its fighters in Syria.
Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has promised not to leave unanswered the death of any of his "brothers".
Read more about the situation in the Kommersant article "Israel is waiting for Hezbollah's revenge."
Furgal's replacement came out to the protesters for the first time
Acting Governor of the Khabarovsk Territory Mikhail Degtyarev for the first time after his appointment came out to the participants of the actions in support of the arrested ex-head of the region Sergey Furgal.
The meeting was broadcast on his Instagram page.
"Moscow hears everyone, so it sent you an interim so that the region does not slip without power ... I repeat about Furgal: he is" a "- my friend," b "- a fellow party member," c "- I am very worried about his fate, the party is helping him, giving him food, Zhirinovsky knocks on all the offices, "said the acting governor
According to Degtyarev, now the Khabarovsk Territory cannot remain without a leader, therefore, by the decree of President Vladimir Putin, he was appointed head of the region so that "a wonderful building (the regional government) would function, everything worked, the budget was spent on social needs."
The acting governor explained that he had not come out to the protesters earlier because he could not communicate with thousands of protesters.
Therefore, he broadcasts on social networks and reads all comments to them.
On July 25, two consecutive protests took place in Khabarovsk.
Rallies in support of the former governor have been held in the region since July 11.
On the eve of the next rally, Mikhail Degtyarev announced that he would leave the city on the day of the rally.
His motorcade was stopped by protesters and called to speak out about the fate of the arrested ex-governor of Furgal.
Degtyarev previously refused to go out to the participants of the actions.
“There is something really for the head to do, than to go out and communicate with those who are shouting under the windows,” said the acting governor.
Today I would like to show you how we will do different things in the future.
I believe that soon our buildings and machines will self-assemble, reproduce and repair themselves.
So I'm going to show you what I consider to be the current stage of industrial development, and then compare that to some natural systems.
So, at the current stage of industrial development, we have skyscrapers - 2.5 years, from 500,000 to a million parts, quite complex, new amazing technologies in steel, concrete and glass.
We have amazing machines that can take us into space - 5 years, 2.5 million parts.
But on the other hand, if we look at natural systems, we see proteins of two million species that can assemble in 10,000 nanoseconds, or a DNA strand with three billion base pairs that we can copy in about an hour.
So, natural systems, for all their complexity, are extremely efficient, much more efficient than anything we can build, much more complex than anything we can build.
They are much more energy efficient.
They are almost never wrong.
And they can regenerate themselves over a long life.
So there is something very interesting about natural systems.
And if we can bring that to our man-made environment, our way of creating things will have tremendous potential.
And I think the key is self-assembly.
So, if we want to use self-assembly in our physical environment, I think there are four key factors to consider.
First, we need to decipher the complexity of what we want to build - our buildings and cars.
And you need to decompose them into a simple sequence - the basic DNA of construction processes.
Then we need programmable parts that can understand this sequence and use it to fold or rebuild.
We will need some amount of energy that will allow all this to be activated, will make the parts able to assemble according to the program.
And we need some kind of back-up bug fixing system to ensure the successful construction of what we want.
I'm going to show you a few projects that my AmyTe colleagues and I are working on to achieve this self-assembled future.
The first two are MacroBot and DeciBot.
These are projects - large-scale reconfigurable robots - 2.5 and 3.5 meter squirrels.
They have built-in mechanical electrical devices, sensors.
You paint what you need to curl up into, in a sequence of angles - minus 120, minus 120, 0, 0, 120, minus 120 - something like that; a sequence of corners or turns, and you send that sequence down the cord.
Each block receives its own message - minus 120. It turns through this angle, checks if everything is correct and sends the information to its neighbor.
And these are brilliant scientists, engineers, designers who worked on this project.
And I think this actually brings up the question: are other scales possible here?
I mean, thousands of dollars, many man-hours to make this 2.5 meter robot.
Can we actually scale up? Can we really build robotics into every part?
The next project addresses this issue, considers the passive nature, or tries to get modification programmability passively.
But he goes one step further and tries to get the real computation.
At its core, it has the most fundamental building block of computation, the logic element of a digital integrated circuit directly in every part.
This is the NAND element.
You have one tetrahedron - the element that will do all the calculations, and two tetrahedrons for the input.
One for user input is the way you lay the bricks.
Another for information from a previous brick laid.
And then it outputs information in three-dimensional space.
So this means that the user can start moving the bricks in the desired direction.
His calculations are based on what was done earlier and on what you told him to do.
And now he begins to move in three-dimensional space - up or down.
On the left side, [1,1] input equals 0 on output, move down.
On the right side, [0,0] input is 1 output, which means upward movement.
And what's really important is that our structures now contain blueprints for what we want to build.
They contain all the information about what was built.
So this means that we have got some form of self-reproduction.
In this case, I call it self-directed reproduction because the structures contain clear blueprints.
If errors appear, you can replace the part.
All local information is saved so you know how to fix it.
So you can have something that moves and reads information and can transfer it from one part to another.
It is built directly inside, without external control.
The last project I'll show you is called Offset Chains, and this is perhaps the most exciting example of what we have of passive self-assembling systems right now.
It combines reconfiguration and programmability to create a completely passive system.
At the core we have a chain of elements.
All elements are completely identical and offset.
Thus, each chain or each element wants to turn right or left.
And when you build a chain, you are essentially programming it.
You tell each block where it should turn: right or left.
So when you shake the chain, it folds into the configuration you programmed - in this case, into a spiral, or in this case, two cubes next to each other.
So in general you can program any 3D shape - or 1D, 2D - of these completely passive circuits.
So what does this tell us about the future?
I think this tells us that there are new possibilities for self-assembly, replication, repair in our physical structures, buildings, machines.
New programming is possible in these parts.
And from here, you have new possibilities in computing.
We will have spatial computers.
Imagine that our buildings, bridges, cars, all our bricks could do calculations.
This is an amazing parallel and distributed subtraction power, new design possibilities.
This is incredible potential.
I think that the projects that I have shown you are only a small step towards the future, if we introduce these new technologies, towards a new self-assembling future.
Thank you.

The number of deaths from coronavirus in the world exceeded 640 thousand
More than 15.7 million people infected
The number of victims of the coronavirus in the world has exceeded 640 thousand, almost 15.7 million cases of infection have been confirmed.
Such data on Sunday, July 26, leads the World Health Organization (WHO).
According to the information provided, over the past day, 200 625 new cases of coronavirus infection and 4 823 deaths were detected in the world.
For the entire time of the pandemic in the world, 15 785 641 cases of coronavirus infection have already been recorded, and the number of deaths has increased to 640 016.
The leader in the number of infected and dead remains the United States, where more than 4.3 million infected and more than 149 thousand deaths have already been registered.
In second place in the anti-rating is Brazil, where the number of cases at the moment has exceeded 2.4 million, and 86.5 thousand patients with coronavirus have already died.
India is next with 1.4 million infected and almost 33 thousand deaths.
Recall, a day earlier, the number of people infected with coronavirus in the world during the day broke a new record.
In 24 hours, doctors identified 284,196 new cases.
The previous record was 247,225 infected.
what connected the Vatican and Nazi Germany
This week another date - 87 years since the conclusion of the treaty between the Vatican and Nazi Germany.
The document, signed a few months after Hitler came to power, became the basis on which the relations of the Holy See with the Nazis were built.
One of those who prepared the treaty was Cardinal Pacelli, who, 6 years before the outbreak of World War II, became Pontiff Pius XII.
In Sochi, the body of a dump truck crashed onto the cab of a truck, killing the driver.
Footage appeared on the Web showing an accident that occurred last Saturday, July 25, at a construction site in Sochi.
The footage shows how, during unloading operations, the raised body of the dump truck collapsed downward, landing directly in the cab of the truck.
According to the Ministry of Emergency Situations, a 59-year-old man who was driving died on the spot from his injuries.
To retrieve the body of the deceased, the help of rescuers was required.
Beautiful tall minarets only adorned Hagia Sophia
Once again about Hagia Sophia - I came across the text of Father Vladimir Zelinsky, saying that one should protest.
Firstly, there is now free admission - hurray!
I haven’t been to Istanbul, but free admission is better than paid admission to the House of God.
Secondly, Muslims just as honestly conquered this land as the Orthodox conquered the Volga-Oka interfluve, the Muslim Caucasus (and erected a church in Grozny) and planted apple trees on Mars.
God help you!
The Jews conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans conquered America.
Are we going to return everything to everyone?
Do you think there are no pagans who will demand the return of their temple, in the place of which the Church of the Tithes?
Thirdly, the Muslims have improved this building and invested in it.
That is, it is theirs, just like the factories and estates that the Leninists took away from the bourgeoisie as their property, belong to the Leninists - Putin and other nomenclature.
They have improved everything - from the Kremlin to the Angara, so this is all theirs by the right of progressors.
The beautiful tall minarets adorned Hagia Sophia very much, very much.
There was a stupid inkwell, now a stupid inkwell with beautiful minarets.
Fourth, there are no "Islamic" and "Orthodox" civilizations.
There are believers, there are hypocrites, there are bigots who unite faith and hypocrisy.
A believer does not think in terms of civilization.
This is the thinking of the British Foreign Office official Toynbee, a believer is ashamed to think so.
And for the believer, the place of prayer is everywhere.
And always.
The believer does not pray only where he is asked to leave - he retires to another place and prays there.
He is a believer, not a defender.
We are koloboks, not gloomy stones.
The working week in St. Petersburg will begin with warm and dry weather
On Monday, July 27, it will be slightly cloudy in St. Petersburg, no precipitation is expected.
This was reported in the press service of the Ministry of Emergency Situations in the city with reference to the forecast of the North-West Directorate for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring.
Variable winds at a speed of 1-4 meters per second are expected at night.
In the afternoon, the southeast wind at a speed of 2-7 meters per second.
The air temperature at night will be +13 ... + 15 degrees.
During the day it will get warmer up to +24 ... + 26 degrees.
Atmospheric pressure will rise throughout the day.
During the broadcast of the parade on Navy Day, the camera "passed under the ship"
Also on Victory Day, the camera flew through the muzzle of the tank.
Today, July 26, a parade in honor of the Day of the Navy is being held in St. Petersburg.
During the filming, one of the cameras filming the equipment "passed under the ship."
The use of new filming technology allowed viewers to see the underwater part of the parade.
The movement of the newest serial small rocket ship Sovetsk was shown from the same perspective.
It passed along the Admiralteyskaya embankment.
Recall that at the parade on June 24, dedicated to the 75th anniversary of the Victory, the camera went through the barrel into the turret of one of the tanks and showed what equipment is inside the grandiose military vehicle.
Then a record number of military equipment took part in the anniversary parade of Victory - 234 combat vehicles.
They showed numb new products that left for the main square of the country for the first time, for example, the modernized main battle tanks T-90M and T-80BVM.
The updated BMP-2M infantry fighting vehicles with the Berezhok combat module also passed through Red Square on June 24 for the first time.
Almost half of Britons believe in Kremlin interference in Brexit referendum
Almost half of Britons - 49% - believe that Russia tried to influence the course of the 2016 referendum on Britain's exit from the European Union.
The Guardian newspaper writes about this with reference to the results of a survey conducted by Opinium.
It is reported that 23% of those surveyed hold the opposite opinion on this issue.
47% of respondents also believe the Kremlin intervened in the last 2019 UK general election.
July will leave with heat, August will start with coolness
Over the weekend, Moscow and the region experienced the coldest night in July.
No chilling apocalypse of frost, of course, happened.
But it's chilly for the top of summer.
Before telling about the weather in Moscow on July 27 - August 2, 2020, it is worth noting that on the night of Saturday, July 25, the air in the capital cooled to +8.8 degrees.
In Kolomna, a new temperature record has even been set: +7 degrees (the previous minimum for July 25 was held since 1964, for more than half a century).
Cherusti became a cold pole near Moscow - there the thermometers showed +3.9 degrees.
However, in the afternoon both Saturday and Sunday were quite comfortable.
Although, compared to climatic norms, it is still 2 - 3 degrees cooler.
On weekdays, not just warmth will return to Moscow, but real heat.
On Monday, July 27, the Hydrometeorological Center of Russia promises +26 degrees, on Tuesday and Wednesday +28 ... + 29, on Thursday, July 30, +26 degrees.
Short showers - every day, in the middle of the week with thunderstorms.
The last day of July and the first days of August (that is, the next weekend) will be cool, not higher than +19 ... + 24 degrees.
And it will not do without precipitation.
A native of Rwanda admitted that he set fire to the cathedral in Nantes
A native of Rwanda, who worked in the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul in the French city of Nantes on a volunteer basis, confessed to setting it on fire a week after the fire.
This was reported on Sunday by the France-3 TV channel.
According to him, the man, who had already been detained on July 19, the day after the fire, was detained again the day before.
On Saturday night, he appeared before an investigating judge.
After being accused of deliberately damaging property, the man confessed to having organized arson in three places - under a large organ, under a small organ and near the electrical panel.
Now he faces up to 10 years in prison and a € 150,000 fine.
The motives behind the actions of the 39-year-old native of Rwanda have not yet been reported.
It is only known that he volunteered to help in the cathedral and on the day of the fire had to close its doors.
However, according to CCTV footage, he left the religious institution 15 minutes after receiving calls about a fire in the building.
The fire in the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul took place on 18 July.
More than 200 firefighters fought for several hours for the monument of Gothic architecture.
However, they failed to save the stained glass windows from the time of Louis XII and the unique organ of the Baroque period.
The situation was brought under control only three hours after the start of the fire.
Nobody was hurt as a result of the accident.
The current fire is not the first in the history of the temple.
In 1972, a fire destroyed its roof.
It took 13 years to eliminate the consequences of that fire.
The cathedral was reopened for parishioners only in 1985.
The legendary travel goalkeeper Pfannenstil can become Inter's scout.
Former German goalkeeper Lutz Pfannenstil may enter Inter's headquarters.
According to Kicker, the 47-year-old specialist was offered the position of head of the scouting department.
Pfannenstiel held a similar position at Fortuna Düsseldorf from December 2018 to May 2020, and before that worked at Hoffenheim.
When he was a football player, Pfannenstil became famous for his frequent transitions.
He is the only professional player to have played in all six FIFA confederations, has changed more than 20 clubs, among which were representatives of the championships of Singapore, South Africa, New Zealand, Canada, Namibia and several other countries.
It is believed that only sighted people can drive a car.
Until recently, it was believed that safe and independent driving was an impossible task for the blind.
Hello, I am Denis Hong and we give the blind freedom and independence by developing cars for the visually impaired.
Before I talk about this vehicle for the blind, I will briefly talk about another project I was working on called the DARPA Urban Challenge.
The project was to create a self-driving robot car.
The driver presses "start", and without his participation, the car reaches its destination.
In 2007, our team won half a million dollars, finishing third in this competition.
Around the same time, the National Federation of the Blind, or NSF, challenged a research committee to develop a vehicle that could be independently and safely driven by a blind person.
We decided to try our hand because we thought: “Hey, what's so hard about that?
We already have an autonomous car.
We put a blind man in it - and the business is over, right? "
(Laughter) But we were deeply mistaken.
The NSF wanted to get not just a car that would transport the blind, but a car that a blind person could drive independently.
Therefore, we had to reject everything and start from scratch.
So, to test this crazy idea, we developed a small prototype of a buggy car to test the feasibility of the project.
And in the summer of 2009, we invited blind youth from all over the country and gave them the opportunity to test this car.
It was an amazing experience.
But the catch is that this car was designed to be driven in a tightly controlled environment, namely a flat, enclosed parking lot, where even lanes are delimited by red signal cones.
With this success, we decided to take the next big step and develop a real car that could be driven on real roads.
So how does it work?
Well, this is a rather complex system, but let me clarify, perhaps even simplify it.
So, it includes three components.
These are tactile perception, computation and non-visual interfaces.
Since the driver cannot see anything, the system must perceive the environment and collect information for the driver.
For this, the original parameter meter is used.
It measures acceleration, angular acceleration, like a person's inner ear.
This information is then transmitted to the GPS device to estimate the vehicle's location.
Two cameras are used to detect lane on the road
and three laser rangefinders.
Lasers scan the area around the car to detect various objects: an approaching oncoming or overtaking car, any obstacles encountered on the road or around the car.
Then all this huge amount of information is fed into the computer, and the computer goes through two stages.
First of all, this is the processing of this information to get an idea of the space: determining the lanes on the road, identifying obstacles, and then bringing this information to the driver.
The system is also smart enough to figure out the safest way to drive.
So, we can also give advice on how to operate the machine.
But the problem is how to get this information and instructions to a blind person who does not have the quick and accurate response needed to drive?
For this purpose, we have developed a number of interface technologies for the blind:
3D ping sound system, vibrating vest, steering wheel with beeps, special prosthetic leg, and even shoes that put pressure on the leg.
But today we will only talk about three kinds of these special interfaces.
The first interface is called DriveGrip.
This is a pair of gloves with motorized knuckles, instructing the driver how to steer: direction and steering angle.
Another device is the SpeedStrip.
It is originally a massage chair.
It was dismantled and the vibrating elements were rearranged in it. Vibration is used to provide speed information to the driver and to guide the use of the accelerator and brake pedals.
So, here you can see how the computer perceives the space around the car. And since vibration cannot be seen, red LEDs are installed on the driver to demonstrate the process.
This is sensory data, it is transmitted to devices by means of a computer.
DriveGrip and SpeedStrip are very efficient.
But the problem is that these are educational prompting devices.
They don't actually give freedom of control, do they?
The on-board computer gives the driver commands: "left", "right", "speed up", "stop".
We call him the "annoying backseat passenger".
Therefore, we are moving away from educational prompting devices and focusing our attention on informing devices.
AirPix is a great example of such an interface.
This is a kind of monitor for the blind.
A small panel with many openings through which compressed air exits, thereby creating images.
A blind person can bring a palm to this panel and "see" traffic lanes and obstacles on the roadway.
Also, the driver can change the frequency with which the air comes out and, possibly, the air temperature.
Those. it is an interface for displaying multidimensional data.
So, here you see the left and right cameras of the car, and how the computer processes and sends this information to the AirPix panel.
Here we demonstrate a simulator where a blind person drives a car using AirPix.
This simulator has proven to be very useful for training blind drivers as well as for quickly testing ideas for using different kinds of special interfaces.
This is, in a nutshell, how this system works.
After all, this is a prototype of a car for the blind. And he will not be released onto the roadway until they are convinced of his absolute safety.
And I sincerely believe that this is very likely.
Still, will society accept such a radical idea?
How much will the auto insurance rules change?
Under what conditions will a driver's license be issued?
Beyond the technological challenges, there are so many pitfalls that must be overcome before this becomes a reality.
Of course, the main goal of this project is to develop a vehicle for the blind.
However, it is possible that the spin-off technologies developed during this project will prove to be an invaluable contribution to our lives.
Our sensors work regardless of the time of day, fog and rain.
We can use these technologies together with new custom interfaces to improve vehicle safety for the sighted.
Or for the blind. Find their use in everyday household appliances, in educational institutions, in offices.
Just imagine: a teacher in a class is writing on a blackboard and a blind student can see and read what is written using these special interfaces.
It's priceless.
Therefore, what I have shown you today is just the beginning.
Many thanks.
(Applause)
The second trailer for "Bill and Ted" with Keanu Reeves released
Orion Pictures' YouTube channel has released the second trailer for the third installment of the Bill & Ted franchise.
The trailer reveals some of the details of the current life of bosom friends: they settled in a suburban area, are married to their girlfriends Joanna (Jaime Mays) and Elizabeth (Erinn Hayes) from "The Incredible Adventures of Bill and Ted" (1989), moreover, restless adventure seekers already have been raising their daughters for a long time.
Brigitte Lundy-Payne ("The Glass Castle", "Atypical") plays Billy, Ted's daughter, and Samara Weaving ("I'm Going To Search") plays Thea, Bill's daughter (yes, Bill and Ted named their daughters Billy and Thea, this is pun).
On top of that, another great adventure awaits them: they must get into the future in order to steal their own song from themselves - only in this way can they save the whole world.
The trailer also features American rapper Kid Cudi and William Sadler (August Rush, Contrary to Death, Green Mile) reprising Death.
The film was originally scheduled to be released on August 21, but the date was pushed back to September 1.
It is reported that the creators do not plan to re-postpone the release date of the film.
The painting will also be immediately available online.
Earlier we wrote that Keanu Reeves will become a screenwriter for comics about the demigod Berserker.
I want you to think for a second that almost all of our knowledge of the universe comes from light.
We are standing on Earth and with the naked eye we see stars in the night sky.
The bright sun can burn the retina of the eye,
but we see the same light in the reflection of the moon.
Since the time of Galileo, who observed celestial bodies through his primitive telescope, we have contemplated the universe thanks to the light passing through the boundless centuries of cosmic history.
With the help of modern telescopes, we have been able to put together a stunning silent film about the universe, covering our entire history up to the Big Bang.
However, this movie is not at all devoid of sound, because the universe is not silent.
I want to prove to you that the Universe has its own sound track, and it is "reproduced" by the cosmos itself, because outer space vibrates like a drum.
It carries peculiar sounds that accompany the brightest events as they happen.
Today we would like to complement the luxurious visual image of the universe that we have with a soundtrack.
Until now, we have never heard sounds from space, but in the near future we should carefully listen to what is happening there.
So, in order to record the "song" of the Universe, we focused on black holes as the most promising objects, because they "beat" in space-time like a bell, and give a characteristic sound. Now you will hear how we think this song will sound.
Maybe one day we will see the shadow that the black hole casts when it appears against a bright background, but so far we have not seen this.
However, a black hole, albeit invisible, can be heard as it “hits” space-time like a drum.
The suggestion that the cosmos is like the membrane of a drum belongs to Albert Einstein, to whom we owe so much.
Einstein concluded that if space were empty, if the universe were empty, it would look like this picture, except, of course, such a visual grid.
If we fell freely through space, even without a convenient coordinate grid, mentally we ourselves could depict it, since we would notice that we are moving in a straight line, strictly in a straight line through the universe.
Einstein also understood - and this is the very essence - that if you put energy or mass into the universe, it will lead to a curvature of space, and a freely falling object will bend around, for example, the Sun, deviating along natural curves in space.
This was Einstein's great general theory of relativity.
Even light bends along this path.
The deflection can be so strong that the object will simply fall into orbit and revolve around the Sun like the Earth, or like the Moon around the Earth.
These are natural curvatures in space.
But Einstein did not understand this - if you take our Sun and compress it to 6 kilometers in diameter, that is, a mass 1 million times heavier than the Earth to fit in an object 6 km in diameter, then you get a black hole, so dense that it passed too close to her light will never break out. Dark shadow in the universe.
However, he always considered black holes to be just a mathematical curiosity.
Einstein did not believe they existed in reality.
He believed that nature should itself protect us from their appearance.
Decades passed before the term "black hole" was invented, and people realized that they are real astrophysical objects - in fact, they are very massive stars in a posthumous state, disastrously destroyed at the end of their life cycle.
Our Sun will not turn into a black hole.
Its mass is not enough for this.
But we’ll do a little thought experiment — Einstein loved them very much — and imagine the sun contracting to 6 kilometers in diameter, and a tiny Earth revolving around it, about 30 kilometers from the sun's black hole.
This Earth is shining, the Sun is no longer there, as well as another source of light, so we will make our little Earth self-luminous.
It turns out that we can put the Earth in a very close orbit, just 30 km from this black hole.
It is not much larger than Manhattan in size.
Perhaps she would have hooked a little on the Hudson before destroying the Earth.
But the scale is something like this.
We're talking about a facility that would occupy about 1/2 the area of Manhattan.
So, placing this Earth very close - only 30 km - we will notice that it perfectly revolves around the black hole.
It's a kind of myth that black holes absorb everything indiscriminately - to get into it, you have to get very close.
But what is amazing is that from our vantage point, we will see the Earth all the time.
She cannot hide behind a black hole.
Part of the light that the Earth emits is absorbed by the hole, but part of it, as it were, bends around it and returns back to us.
So that nothing can be hidden behind a black hole.
If you suddenly find yourself in the series "Battlestar Galactica", and will fight with the Cylon, do not hide behind a black hole.
They will see you!
Our Sun will not turn into a black hole - it is not massive enough for that. But there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
And if one of them obscured the Milky Way, this is what it would look like.
We would see the shadow of a black hole amid hundreds of billions of stars and glowing dust.
If we were on the verge of falling into this black hole, we would see all this light enveloping it, and even entering this shadow, we would not notice the imminent catastrophe.
It would be useless to start the engines and try to get out, because nothing, including the light, can escape from it.
Although the black hole looks like this from the outside, it is not dark inside, since all the light falls into it with us.
According to the relativistic effect known as time dilation, our clocks would seem to slow down in relation to general galactic time, but we, on the contrary, would see the evolution of a galaxy at an accelerated rate a moment before its death inside a black hole.
It would be like a near-death experience, where you see the light at the end of the tunnel, but not "near", but absolutely mortal.
(Laughter) And you can't tell anyone about the light at the end of the tunnel.
Scientists have not yet been able to see the shadow of a black hole, but we can hear it, albeit invisible.
Imagine a real astrophysical situation - two black holes that have lived together for a long time.
They may have been stars at first and then turned into black holes. Each of them is 10 times heavier than the Sun.
Let's compress them up to 60 km in diameter.
They can rotate rapidly: hundreds of revolutions per second.
At the end of their life cycle, they revolve around each other at almost the speed of light.
They cover thousands of kilometers in a split second, and not only thus bend space, but also leave a trail behind them: they cause fluctuations, a wave trail in space-time.
Space contracts and stretches, freeing itself from these black holes that oscillate in the universe.
And they travel through space at the speed of light.
This computer simulation was done by Goddard's group at NASA, which studies the theory of relativity.
For almost 30 years, scientists around the world have been struggling with this problem.
It was one of the groups.
You see two black holes orbiting each other - and again the curves are graphically depicted here.
If you see - it turned out a little pale - they emit red waves, gravitational waves.
These are the sounds of vibrating space, and they will emanate from these black holes at the speed of light as they calm down and merge into one spinning, silent black hole - such is the outcome.
If you were close enough, your ear would resonate as the space contracts and stretches.
You would actually hear the sound.
Of course, your head would also contract and stretch, so it would be difficult for you to understand what is going on.
But I would like to play this sound to you as we predict it.
This is the work of my group, so the graphics are more modest here.
Imagine a light black hole falling into a very heavy one.
The sound you hear makes a slight hole, arching the space, approaching the end step by step.
If it is removed, the sound becomes quieter.
But it is like a hammer striking a space that vibrates like a membrane.
And we can predict what that sound will be.
We know that as the hole is absorbed, it gets faster and louder.
At the end, we will hear a small hole just fall into a large one.
I have never heard the recording so loudly - really, quite impressive.
At home it turns out much more modest.
Just quiet clicks.
This is a different sound created by my group.
I am not showing you a picture here, since black holes leave no obvious traces behind them, there are no visible curves in space.
If you went on a space cruise and heard such a sound, I would recommend leaving as soon as possible.
(Laughter) Get away from that sound.
Both black holes are moving.
They are getting closer to each other.
In this case, they both fluctuate greatly.
And now there will be a merger.
This "chirping" is very characteristic of merging black holes, this is the acceleration at the end.
We assume that it would sound like that.
Fortunately, we are now at a safe distance in Long Beach, California.
Surely, somewhere in the universe, two black holes are merging.
And without a doubt, the space around us vibrates, and these vibrations may have passed millions of light years, that is, a million years moved towards us at the speed of light.
But the sound is too quiet, we cannot hear it.
There is a very complex project today: LIGO (Laser-interferometric gravitational-wave observatory) - it tracks deviations in space oscillations, the smallest ones - by the size of an atomic nucleus at 4 kilometers.
This is an extremely ambitious experiment, and in the next few years it will be devoted to capturing such waves.
One space program is also planned and will hopefully be launched in the next 10 years: LIKA (Laser Interferometric Space Antenna).
She will be able to see super-heavy black holes, millions and billions of times more massive than the Sun.
In this image from the Hubble telescope, we see two galaxies.
They look like they are frozen in some kind of "embrace"
and each of them probably contains a superheavy black hole in its core.
But they didn't freeze. In fact, they merge.
These two black holes collide, and it will last for over a billion years.
It is beyond our perception to hear a song of such length.
But LIKA can see the end of the merger of two super-heavy black holes, which began a long time ago: the last 15 minutes of this action.
We are not only talking about black holes, but also about any serious troubles in the universe, and the most important of them is the Big Bang.
When this expression was invented, it was ironic - "they say, who will believe in the Big Bang?"
This animation from a friend of mine at Proton Studios shows the Big Bang from the outside.
Any observer would like to be inside at this moment, because it is impossible to be outside the universe.
Imagine that you are inside the Big Bang.
It is everywhere, around you, and space vibrates chaotically.
Already 14 billion years have passed, and this song still sounds around us.
Galaxies are born, and in them - generations of stellar forms. And around one star, at least one, there is an inhabited planet.
And here we are persistently carrying out these experiments, making calculations, writing programs.
Imagine - a billion years ago, two black holes collided.
All this time, their song sounds in space.
We haven't even been born yet.
The sound is getting closer, closer and closer - 40 thousand years ago, we are still making rock paintings.
If we were going to “hear” the Big Bang, it would sound like this.
Noise in its purest form.
This is white noise, just chaotic sounds.
But he probably surrounds us everywhere, if he was not drowned out by some other processes in the universe.
And if we catch it, it will be the most pleasant music for us, because it is a quiet echo of the moment of our creation, the birth of the observable Universe.
Over the next few years, we will be able to turn up the volume a little, and we will hear the universe in sound.
But if we catch the echo of those early events, it will take us much closer to understanding the Big Bang, and this will already allow us to ask some of the most difficult, elusive questions.
Scrolling the film about our universe backwards, we learn that there was a Big Bang in the past, and maybe we even hear its cacophony, but was this explosion the only one?
I mean, hasn't it happened before?
Will it happen again?
In the spirit of TED calling us to regain our faith in miracles, we can now ask questions that have always eluded us.
But we must ask: is it possible that our universe is just a trace of some more significant history?
Or - aren't we just one branch of the multiverse - each with its own Big Bang in the past? Maybe with black holes and their "songs", or without them, maybe with intelligent life, and perhaps without - they are not in our past, not in our future, but are somehow connected with us?
We ask - in such a multiverse, in its other branches, is there life there?
Here are my brethren in the multiverse.
But are there other creatures out there who think about us, and about their origin?
And, if they exist, I can imagine them doing calculations, like us, building instruments, trying to detect that faint sound of the moment of their creation, and thinking - who else is there besides us?
Thank you. Thank you.
(Applause)
Minneapolis residents create squads to patrol the streets
The Wall Street Journal reports: In Minneapolis, troops are being set up to patrol the streets.
Local residents want to help law enforcement officers.
Some of the vigilantes have weapons with them.
Armed citizens assure: they will not open fire, this is possible only in case of emergency.
According to journalists, the creation of patrols is associated with a reduction in the police budget.
Law enforcement agencies will receive $ 10 million less per year (this amount may be reduced).
The previous budget for law enforcement is $ 193 million.
This decision was made by the city council of Minneapolis in connection with the death of George Floyd and rallies against police brutality over the past two months.

Earlier, Dynamo Moscow presented the form for the next season.
City and Real Madrid will be able to host the second leg of the Champions League round of 16 in Manchester
The British newspaper The Guardian reports that Manchester City and Real Madrid will still be able to play the second leg of the Champions League 1/8 finals in Manchester at the Etihad stadium on 7 August.
Yesterday, July 25, the government of the United Kingdom passed a decree that all persons arriving in the UK from Spain are required to undergo a 14-day quarantine due to a new outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.
For Real Madrid, however, an exception will be made.
The possibility of easing quarantine norms for sports teams and film crews of cinema was previously announced by Secretary of the British Ministry of Culture Oliver Dowden.
In February, Real Madrid lost 1: 2 to Manchester City at home.
The return match is scheduled for August 7th.
The presidents of Russia and Ukraine discussed the implementation of the ceasefire in Donbass
Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy discussed the implementation of the armistice agreements in Donbass reached during the Normandy Summit in December 2019, the press service of the Kremlin and the office of the President of Ukraine reported.
The telephone conversation between Vladimir Putin and Vladimir Zelensky took place at the initiative of the Ukrainian side, according to the Kremlin press service.
The interlocutors welcomed the agreement reached on July 22 at a meeting of the Minsk Contact Group on a full and comprehensive ceasefire in Donbas, which starts at 00:01 on July 27, 2020; The Russian President supported this agreement.
The leaders agreed on the need to urgently implement additional measures to support the ceasefire in Donbas.
At the same time, Putin criticized the resolution adopted by the Verkhovna Rada on July 15 on organizing local elections in the fall, which, according to the Russian side, ignores the Minsk agreement.
The situation in connection with the coronavirus pandemic was also discussed.
The July 22 agreement provides for a complete renunciation of any military action, including reconnaissance, the dispatch of sabotage and reconnaissance groups and sniper warfare.
Tinkov showed a video of bone marrow transplant
Russian entrepreneur, founder of the Tinkoff group, Oleg Tinkov, published a video in which he described how he had a bone marrow transplant.
Let us remind you that the businessman is fighting leukemia.
On the recording, a businessman is lying in the ward, bone marrow is transplanted using a dropper.
Tinkov noted that the donor material is collected in the same way.
"The skull is not cut open," he added.
Judging by his posture during the operation, he feels comfortable and relaxed.
A girl from Germany became its donor.
The businessman expressed regret that there are only 130 thousand bone marrow donors in Russia, while there are about 8 million in Germany.
Bone marrow transplantation to Oleg Tinkou was performed in a London clinic.
It became known about the destruction of the Russian "Shell" in Ethiopia
Two Russian-made Pantsir-C1 anti-aircraft missile and cannon systems, which were in service with the Ethiopian army, were destroyed.
This became known to the Voenniy Obozrevatel Telegram channel on Sunday, July 26.
According to the canal, two of the vehicles that secured the safety of the Hydase hydroelectric power station on the Blue Nile River were disabled by lightning.
Other details of the incident were not provided.
In May, the Turkish agency Anadolu reported the destruction of nine Russian-made Pantsir-C1 air defense missile systems in Libya.
They belonged to the forces of the commander of the Libyan National Army (LNA) Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar and were destroyed with the help of the Turkish operational-tactical multipurpose unmanned aerial systems Bayraktar TB2.
Then Defense Express called the incident "a real genocide."
Another "Pantsir-C1" in Libya was destroyed by an attack drone in early July.
1,500 people evacuated in Warsaw due to bomb
About 1.5 thousand inhabitants of Warsaw are evacuated because of the bomb found during the construction of the metro, RIA Novosti reports with reference to the representative of the capital's mayor's office Karolina Galetskaya.
She said that an unexploded ordnance weighing 250 kg and a length of about 2 m was found at the construction of the second metro line in the area of Bazilianska Street in Warsaw's Brody district.
In this regard, about 1.5 thousand people are being evacuated from eight adjacent quarters.
Only after that the sappers will start working.
Lokomotiv is close to signing a contract with a footballer of the Belarusian national team
The forward of Shakhtar Soligorsk and the Belarusian national football team Vitaly Lisakovich is preparing to move to Lokomotiv Moscow.
According to the source, the 22-year-old footballer will soon undergo a medical examination for Lokomotiv, after which he will sign a four-year contract.
Lisakovich scored nine goals in 18 matches this season of the Belarusian championship.
He has five games for the Belarusian national team, in which he never scored.
Earlier, the media called Miranchuk's wishes for a contract with Serie A.
Putin spoke with Shoigu in the cabin:
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke with Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Commander-in-Chief of the Navy Nikolai Evmenov.
The corresponding footage on Sunday, July 26, was published by the journalists of the Kremlin pool RIA Novosti in their Telegram channel.
A short meeting took place in the cabin of the boat, in which the head of state, together with Shoigu and Evmenov, was heading to the parade line of ships in the Gulf of Finland before the parade timed to coincide with the Day of the Russian Navy.
They exchanged a couple of phrases while sitting at the table.
Earlier it was reported that Putin arrived in Kronstadt to participate in ceremonies.
From there, the president went to St. Petersburg, where he was supposed to receive a festive parade.
On July 26, parades are held throughout Russia to mark the Day of the Navy.
The main naval parade takes place in St. Petersburg.
More than 4 thousand military personnel, 46 ships, submarines and boats, as well as naval aviation are involved in it.
In one of the Tyumen publics there was an appeal to take part in the action "Buy from grandmother".
The organizers urge to buy vegetables, flowers and berries from grannies, which they have grown in their gardens, and not to bargain.
The author of the post even gave an example, indicating the specific address where the grandmother sells cherries.
But Tyumen residents suddenly burst into angry comments.
I myself saw how a merchant from neighboring countries immediately approached this grandmother and gave a new portion of goods "from grandmother's garden" for sale.
Look carefully what you are buying !!! - Nadezhda Grigorieva shared her observations.
More than once I saw when greens were taken from traders from neighboring countries and sold.
There is no trust, - Larisa Kharlamova agreed.
It's been a long time already, I see, Granny Victoria has "shine", but in our garden she hasn't been ugly, I ask: "Is this from your garden?"
"- Yes!"
I bought it, the taste of a rag, well, not a fresh vegetable garden, then I look at these "yes" on every corner, my grandmother deceived me, she took it from someone for implementation, - Tatyana Krasilnikova told about her experience.

the decision to expand the RPL would not be supported by either UEFA or FIFA
President of the Russian Football Union (RFU) Alexander Dyukov believes that expanding the Russian Premier League (RPL) to 18 teams is currently wrong.

This violates the integrity of the tournament and the sporting principle.
And, of course, this decision would not have been supported by either UEFA or FIFA, "Dyukov said after the Russian Cup final, Zenit - Khimki (1: 0).

On the set, I gave him compliments: "Oh!
Kobe, scored well, great pass!
Listening to my enthusiastic responses, he a little bit forgot that he had to take the ball in his hands again and score another 3 - 4 points.
We communicated well with Kobe ", - quotes the words of Kirilenko" Evening Moscow ".
He also talked about his first game against Jordan.
"I took care of him.
The first three minutes of the match, I ran in complete admiration of the fact that next to me was a legend that I saw only on TV.
While I was breathless with joy in my goiter, Michael scored a lot of points.
Soon I moved away from the delight, covered his throws a couple of times ...
In that game, my team won, but Jordan still scored 44 points, "added the head of the RFB.

Russian TV series actor responded to accusations of "propaganda of LGBT and feminism"
The actor of the Russian TV series "Chiki", whose creators were accused of "propaganda of LGBT and feminism," responded to the claims about the film.
The authors "understood the severity of the topics raised and did not want to offend anyone," said American Stephen Thomas Ochsner in an interview with the Rise.
“It seems to me that this is a story about the strength and general aspects of human life.
It has nothing to do with LGBT and feminism, "said the actor, who played the boy's father, who dressed in women's clothes.
He stressed that he is "proud of the work" and does not consider it propaganda.
At the same time, the American added, he is frightened by the reaction of some people to the plot line of the series: for example, there was a case when "a man in a deep drunkenness shot the set and said that all this was not true."
“Then there were a couple of cases when we met disgruntled locals who did not understand what we were doing.
But we were open, so people who first came with complaints began to help us, "he summed up.
The shooting incident, the newspaper explains, took place in September 2019 in Kabardino-Balkaria: a drunk man attacked the car of a film crew with a weapon, after which he was detained by police officers.

Also, the Ombudsman was outraged by the fact that "the series paid a lot of attention to the homosexual sexual orientation" of the minor character.
Comedy drama "Chiki" tells the story of three prostitutes who started a new life and opened a business on the advice of a friend.
