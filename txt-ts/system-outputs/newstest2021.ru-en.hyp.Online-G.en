The acting governor of the Khabarovsk Territory, Mikhail Degtyarev, called in an interview with Komsomolskaya Pravda columnist Alexander Gamov not to demonize Khabarovsk residents against the background of rallies in support of the arrested ex-head of the region, Sergei Furgal.
I want to appeal to all political commentators, political scientists, participants of all sorts of talk shows.
Do not demonize the people of the Khabarovsk Territory.
Hardworking and wonderful people live here, " Mikhail Degtyarev shared.

Previously the site KP.ru I reported that Mikhail Degtyarev called for an open trial of Sergei Furgal and considers it fair to hold it in Khabarovsk.
In two Mexican states, an alert was issued due to Hurricane Hanna"
The Mexican National Civil Defense Administration has declared an "orange" (high) alert level in the two eastern states of Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon due to the approaching hurricane Hanna, TASS reports.
The hurricane will bring heavy downpours to Mexico, with 150 to 250 liters of precipitation per square meter predicted in some areas.
The authorities have prepared about 800 shelters for the population.
10 thousand people, including rescuers, soldiers of the National Guard and the military, will provide assistance to people.
At the moment, the hurricane reached the coast of the US state of Texas with a wind speed of 150 km/h.
The Hanna is expected to arrive in Mexico on Sunday morning.
Semilarski v. Prosecutor's office: the appeal of the former vice-mayor of Tartu will be considered on August 4
This means that a decision on it is likely to be made in early September.
The courts of the first two instances refused to consider Semilarski's claim, but in April his appeal was accepted by the State Court.
On 12 December 2019, the Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the applicant, as its resolution is not within the competence of the administrative court.
The court's decision stated that the complaint contains a claim for compensation for damage caused in the course of criminal proceedings.
"It is up to the Prosecutor's Office and the county Court to regulate such matters," Anette Kreitsmann, a spokeswoman for the Tartu Courts, told ERR earlier.
According to her, Valvo Semilarski appealed this decision to the district court, which on February 5 did not change the decision of the court of first instance.
Now the State Court will have to say its word.
According to Semilarski's defense lawyer, juror Oliver Nyas, his client was unreasonably under suspicion of bribery for about two years.
Now he demands from the prosecutor's office to refute the incorrect statements in his address and compensate him for moral damage.
The reason for filing a complaint to the court was the statements of the Prosecutor for Special Cases of the District Prosecutor's Office of Liuna, Margus Gross, made by him in October 2017, when Semilarski, along with another Vice-mayor of Tartu at that time, Artem Suvorov, was detained on suspicion of committing several crimes.
"We remind you that when I was detained, the Security Police and the Prosecutor's Office immediately organized a press conference and informed the entire Republic of Estonia that the leaders of Tartu - one of the most influential local government bodies - are corrupt.
These public suspicions that hung in the air accompanied me for about two years.
And now that these allegations and suspicions have turned out to be false, the prosecutor's office does not want to say anything about it, " Semilarski commented in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Nyas, at the press conference, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework in which the prosecutor's office should act.
"The allegation of bribery and corruption turned out to be false, but this is not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its rulings on Russia, as well as on Lithuania, that at the stage of the investigation, state representatives should be careful when choosing words, so that suspects would not be presented as criminals before sentencing.
The prosecutor's office is also obliged by the presumption of innocence, which, unfortunately, was not observed in this case against Valvo Semilarski," said the Nnec.
"The public presentation of Semilarski as a serious offender and a bribe taker in circumstances where the facts underlying the suspicion of bribery are still being investigated is unacceptable, which contradicts the presumption of innocence and is unfair to the applicant," the lawyer added.
As I wrote rus.err.ee the former vice-mayor of Tartu, Valvo Semilarski, will not be prosecuted on charges of bribery - the criminal case against him was partially closed in July.
At the same time, the former official is being tried on charges of knowingly violating anti-corruption legislation when conducting transactions on a particularly large scale.
According to the indictment, between 2015 and 2017, the former Deputy Mayor of Tartu participated more than thirty times in city council meetings when making decisions related to companies operating in Tartu, with the owners or managers of which Semilarski actively communicated on a personal level during non-working hours.
According to Gross, in all these cases Semilarski had personal interests, and therefore he had to withdraw from participation in decision-making.
Previously, as I wrote rus.err.ee the prosecutor's office charged Semilarski with receiving a bribe and violating anti-corruption legislation when conducting transactions on a particularly large scale.
This happened in October 2016, when he was detained along with another deputy mayor, Artem Suvorov (Centrist Party).
Then the Prosecutor's Office and the Security Police said that there is strong evidence against both vice-mayors.
After that, both officials resigned.
Suvorov's case later reached the court, which fully acquitted the politician.
The judicial investigation in the case of Valvo Semilarski is still ongoing.
Ex-soloist of the group "Hands Up" visited the Tver region
Ex-soloist of the group "Hands Up", and now a solo artist, businessman and actor Sergey Zhukov posted a photo from Kalyazin, Tver region, on his official Instagram account.
The photo was posted a day ago, on Saturday, July 25.
"I raise my hands up to the new "Baby" and send you greetings from the intoxicatingly fresh air!
Write in the comments, what is the weather in your city?
We have no rain today, but it does not rise above +20 yet."..,- Zhukov writes in social networks.
Probably, the singer is resting in the beautiful city of the Tver region with his family.
Residents of the region have already thanked the performer for the visit, and also expressed hope for a meeting and personal communication.
The new "Baby" mentioned in the post is probably a new version of an old song that Zhukov has now recorded together with blogger and musician David Manukyan (DAVA M).
At the same time, most fans remain FOR the old version: "Sergey, the old version of the song is clearly 1,000,000 times better!
Support me loyal fans of "Hands Up"", " We don't need a "new baby"".
Most of them write directly that they like the original, which became a hit at the time, more.
The Ministry of Defense reported on the successful completion of tests of the hypersonic missile " Zircon"
The Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation reported on the successful completion of tests of the hypersonic missile "Zircon".
On the Day of the Navy, the Defense Ministry noted that the test launches conducted from the frigate "Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union Gorshkov" confirmed the unique tactical and technical characteristics of this missile in terms of range and accuracy of fire, as well as its hypersonic flight speed.
According to the Ministry of Defense, testing of the hypersonic missile is proceeding as planned.
Earlier in May, Deputy Defense Minister Alexey Krivoruchko reported that the ship complex with the latest hypersonic missile "Zircon"will enter service in 2021-2022.
You are all well aware of the truth that will be discussed today.
I think the idea of inequality as a divider and destroyer of society was in the air even before the French Revolution.
But now we can see the evidence by comparing the most and least similar societies, and by observing the effects of inequality.
I'll show you this data and explain why the relationships we're talking about exist.
But first, look at how much of a dull mass we are.
(Laughter) I'll start with a paradox.
It shows life expectancy depending on GNI, or the average level of well-being of countries.
You can see that countries on the right, such as Norway and the United States, are twice as rich as Israel, Greece and Portugal on the left.
But this does not affect the life expectancy at all.
There is no hint of a relationship.
But within societies, there are strong gradations in the state of health that affect all social strata.
Again, the average life expectancy.
The graph refers to small areas of England and Wales: the poorest-on the right, the richest-on the left.
There is a huge difference between the poor and everyone else.
Even those who are slightly poorer than the richest are already less healthy than the very top.
Thus, income is very important within our societies, but not between them.
The explanation for this paradox is this: within our societies, we look at relative income or social position, status — at what level we are in relation to others, and what are the distances between us.
Once you understand this idea, you will immediately think about it: what happens when the difference increases or shrinks, in other words, making the difference in income bigger or smaller?
I'll show you now.
All the data used is absolutely real.
I take the UN information, and the World Bank has the same: the scale of income differences in these rich and developed market democracies.
The indicator used by our team is very simple, you can download it. We count the difference between the richest 20% and the poorest 20% of citizens in each country.
See, in the equal countries on the left, Japan, Finland, Norway, and Sweden, the rich 20% are 3.5-4 times richer than the poor 20%.
But in unequal countries, in the UK, Portugal, the US and Singapore, the difference is twice as big!
According to these measurements, we are half as equal as other successful democracies.
And now you will see what impact this has on society.
We have collected statistics on social problems that are more common among the poor.
These are internationally comparable data on life expectancy, children's literacy and math skills, infant mortality, homicide rates, incarceration rates, teenage pregnancy, confidence levels, obesity, mental illness, which, according to the standard diagnostic classification, includes drug and alcohol addiction, and finally, data on social mobility.
We put it all in one index.
They are all of equal importance.
The country is, in a way, the average value of this data.
You see the countries in relation to the inequality indicator that was shown at the very beginning. I will return to it again and again as the presentation progresses.
Unequal countries in general have more difficulties with all these social problems.
It's an unusually close relationship. You can see that the correlation is unusually high.
But if you look at the same index of health and social problems in relation to GNP per capita, on Gross National Income, there is no correlation.
We were a little worried that people would think that we were fitting problems to our arguments and just "fitting" the evidence. So we also wrote an article in the British Medical Journal about the UNICEF child well-being index.
The index consists of 40 different parts put together by different people.
Among the criteria:, the presence of books at home, the ability of children to talk to their parents, the level of immunization, the presence of bullying in school.
It includes everything.
And this is all against the background of the same indicator of inequality.
The situation for children is worse in unequal societies.
And this is a statistically significant relationship.
But again, if you look at the level of child well-being in relation to national income per capita, there is no relationship, no hint.
All the data demonstrated shows one thing:
on average, the well-being of our societies no longer depends on national income and economic growth.
They are extremely important in poor countries, but not in the developed world.
The difference between us, and our position in the background of others-that's what makes a huge difference.
I'll show you the fragments of our index.
Here, for example, is trust.
This is the part of the population that agrees that most people can be trusted.
The data is taken from the World Values Survey.
Look, in unequal countries, only 15% of the population trusts others.
And in equal societies, this figure reaches 60-65%.
If you look at the dimensions of the activity of social activity, or social capital, you will notice very similar ratios that are closely related to inequality.
You could say we did the job twice.
First, we analyzed the developed countries, and then, as a control study, we repeated the procedure in 50 American states, asking one question: are things worse on all our indicators in the most unequal states?
Here's the confidence in inequality, according to the federal government's general social survey.
A very similar spread, compared to a similar range of confidence levels.
Same story.
In general, we found that almost everything related to trust at the international level is also shown in our control study.
It's not just a coincidence.
Here is a graph of mental illness.
WHO, using identical diagnostic interviews conducted on random samples of the population, collected results that allow us to compare the level of mental illness in each of the societies.
Here is the percentage of the population who suffered from any mental illness in the past year.
The numbers start at about 8% and go up to almost 24%; whole societies with three times the rate of psychological illness.
Again, this is closely related to inequality.
And here are the crimes.
These red dots represent the American states, and the blue triangles represent the Canadian provinces.
But look at the scale of the differences.
It starts at 15 kills per million and goes up to 150.
This is the proportion of prisoners.
We are talking about a tenfold difference, expressed in a logarithmic scale.
The figures range from 40 to 400 for the number of prisoners in prisons.
These correlations are not simply explained by higher crime.
Yes, in some cases this is partly true.
But most of them involve harsher sentences.
Unequal societies are more likely to maintain the death penalty.
The percentage of children dropping out of school is shown here.
Again, quite a big difference.
It's incredibly malicious when it comes to using talent.
And here is social mobility.
This is a measure of mobility based on income.
Basically, the question is: do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons, or is there no dependency here?
Among unequal countries, in the UK and the US, the father's income is much more important.
And in the Scandinavian countries, income is already much less significant.
As a result-greater social mobility.
And as we often like to say — I know there are many Americans in the audience — if Americans want to realize the American dream, they should go to Denmark.
(Laughter) (Applause) I have only shown a couple of points, indicated in italics.
A number of other problems could be demonstrated.
All kinds of problems that become more significant among the lower social strata.
But there are endless problems with social gradients that are much worse in unequal countries; and not just slightly, but 2, 10 times worse.
Think about the costs, what it costs people.
Let me go back to the graph shown earlier, where all the data is put together. Let's make two conclusions.
The first. Graph by graph, the less successful countries, and regardless of the result, are from the unequal, and the well-performing ones are the Scandinavian countries and Japan.
Thus, we see a general social dysfunction against the background of inequality.
These are not one or two separate problems. This is a trend.
One more important note about this chart. Let's see below: Sweden and Japan: the countries are different in literally everything.
The position of women, how closely they are connected with the family, is directly opposite, in the conditions of developed countries.
Another very important difference is how they achieve greater equality.
In Sweden, income differences are huge, but they are reduced through taxation, through social programs, generous benefits, etc.
in Japan, everything is different.
The difference in salaries is initially small.
Taxes are lower.
There are fewer social programs.
And in our analysis of the American states, we find the same contrast.
Some states thrive on income redistribution, while others thrive on a smaller difference in net income before taxes.
We believe that it does not matter by what means equality is achieved, as long as it is achieved.
I am not talking about full equality, but about the one that exists in rich and developed market democracies.
Another surprising observation is that it is not only the poor who are affected by this inequality.
There seems to be some truth in John Donne's words: "Man is not an island."
A number of studies compare how well people in more or less equal countries do at each rung of the social ladder.
One such example is:
Mortality among newborns.
A group of Swedes classified many cases of infant mortality according to the British register of general socio-economic classification.
This is rather an anachronistic classification according to the profession of fathers, so single parents are not taken into account.
And by "low social level" we mean unskilled professions.
Next — skilled manual workers, then-white-collar workers of the lowest level and up to the highest level with highly qualified professions: doctors, lawyers, directors of large companies.
You can see that Sweden is doing better than the UK in all sectors of society.
The biggest difference is at the lowest levels,
but even for the higher ranks, there are benefits from a more equal society.
We have shown this in five different data sets that affect educational outcomes and health in the US and internationally.
And this seems to be the general picture: greater equality makes a bigger difference at the bottom, but it is also useful for the top.
But I must still explain what is happening.
I think it's all about the psychosocial consequences of inequality.
About the feeling of superiority and inferiority, about the feeling of one's worth and vice versa, about the feeling of self-respect and vice versa.
And, of course, the sense of competition that is born of these feelings, fuels consumerism in our society.
This also leads to fear for your status.
We worry more about how others think of us, whether we are considered attractive, smart — this worries us.
The more public assessments, the greater the fear of them.
Interestingly, parallel work is being conducted in social psychology: 208 different studies were considered with the participation of volunteers who were tested in psychological laboratories for stress hormones, for reaction to stressful tasks.
In general, they wanted to observe the types of stress that increase the level of cortisol, the main stress hormone.
As a result, such factors were situations that included a potential threat to social assessment, a threat to self-esteem or social status, situations where other people could give a negative assessment.
Just such stressful factors have a special effect on the physiology of stress.
Not without criticism in our address.
Of course, there will be dissenters or people who find this amazing.
I have to tell you, in response to the criticism for the selection of data, that we do not select this data.
Our main rule is that if the data source has the necessary indicators for one of the analyzed countries, we include it in our analysis.
It is the source of the information that decides whether this data is real, but not us.
Otherwise, we would have created a systematic error.
What about other countries?
There are 200 studies of health in relation to income and equality in academic journals.
And they are not limited to these countries, but we have excluded the others for clarity.
Same countries, same dimensions of inequality, problem after problem.
Why don't we control other factors?
Well, we've shown you that GNP per capita doesn't matter.
And, of course, others, using more sophisticated methods, controlled both poverty, and the level of education, and so on.
What about causality?
Correlation alone does not prove causation.
We spent a lot of time on this.
Indeed, for some of these situations, the causal relationships are well known.
A major change in our understanding of the causes of chronic health impacts in the developed world has been the significance of chronic social stress and its impact on the immune and cardiovascular systems.
For example, violence is becoming more common in unequal societies because people are more sensitive to contempt.
I must say that to solve this problem, we should work on the income before and after taxes.
We must limit the income and additional bonuses of the higher ranks.
I think that it is necessary to make our bosses responsible for the employees in every possible way.
I want you to leave here with the knowledge that we can improve a person's real quality of life by reducing the income gap between us.
Now we have a fulcrum for influencing the psychological well-being of entire societies, and this is truly incredible.
Thanks.
(Applause)

According to "SE", at the moment, the midfielder of "Lokomotiv" Alexey Miranchuk is claimed by the teams of Serie A "Milan", "Lazio", "Fiorentina"and " Atalanta".
The 24-year-old would like a four-year contract with a salary of at least 2 million euros a year with bonuses.
Any club that makes such an offer will get priority.
"Lokomotiv" is determined to sell its main star and make money on it.
Otherwise, the club will face serious expenses for the extension of the contract with the midfielder.
It should be noted that AC Milan expects to include left-back Diego Laxalt in the deal.
In the 2019/20 season, Miranchuk made 32 appearances for the Railwaymen, scoring 16 goals and making 5 assists.
Together with Lokomotiv, the midfielder became the champion of Russia (2017/18), won the National Cup three times (2014/15, 2016/17, 2018/19) and once the Russian Super Cup (2019).
The US has called on Qatar and its neighbors to end the dispute
It is necessary to restore trust and unity between Qatar and other states, according to the US Special Representative for Iran, Brian Hook.
He said that the conflict between the emirate and other countries in the region has been going on for too long and is detrimental to regional interests in the areas of stability, prosperity and security.
So far, the US has tried unsuccessfully to mediate a settlement to the dispute, which Washington sees as a " threat to efforts to contain Iran."
The United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain severed diplomatic relations with Qatar three years ago.
They imposed a transport blockade, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorism.
In response, Doha said that its neighbors are simply jealous of Qatar's economic success - according to the IMF, Qatar has been leading in terms of GDP per capita for several years by a large margin.
The Emirate is the third largest exporter of natural gas, the sixth largest exporter of natural gas, and a major exporter of oil and petroleum products.

According to Roscosmos, the defective parts were manufactured at the Ust-Katavsky plant in Chelyabinsk in 2015-2016.
Remenyako won the second race in the SMP GT4 RUSSIA class.
Yevgeny Kulikov, whose Porsche Cayman was damaged in the first race, could not get to the start.
Therefore, Alexey Bashmakov was on the reverse pole - however, by the second lap, the Mercedes drivers were already ahead.
Denis Remenyako again raced ahead, and Alexander Vaintrub was forced to repel the attacks of Alexander Maslennikov on KTM, who broke from last place to third.
Despite a tight fight in the first part of the race, towards the middle Weintrub increased the pace, showing the best lap time in the race - and, although he could not catch up with the extremely stable Remenyako, guaranteed himself silver.
The group of Caimans lagged behind the leaders, but fought a tight battle among themselves.
The best of the Porsche drivers was Alexey Bashmakov, who became fourth in the standings, but Andrei Fedotov and Konstantin Zakharevsky lost to him in a matter of moments.
And at the intermediate finish in the middle of the race, Fedotov and Zakharevsky were separated by 0.001 seconds.
Two more highways were included in the list of federal roads
The Government of the Russian Federation has included two more highways in the list of federal highways.
According to the Cabinet of Ministers, one of these roads with a length of more than 663 kilometers Chekshino-Totma-Kotlas-Kuratovo connects the Vologda and Arkhangelsk regions with the Republic of Komi.
Another highway with a length of more than 388 kilometers leads from Barnaul through Pavlovsk to the border with the Republic of Kazakhstan.
On this road, you can drive from the capital of the Altai Territory to the checkpoint "Kulunda".
Obtaining the new status will allow these highways to be brought to a standard state with the funds of the Federal Road Fund.
Major repairs and reconstruction of individual sections will be carried out, and the quality of the road surface will be improved.
Tatarstan allowed to hold film screenings in the open air
The Cabinet of Ministers of Tatarstan has published a decree according to which from July 27 in the republic it is possible to hold film screenings in open areas − in parks, squares and on embankments, writes "Tatar-inform".
Also, the document states that for citizens over 65 years of age, the mandatory self-isolation regime has been extended until August 9.
They can leave their homes to go to the store, take out the trash or take a walk with the dog.
But the cinemas in the premises are not planned to open until the third stage of lifting the restrictions, the agency reminds.
Washington is happy with the playoff games.
We missed them
Russian hockey player "Washington Capitals" Alexander Ovechkin spoke about the preparation of the club for the upcoming resumption of the season in the NHL.
The 34-year-old Caps striker noted the readiness of his teammates for the matches.
Psychologically, all the guys are ready.
We go to Toronto happy, because we were long without a game and missed hockey in the playoffs,-quotes Ovechkin Russian version of the site NHL.Com.
- Now we are fresh, we have no injuries and various sores.
However, Ovechkin also admitted that he and his partners still have to remember some of the tactical combinations: "We don't have much time to play most of them and remember the March practices on how to move the puck in such situations.
But there is still time: I am sure that in Toronto we will still devote part of our training to this.
Majority and minority are important in the playoffs.
And I have confidence in our special teams."
Recall that the Washington Capitals ' restart is scheduled for August 3, when the Capitals play the Tampa Bay Lightning.
After that, the Caps will also play the Philadelphia Flyers (August 6) and the Boston Bruins (August 9).
The Russian refused to pay for parking and beat the parking worker
In Vladivostok, a man refused to pay for parking and hit a parking employee, the police are checking.
This is reported by the portal vl.ru with reference to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia in the city.
The incident occurred on Friday, July 24, in the parking lot near the shopping center.
The driver of the car refused to pay for the parking of the car, which is why there was a conflict with the parking employee.
The verbal argument escalated into a physical assault.
The man hit the employee in the face, he fell unconscious.
He was hospitalized.
According to the source of the publication, the victim received a moderate head injury and was taken to the department of neurosurgery.
Currently, the police are establishing all the circumstances of the incident.
Earlier, the Russian was charged with beating a disabled man who died later in hospital.
According to the investigation, the victim was visiting his friend-a 45-year-old local resident.
The men drank alcohol together, after which there was a conflict between the friends.
The owner of the apartment beat the guest, he went home.
Two days later, the man became ill and was hospitalized.
He died from his injuries.
Recently, cyber attacks on the business world have become more frequent.
Access to data from companies such as JP Morgan, Yahoo, Home Depot, and Target has caused them losses of hundreds of millions, and in some cases even billions of dollars.
It doesn't take too many such attacks to damage the global economy.
The public sector is also not immune to such problems.
From 2012 to 2014, there was a significant data leak in the US Office of Personnel Management.
Access to the security and fingerprint verification data of 22 million employees was compromised.
There are known attempts by hackers sponsored by government agencies to influence the results of elections in a number of countries with the help of stolen data.
The two most recent disclosures involve the Bundestag, the German Federal Parliament, and the theft of emails from the US Democratic National Committee.
The cyber threat affects our democratic processes.
The situation is even getting worse.
As computer technology evolves, data protection systems become increasingly vulnerable.
A new type of computer technology is also of concern — computing on quantum computers, which use the microscopic properties of nature to enormously increase computing power.
It is so powerful that it can crack many modern encryption systems.
Is the situation so hopeless?
Maybe it's time to pack up our vital data and prepare for the coming digital apocalypse.
I would say, " Not yet."
Quantum computers are still in development, and it will take many years before they are put into practice.
More important is the fact that there are major breakthroughs in the field of encryption.
For me, this is a particularly exciting time in the history of secure communications.
About 15 years ago, when I learned about the new possibility of creating quantum effects that do not exist in nature, I was very excited.
I was intrigued by the idea of applying the fundamental laws of physics to create more secure encryption.
Today, a number of companies and laboratories around the world, including mine, are working on these technologies to put them into practice.
Right.
Now we are preparing to fight the quantum with the help of the quantum.
So how does it all work?
First, let's take a quick look at the world of encryption.
To do this, we will need a briefcase, some important documents that we want to send to our friend, James Bond, and a lock to keep everything safe.
Since our information is top secret, we need a special briefcase.
It has a special combination lock: when it is closed, it converts all the text in the documents to random numbers.
You put the documents in the briefcase, close the lock — at this very moment all the documents are converted to random numbers — and send the briefcase to James.
While the briefcase is on its way, you call James to tell him the code.
After receiving the briefcase, he enters the code, the documents are decrypted, and voila — you just sent an encrypted message to James Bond.
(Laughter) A funny example, but it illustrates three important coding elements.
The code — we call it the "encryption key".
It's like a password.
Call James to tell him the combination code of the lock.
This is called " key exchange» —
guarantee that you will safely get the encryption key from the right place.
And a lock that encodes and decodes the document.
This is called the "encoding algorithm".
Using the key, it converts the text in the documents to random numbers.
A good algorithm will encode in such a way that without a key, the document is very difficult to decipher.
The importance of encryption is that if someone gets hold of a briefcase and breaks it without using the encryption key and the encoding algorithm, they still won't be able to read its contents.
The information will look like a set of random numbers.
Most security systems rely on a secure way to exchange keys to transfer the encryption key to the desired location.
However, the rapid development of computing power threatens a number of modern methods of key exchange.
Consider one of the most widely used systems today — RSA.
When it was invented in 1977, it was estimated that it would take 40 quadrillion years to crack a 426-bit RSA key.
In 1994, just 17 years later, the code was cracked.
As computers became more powerful, we had to use more complex codes.
Today we usually use 2,048 or 4,096 bits.
As you can see, the creators of the code and the hackers are engaged in an ongoing battle, trying to outsmart each other.
And when quantum computers appear in the next 10-15 years, they will be able to crack the complex mathematics that underlies many modern encryption systems even faster.
A quantum computer is likely to turn our current secure fortress into a simple house of cards.
We must find a way to defend our fortress.
In recent years, there has been an increasing amount of research into the use of quantum effects to enhance cryptographic protection.
Some interesting discoveries have been made.
Remember the three main elements of encryption: high-quality keys, secure key exchange, and a complex algorithm?
Advances in science and technology threaten two of these three elements.
First, the keys themselves.
Random numbers are the fundamental building blocks of encryption keys.
But to date, they are not entirely random.
Today, we create encryption keys from sequences of random numbers generated from software, so-called pseudo-random numbers.
In the numbers generated by a program or a mathematical formula, one way or another, there is a certain pattern.
The less random numbers are — in scientific terms, the less entropy they contain — the easier it is to predict them.
Recently, several casinos have been the victims of an ingenious attack.
Combinations at the output of slot machines were recorded for some time, after which they were analyzed.
This allowed cybercriminals to redesign the pseudo-random number generator that controls the reels.
This, in turn, made it possible to predict the spin of the reels with high accuracy and get a big win.
Encryption keys can also be exposed to similar risks.
Secure encryption requires a truly random number generator.
For many years, scientists have been looking for the possibility of creating such a generator.
But most attempts today are either not random enough, not fast enough, or difficult to repeat.
But the quantum world is based on randomness.
Therefore, it makes sense to take advantage of this fact.
Devices that can measure quantum effects can also create an infinite stream of random numbers at high speed,
which will prevent all these potential criminals from entering the casino.
A number of top universities and companies around the world are engaged in creating truly random number generators.
The first quantum generator created in my company was one meter by two meters and placed on an optical table.
Later, we were able to reduce it to the size of a server box.
Today, it's the size of a PCI card plugged into a standard computer.
This is the world's fastest truly random number generator.
Its performance is a billion random numbers per second.
Today, it is used to strengthen the security system by cloud providers, banks, and government agencies around the world.
(Applause) But even with such a generator, the second big problem remains unsolved: the threat to secure key exchange.
Modern methods of key exchange are not compatible with a quantum computer.
The quantum solution to this problem is called "quantum key distribution" or QKD, which is based on a fundamental, paradoxical characteristic of quantum mechanics.
A quantum particle changes depending on its observation.
Here is an example of how it works.
Let's go back to exchanging the codes for the lock with James Bond.
Only this time, instead of calling James with the code message, we'll use quantum effects on the laser to create the code and send it to James over a conventional optical fiber.
We believe that Dr. Know will try to hack access to the data exchange.
Fortunately, his attempts to catch the quantum keys in transit will leave fingerprints that James and you will be able to detect.
This will eliminate the intercepted keys.
And the remaining keys can be used for enhanced data protection.
Since such security is based on the fundamental laws of physics, a quantum computer or even any supercomputer of the future will not be able to crack it.
My team and I are working with leading universities, as well as the defense sector, to develop this promising technology into next-generation security tools.
The Internet of Things heralds an era when 25-30 billion devices will interact, which is projected to appear by 2020.
For our society to function properly in the world of the Internet of Things, trust in the systems that support these devices is vital.
I bet that quantum technology can provide that trust, allowing us to take full advantage of the amazing innovations that will enrich our lives.
Thanks.
(Applause)
Video of cats helping an injured dog cross the road
On the Internet, a video with two cats that helped a wounded dog cross the road in the Krasnodar Territory is becoming popular.
The touching procession was recorded by the video recorder of one of the drivers.
The events took place in the dark, the man noticed traffic on the road and slowed down.
"Look, the whole delegation is rushing," the driver says ironically at first.
And then he notices that the dog moves with great difficulty.
The group made it safely to the side of the road, then headed towards the forest.
"There is something for people to learn from animals," they write in the comments.
On Sunday, parades in honor of the Day of the Russian Navy were held in St. Petersburg and near all major fleet bases, including in the Syrian Tartus.
They were attended by 219 different ships and 15 thousand personnel.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, who hosted the main parade in St. Petersburg, said that in 2020, the Navy will be replenished with 40 new ships of different classes, as well as the latest weapons - including hypersonic strike systems and unmanned underwater vehicles.
In 2020, the parade was held for the first time in Kaspiysk, where the base of the Caspian Fleet was relocated from Astrakhan.
In addition to St. Petersburg, parades were held in Baltiysk, Kaspiysk, Severomorsk, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Vladivostok, as well as in the annexed Sevastopol and on the roadstead of the Syrian port of Tartus.
The main parade in the waters of the Neva River and the Gulf of Finland was attended by 4,000 military personnel and 46 vessels, including nuclear and diesel submarines, as well as helicopters and naval aircraft.
Before the start of the parade, Putin, accompanied by Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, Navy Commander-in-Chief Admiral Nikolai Evmenov and Commander of the Western Military District, Colonel-General Zhuravlev, toured several ships stationed on the Kronstadt Roadstead and in the Gulf of Finland, greeting the personnel.
The parade was decorated with a copy of the first Russian battleship "Poltava", recreated according to archival drawings.
The Emperor Peter I took part in its design.
In his speech, Putin recalled that this year marks the 200th anniversary of the discovery of Antarctica as a result of the expedition of Russian navigators Thaddeus Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev.
And on the roof of the Senate and Synod buildings, snipers were seen providing security during the parade.
The parade in Baltiysk, where the Baltic Fleet is based, was attended by more than 46 warships and more than 1.5 military personnel, and the large warship "Kaliningrad" made a landing of marine troops.
In the annexed Sevastopol, a parade was held with the participation of 30 ships and a performance dedicated to the history of the Black Sea Fleet, which included the exit of a group of divers from under the water.
The parade in Severomorsk was attended by a new nuclear submarine "Prince Vladimir" of strategic purpose, which was accepted into the Northern Fleet in June.
In Vladivostok, the holiday ended with a salute.
The Russian Navy will receive forty ships and vessels this year
Forty ships and vessels will join the Russian Navy this year, Russian President Vladimir Putin said.
"The level of equipment of our military fleet is constantly growing.
This year, it will include forty ships and vessels of various classes, " he said, speaking at the main parade in honor of the Navy Day in St. Petersburg.
Putin also recalled that a few days ago, six new ships of the far sea zone were laid down at three shipyards in Russia.
Earlier it was reported that a parade in honor of the Day of the Navy began in St. Petersburg.
A four-year-old child was injured in an accident near Volgograd
On Saturday, July 25, at 11: 28 a.m., an accident occurred on a dirt road five kilometers from the village of Medvedev.
The 73-year-old pensioner was driving a VAZ-21083 in the direction of the village of Shirokoe.
At some point, the motorist lost control and the car overturned on the roof.
− As a result of the accident, a 4-year-old girl was injured − - said the press service of the regional headquarters of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
- The child was hospitalized with injuries.
18 children have died since the beginning of the summer in the Volgograd region

How will the Central Bank's decision to cut the key rate affect the economy
The Bank of Russia is expected to cut its key rate again.
It fell by another 0.25 percentage points, to 4.25% per annum-formally another historical low.
Judging by the return of the short rate cut, as well as the tone of the Central Bank's statements and updated forecasts for the Russian economy, the regulator is more optimistic about the economic outlook than before.
This means that the current cycle of monetary easing may soon come to a halt.
"We have continued to ease monetary policy, primarily given that there are still risks of deflection of inflation down from 4% in 2021," -said the head of the Bank of Russia Elvira Nabiullina.
They are associated with a significant decline in economic activity, a drop in domestic and foreign demand.
The economic recovery, according to Nabiullina, will take more than a year and a half.
At the same time, she noted that after the lifting of restrictions due to the pandemic, economic processes have revived: energy consumption, consumer and investment demand were restored, construction and production of consumer goods were expanded, and the annual rate of decline in the turnover of transport and industrial production slowed down.
According to the updated forecast of the Central Bank, in 2020, the economy will shrink by 4.5-5.5% (before that, 4-6% was expected), and the recovery growth of the economy in 2021 will be 3.5-4.5%, in 2022 - 2.5-3.5%.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised the forecast for annual oil prices to $ 38 and $ 40 per barrel of Urals in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
Earlier, the Central Bank expected $ 27 and $ 35 per barrel.
Finally, the Bank of Russia's forecast for inflation for 2020 was 3.7-4.2% against the previously expected 3.8-4.8%.
The Bank of Russia's view of the economy is becoming more optimistic, which brings us closer to the end of the easing cycle, according to Sofya Donets and Andrey Melashchenko, economists for Russia and the CIS at Renaissance Capital.
So, the Bank of Russia has been consistently reducing the key rate for more than a year, since the beginning of last summer it has already fallen by 3.5 percentage points.
And at the last meeting in June, the Central Bank lowered it immediately by one percentage point due to low inflation rates due to subdued demand and the need to stimulate the economy, which has slowed down due to the pandemic and related restrictions.
The chances of further adjustment of monetary policy remain (at the next meeting on September 18 and until the end of the year), but the limit is already close, agrees Rosbank chief analyst Evgeny Koshelev.
The combination of pro-inflationary risks also points to the proximity of a pause in interest rate policy easing - disrupted supply chains, possible cost increases due to epidemic prevention measures, and a faster (than expected) recovery in demand, he says.
To top it off, the Bank of Russia's subsequent actions will require more attention to inflationary processes during the harvest season, as well as external volatility, which has increased against the background of geopolitical conflicts, Koshelev points out.
One way or another, a reduction in the key rate will lead to a further reduction in rates for the most reliable borrowers, as well as, possibly, for mortgages, says Maxim Petronevich, senior economist at the analytical department of Otkritie Bank.
The rate correction will be less pronounced than the reduction in the key rate, he says.
Rates on consumer loans may fall by another 0.3-0.6 percentage points during the second half of the year, mortgage rates may end the year in the range of 6.2-7%, does not exclude economist "BCS Premier" Anton Pokatovich.
Average deposit rates, in his opinion, will also fall - in the coming months they may fall to 4.2-4.5% (now barely above 4.5%).
Further, they can fall to 4% if the Central Bank cuts the key rate in the fall, Pokatovich believes.
The centrist party promises to pay all its debts by the end of the year
This was stated in an interview with ERR by the General Secretary of the Centrist Party, Mikhail Korb.
According to him, the total amount of payments that the party has to make is about 300,000 euros.
"According to today's financial forecasts, the Centrist Party will pay off its current debts and obligations by the end of this year," Korb said.
Earlier it became known that the Prime Minister's party returned 110,100 euros to the state, which were recognized as a prohibited donation.
In Harjumaa, a car and a caravan collided: four people were injured
According to police, the accident occurred at 13:50 in the village of Soodla, where a Mercedes-Benz car driven by a 31-year-old woman collided with a Fiat truck with a 48-year-old man at the wheel.
As a result of the incident, the drivers of both vehicles were injured, as well as the passengers who were in the mobile home: a 10-year-old child and a 48-year-old woman, who was taken to the hospital.
The rest of the victims were given first aid on the spot, they did not need hospitalization.
The exact circumstances of the incident are being investigated.
The Ukrainian military will monitor the ceasefire in the Donbass
The Ukrainian military has begun preparations for a ceasefire on the line of demarcation in the Donbas, and control over the implementation of the agreements will be carried out by military personnel with experience in peacekeeping missions, the Joint Forces headquarters reports on Facebook.
"Units from the Joint Forces have begun preparations for a full and comprehensive ceasefire on the line of demarcation, which will take effect from July 27, 2020," the statement said.
It is noted that, starting from 00: 01 on July 27, at each of the Ukrainian positions, additional control over the ceasefire will be carried out by specially seconded Ukrainian servicemen, most of whom have combat experience and were directly engaged in specialized issues during participation in peacekeeping missions under the auspices of the UN.
Such a step will allow "not to distract the personnel of the Joint Forces units from performing combat tasks and to prevent possible provocations," the report says.
At a meeting of the contact group on the Donbas on Wednesday, the parties agreed on a set of additional measures to control the truce, which, among other things, includes a ban on the activities of sabotage and reconnaissance groups and a ban on firing, including sniper fire.

Psychologist: "Emelianenko still can't forget parting with the woman he loves."
Psychologist Veronika Stepanova, who has more than 1 million subscribers on Youtube, spoke about the MMA fighter Alexander Emelianenko, who is the ex-husband of her sister.
Olya met with Sasha, they began a stormy love, " Stepanova said in a video on her Youtube channel.
- It was a very beautiful story, they instantly gave birth to a child, everything was fine and wonderful.
At some point, Sasha got fed up with all this, he wanted to take a little walk.
And if any other woman will react to this normally (well, just think, went for a walk, dance a little), then this is not about Olya.
She doesn't stand for such things.
And his story about a little walk ended with the fact that his sister instantly married another man and immediately gave birth to a child.
When Sasha came to his senses from what had happened, he couldn't believe it.
He tried to crawl on his knees and give me diamonds.
His lion pride blew his head off.
He wanted to get it back, but he didn't know how to get it back.
They maintain friendly relations, they have a common child, but he still can not come to himself.
His destructive behavior is a cry of despair, an attempt to either kill himself or attract her attention.
The prospect of "Carolina" will go to play in Sweden.
Carolina prospect Jack Drury will play in the Swedish championship next season, according to The Hockey News ' Ryan Kennedy on Twitter.
The player of the youth national team of the USA last season played in the NCAA for Harvard.
In 28 matches, he scored 39 (20+19) points.
Drury was selected by Carolina in the 2018 draft with the 42nd overall pick.
Albert Proza signed a contract with the Tallinn "Legion"."
Proza's last club was Tammeka Tartu, for whom he played last season.
"Because of the injury, I was out of football for more than a year.
On April 30, he underwent surgery.
But now it's all right-I'm ready to play again.
However, while my form is far from optimal.
When will I make my debut for Legion?
It is quite possible that on July 29 I will play a certain amount of time for the Estonian Cup, and on August 1 I will get into the application for the championship match against Paide .
But it all depends on the coach's decision, he will decide whether I am ready or not.
I myself believe that I still have a lot to gain, " Albert Proza said in an interview with ERR on Sunday.
In the current Estonian Football Championship, Legion takes the ninth place in the standings after 14 rounds, scoring 10 points.
"At the moment, if you look at the table, we can't talk about fighting for high places, but Legion is an ambitious team, we have a fairly good squad.
I think we will have better results next year.
And the task for this year is to keep a place in the top league and play more confidently, " Proza added.
"I don't set any personal goals for myself.
It is not easy to return to football after such a long break.
Now my main task is to help the team stay in the top league and climb the table as high as possible," the striker said.
Previously, Proza also played for the capital "Flora" and "Infonet", Finnish RoPS and TPS, Maltese"Valetta".
Proza played 7 matches for the Estonian national team.

The main naval parade was marked by new ships and shooting technologies
At the Main Naval Parade in St. Petersburg, a new shooting technology was applied: a video camera "passed" under one of the ships, showing it "from the wrong side".
In this perspective, the passage of the newest serial small rocket ship "Sovetsk" along the Admiralteiskaya Embankment was filmed.
The main naval parade was broadcast by the TV channel "Russia 1" and the website Russia.tv.
Earlier, on June 24, at the parade in honor of the 75th anniversary of the Great Victory, the camera "passed" through the barrel of a tank into an armored vehicle when switching from one plan to another, and during the flight of the Russian Knights and Swifts aerobatic team fighters, the camera "flew" out of the nozzle of the aircraft engine.
The main naval parade consisting of 46 warships, boats and submarines, 41 aircraft and helicopters of naval aviation and more than 4 thousand military personnel ended in the waters of Kronstadt.
The parade, in particular, was attended by the large anti-submarine ship "Vice Admiral Kulakov", the corvette "Stoyky", the large landing ships "Minsk" and "Patriot", the nuclear submarine missile cruiser" Eagle", the submarine" Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky", the patrol ship" Vasily Bykov", the small anti-submarine ships" Kazanets "and" Urengoy", the small missile ships" Liven "and" Passat", the missile boat"Chuvashia".
On the roadstead of Kronstadt in the Gulf of Finland, it was possible to see for the first time a large landing ship "Peter Morgunov", built according to the project 11711 of the Nevsky PKB at the Baltic plant "Yantar".
The lead ship of this series "Ivan Gren" is already serving in the Northern Fleet, reports TASS.
Among other newcomers who recently entered service with the Navy was the first production frigate "Admiral of the Kasatonov Fleet", built according to Project 22350 at the Severnaya Verf plant.
Another newcomer to the Navy is the diesel-electric submarine "Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky" of the project 636.3 of the Central Design Bureau of Marine Equipment "Rubin", built at the"Admiralty Shipyards".
She joined the Russian Pacific Fleet in December 2019.
Other new ships that have recently joined the Navy are the small missile ships "Sovetsk " and" Mytishchi " of the project 22800 ("Karakurt"), developed by the Almaz CMCB.
The parade on the Neva River was also attended by the small rocket ships "Veliky Ustyug "and" Serpukhov "of project 21631 " Buyan-M".
And the largest participants were the nuclear submarine missile cruiser "Eagle "and the large anti-submarine ship" Vice Admiral Kulakov " - they could be seen in the Gulf of Finland.
In recognition of the great contribution of the Russian navy to the exploration of the World Ocean, two new hydrographic boats "Georgy Zima" and "Mikhail Kazansky"passed along the Neva River together with warships. And the Kronstadt roadstead was occupied by the oceanographic research vessel Admiral Vladimirsky, which completed a joint scientific round-the-world expedition to the shores of Antarctica in June in honor of the 200th anniversary of its discovery by Russian navigators Thaddeus Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev.
And at the Palace Bridge, you could see the first Russian battleship of the XVI century "Poltava"recreated at the historical shipyard.
This 54-gun sailing ship was launched in 1712, participated in the war with the Swedes, and in 1717 provided a landing on the island of Gotland.
In 1725, this ship was withdrawn from the Baltic Fleet, and after its reconstruction, it was launched in St. Petersburg on May 27, 2018.
Travel to Kronstadt this year was restricted for the duration of the parade in connection with the prevention of the spread of the coronavirus COVID-19, RIA Novosti reports.
1 person was killed during protests in the United States
Protests were held in Seattle, Portland, Louisville and Denver, the Actual Camera reported on Sunday.
In Austin, Texas, a man was killed during a protest.
The protester was shot with a rifle while he was sitting in his car.
The suspect in the commission of the crime has already been detained.
In other cities, demonstrators clashed with law enforcement officers.
The protesters staged mass riots and the police were forced to use tear gas and stun grenades.
Poll: The ruling Union of Peasants and Greens of Lithuania again topped the rating of parties
The Union of Peasants and "Greens" of Lithuania, which heads the ruling coalition of the Seimas, topped the rating of the parties.
This was shown by a survey conducted by the social research company Vilmorus, commissioned by the newspaper Lietuvos rytas.
After winning the 2016 parliamentary elections, the Peasants lost first place and for a long time the main critic of Russia in Lithuania, the opposition Union of the Fatherland - Christian Democrats (Conservatives), was in the lead.
However, recently Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda, assessing the electoral possibilities of the parties, said that the Union of Peasants and "greens" after the parliamentary elections of this year, will probably be able to form a coalition again.
This statement aroused the indignation of the conservatives.
The latest poll showed that if the parliamentary elections were held today, 17.6 percent of voters would vote for the peasants, and 17.2 percent for the conservatives.
According to the director of Vilmorus Vladas Gaidis, the gap is within the margin of error, and yet the ruling party has stopped lagging behind the conservatives.
According to Gaidis, the sociological success of the" peasants " was promoted by the news that their electoral list will be headed by Prime Minister Saulius Skvernialis.
This politician was the first in the list of "peasants" and in the 2016 elections.
In third place is the Social Democratic Party, for which 7.1 percent of respondents are now ready to vote.
For a month, it unexpectedly lost 2 percent.
The fourth is the Labor Party, led by Russian-born businessman Viktor Uspasskikh (6.2 percent).
The rest of the political organizations, judging by the survey, will not be able to overcome the 5-percent electoral barrier yet.
Putin spoke about the unique advantages of the Russian fleet
Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Main Naval Parade in St. Petersburg said that the unique advantages and increased combat capabilities of the Russian fleet will be achieved through the introduction of advanced digital technologies.
As the head of state specified, domestic hypersonic strike systems, unmanned underwater vehicles have no analogues in the world.
In addition, the Russian leader drew attention to the most effective means of defense of the Russian Federation.
According to the Russian leader, the level of equipment of the Russian Navy is constantly growing, so this year it will accept 40 ships and vessels of various classes.
At the same time, it is noted that the emphasis will be placed on equipping with unique hypersonic strike complexes.
Today, the Navy is armed with the latest ships equipped with high-precision weapons, strategic submarine cruisers and multi-purpose submarines, as well as unique samples of special equipment, the president added.
Putin also stressed that the sailors adequately perform the most difficult tasks, serving the Fatherland flawlessly.
The Ministry of Emergency Situations warned residents of the Moscow region about a thunderstorm
In the Moscow region, thunderstorms and wind gusts of up to 15 m/s are expected. This was reported by the regional department of the Ministry of Emergency Situations on Sunday, July 26.
Residents are advised to remove household items from their yards and prune dry trees that can cause damage to their homes.
The car should be placed in a garage or parked away from trees or weakly reinforced structures.
To avoid a lightning strike, it is recommended not to heat the stove in the house in a thunderstorm and not to use electrical appliances, and not to hide under trees (especially lonely ones) on the street, not to swim in reservoirs.
Those in the car are advised to close the windows and stay inside.
On July 24, the Ministry of Emergency Situations also warned residents of the Moscow region about a thunderstorm.
Extra requirements for public procurement applications will be excluded by law
The legislation may establish exhaustive requirements for applications for participation in procurement.
In the autumn session at the plenary session of the State Duma, it is planned to consider in the second reading a bill that establishes requirements for the content and composition of an application for participation in a purchase, which can only be attended by small and medium-sized businesses.
Amendments are being made by the Government to the law "On Procurement of goods, works, and services by certain types of legal entities".
The draft law was developed in accordance with the roadmap for the implementation of the Strategy for the Development of Small and Medium-sized Businesses in the Russian Federation until 2030, approved by the government.
It provides for the preparation of a draft law on an exhaustive list of documents that customers have the right to request as part of an application from participants in the purchase - small and medium-sized businesses.
And also-about the list of requirements for the specified documents.
To date, the law" On Procurement of goods, works, and services by certain types of legal entities " regulates the procurement activities of certain types of legal entities in a framework.
The requirements for the content, form, design and composition of the application for participation in the purchase are set by the customers themselves in the purchase documentation.
"As a result, customers set excessive requirements for the content, registration of the application, the mandatory presence in its composition of certificates, certificates, extracts, the period of receipt of which in the authorized bodies is comparable to the deadline for submitting applications, which leads to the inability to participate in such a purchase and a reduction in the number of participants in the purchase," the explanation to the bill says.
The new draft law provides for the establishment of an exhaustive list of documents that customers have the right to require as part of the application from procurement participants who are small and medium-sized businesses.
"The adoption of the document will eliminate the arbitrary establishment of requirements by customers for the composition and content of applications of participants who are small and medium-sized businesses," the explanatory note says.
As an artist, the relationship is very important to me.
In my works, I try to show that people are inseparable from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I first visited Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and there I saw icebergs.
I was in awe.
My heart beat faster, and my head spun, trying to make sense of what lay before me.
The icebergs around them were almost 200 feet out of the water. And I couldn't help but be surprised that it was one snowflake on top of another, year after year.
Icebergs are born when they break off from glacial ice or break off from ice shelves.
Each iceberg has its own personality.
Everyone interacts with the environment in their own way and accumulates their own experience.
Some refuse to give up and hold on until the bitter end, while others can no longer fight and perish in a fit of bright passion.
Looking at an iceberg, it is easy to think that it is isolated, that it is closed and lonely, just as we humans often see ourselves.
But life is very different.
When the iceberg melts, I breathe in its ancient atmosphere.
When an iceberg melts, it releases fresh, mineral-rich water that feeds many forms of life.
I approach photographing these icebergs as creating portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these individual moments they exist in this image, and that it will never happen again.
They do not die when they melt; this is not the end, but the continuation of their path in the cycle of life.
Sometimes the ice in the icebergs I photograph is very young — it's only a couple of thousand years old.
And some icebergs are older than 100,000 years.
The last photos I want to show you are of an iceberg that I photographed in Kirtartivatziak, in Greenland.
It is a very rare case when you can see how the iceberg rotates.
So here it is.
A small boat can be seen on the left.
Approximately 4.5 meters long.
Please pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and the place of its contact with the water.
Here you can see how it starts to rotate, and the boat has swum to the other side, and there is a man standing there.
This is a medium-sized Greenland iceberg.
It protrudes about 120 feet or 40 meters out of the water.
And here is this real-time recording.
(Music) And just like that, the iceberg shows us the other side of his personality.
Thanks.
(Applause)
One winter morning a few years ago, I was driving to work in Johannesburg, South Africa, when I noticed a fog hanging over the city.
I drive there almost every day, so I probably wouldn't have noticed it before.
Johannesburg is known for its special horizons, which I could barely see that morning.
I soon realized that it was a huge cloud of polluted air.
The contrast between my usual picturesque surroundings and that smog-shrouded sky stirred something in me.
I was terrified that this city of colorful and picturesque sunsets would be swallowed up in the mist.
At that moment, I had a strong desire to do something, but I didn't know what.
All I knew was that I couldn't stay away.
The main difficulty was that I didn't know much about ecology, air quality management, or atmospheric chemistry.
I'm a computer engineer, and I was pretty sure I couldn't handle this problem with code.
(Laughter) Who am I to make a difference?
But I was a resident of this city.
In the years that followed, I learned one very important lesson — a lesson that must be taken seriously if we are to strive for a better future.
Even if you are not an expert in any field, your experience from outside can be the key to solving complex problems in this area.
Sometimes your unique vision can lead to an extraordinary idea that will move everything from the dead end, but you must be brave enough to try to do it.
It's the only way out.
Even then I realized that in order to at least try to change the situation for the better, first I would have to understand air pollution, so I became a student again.
At the very beginning of my research, I learned that air pollution is the main danger to the environment.
According to the World Health Organization, almost 14 percent of deaths worldwide in 2012 were caused by home air pollution and ambient air pollution, which is particularly common in low-and middle-income countries.
Air pollution alone causes more deaths each year than malaria or HIV/AIDS.
In Africa, the number of premature deaths due to unsafe sanitation or malnutrition among children is nothing compared to the number of deaths due to air pollution, and this comes at a huge economic cost: more than $ 400 billion as of 2013, according to a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
Now in my work, I am exploring new opportunities in the field of artificial intelligence, where the symbiotic relationship between man and machine will help to find a favorable basis for making the right decisions.
In the process of studying the problem of air pollution, it became clear that we need to find a way to make better decisions to control air pollution, and given the scale of this problem, it is necessary to do this together.
So I decided to meet people who work in this field.
I started meeting with officials from Johannesburg and other nearby cities, I also engaged the local scientific community, and I also made some cold calls.
The contact-building process I went through helped me gain a deeper understanding of the problem.
It also helped me avoid falling into the trap that my colleagues often fall into when trying to innovate, where we quickly apply the technology before we clearly recognize the problem.
I started thinking about what I could do to improve the situation.
I just started asking myself how I could effectively combine all my programming and artificial intelligence skills with the experiences of the people I met.
I wanted to create an online air quality management platform that would identify patterns in pollution, look into the future, and determine what we should expect.
I was determined to put my idea into practice, but faced with uncertainty, I had no guarantees of success.
I only had a certain set of engineering skills, skills that I had acquired in my profession (Laughter) and that people who have been dealing with air pollution for many years have not had.
I realized that sometimes just one fresh look, some new skills create the conditions for the appearance of something outstanding.
Willpower and imagination are our guiding stars, giving us the ability to find new ways and avoid difficulties.
Armed with a deep understanding of air pollution and decades of accumulated information on pollutant concentrations and meteorological conditions in Johannesburg and beyond, my colleagues from South Africa and China and I have created a cloud-based air decision support system.
The software system analyzes historical data and real-time data to identify spatial and temporal trends.
We then used a new machine learning technology to predict the level of pollution for different pollutants several days in advance.
This means that residents can make better decisions about their movements and where to live for their families.
We will be able to predict cases of pollution in advance, to calculate the culprits of pollution, who, by order of the authorities, will be forced to reduce the scale of their activities.
With the help of scenario planning, urban planners will be able to make the right decisions in the development of infrastructure, such as residential settlements, industrial zones.
We completed testing of our technology, which lasted about 120 days, covering the whole of South Africa.
The results were welcomed when we demonstrated a close relationship between the forecast data and the data we received on-site.
Thanks to our leadership, we have created cutting-edge, groundbreaking technologies that can predict air quality with unprecedented accuracy, improving a city that not so long ago I was driving through one winter morning and thought, " Something is wrong here. What can be done?»
And here's my conclusion: what if I hadn't studied the problem of air pollution back then?
What if I hadn't expressed concern about the state of the environment and just hoped that someone, somewhere, was already dealing with this problem?
Here's what I've learned: when we embark on a challenging venture that promotes what we firmly believe in, it's important to focus on success and consider the consequences of inaction.
We should not go astray in the face of obstacles and difficulties, this should motivate us even more.
No matter where you are, when you realize that your natural curiosity is aroused by something and it is something that excites you, and you have crazy and bold ideas, and perhaps this is beyond your competence, ask yourself: why not?
Why not take action and solve the problem as best you can, in your own way?
And, perhaps, you will be pleasantly surprised.
Thanks.
(Applause)
Republicans will offer to give another $1 trillion to support the US economy
Republicans will offer to spend another $1 trillion to support the United States economy, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin confirmed on Fox News on Sunday, July 26.
"Inside the $1 trillion package, there are the most priority and urgent things," the head of the US Treasury Department said.
The support package includes new direct payments to Americans.
The proposal must be passed by Congress and signed by US President Donald Trump.
Representatives of the US Democratic Party believe that the proposed funds are not enough.
In the spring, the US allocated about $3 trillion to support the economy.
On April 24, Trump signed a bill on financial assistance to the American economy in the amount of almost half a trillion dollars to combat the coronavirus and its consequences.
According to analysts, the US GDP in the second quarter of 2020 will fall by 25% in annual terms, which will be the strongest decline in the history of the country.
Microsoft will forcibly update older versions of Windows 10
Microsoft has confirmed the transition to the next stage of distribution of the May 2020 Update for the Windows 10 operating system, writes the BetaNews portal on July 25.
The package is not needed: the FAS questioned the legality of Microsoft's antivirus offer
Having received software for remote work from an American corporation, government agencies may violate the law
The company will expand the range of users with the new version of the OS.
To do this, computers with older versions of the system will be automatically updated.
It is assumed that a specially developed algorithm by the company will detect devices with older versions of the software platform, whose support period will soon end, and automatically install Windows 10 May 2020 Update on them.
In the near future, this will affect computers with Windows 10 (1809) and Windows 10 (1903), support for which expires on November 10 and December 8, respectively, the publication notes.
On July 21, it was reported that after updating the Windows 10 operating system, users encountered problems when connecting to the Internet - there was no network access.
The difficulties were not related to the connection to the network itself, but to the connection status.
Dr. Myasnikov named the main indicators of human health
In the" deadly quartet", one of the main criteria was the excess of the waist size
Doctor and TV presenter Alexander Myasnikov spoke about the key indicators that can be used to determine a person's health.
His so-called "deadly quartet" included four criteria - an increase in blood pressure, cholesterol, sugar and waist volume, the doctor said on the TV channel "Russia 1".
Myasnikov urged everyone to pay attention to these factors.
Moreover, according to him, controlling the waist size is even more important than the weight.
For men, this parameter should not exceed 102 centimeters, for women-88 centimeters.
Exceeding these standards may indicate that health is at risk.
First of all, we are talking about the state of the heart - the waist size above the norm is a risk factor for stroke, heart attack, as well as cancer and diabetes.
Earlier, Myasnikov told why you can eat candy at night.
The doctor explained that sugar itself is not dangerous to health, the dessert will become harmful only when there is such food in large quantities, and candy at night, according to him, is not the worst snack.
At Igor Drive, the winners in Touring and Super-production were determined
The touring car and Super-production competitions have ended at the Igor Drive circuit, where the main stage of the Russian Circuit Racing series is taking place.
This was reported by Channel Five on Sunday, July 26.
The leaders in Touring were Kirill Ladygin, Dmitry Bragin, Alexey Dudukalo, Pavel Kalmanovich, Ivan Lukashevich.
Andrey Petukhov, Vladislav Nezvankin, Nikolay Vikhansky, Vadim Antipov, Dmitry Lebedev won the Super-production.
In the SMP RSKG Trophy, the best was Rustam Fatkhutdinov, the winners were Lev Tolkachev and Pavel Yashin.
The documentary "John Lewis: Good Trouble" (John Lewis: Good Trouble) has been released online.
The biography film, which was supposed to be a kind of visual greeting to Congressman John Lewis, who celebrated his 80th birthday at the beginning of the year, became an extended epitaph.
On July 17, the prominent human rights activist and politician died after a long battle with pancreatic cancer.
These days, numerous mourning events are held in the United States in memory of him.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House chief of Staff Mark Meadows have floated the idea of passing legislation focused on several topics, including federal unemployment benefits that expire on Friday.
The remaining issues are suggested to be addressed later.
Moderna Inc said on Sunday it had received an additional $ 472 million from the U.S. Office of Advanced Biomedical Research to develop a vaccine for the new coronavirus.
The U.S.-based drugmaker explained that the additional funding is intended to help the company's work in late-stage clinical trials.
Without any warning, the UK removed Spain from the list of safe countries for travel and imposed a two-week quarantine for all those entering the country from Spain.
British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab made no apologies for the sudden decision, attributing it to a recent spike in the incidence of COVID-19 in Spain.
Protests
In a number of cities in the United States, protests were held to draw attention to the problem of racial injustice.
In Seattle, police used stun grenades and tear gas and arrested 45 people after demonstrations in support of the Portland protests turned violent.
Police said more than 20 police officers were injured.
In Austin, Texas, on Saturday, a man was killed when someone shot at participants of the march of the movement "Black lives matter".
According to media reports, the man may have approached the car with a rifle when he was shot at.
Experts from the United States called Pompeo the worst secretary of state in the history of the country
International affairs experts Aaron David Miller and Richard Sokolsky called Mike Pompeo the worst secretary of state in the history of the United States.
The material with their opinion was published by CNN on July 23.
"In just two short years, Mike Pompeo - with an eye on the presidency in 2024 and the support of President Donald Trump-has become not only the worst secretary of state in US history, but also the most politically biased," the text says.
Experts accused Pompeo of "politicizing the position of Secretary of State and defiling the institution he runs" in order to advance his personal political agenda and protect Trump "from responsibility and the rule of law."
According to them, the Secretary of State, in particular, covers up "Trump's blackmail of Ukraine" and is ready to substitute employees of the American foreign Ministry for their cooperation with Congress on this case.
Pompeo was also remembered for being quite friendly with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who claimed partial responsibility for the murder of The Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.
Trump announced the decision to appoint Mike Pompeo as head of the State Department on March 13, 2018, following the firing of former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.
Prior to that, Pompeo was the head of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
In Tikhoretsk, a foreign car drove into a store
Today, July 26, in Tikhoretsk on Menshikov Street, a Land Cruiser SUV drove at speed into the shopping hall of a chain supermarket.
The emergency was recorded by surveillance cameras.
As a result of the accident, a boy was injured, who at that time was in the store.
The child was hospitalized with injuries and cuts.
In the hall of the shopping facility, windows and counters were destroyed.
Eyewitnesses claim that the driver of the foreign car was in a state of alcoholic intoxication.
Do you know how many species of flowering plants there are?
A quarter of a million — at least those we know of-a quarter of a million species of flowering plants.
Flowers are a real problem for plants:
they are hard to create,
they require a huge amount of energy and resources.
Why do plants go to such difficulties?
The answer to this, as well as to many other questions, is sex.
I know what you're thinking when you look at these pictures.
The reason why sexual reproduction is so important is that there are many other ways plants can reproduce.
They can be propagated by cuttings; they can fertilize themselves or pollinate themselves.
But it is very important for them to spread their genes in order to mix them with the genes of other plants - so they can adapt to natural niches.
This is how evolution works.
Plants transmit genetic information through pollen.
Some of you may have seen some of these images before.
As I like to say, every home should have a scanning electron microscope to look at these things.
There are as many different types of pollen as there are flowering plants.
By the way, this can be applied in criminology and not only.
Basically, the pollen that causes allergies is the pollen of plants that use the wind to spread it. This is a very inefficient process, which is why it gets so much stuck in our noses.
Plants have to throw out huge masses of pollen, in the hope that the germ cells, the male germ cells that are contained in the pollen, will somehow accidentally get to another flower, absolutely by accident.
The pollen of all grasses, and therefore of all cereals, and the pollen of most trees, is carried by the wind.
However, most species use insects for this purpose. To some extent, this is more reasonable because it requires less pollen.
Insects and other species can take pollen and transfer it to where it is needed.
It is clear that we know the relationship between insects and plants.
It's a symbiotic relationship: whether it's flies, birds, or bees, they all get something in return, and that something is usually nectar.
In some cases, this symbiosis has led to amazing adaptations — for example, the hummingbird hawk moth is beautiful in its adaptation.
The plant gets its own way - the hawk moth spreads its pollen elsewhere.
The plants have evolved to create small landing strips in different places for the bees so that they don't get lost.
Many plants have a color that makes them look like insects.
These are the anthers of the lily, cleverly made so that when an unsuspecting insect lands on them, the anther turns over and hits it on the back, showering it with a large amount of pollen, with which the insect then goes to another plant.
And here's an orchid that looks like it has jaws. In a sense, it has them, which forces the insect to crawl out, covered with pollen, which it will then spread.
There are at least 20 thousand species of orchids-and all of them are surprisingly diverse.
They go to all sorts of tricks.
They are forced to attract pollinators to reproduce.
This orchid, known as Darwin's orchid because he was the one who studied it and made a startling prediction when he saw it. You can see a very long tube with nectar, which falls from the orchid.
You see the middle of the flower: the insect has to stick its proboscis right in the middle and get to the very bottom of this tube to get the nectar.
Darwin stated, looking at this flower: "I assume something evolved together with it."
And indeed, here is the insect.
Usually its proboscis is rolled up, but in its straightened form it looks like this.
One might think that if the nectar - so valuable and expensive to produce-attracts so much attention from pollinators, then, as with sex in humans, deceptions can begin.
The flower may say, " I have some nectar.
Will you come by?"» Here's a plant.
This is a plant that insects love in South Africa. In the process of evolution, they acquired a long proboscis to get nectar from the bottom.
And this is imitation.
This plant imitates the previous one.
And here is a long-lobed fly, which did not get a drop of nectar from the fake. Because the imitating plant didn't give her anything. She thought she was going to get something.
But not only did the fly not get any nectar from the fake plant, but-if you zoom in-near the bottom of the head, it picked up some pollen, which it will transfer to another plant, unless some botanist comes along and pins it on a blue cardboard box.
(Laughter) Deception is also spreading in the plant kingdom.
This flower has black dots: they look black to us, but for male insects of a certain species, they look like two females ready for anything.
(Laughter) When an insect gets to this flower and lands on it, it dips itself in pollen, which, of course, it will transfer to another plant. If you look through the same scanning electron microscope that should be in every house, you can observe a certain three-dimensional arrangement of the pattern here.
So it probably even brings a pleasant feeling to the insect, in addition to the fact that it looks attractive.
In the picture from the electron microscope-here is an orchid imitating an insect-you can see that different parts of this structure have different colors and textures, but insects can perceive them in a completely different way.
This plant has adapted to imitate the shiny metal surface of the body of some beetles.
Under a scanning electron microscope, you can see that the surface is very different from the surfaces we looked at.
Sometimes the whole plant imitates an insect, even from our point of view.
I think it looks like some kind of flying thing.
This is an amazing, amazing flower.
And smart. It's called obsidian.
I call it the Hythrodian.
For a bee of a certain species, it resembles another very aggressive bee, and it flies up and hits its head many times to drive the "bee" away, and of course gets covered in pollen.
This plant also mimics another orchid, which has a wonderful storehouse of food for insects.
And this one has nothing for them.
So it's cheating on two levels — just unheard of.
(Laughter) Here is ylang-ylang, a component of many perfumes.
I recently smelled someone wearing it.
Flowers in principle do not need to be so fragrant.
They emit a striking range of odors for any insects with a sense of smell.
This one doesn't smell so good.
It's a flower that smells really, really bad, and it's evolved to look like carrion.
This is very popular with flies.
They fly in and pollinate.
This one, the helicodiceros, also known as the"dead horse lily."
I don't know what a dead horse really smells like, but this one definitely smells a lot like it.
It's really awful.
And the meat flies just can't resist.
They fly in and fly all the way to the bottom.
There they lay their eggs, thinking that this is a great piece of carrion, and not realizing that there is no food for the larvae and the larvae will die, but in the meantime the plant has benefited, because the bristles relax, and the fly flies away to pollinate the next flower. It's amazing.
Here is arum, arum maculatum, or in the USA-arum mottled.
I photographed it the previous week in Dorset.
It warms up to about 15 degrees above ambient temperature-amazing.
If you look at it from above, you can see something like a dam behind the cob. The flies are attracted to the heat-the evaporation of volatile compounds - and they get stuck down in this container.
They drink the divine nectar and become sticky.
During the night, they are covered with pollen, flowing around them from above, and then the bristles, which we saw above, weaken and release the flies covered with pollen. An amazing thing.
If you think it's amazing, here's one of my favorites.
Philodendron Sello.
Those from Brazil should know about this plant.
This is the most amazing thing.
This phallic thing is about 30 centimeters long.
It does something that no other plant I know of does: when it blooms - there's an ear in the middle — for about two days, its metabolism is similar to that of a mammal.
Instead of starch, which is food for plants, it takes something similar to brown fat and burns it at such a speed, digesting it just like a small cat.
This energy output, in equivalent weight, is twice as high as that of a hummingbird — absolutely astounding.
And it also does something else, also unusual.
Not only does it heat itself up to 115 degrees Fahrenheit, or 43-44 degrees Celsius, for two days, but it also keeps the temperature constant.
It has a thermoregulation mechanism that maintains a constant temperature.
You may ask: "Why is he doing this?»
Well, as if you didn't know that there are bugs that just love to make love at this temperature.
They get inside, and that's where it starts.
(Laughter) And the plant showers them with pollen, and they go to pollinate.
Surprisingly well thought out.
Most of the pollinators we know are insects, but in the tropics, many birds and butterflies also pollinate.
Many tropical flowers are red, and it seems to us that all this is because butterflies and birds have vision similar to ours, and that they see red very well.
But if you look at the spectrum, the person and the bird see red, green and blue-they see this spectrum.
Insects also see green, blue and ultraviolet light, and they distinguish different shades of ultraviolet light,
which are at this end of the spectrum.
You probably think, " It would be great if we could see them."
Yes, we can.
So what does the insect see?
Last week, I took these photos of the sunflowers, the incense family, in Dorset.
These are the small yellow flowers that we see everywhere.
This is what it looks like in daylight.
And this is what it looks like if you remove the red one.
Most bees don't see red.
Then I put UV filters on the camera and took a very, very long exposure with certain UV frequencies, and this is what happened.
The most that neither is "bullseye".
Of course, we know exactly what the bees see, no more than you know what I see when I call this red.
We can't tell what's going on in a neighbor's mind, let alone an insect.
But the picture will be about the same contrast, strongly standing out in the background.
Here is another small flower — a different range of ultraviolet frequencies, different filters, to match the pollinators.
They'll see something like this.
In case you think this applies to all yellow flowers — no flowers were damaged during the shooting process, this one was just attached to a tripod, not torn off - when they are in ultraviolet light, then take a look at this one.
By the way, it could serve as the basis of a sunscreen, because such creams work by absorbing ultraviolet light.
Maybe this connection would be useful.
Finally, here is one of the oenothers that Bjorn Rorslett from Norway sent me — a fantastic hidden pattern.
I like the idea of something hidden.
I think there's something poetic about it. These photos were taken with an ultraviolet filter, which is mainly used by astronomers to photograph Venus — in fact, the clouds of Venus.
This is the main purpose of this filter.
Venus, of course, is the goddess of love and fertility, and this is in tune with flowers.
Not only do flowers spend a lot of effort attracting pollinators, they also somehow managed to convince us to plant whole fields of flowers and give them to each other at the moments of birth and death, and in particular at a wedding, which, if you think about it, is a moment that represents the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another.
Thank you very much.

In China, the Yangtze River experienced the third flood in a year
After a heavy rainstorm in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River-the longest waterway in China-for the third time in a year, there were floods.
The flood was caused by an increase in the water level in the tributaries of the river in its upper course, which led to a rapid increase in the flow of water into the reservoir of the Chinese hydroelectric power station "Sanxia "/"Three Gorges"/.
At 14: 00 on July 26, an inflow of 50 thousand cubic meters/s was observed in the reservoir, which is expected to reach its maximum of 60 thousand cubic meters/s in the evening of July 27, the Yangtze River Water Management Committee under the Ministry of Water Resources of the People's Republic of China reported.
The Committee today issued flood alerts on one of the sections of the upper Yangtze River and the overflow of the Sanxia hydroelectric power station reservoir.
My job is to help computers make messages about the world around them.
There are many ways to do this, but I like to help computers communicate what they see and understand.
For example, in this picture, a modern computer vision algorithm can recognize that this is a woman and this is a dog.
He can tell that the woman is smiling.
He is even able to say that the dog is extremely cute.
I work on this by thinking about how people understand and process data about the world.
What thoughts, memories and stories can awaken in people such a picture here.
Everything related to such situations.
You may have seen a similar dog before, or spent time running on the beach in the same way, and this, in turn, brings up thoughts and memories of the past vacation, the time spent on the beach, or the time when you ran somewhere with other dogs.
One of my main principles is to help computers understand what it means to have such an experience, to understand what we share, what we believe and what we feel, because then we will be ready to start involving computer technology in processes that complement our own experience.
If you dig deeper, a few years ago I started helping computers write stories based on a series of images.
And one day in the course of work, I asked the computer what it thought about going to Australia.
He looked at the pictures and saw a koala.
He didn't know what a koala was, but he said he thought it was a curious creature.
Then I shared with him a series of images about burning houses.
He looked at the pictures and said, " Amazing view! Amazing!»
A shiver ran down my spine.
He looked at the terrible, life-destroying event and thought it was something positive.
I realized that he recognized the contrasts, the shades of red and yellow, and thought that this deserved a positive assessment.
In part, he did this because most of the images I gave him were positive.
Because people tend to share positive images when they talk about their experiences.
When was the last time you saw a selfie at a funeral?
I realized that by improving artificial intelligence, task by task, data array by data array, I had created huge gaps, holes, and gaps in what it could understand.
And in doing so, I encoded all possible kinds of biases.
Biases that reflect a limited vision, limited by a single set of data. Gaps that reflect human biases encoded in the data, such as biases and stereotypes.
I thought about the evolution of technology that led me to where I was then — how the first color photos were calibrated to the skin of white women, which means that color photos were not adapted to dark faces.
And the same bias, the same gap was observed in the 90s.
And the same information gap we have today is how well we can recognize a variety of human faces with facial recognition technology.
I was thinking about the latest research, where we tend to limit our thinking to one set of data and one problem.
And in doing so, we created more and more gaps and biases that the AI could develop even more.
I realized that we need to think more about what the technologies we are working with today will look like in 5 and 10 years.
Humanity evolves slowly, eventually correcting problems in the interaction of people and the environment.
Artificial intelligence, on the other hand, is evolving at an incredible rate.
And that means it's really important to think carefully about it right now - to reflect on our own gaps, our own biases, and how this affects the technologies we create, and to discuss what modern technology will mean in the future.
Top managers and scientists around the world talk about what they think artificial intelligence will be in the future.
Stephen Hawking warns: "AI can end humanity."
Elon Musk warns that this is one of the greatest existential risks that our civilization has ever faced.
Bill Gates is perplexed: "I don't understand why people aren't concerned."
But these opinions are only part of the story.
Mathematics, models, the fundamental building blocks of artificial intelligence — this is what we call access and what we work with.
We have open source tools for machine learning and intelligence that we are willing to share.
And in addition, we can share our experience.
Share your knowledge about technology, and how it bothers us, and how it excites us.
We can discuss what we love.
We can anticipate which aspects of technology may eventually become the most useful and which may become the most problematic.
If we all focus on an open dialogue about AI in the future, it will help create an atmosphere of shared awareness about what AI is now, what it can become, and what we need to do to get the most appropriate result for us.
We already see and know all this about the technologies used today.
We use smartphones, digital assistants, and robot vacuum cleaners.
Are they evil?
Maybe sometimes.
Are they useful?
Definitely.
And they are all different.
And in them, you already see a ray of light illuminating our future.
The future begins in what we create and build right now.
We are launching the domino effect that will determine the path of AI development.
Right now, we are shaping the AI of the future.
Technologies that immerse us in augmented reality, bring back to life past worlds.
Technologies that help people share experiences when they have difficulty communicating.
Technologies based on an understanding of streaming visual worlds are being used for self-driving cars.
Technologies based on image understanding and language generation are being transformed into technologies that help visually impaired people better access the visual world.
But we also see how technology can lead to problems.
Today, we have technologies that analyze our innate physical characteristics — such as skin color or facial features-to determine whether we might be criminals or terrorists.
We have technology that analyzes data about us, even data like gender or race, to determine if we can get credit.
All that we see now is just one frame from the evolution of artificial intelligence.
Because where we are now is just a moment of this evolution.
This means that everything we do today will have an impact on our future.
If we want AI to evolve to help humans, we need to define the goals and strategies that will set this path now.
I would like to see something that suits people well, blends in with our culture and environment.
Technologies that help those of us who suffer from neurological or other diseases to make life equally difficult for everyone.
Technologies that work regardless of your skin color or demographic characteristics.
Today I am focused on the technologies that will be with us tomorrow and in 10 years.
AI can become anything.
But in this case, it's not a self-driving car with no final destination.
This machine is controlled by us.
We choose when to speed up and when to slow down.
We choose when we need to turn.
We choose what the AI of the future will be like.
There are countless things that artificial intelligence can become.
And it will become a multitude of things.
And our task today is to find out exactly what we need to invest in AI, so that the results obtained will be the best for all of us.
Thanks

The reason was the sports facilities, in the construction of which the late father of the champion, Honored Coach of Russia Abdulmanap Nurmagomedov showed great interest.
We are talking about a sports complex in the village of Dubki, Kazbekov district, and a sports training Center for martial arts in the village of Sildi, Tsumadinsky district.
First of all, Vladimir Vasiliev noted that now the construction of these sports facilities is also a tribute to the memory of the great coach.
The father of the baby abducted in Salsk revealed the details of the incident
The father of a newborn who was abducted from a maternity hospital in Salsk, Rostov region, revealed the details of the incident.
Alexander Rusikov told the TV channel" 360 " that the kidnapper went into the room of his wife when she was going to go to the toilet.
The mother of the abducted baby could not even think that a person with malicious intent could be in the maternity hospital.
The woman moved away from the ward just a couple of meters away when she heard a neighbor's scream.
The baby was no longer in the room.
According to Rusikov, everything happened between three and four o'clock in the morning.
He also said that the wife's ward is located between two medical posts, but at the time of the incident, there were no nurses on the spot.
Also, the father of the abducted baby said that there were no comments or apologies from the hospital staff.
Recall that the newborn boy, abducted on Saturday from the maternity hospital in Salsk, was found on the same day in the Republic of Kalmykia.
Police arrested a 40-year-old suspect in the kidnapping.
The child has already been returned to the mother.
Doctors took tests from the baby to make sure that he was healthy and not injured.

The expert assessed the role of vitamins in the formation of immunity
Andrey Tyazhelnikov, chief freelance specialist in primary health care for adults of the Moscow Department of Health, assessed the role of vitamins in the formation of immunity.
"It is impossible to create a stable immune system in a very short time with extra doses of some drugs, vitamins or food products, "he said in an interview with the radio station"Says Moscow".
According to him, there are certain rules.
For example, in the summer it is better to spend more time outdoors, including under the sun.
Tyazhelnikov also noted that in the summer, if possible, you need to consume a large amount of seasonal fresh vegetables and fruits.
"It generally strengthens the immune system, gives a certain amount of vitamins and a certain amount of health," he added.
Earlier, Tyazhelnikov named several differences between the flu and the coronavirus.
In Russia, 5765 patients with COVID-19 were registered per day
In Russia, 5765 new cases of coronavirus infection were detected during the day by July 26, the stopcoronavirus website reports.russian Federation according to the federal operational headquarters.
For all the time of observations in Russia, 812,485 cases of COVID-19 were recorded.
During the day, 77 people with confirmed coronavirus died, and the total number of COVID-19-related deaths in Russia reached 13,269.
The number of COVID-19 cases in the world has exceeded 16 million, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
More than 4.1 million of them are in the United States, and more than 2.3 million are in Brazil.
Russia ranks fourth in the world in the total number of cases, and third behind India (1.3 million cases).
In total, more than 644,000 people have died from the coronavirus worldwide, and more than 9.2 million have been cured.
The head of the region Igor Kobzev met with the mayors of the Ust-Orda Buryat district
During the working meeting, which took place today, July 24, in the government of the Irkutsk region, the main directions of development of remote agricultural territories were discussed.
During working trips to the districts of the Ust-Orda Buryat District, the head of the region gave a number of instructions.
Today, the mayors reported on their implementation.
First of all, the construction of the Sports House in Ust-Orda was resumed.
The order for this object was given by the President of the Russian Federation fourteen years ago.
But only now the situation was able to move from the dead end.
866 million rubles will be spent on the construction.
The construction completion date is 2022.
And this year, a school in the village of Bayandai should be put into operation.
At the moment, the finishing of the premises has been completed.
Of the remaining works - landscaping of the territory.
In general, the program of construction of pre-school and secondary education facilities is of particular importance for the region.
Especially for your district.
The demographic situation here is the best in the region.
And we are obliged to create all conditions for education and leisure of children of all ages, - said the acting Governor of the Irkutsk region Igor Kobzev.
At the meeting, the head of the region instructed all mayors to actively participate in the work on the development of general plans for settlements.
This is one of the main conditions for the integrated development of the district.
All localities must have established borders and a master plan.
This is necessary for the development of the territory, for the construction of socially significant objects, as well as infrastructure and cultural heritage, " the head of the region stressed.
Also, during the conversation, a problematic issue was raised with a reduction in the intake of milk from cooperatives by 30%.
This was due to the redistribution of milk purchases by the processing enterprise in favor of peasant farms.
Because of this, the share of receiving products from cooperatives has decreased.
The head of the region instructed the acting Minister of Agriculture to go to the site, study the structure of milk sales, analyze the experience of other territories and determine solutions to the problem.
Kuzminov won two races of the second stage of the NSR RSKG on "Igor Drive".
The second race of the second stage of the NSR RSKG championship was held at "Igora Drive".
Pavel Kuzminov won the second consecutive victory.
He started fifth, but took the lead on the first lap.
Alexander Dudarev, who became the second, rose from the sixth position.
Sergey Tikhomirov lost his position, beat off the attacks of Alexander Chernyak and first secured third place, but received a drive through penalty and after driving through the pitlane, he was eliminated from the fight for the podium.
The third was Ivan Pugachev, who won back five positions.
The authorities of the Moscow region told about the fate of closed landfills
In the Moscow region, landfills of solid household waste continue to be closed.
This year, the authorities promise to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 existing landfills in the region are being upgraded into modern waste processing complexes.
But this option is not possible for every landfill - many of them are overgrown with dense residential buildings.
After the landfill is closed, it gets up for reclamation - the body of the landfill is poured with soil, systems of degassing and removal of infiltrate are installed.
This allows you to stop the chemical processes inside the landfill, so that it does not ignite, does not exude a stench, does not poison the soil and groundwater.
And then the former landfill remains a towering useless pile in the midst of the surrounding residential development.
Why not make something useful out of it?
For example, in Ruza, where the reclamation of the Annino landfill was completed just a few days ago, the authorities are considering making a ski slope out of the pile.
This landfill, which was operated from 1976 to 2016, has grown so much that it has gone beyond the boundaries of the land allocated for it.
Therefore, during the reclamation, it was necessary to buy out the neighboring plots, de facto long ago clogged with garbage to the brim.
"Some time will pass, the landfill will "settle down", gain strength, and we will think about what can be done to make it useful.
Right in the eye catches - a ski resort, " - told reporters the head of the Ruz district Nikolai Parfenov.
Two landfills will become sites for the production of renewable energy sources
The Torbeevo landfills in Lyubertsy and Timokhovo landfills in Bogorodsky District will become sites for the production of renewable energy sources from landfill and biological gases.
By the end of the year, a gas-piston power plant will be launched on the territory of Torbeyev, capable of generating up to 8 million kilowatt - hours of electricity per year and about 0.95 gigacalories of thermal energy, which will provide the landfill's own needs-heat supply to administrative and industrial premises.
Timokhovo will produce 72.5 million kilowatt-hours and will continue to operate as a waste processing complex.
And a museum can be created at the Kuchino training ground in Balashikha, which was closed after complaints from residents about the "Direct Line" with the president of the country.
"There was such an idea - to create a museum of recultivation of landfills in the Moscow region," said Dmitry Kurakin, Deputy Chairman of the government - Minister of Ecology and Nature Management of the region.
Israel reported the crash of a drone in southern Lebanon
An Israeli army drone crashed in southern Lebanon.
The Armed Forces reported that it collapsed "during operational activities."
The reasons for the fall of the device are not reported.
"Some time ago, during operational activities near the border with Lebanon, an unmanned aerial vehicle of the Israeli army fell on Lebanese territory.
There is no risk of information leakage, " the Israeli army said on Twitter.
Recall that this week the Israeli army decided to strengthen its military units on the border with Lebanon, fearing revenge of the Lebanese movement "Hezbollah" for the killings of its fighters in Syria.
The leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, promised not to leave the death of any of his "brothers" unanswered.
Read more about the situation in the material "Kommersant ""Israel is waiting for revenge "Hezbollah".
the replacement of Furgal for the first time came to the protesters
Acting Governor of the Khabarovsk Territory Mikhail Degtyarev for the first time after the appointment came to the participants of the actions in support of the arrested ex-head of the region Sergey Furgal.
The meeting was broadcast on his Instagram page.
"Moscow hears everyone, so I sent you an acting head, so that the region does not slip without power... I repeat about Furgal once again: he is "a" - my friend, "b" - a fellow party member, "c" - I am very worried about his fate, the party is helping him, handing him food, Zhirinovsky knocks on all the offices, " the acting governor said.
According to Degtyarev, now the Khabarovsk Territory can not remain without a leader, so he was appointed by the decree of President Vladimir Putin to the post of head of the region, so that "the wonderful building (the government of the region) functions, everything works, the budget is spent on social needs."
The acting governor explained that he did not go out to the protesters before, because he could not communicate with thousands of demonstrators.
Therefore, he conducts broadcasts in social networks and reads all the comments on them.
On July 25, two consecutive protests were held in Khabarovsk.
Rallies in support of the former governor have been held in the region since July 11.
On the eve of the next rally, Mikhail Degtyarev said that he would leave the city on the day of the rally.
His motorcade was stopped by protesters and urged to speak out about the fate of the arrested ex-governor of Furgal.
Degtyarev previously refused to go out to the participants of the actions.
"There is something to really do for the head, than to go out and communicate with those who shout under the windows," said the acting governor.
Today I would like to show you how we will do different things in the future.
I believe that soon our buildings and machines will be self-assembling, reproducing and repairing themselves.
So, I'm going to show you what I think is the current stage of industrial development, and then compare it to some natural systems.
So, at the current stage of industrial development, we have skyscrapers-2.5 years, from 500,000 to a million parts, quite complex, new amazing technologies in steel, concrete and glass.
We have amazing machines that can take us to space-5 years, 2.5 million parts.
But on the other hand, if we look at natural systems, we see proteins of two million species that can assemble in 10,000 nanoseconds, or a DNA chain with three billion base pairs that we can copy in about an hour.
So natural systems, for all their complexity, are extremely efficient, far more efficient than anything we can build, far more complex than anything we can build.
They are much more efficient in terms of energy.
They are almost never wrong.
And they can regenerate themselves over a long lifetime.
So, there is something very interesting about natural systems.
And if we can bring that into our man-made environment, our way of creating things will have tremendous potential.
And I think the key is self - assembly.
So, if we want to use self-assembly in our physical environment, I think we need to consider four key factors.
First, we need to decipher the complexity of what we want to build - our buildings and machines.
And you need to decompose them into a simple sequence - the basic DNA of the construction processes.
Then we will need programmable parts that can understand this sequence and use it to collapse or reassemble.
We will need some amount of energy that will allow us to activate all this, make the parts able to assemble according to the program.
And we need some kind of fallback bug-fixing system to ensure that what we want is built successfully.
I'm going to show you some of the projects that my colleagues at EmAiTi and I are working on to achieve this self-assembling future.
The first two are MacroBot and DeciBot.
These projects are large-scale reconfigurable robots-2.5 and 3.5 meter squirrels.
They have built-in mechanical electrical devices, sensors.
You write out what you want to curl up into, a sequence of angles-minus 120, minus 120, 0, 0, 120, minus 120 - something like that; a sequence of angles or turns, and you send that sequence down the cord.
Each block receives its own message-minus 120. He turns at this angle, checks if everything is correct, and passes the information to the neighbor.
And these are the brilliant scientists, engineers, and designers who worked on this project.
And I think it really brings out the question: is there a different scale possible here?
I mean, thousands of dollars, a lot of man-hours to make this 2.5-meter robot.
Can we actually zoom in? Can we really build robotics into every part?
The next project solves this question, considers the passive character, or tries to obtain modifiability passively.
But it goes a step further and tries to get a real calculation.
At its core, it has the most fundamental building block of computing, the logic element of a digital integrated circuit directly in each part.
This is the "And-NOT" element.
You have one tetrahedron element that will do all the calculations, and two tetrahedrons to input.
One is for user input, this is how you lay the bricks.
The other is for information from the previous laid brick.
And then it outputs the information in three-dimensional space.
So, this means that the user can start running moving the bricks in the desired direction.
His calculations are based on what was done earlier and what you told him to do.
And now it begins to move in three-dimensional space-up or down.
On the left side, [1,1] input is 0 on the output, moving down.
On the right side, [0,0] input is 1 on the output, which means moving up.
And what's really important, our structures now contain blueprints for what we want to build.
They contain all the information about what was built.
So, this means that we have some form of self-reproduction.
In this case, I call it self-directed reproduction, because the structures contain clear drawings.
If errors appear, you can replace the part.
All local information is saved so that you know how to fix it.
So you can have something that moves and reads the information and can transfer it from one part to another.
It is built directly inside, without external control.
The latest project I'm going to show you is called Biased Circuits, and it's probably the most exciting example of what we have right now of passive self-assembling systems.
It combines the ability to reconfigure and program and creates a completely passive system.
At the core, we have a chain of elements.
All elements are completely identical, and are offset.
So every chain or every element wants to turn right or left.
And when you assemble a circuit, you are essentially programming it.
You tell each block where it should turn: to the right or to the left.
So when you shake the chain, it collapses into the configuration you have programmed - in this case, a spiral, or in this case, two cubes next to each other.
So in general, you can program any three-dimensional shape - or one-dimensional, two-dimensional-from these completely passive circuits.
So, what does this tell us about the future?
I think it tells us that there are new possibilities for self-assembly, replication, repair in our physical structures, buildings, machines.
New programming is possible in these parts.
And from here, you have new possibilities in computing.
We will have spatial computers.
Imagine that our buildings, our bridges, our cars, all our bricks could do calculations.
This is an amazing parallel and distributed computing power, new design possibilities.
This is an incredible potential.
I think that the projects I have shown you are only a small step towards the future, if we implement these new technologies, towards a new self-assembling future.
Thanks.

The number of deaths from coronavirus in the world has exceeded 640 thousand
More than 15.7 million people are infected
The number of victims of the coronavirus in the world has exceeded 640 thousand, almost 15.7 million cases of infection have been confirmed.
Such data on Sunday, July 26, leads the World Health Organization (WHO).
According to the information provided, over the past day, 200,625 new cases of coronavirus infection and 4,823 deaths were detected in the world.
During the entire time of the pandemic, 15,785,641 cases of coronavirus infection have already been recorded in the world, and the number of deaths has increased to 640,016.
The United States remains the leader in the number of infected and dead people, where more than 4.3 million infected people and more than 149 thousand deaths have already been registered.
In the second place of the anti-rating is Brazil, where the number of cases at the moment has exceeded 2.4 million, and 86.5 thousand patients with coronavirus have already died.
Next comes India, with 1.4 million infected and almost 33,000 dead.
Recall, a day earlier, the number of people infected with coronavirus in the world during the day broke a new record.
In 24 hours, doctors identified 284,196 new cases.
The previous record was 247,225 infected.
what connected the Vatican and Nazi Germany
This week, the next date is 87 years since the conclusion of the treaty between the Vatican and Nazi Germany.
The document, signed a few months after Hitler came to power, became the basis on which the relations of the Holy See with the fascists were built.
One of those who prepared the treaty was Cardinal Pacelli, who 6 years later, before the outbreak of World War II, became Pontiff Pius XII.
In Sochi, the body of a dump truck collapsed on the cab of a truck, killing the driver.
The Network has released footage of an accident that occurred last Saturday, July 25, at a construction site in Sochi.
The recording shows how during unloading operations, the raised body of the dump truck collapsed down, landing directly in the cab of the truck.
According to the Ministry of Emergency Situations, a 59-year-old man who was driving died on the spot from his injuries.
To recover the body of the deceased, it took the help of rescuers.
Beautiful high minarets only decorated Hagia Sophia
Once again about Hagia Sophia-I came across the text of fr.Vladimir Zelinsky, that, they say, it is necessary to protest.
First, there was a free entrance-hooray!
I have not been to Istanbul, but the House of God is better to have free entrance than paid.
Secondly, the Muslims just as honestly conquered this land as the Orthodox conquered the Volga-Oka interfluve, the Muslim Caucasus (and set up a church in Grozny) and planted apple trees on Mars.
God help you!
The Jews conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans have conquered America.
Are we going to give everything back to everyone?
Do you think there are no pagans who will demand the return of their temple, on the site of which there is a Tithe Church?
Third, the Muslims have improved this building and invested in it.
That is, it belongs to them, just like the factories and estates that the Leninists took from the bourgeoisie as their property, belong to the Leninists - Putin and other nomenclature.
They've improved everything from the Kremlin to the Hangar, so it's all their rightful progressors.
Beautiful high minarets very decorated Hagia Sophia, very much.
There was a stupid inkwell, there was a stupid inkwell with beautiful minarets.
Fourth, there are no "Islamic" or "Orthodox" civilizations.
There are believers, there are hypocrites, there are hypocrites who combine faith and hypocrisy.
The believer does not think in terms of civilization.
This is the thinking of the official of the British Foreign Ministry Toynbee, a believer is ashamed to think so.
And the believer has a place of prayer everywhere.
And always.
The believer does not pray only where he is asked to leave - he goes to another place and prays there.
He's a believer, not a champion.
We are koloboks, not moody stones.

During the broadcast of the parade on the Day of the Navy, the camera " passed under the ship"
Also on Victory Day, the camera flew through the barrel of a tank
Today, on July 26, a parade in honor of the Day of the Navy is held in St. Petersburg.
During the shooting, one of the cameras that filmed the equipment "passed under the ship."
The use of new shooting technology allowed the audience to see the underwater part of the parade.
In the same perspective, the course of the latest serial small rocket ship "Sovetsk"was shown.
It passed along the Admiralty Embankment.
Recall that at the parade on June 24, dedicated to the 75th anniversary of the Victory, the camera passed through the barrel into the tower of one of the tanks and showed what equipment is inside the grandiose military vehicle.
Then, a record number of military equipment - 234 combat vehicles-took part in the Victory Day parade.
They showed a lot of new products that went to the main square of the country for the first time, for example, upgraded main battle tanks T-90M and T-80BVM.
On June 24, the updated BMP-2M infantry fighting vehicles with the Berezhok combat module also passed through Red Square for the first time.
Almost half of Britons believe the Kremlin interfered in the Brexit referendum
Almost half of Britons - 49% - believe that Russia tried to influence the course of the 2016 referendum on the UK's exit from the European Union.
This is reported by the Guardian newspaper with reference to the results of a survey conducted by Opinium.
It is reported that 23% of respondents hold the opposite opinion on this issue.
47% of respondents also believe that the Kremlin interfered in the last general election in the UK in 2019.
July will leave with the heat, August will start with the cool
Over the weekend, Moscow and the region experienced the coldest night in July.
No chilling soul and body apocalypse frosts, of course, did not happen.
But for the top of the summer-chilly.
Before you talk about the weather in Moscow on July 27 - August 2, 2020, it is worth noting that on the night of Saturday, July 25, the air in the capital cooled to +8.8 degrees.
In Kolomna, a new temperature record was even set: +7 degrees (the previous minimum for July 25 was held since 1964, more than half a century).
Cherusti became the cold pole near Moscow - there the thermometers showed +3.9 degrees.
However, in the afternoon and on Saturday and Sunday it was quite comfortable.
Although compared to the climatic norms, it is still 2-3 degrees cooler.
On working days, not just heat will return to Moscow, but real heat.
On Monday, July 27, the Hydrometeorological Center of Russia promises +26 degrees, on Tuesday and Wednesday +28...+29, on Thursday, July 30, +26 degrees.
Short rains-every day, in the middle of the week with thunderstorms.
The last day of July and the first days of August (that is, the next weekend) will be cool, not higher than +19...+24 degrees.
And it will not do without precipitation.
A native of Rwanda admitted that he set fire to the cathedral in Nantes
A native of Rwanda, who worked at the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul in the French city of Nantes on a voluntary basis, confessed to setting it on fire a week after the fire.
This is reported on Sunday by the TV channel "France-3".
According to him, the man who was already detained on July 19, the day after the fire, was detained again the day before.
He appeared before an investigating judge on Saturday evening.
After being charged with intentional damage to property, the man admitted to setting fires in three places - under a large organ, under a small organ and near an electrical panel.
Now he faces up to 10 years in prison and 150 thousand euros in fines.
The motives for the actions of the 39-year-old native of Rwanda have not yet been reported.
It is only known that he voluntarily helped in the cathedral and on the day of the fire had to close its doors.
However, according to CCTV footage, he left the religious institution 15 minutes after receiving calls about a fire in the building.
The fire in the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul occurred on July 18.
More than 200 firefighters fought for several hours for the monument of Gothic architecture.
However, they were unable to save the stained glass windows of the time of Louis XII and the unique organ of the Baroque era.
The situation was brought under control only three hours after the fire started.
As a result of the incident, no one was injured.
The current fire is not the first in the history of the temple.
In 1972, a fire destroyed its roof.
It took 13 years to eliminate the consequences of that fire.
For parishioners, the cathedral was reopened only in 1985.
Legendary travelling goalkeeper Pfannenstiel could become an Inter scout.
Former German goalkeeper Lutz Pfannenstiel may join Inter's staff.
According to Kicker, the 47-year-old specialist was given the position of head of the scout department.
Pfannenstiel held a similar position at Fortuna Dusseldorf from December 2018 to May 2020, and before that he worked at Hoffenheim.
When he was a football player, Pfannenstiel became famous for his frequent transitions.
He is the only professional player who has played in all six FIFA confederations, has changed more than 20 clubs, including representatives of the championships of Singapore, South Africa, New Zealand, Canada, Namibia and a number of other countries.
It is believed that only sighted people can drive a car.
Until recently, it was believed that for a blind person, safe and independent driving is an impossible task.
Hello, I'm Denis Hong, and we give the blind freedom and independence by designing cars for the visually impaired.
Before I talk about this car for the blind, I'll briefly talk about another project I've been working on, called the DARPA Urban Challenge.
The project was to create a self-driving robot car.
The driver presses "start", and without his participation, the car reaches its destination.
In 2007, our team won half a million dollars, taking third place in this competition.
Around the same time, the National Federation of the Blind, or NSF, set a research committee the task of developing a car that could be driven independently and safely by a blind person.
We decided to try our hand at it because we thought, " Hey, what's so hard about that?
We already have an autonomous car.
We put a blind man in it , and that's the end of it, isn't it?»
(Laughter) But we were deeply mistaken.
The NSF wanted to get not just a car that would transport the blind, but a car that the blind could drive independently.
So we had to reject everything and start from scratch.
So, to test this crazy idea, we developed a small prototype buggy car to test the feasibility of the project.
And in the summer of 2009, we invited blind young people from all over the country and gave them the opportunity to experience this car.
It was an amazing experience.
But the catch is that this car was designed to be driven in a strictly controlled environment, namely in a flat, enclosed parking lot, where even the traffic lanes are limited by red signal cones.
Due to this success, we decided to take the next big step and develop a real car that could be driven on real roads.
So, how does it work?
Well, it's quite a complex system, but let me clarify, maybe even simplify it.
So, it includes three components.
These are tactile perception, computation, and non-visual interfaces.
Since the driver can't see anything, the system must perceive the environment and collect information for the driver.
For this purpose, the initial parameter meter is used.
It measures acceleration, angular acceleration, like a person's inner ear.
This information is then transmitted to the GPS device to estimate the vehicle's location.
Two cameras are used to detect traffic lanes on the road
and three laser rangefinders.
Lasers scan the space around the car to detect various objects: an approaching oncoming or overtaking car, any obstacles encountered on the road or around the car.
Then all this huge amount of information is fed into the computer, and the computer performs two steps.
First of all, it is processing this information to get an idea of the space: determining traffic lanes on the road, identifying obstacles, and then communicating this information to the driver.
The system is also smart enough to calculate the safest way to drive a car.
So, we can also give recommendations on how to operate the car.
But the problem is how to convey this information and instructions to a blind person who does not have the quick and accurate reaction necessary for driving?
For this purpose, we have developed a number of interface technologies for the blind:
A three-dimensional ping sound system, a vibrating vest, a steering wheel with beeps, a special prosthetic leg, and even shoes that put pressure on the foot.
But today we will only talk about three types of these special interfaces.
The first interface is called DriveGrip.
This is a pair of gloves with motors on the knuckles of the fingers, instructing the driver how to steer: the direction and angle of rotation.
The other device is SpeedStrip.
Initially, this is a massage chair.
It was disassembled and the vibrating elements were rearranged in it. Vibration is used to transmit speed information to the driver, as well as to guide the use of the gas and brake pedals.
So, here you can see how the computer perceives the space around the car. And since the vibration cannot be seen, red LEDs are installed on the driver to demonstrate the process.
This is sensory data, which is transmitted to the devices via a computer.
The DriveGrip and SpeedStrip devices are very efficient.
But the problem is that these are educational prompting devices.
They don't actually give you the freedom to manage, do they?
The on-board computer gives the driver commands: "left", "right", "speed up", "stop".
We call him the " annoying backseat passenger."
Therefore, we are moving away from educational prompting devices and focusing on informing devices.
An excellent example of such an interface is AirPix.
This is a kind of monitor for the blind.
A small panel with many holes through which compressed air escapes, thereby creating images.
A blind person can put their palm up to this panel and "see" the traffic lanes on the roadway and obstacles.
Also, the driver can change the frequency with which the air exits and, possibly, the air temperature.
That is, it is an interface for displaying multidimensional data.
So, here you can see the left and right camera of the car, and how the computer processes and sends this information to the AirPix panel.
Here we demonstrate a simulator, a blind person driving a car using AirPix.
This simulator turned out to be very useful for training blind drivers, as well as for quickly testing ideas for using different types of special interfaces.
This is how the system works in short.
After all, this is a prototype car for the blind. And they won't let him out on the roadway until they're sure he's absolutely safe.
And I sincerely believe that this is quite likely.
And yet, will society accept such a radical idea?
How much will the rules of car insurance change?
Under what conditions will a driver's license be issued?
Beyond the technological challenges, there are so many pitfalls that need to be overcome before this becomes a reality.
Of course, the main goal of this project is to develop a car for the blind.
However, it is possible that the side technologies developed during this project will prove to be an invaluable contribution to our lives.
Our sensors work regardless of the time of day, fog, or rain.
We can use these technologies together with new special interfaces to improve the safety of cars for the sighted.
Or for the blind. Find their use in everyday household appliances, in educational institutions, in offices.
Just imagine: the teacher in the classroom writes on the blackboard, and the blind student can see and read what is written using these special interfaces.
It's priceless.
So what I have shown you today is just the beginning.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
The second trailer for "Bill and Ted" with Keanu Reeves has been released
The second trailer for the third part of the "Bill and Ted" franchise has appeared on the YouTube channel of the Orion Pictures film studio.
The trailer reveals some details from the current life of the bosom friends: they settled in a suburban area, married to their girlfriends Joanna (Jaima Mays) and Elizabeth (Erinn Hayes) from " The Incredible Adventures of Bill and Ted "(1989), moreover, the restless adventurers have long been raising daughters.
Brigitte Lundy-Payne ("The Glass Castle"," Atypical") plays Billie, Ted's daughter, and Samara Weaving ("I'm Going Looking") plays Thea, Bill's daughter (yes, Bill and Ted named their daughters Billie and Thea, such a pun).
On top of all this, they are waiting for another great adventure: they must go to the future to steal their own song - the only way they can save the whole world.
In the trailer, you can also see the American rapper Kid Cudi and William Sadler ("August Rush"," Death in Spite"," Green Mile"), again playing the role of Death.
The film was originally scheduled to be released on August 21, but the date was pushed back to September 1.
It is reported that the creators do not plan to reschedule the release date of the film.
The picture will also be immediately available online.
Earlier, we wrote that Keanu Reeves will become a writer of comics about the demigod Berserk.
I want you to think for a second that almost all of our knowledge of the universe is derived from light.
We stand on the Ground and see the stars in the night sky with the naked eye.
Bright Sun can burn the retina of the eye,
but we see the same light in the reflection of the moon.
Since the time of Galileo, who observed the heavenly bodies through his primitive telescope, we have been observing the universe through the light that passes through the vast ages of cosmic history.
With the help of modern telescopes, we were able to put together a stunning silent film about the Universe, covering our entire history up to the Big Bang.
However, this movie is not at all devoid of sound, because the Universe is not silent.
I want to prove to you that the Universe has its own sound track, and it is" played " by the cosmos itself, because outer space vibrates like a drum.
It carries peculiar sounds that accompany the most vivid events as they occur.
Today, we would like to complement the luxurious visual image of the universe that we have with a soundtrack.
Until now, we have never heard sounds from outer space, but in the near future, we should listen carefully to what is happening there.
So, in order to record the" song "of the Universe, we focused on black holes as the most promising objects, because they "beat" space-time like a bell, and give a characteristic sound. Now you will hear how, in our opinion, this song will sound.
Maybe one day we will see the shadow that a black hole casts when it appears on a bright background, but so far we have not observed this.
However, a black hole, even if invisible, can be heard because it" beats " space-time like a drum.
The suggestion that the cosmos is like the membrane of a drum belongs to Albert Einstein, to whom we owe so much.
Einstein concluded that if space were empty, if the universe were empty, it would look like this picture, except, of course, for such a visual grid.
If we were free-falling through space, even without a convenient coordinate grid, we could mentally draw it ourselves, since we would notice that we were moving in a straight line, strictly in a straight line through the universe.
Einstein also realized — and this is the point — that if you put energy or mass into the universe, it will cause space to bend, and a free-falling object will bend around, for example, the Sun, deviating along the natural curves in space.
This was Einstein's great general theory of relativity.
Even light bends along this path.
The deviation can be so strong that the object will simply fall into orbit, and will rotate around the Sun like the Earth, or like the Moon-around the Earth.
These are natural curvatures in space.
But Einstein did not understand this — if you take our Sun and compress it to 6 kilometers in diameter, that is, a mass 1 million times heavier than the Earth to fit in an object with a diameter of 6 km, you will get a black hole so dense that the light that passed too close to it will never escape. A dark shadow in the universe.
However, he always considered black holes to be just a mathematical curiosity.
Einstein did not believe that they existed in reality.
He believed that nature itself should protect us from their appearance.
It took decades before the term "black hole" was coined, and people realized that they were real astrophysical objects — in fact, they are very massive stars in a postmortem state, catastrophically destroyed at the end of their life cycle.
Our Sun will not turn into a black hole.
Its mass is not enough for this.
But we'll do a little thought experiment — Einstein was very fond of them — and imagine the Sun shrinking to 6 kilometers in diameter, and a tiny Earth orbiting around it, about 30 km from the sun's black hole.
This Earth is glowing, because the Sun is no longer there, as well as any other source of light, so let's make our little Earth self-luminous.
It turns out that we can put the Earth in a very close orbit, just 30 km away from this black hole.
It is not much larger than Manhattan in size.
Perhaps it would have snagged the Hudson a little before destroying the Land.
But the scale is something like this.
We're talking about a facility that would take up about 1/2 the area of Manhattan.
So, putting this Earth very close — just 30 km away — we will notice that it rotates perfectly around the black hole.
It is a kind of myth that black holes consume everything indiscriminately — to get into it, you need to get very close.
But what is striking is that from our vantage point, we will see the Earth all the time.
It can't hide behind a black hole.
Some of the light that the Earth emits is absorbed by the hole, but some of it seems to go around it and come back to us.
So that nothing can be hidden behind a black hole.
If you suddenly find yourself in the TV series "Battlestar Galactica", and you will fight with the Cylons-do not hide behind a black hole.
They'll see you!
Our Sun won't turn into a black hole — it's not massive enough for that. But there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
And if one of them obscured the Milky Way, this is what it would look like.
We would see the shadow of a black hole against hundreds of billions of stars and glowing dust.
If we were on the verge of falling into this black hole, we would see all this light going around it, and even as we enter this shadow, we would not notice the near catastrophe.
It would be useless to start the engines and try to get out, because nothing, including the light, can escape from it.
Although the black hole looks like this from the outside, it is not dark inside, as all the light falls into it with us.
According to the relativistic effect known as time dilation, our clocks would appear to slow down relative to galactic time, but we would instead see the evolution of the galaxy in accelerated mode a moment before dying inside a black hole.
It would be like a near-death experience, where you see a light at the end of a tunnel, but not" near", but absolutely mortal.
(Laughter) And you can't tell anyone about the light at the end of the tunnel.
Scientists have not yet been able to see the shadow of the black hole, but we can hear it, even if it is invisible.
Imagine a real astrophysical situation — two black holes that have lived together for a long time.
Perhaps they were stars at first, and then turned into black holes. Each of them is 10 times heavier than the Sun.
We will compress them to 60 km in diameter.
They can rotate rapidly: hundreds of revolutions per second.
At the end of their life cycle, they orbit each other at almost the speed of light.
They cover thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second, and not only do they bend space, but they also leave a trail behind them: they cause vibrations, a wave trail in space-time.
Space is shrinking and stretching, being released from these black holes oscillating in the universe.
And they travel through space at the speed of light.
This computer simulation is made by NASA's Goddard group studying relativity.
For almost 30 years, scientists around the world have struggled with this problem.
It was one of the groups.
You see two black holes rotating around each other — and again, the curves are clearly shown here.
If you see — a little pale-they emit red waves, gravitational waves.
These are the sounds of vibrating space, and they will come out of these black holes at the speed of light as they subside and merge into one spinning, silent black hole — such is the outcome.
If you were standing close enough, your ear would resonate as the space shrinks and stretches.
You would actually hear the sound.
Of course, your head would also shrink and stretch, so it would be difficult for you to understand what is going on.
But I would like to play you this sound, as we predict it.
This is the work of my group, so the graphics here are more modest.
Imagine a light black hole falling into a very heavy one.
The sound you hear is made by a light hole, arching the space, approaching the end step by step.
If it is removed, the sound becomes quieter.
But it is like a hammer "hitting" a space that vibrates like a membrane.
And we can predict what that sound will be like.
We know that as the hole is absorbed, it gets faster and louder.
At the end, we'll hear how a small hole just falls into a large one.
I've never heard a record so loud before — it's really quite impressive.
At home, it turns out much more modest.
Just quiet clicks.
This is a different sound created by my band.
I'm not showing you a picture here, because black holes leave no visible traces behind them, and there are no visible curves in space.
If you were going on a space cruise and you heard a sound like that, I would recommend leaving as soon as possible.
(Laughter) Get away from that sound.
Both black holes are moving.
They approach each other.
In this case, they both fluctuate greatly.
And now there will be a merger.
This "chirping" is very characteristic of merging black holes, this is the acceleration at the end.
We assume it would sound like that.
Fortunately, we are now at a safe distance, in Long Beach, California.
There is no doubt that two black holes are merging somewhere in the universe.
And without a doubt, the space around us is vibrating, and these vibrations may have traveled millions of light-years, that is, a million years moving towards us at the speed of light.
But the sound is too quiet, we can't hear it.
There is a very complex project today: LIGO (Laser-Interferometric Gravitational-wave Observatory) — it tracks deviations in the vibrations of space, the smallest ones-by the size of the atomic nucleus per 4 kilometers.
This is an extremely ambitious experiment, and in the next few years it will be dedicated to capturing such waves.
There is also one space program planned, which I hope will be launched in the next 10 years: LIKA (Laser Interferometric Space Antenna).
It will be able to see super-heavy black holes, millions and billions of times more massive than the Sun.
In this image from the Hubble Telescope, we see two galaxies.
They look as if they are frozen in a kind of " embrace»,
and each of them probably contains a super-heavy black hole in its core.
But they didn't freeze. In fact, they merge.
These two black holes collide, and it will last for more than a billion years.
It is beyond our comprehension to hear a song of such duration.
But LIKA can see the finale of the merger of two heavyweight black holes that began a long time ago: the last 15 minutes of this action.
We're not just talking about black holes, we're talking about every major problem in the universe, and the biggest one is the Big Bang.
When this expression was coined, it was ironic — " they say, who will believe in the Big Bang?»
This animation from my friend at Proton Studios shows a Big Bang from the outside.
Any observer would like to be inside at this moment, because it is impossible to be outside the universe.
Imagine that you are inside the Big Bang.
It is everywhere, all around you, and the space vibrates chaotically.
It's been 14 billion years, and this song is still playing around us.
Galaxies are born, and in them — generations of star forms. And around one star, at least one, there is a habitable planet.
And here we persistently conduct these experiments, make calculations, and write programs.
Imagine-a billion years ago, two black holes collided.
All the while, their song is playing in space.
We haven't even been born yet.
The sound is getting closer, closer and closer-40 thousand years ago, we are still making rock paintings.
If we were going to "hear" the Big Bang, it would sound like this.
Noise in its purest form.
It's white noise, just chaotic sounds.
But it probably surrounds us everywhere, unless it has been drowned out by some other process in the universe.
And if we catch it, it will be the most pleasant music for us, because it is a quiet echo of the moment of our creation, the birth of the observable universe.
Over the next few years, we'll be able to turn up the volume a little bit, and hear the universe in sound.
But if we catch an echo of those early events, it will bring us much closer to understanding the Big Bang, and it will allow us to ask some of the most difficult, elusive questions.
If we play a movie about our universe backwards, we will know that there was a Big Bang in the past, and maybe we will even hear its cacophony, but was this the only explosion?
I mean — did it happen before that?
Will it happen again?
In the spirit of TED encouraging us to regain our faith in miracles, we can now ask questions that have always eluded us.
But we have to ask: is it possible that our universe is just a trace of some more significant history?
Or — aren't we just one branch of the multiverse-each of which has had its own Big Bang in the past? Maybe with or without black holes and their "songs", maybe with or without intelligent life — they are not in our past, not in our future, but somehow connected to us?
We will ask — in such a multiverse, in its other branches, is there life there?
Here are my brothers in the multiverse.
But are there other creatures out there who think about us, and about their origins?
And if they are, I can imagine them doing calculations like we do, building instruments, trying to detect that faint sound of the moment of their creation, and thinking-who else is there but us?
Thanks. Thanks.
(Applause)
Minneapolis residents create squads to patrol the streets
The Wall Street Journal reports: in Minneapolis, detachments are being created to patrol the streets.
Local residents want to help the guards.
Some of the vigilantes have weapons with them.
Armed citizens assure that they will not open fire, this is possible only in case of extreme necessity.
According to journalists, the creation of patrols is associated with a reduction in the police budget.
Law enforcement agencies will receive $10 million less per year (this amount may be reduced).
The previous budget of law enforcement agencies is $193 million.
This decision was made by the Minneapolis City Council in connection with the death of George Floyd and rallies against police brutality over the past two months.

The drawing was made on a white canvas measuring 21 × 27.5 cm and consists of an interweaving of five rings of different colors-blue, yellow, black, green and red.
The first modern Olympic Games were held in Athens in 1896.
"Dynamo" will not extend the contract with Panchenko
Forward Kirill Panchenko will leave Dynamo Moscow due to the end of his contract.
According to the source, the club has already notified the player of its decision.
30-year-old Panchenko spent four seasons at Dynamo, played 103 games and scored 37 goals.
Earlier, Dynamo Moscow presented their uniforms for the next season.
City and Real Madrid will be able to play the second leg of the 1/8 final of the Champions League in Manchester
The British newspaper The Guardian reports that Manchester City and Real Madrid will still be able to hold the second leg of the 1/8 final of the Champions League in Manchester at the Etihad stadium on August 7.
Yesterday, July 25, the government of the United Kingdom adopted a decree that all persons arriving in the UK from Spain are required to undergo a 14-day quarantine due to a new outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.
For Real Madrid, however, an exception will be made.
The possibility of easing quarantine regulations for sports teams and film crews was previously announced by the Secretary of the Ministry of Culture of the United Kingdom, Oliver Dowden.
In February, Real Madrid lost to Manchester City with a score of 1: 2.
The second leg is scheduled for August 7.
The Presidents of Russia and Ukraine discussed the implementation of the truce in the Donbass
Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky discussed the implementation of the agreements on the truce in the Donbas, reached during the Normandy Summit in December 2019, the press services of the Kremlin and the office of the President of Ukraine reported.
The telephone conversation between Vladimir Putin and Vladimir Zelensky took place at the initiative of the Ukrainian side, according to the Kremlin press service.
The interlocutors welcomed the agreement reached on July 22 at the meeting of the Minsk Contact Group on a full and comprehensive ceasefire in the Donbas, which begins at 00: 01 on July 27, 2020; the Russian President supported this agreement.
The leaders agreed on the need to urgently implement additional measures to support the ceasefire in the Donbas.
At the same time, Putin criticized the resolution adopted by the Verkhovna Rada on July 15 on the organization of local elections in the fall, which, according to the Russian side, ignores the Minsk agreements.
The situation in connection with the coronavirus pandemic was also discussed.
The agreement on July 22 provides for a complete rejection of any military actions, including intelligence searches, sending sabotage and reconnaissance groups and sniper warfare.
Tinkov showed a video of a bone marrow transplant
Russian entrepreneur, the founder of the group "Tinkoff" Oleg Tinkov published a video in which he told how he was transplanted bone marrow.
Recall that the businessman is fighting leukemia.
On the recording, the businessman is lying in the ward, the bone marrow is transplanted using an IV.
Tinkov noted that the collection of donor material takes place in the same way.
"The skull is not cut open," he added.
Judging by his posture during the operation, he feels comfortable and relaxed.
His donor was a girl from Germany.
The businessman expressed regret that in Russia there are only 130 thousand bone marrow donors, while in Germany there are about 8 million.
Oleg Tinkou's bone marrow transplant was performed in a London clinic.
It became known about the destruction of Russian "Shells" in Ethiopia
Two Russian-made Pantsir-S1 anti-aircraft missile and gun systems that were in service with the Ethiopian army were destroyed.
This became known to the Telegram channel "Military Observer" on Sunday, July 26.
According to the channel, two cars that provided security for the Hidase hydroelectric power station on the Blue Nile River were disabled as a result of a lightning strike.
Other details of the incident are not given.
In May, the Turkish Anadolu agency reported the destruction of nine Russian-made Pantsir-S1 missile defense systems in Libya.
They belonged to the forces of the commander of the Libyan National Army (LNA), Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, and were destroyed with the help of Turkish Bayraktar TB2 tactical multi-purpose unmanned aerial systems.
Then Defense Express called the incident "a real genocide."
Another "Pantsir-C1" in Libya was destroyed by a drone strike in early July.
In Warsaw, 1.5 thousand people are evacuated because of the bomb
About 1.5 thousand residents of Warsaw are being evacuated because of a bomb found during the construction of the metro, RIA Novosti reports with reference to the representative of the capital's mayor's office, Karolina Galetskaya.
She said that an unexploded munition weighing 250 kg and about 2 m long was found on the construction of the second line of the metro in the area of Basilianska Street in the Warsaw district of Brody.
In this regard, about 1.5 thousand people are being evacuated from eight adjacent neighborhoods.
Only after that, the sappers will start working.
Lokomotiv is close to signing a contract with the Belarusian national team player
