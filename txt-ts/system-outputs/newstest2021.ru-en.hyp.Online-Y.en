No need to demonize the people of Khabarovsk
The head of Khabarovsk Krai spoke about his trip to the region in an exclusive interview with Komsomol Pravda
Acting Governor of Khabarovsk Krai Mikhail Degtyarev urged Komsomolskaya Pravda columnist Alexander Gamov not to demonize khabarovchans amid rallies in support for the arrested ex-head of the region, Sergei Furgal.
I want to reach out to all political commentators, political scientists, attendees of all kinds of talk shows.
Don't demonize the people of Khabarovsk Krai.
Hard-working and wonderful people live here,” Mikhail Degtyarev shared.
In an interview, Degtyarev recalled that he was a member of the LDPR and a fellow party of Furgal and added that he wished him good luck in court, while the party and Vladimir Zhirinovsky personally would provide support in court.
The full text of the interview is published on KP.ru.
Earlier, KP.ru reported that Mikhail Degtyarev advocated the open trial of Sergei Furgal and thought it fair to hold it in Khabarovsk.
Two Mexican states announce alarm over Hurricane Hanna
The Mexican National Civil Defense Administration declared an “orange” (high) alert level in the two eastern states of Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon due to approaching Hurricane Hanna, TASS reported.
The hurricane will bring heavy downpours to Mexico, with 150 to 250 litres of rain per square metre forecast in some areas.
Authorities have prepared about 800 shelters for the public.
10,000 people will assist people, including rescue workers, National Guards and the military.
At this point, the hurricane has reached the coast of the U.S. state of Texas with wind speeds of 150 km/h.
The arrival of “Hannah” in Mexico is expected Sunday morning.
Semilarski v. Prosecutor's Office: Former Vice Mayor of Tartu's cassation to be considered on August 4
That means a ruling on it is likely to be handed down in early September.
The two first courts to hear Semilarski's claim refused, but in April, his cassation complaint was taken into action by the State Court.
The Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the complainant on December 12, 2019, because its permission was not within its jurisdiction of the administrative court.
The court order stated that the complaint included a claim for damages caused in criminal proceedings.
“The prosecutor's office and county court should regulate such matters,” Anette Creutsmann, a spokeswoman for the Tartu courts, previously explained to ERR.
She said Valvo Semilarski appealed the ruling to the District Court, which on February 5 did not change the trial court's decision.
The State Court will now have to say its word.
His client had been unreasonably under suspicion of bribery for about two years, according to Semilarski's defense attorney, sworn attorney Oliver Näes.
He now requires the prosecutor's office to refute incorrect allegations against its own and pay him for moral damages.
The reason for filing the complaint to the court was the statements made by the Liuna District Prosecutor's Office of Special Cases, Margus Gross, made by him in October 2017, when Semilarski along with another at that time Tartu Vice Mayor Artem Suvorov was detained on suspicion of several crimes.
“When I was detained, the Security Police and the Prosecutor's Office immediately organized a press conference and informed the entire Republic of Estonia that the leaders of Tartu are one of the most influential local governments - are saleable.
These hung public suspicions in the air accompanied me for about two years.
And now that these allegations and suspicions have been proven to be false, the prosecutor's office doesn't want to say anything about it,” Semilarski commented in early August 2019.
At a news conference, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework in which the prosecutor's office should operate, Oliver Näes said.
'The claim of bribes and sales has been proven false, but that's not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its rulings on Russia as well as Lithuania that during the investigation phase, state representatives must be careful when choosing words so that suspects would not be represented in the role of criminals before sentencing.
To this, the prosecutor's office also obliges the presumption of innocence, which unfortunately was not observed in this case against Valvo Semilarski,” Näes said.
“The public representation of Semilarski as a serious offender and briber in circumstances where the facts behind the suspicion of bribery are still being elucidated is unacceptable, which is contrary to the presumption of innocence and unfair to the complainant,” the lawyer added.
As rus.err.ee wrote, former Tartu Vice Mayor Valvo Semilarski will not be prosecuted on bribery charges - the criminal case against him in July was partially closed.
At the same time, the former official is being tried on charges of knowingly violating anti-corruption laws while carrying out transactions in particularly large amounts.
According to the indictment, between 2015 and 2017, the former deputy mayor of Tartu attended city department meetings more than thirty times in making decisions related to incumbents in Tartu companies whose owners or executives Semilarski actively communicated on a personal level during after-hours hours.
According to Gross, in all of these cases, Semilarski had personal interests, and therefore he had to be suspended from taking part in decision-making.
Earlier, rus.err.ee wrote, the prosecutor's office had raised Semilarski suspicions of taking a bribe and violating anti-corruption laws in particularly large transactions.
This happened in October 2016, when he was detained along with another deputy mayor, Artem Suvorov (Centrist Party).
The prosecutor's office and Security Police then said there was strong evidence against both vice mayors.
Both officials then resigned.
Suvorov's case later reached the court, which fully vindicated the politician.
The trial investigation of Valvo Semilarski is still ongoing.
Ex-Hands Up Soloist Visits Tver Region
Ex-Hands Up soloist and now solo performer, businessman and actor Sergei Zhukov posted a photo from Kalyazin in the Tver region on his official Instagram account.
Photo posted a day ago, Saturday, July 25.
“Raising my hands up under the new “Crumb” and say hello to you from the heady fresh air!
Write in the comments, what's the weather in your city?
We have no rain today, but above +20 is not rising yet”..., Zhukov writes on social media.
Probably the singer is vacationing in the beautiful city of Tver region with his family.
Residents of the region have already thanked the performer for the visit, and expressed hope for a meeting and personal communication.
The new “Crumb” referred to in the post is probably due to the new version of an old song that Zhukov has now recorded with blogger and musician David Manukian (DAVA M).
Most fans stay BEHIND the old version: “Sergey, the old version of the song is clearly 1,000,000 times better!
Support me dedicated “Hands Up"” fans, “Don't We Need a “New Crumb"”.
Most write directly that the original, which was a hit at one time, they like it better.
Defense Ministry reported successful completion of Zirkon hypersonic missile
The Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation reported the successful completion of the Zirkon hypersonic missile tests.
On Navy Day, the Defense Department noted that the test launches conducted from the Admiral of the Fleet Gorshkov frigate “Admiral of the Soviet Union” confirmed unique tactico-technical specifications of the missile based on its range and accuracy, as well as its hypersonic flight speed.
According to the Defense Ministry, the testing of the hypersonic missile is on a routine basis.
Earlier in May, Deputy Defense Minister Alexei Krivoruchko reported that the ship's complex with the newest hypersonic Zircon missile would enter service in 2021 to 2022.
You all know the truth that will be talked about today.
I think the thought of inequality as a divider and destroyer of society was in the air before the French Revolution.
But now we can see evidence by comparing the most and least similar societies, and observing the effects of inequality.
I'll show you this data and explain why there are relationships that are going to talk about.
But first, look at how much we are — a squalid mass.
(Laughter) I'll start with a paradox.
It shows life expectancy depending on GNI, or the average wealth of countries.
It can be seen that countries on the right, such as Norway and the US, are twice as rich as Israel, Greece and Portugal on the left.
But it has absolutely no effect on life expectancy.
There is no indication of the relationship.
But within societies, strong gradations in health are noticeable, affecting all social strata.
Average life expectancy again.
The graph refers to small areas of England and Wales: the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.
Huge difference between the poor and everyone else.
Even those slightly poorer than the wealthiest are already less healthy than the very top.
So income is very important within our societies, but not between them.
The explanation for this paradox is: within our societies, we look at relative income or social position, status — at what level we are in relation to those around us, and what distances are between us.
Once you understand this idea, what happens when the difference is increased or squeezed, in other words, making the difference in income bigger or smaller?
Now I'll show you that.
All the data used is absolutely real.
I take UN information, the same from the World Bank: the scale of income disparities in these rich and developed market democracies.
The indicator used by our team is very simple, you can download it. We count the difference between the 20% richest and 20% of the poorest citizens in each country.
See, in equal countries on the left, in Japan, Finland, Norway and Sweden, the rich 20% are 3.5-4 times richer than the 20% of the poor.
But in unequal countries, in the UK, Portugal, the US and Singapore, the difference is twice the difference!
According to these measurements, we are twice as equal against the background of other successful democracies.
And now you'll see the impact it has on society.
We have compiled statistics on social problems that are more frequent among the poor.
This is internationally comparable data for life expectancy, literacy and mathematical training of children, mortality of newborn, murder rate, number of prisoners, adolescent pregnancy, trust, obesity, mental illness, which, according to the standard diagnostic classification, include drug and alcohol dependencies, and finally, data on social mobility.
We put that all in one index.
All of them are of equal importance.
The country is, of course, the average value of this data.
You see countries with regard to the measure of inequality that was shown at the beginning. I will come back to it again and again as the presentation progresses.
Unequal countries in general have more complexities with all these social problems.
It's an unusually close bond. You see the correlation is unusually high.
But if you look at the same index of health and social problems relative to GNP per capita, Gross National Income, there is no correlation anymore.
We were a little worried that people would think we were picking up problems to our arguments and just “fit” the evidence. So we also wrote an article to the British Medical Journal about the UNICEF Child Wellbeing Index.
The index consists of 40 different parts, put together by different people.
Among the criteria:, the availability of books at home, the ability of children to talk to parents, the level of immunization, the availability of bullying in school.
That's where everything goes.
And this is all against the same measure of inequality.
The situation in children is worse in unequal societies.
And that's a statistically significant relationship.
But again, if you look at the level of child welfare in relation to national income per capita, there is no relationship, no hint.
All the demonstrated data says one thing:
on average, the welfare of our societies is no longer dependent on national income and economic growth.
They are extremely important in poor countries, but not in the developed world.
The difference between us, and our position against the background of others, is what makes a huge difference.
I'll show you snippets of our index.
Here, for example, is trust.
It's the part of the population that agrees that most people can be trusted.
The data is from the World Values Study.
Here, look, in unequal countries, only 15% of the population trusts others.
And in equal societies, that figure reaches 60-65%.
If you look at the measurements of social activity activity, or social capital, you'll notice very similar ratios closely related to inequality.
We could say we've done the job twice.
First we analyzed developed countries, and then as a control study we repeated the procedure in 50 American states, asking one question: whether things are worse for all of our to indicators in the most unequal states?
Here's trust in relation to inequality, according to the federal government's general social study.
Very similar spread, compared to a similar range of confidence levels.
Same story.
In general, we found that almost everything related to trust internationally appears as well in our control study.
It's not just a coincidence.
Here's a graph of mental illness.
WHO, through identical diagnostic interviews conducted on random samples of the population, collected results that allow us to compare the level of mental illness in each of the societies.
This shows the percentage of the population who suffered from a mental illness in the past year.
The numbers start at about 8% and rise to nearly 24%; entire societies with three times the level of psychological illness.
And again, this is closely related to inequality.
And here's the crimes.
These red dots show American states, and the blue triangles show Canadian provinces.
But look at the scale of the differences.
It starts at 15 kills per million and gets to 150.
This is the proportion of prisoners.
This is a tenfold difference expressed on a logarithmic scale.
The numbers rise from 40 to 400 in terms of prison inmates.
These relationships are not explained simply by higher crime.
Yes, in some cases this is partly the case.
But most of them involve more stronger sentences.
Unequal societies were more likely to favor the continuation of the death penalty.
The percentage of children dropping out of school is shown here.
Again, a pretty big difference.
It's incredibly malicious when it comes to using talent.
And here is social mobility.
It's a measurement of mobility according to income.
The main thing is: Do rich fathers have rich sons and poor sons, or are there no dependency here?
Among unequal countries, in the UK and the US, his father's income is repeatedly more important.
And in Scandinavian countries, income is already much less meaningful.
As a bottom line — Greater social mobility.
And as we often like to say — I know there are many Americans among listeners — if Americans want to fulfill the American dream, they should go to Denmark.
(Laughter) (Applause) I showed only a couple of italicized moments.
A number of other problems could be demonstrated.
All kinds of problems that are becoming more significant among the lower social strata.
But there are endless problems with social gradients that are much worse in unequal countries; and not a little bit, but 2, 10 times worse.
Think about the costs, what it costs people to do.
Let me go back to the previously shown graph where all the data is put together. Let's make two conclusions.
The first one. Chart by chart, less successful countries, regardless of the outcome, are out of unequal terms, and the successful countries are Scandinavian and Japan.
Thus, we see a general social dysfunction against the background of inequality.
These are not one, not two separate problems. It's a trend.
Another important point about this graph. Let's see below: Sweden and Japan: countries are different literally in everything.
The situation of women, how closely related to the family, is exactly the opposite in developed countries.
The other very important difference is how they achieve greater equality.
In Sweden, income differences are huge, but they decrease through taxation, through social programs, generous benefits, etc.
it's different in Japan.
The difference in salaries is initially small.
Taxes are lower.
There are fewer social programs.
And in our analysis of American states, we find the same contrast.
Some states succeed by redistributing income, others by a smaller difference in net income before tax.
We believe it does not matter by what means equality is achieved, as long as it is achieved.
I'm not talking about full equality, but the one in rich and developed market democracies.
Another amazing observation is that it's not just the poor who are influenced by this disparity.
There seems to be a share of truth in John Donne's words: “Man is not an island.”
A number of studies can compare how people in more and less equal countries succeed at every rung of the social ladder.
One such example:
Newborn deaths.
A group of Swedes classified many infant deaths according to the British Register of General Socio-Economic Classification.
This is more of an anachronistic classification according to the profession of fathers, so that single parents are not counted.
And by “low social level” means unskilled professions.
Then there are skilled manual workers, then lower-level white collar workers and up to the top level with highly skilled occupations: doctors, lawyers, directors of large companies.
You see things are going better in Sweden than in the UK in every section of society.
The biggest difference at the lower levels,
but even for the higher ranks there are benefits from a more equal society.
We've shown this on five different data sets affecting educational outcomes and health in the U.S. and internationally.
And that seems to be the big picture: greater equality more strongly changes things at the bottom, but useful for the top too.
But I must still explain what's going on.
I think it's talking everywhere about the psychosocial effects of inequality.
About feeling superior and inferiority, feeling worth and vice versa, feeling respect for oneself and vice versa.
And, of course, that sense of competition that is born of these feelings inflames consumerism in our society.
It also leads to fear for one's status.
We are more worried about how people around us think about us, whether we find us attractive, smart — that worries us.
The more public assessments, the greater the fear of them.
Interestingly, parallel work is being done in social psychology: 208 different studies involving volunteers who were tested for stress hormones in psychological laboratories, to respond to stressful tasks.
Overall, they wanted to observe the kinds of stress that increase levels of cortisol, the main stress hormone.
As a result, situations that included the potential threat of social assessment, the threat of self-esteem or social status, and situations where other people might have given a negative assessment.
Such stressors have a special effect on the physiology of stress.
Nor was it without criticism of us.
Of course, there will be dissenters or people who find it amazing.
I have to tell you, in response to criticism for a collection of data, that we don't choose this data.
Our main rule is if the data source has the necessary indicators for one of the countries being analyzed, we include it in our analysis.
It's the source of information deciding whether this data is real, but not us.
Otherwise we would have created a systematic error.
What is it with other countries?
There are 200 health studies in academic journals in relation to income and equality.
And they are not limited to these countries, but we have excluded others for visibility.
Same countries, same dimensions of inequality, problem after problem.
Why aren't we in control of other factors?
Well, we've shown you that GNP per capita doesn't make any difference.
And, of course, others, using more sophisticated methods, controlled both poverty and educational attainment, and so on.
And what about causality?
Correlation alone does not prove causality.
We spent quite a bit of time doing it.
And indeed, for some of these situations, causation is well known.
A big change in our understanding of the causes of chronic health impacts in the developed world has been how significant the chronic stress of social nature and its effects on immune and cardiovascular system.
For example, violence is becoming more common in unequal societies because people are more sensitive to contempt.
It must be said that to address this problem, we should work on earnings before tax and after.
We need to limit the revenues and extra bonuses of the higher ranks.
I think it is necessary in every way possible to make our bosses responsible for employees.
I want you to leave here with the knowledge that we can improve a person's real quality of life by reducing the income difference between us.
Now we have a foothold point for influencing the psychological welfare of whole societies, and it's really incredible.
Thank you.
(Applause)

US calls on Qatar and its neighbors to end dispute
Trust and unity between Qatar and other states must be restored, according to the US Special Representative for Iran, Brian Hook.
He said the conflict between the emirate and other countries in the region had lasted too long and was damaging regional interests in stability, prosperity and security.
So far, the U.S. has tried unsuccessfully to mediate a settlement of the dispute, which Washington sees as a “threat to efforts to contain Iran.”
Diplomatic relations with Qatar broke the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain three years ago.
They set up a transport blockade, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorism.
In response, Doha said neighbours were simply jealous of Qatar's economic successes - according to the IMF, Qatar has been leading by a large margin in GDP per capita for several years.
The Emirate is the third largest natural gas reserves, the sixth exporter of natural gas and a major exporter of oil and petroleum products.

Russia's Proton ready to subdue expanses
The Proton-M rocket is ready for launch in which it will launch two Express telecommunication satellites into orbit.
That's the conclusion of a state commission.
As early as July 26, the vehicle will be deployed to the launch site of the Baikonur Cosmodrome.
The immediate launch of the rocket is scheduled for July 30.
The original launch date was shifted after a number of faults were discovered among the components of the carrier rocket.
According to REGNUM, according to Roscosmos, defective parts were manufactured at Ust-Katavsky factory in Chelyabinsk in 2015-2016.
Remenyako won his second race in SMP GT4 RUSSIA class.
Evgeny Kulikov, whose Porsche Cayman suffered damage in the first race, failed to make the start.
Therefore, Alexey Bashmakov turned out to be on the reverse pole - it was true that the Mercedes pilots broke out by the second lap ahead.
Denis Remenyako once again clumped forward, and Alexander Vaintrub was forced to repel Alexander Maslennikov's attacks on KTM, which broke from last place to third.
Despite a tight struggle in the first part of the race, closer to the middle Weintrubbe built up the pace, showing the best lap time in the race - and, although unable to catch up with the extremely stable Remenyako, guaranteed himself silver.
The Cayman group fell behind the leaders, but fought a tight fight.
The best of the drivers at Porsche was Alexey Bashmakov, who was fourth overall, but Andrei Fedotov with Konstantin Zakharevsky conceded him a matter of moments.
And at the intermediate finish in the middle of the race, Fedotov and Zakharevsky split 0.001 seconds.
Two more motorways made federal roads list
The Russian government has included two more motorways in the list of highways of federal importance.

Another highway over 388 kilometers long leads from Barnaul through Pavlovsk to the border with the Republic of Kazakhstan.
By this road you can travel from the capital of Altai Krai to the “Kulunda” checkpoint.
Obtaining the new status would bring these tracks to a regulatory state on Federal Highway Fund funds.
Some sections will be overhauled and refurbished, and the quality of the pavement will be improved.
Tatarstan allowed to hold open-air film screenings
The Cabinet of Ministers of Tatarstan has issued a resolution that can be held in the republic from July 27 in the republic in outdoor venues - parks, squares and on embankments, according to Tatar-Inform.
Also, the document states that for citizens over 65 years of age, the mandatory self-isolation regime has been extended until August 9.
They can leave the accommodation to go to the shop, take out trash or walk the dog.
And indoor cinemas don't plan to open until the third phase of lifting restrictions, the agency recalls.
Washington is excited about playoff games.
We missed them
Washington Capitals Russian hockey player Alexander Ovechkin spoke about the club's preparations for the upcoming season resumption in the NHL.
The 34-year-old Capz striker noted his partners' readiness for matches.
Psychologically, all the guys are ready.
We go to Toronto joyful, because we were without a game for a long time and missed hockey in the playoffs,” Ovechkin quoted Ovechkin as saying the Russian-language version of NHL.com.
- Right now we're fresh, we don't have any injuries and no different pain.
However, Ovechkin also admitted that he and his partners have yet to remember part of the tactical combinations: “We don't have much time to play most and remember March working on how to move the washer in these situations.
But the time is still there: I'm sure that in Toronto, we'll still dedicate some of our training to it.
Majority and minority are important in the playoffs.
And I'm confident in our special teams.”
Recall that the Washington Capitals are scheduled to restart on August 3, when the Capitals play with the Tampa Bay Lightning.
After that, Caps hockey players will also have to play with the Philadelphia Flyers (August 6) and Boston Bruins (August 9).
Russian refused to pay parking and beat parking worker
In Vladivostok, a man refused to pay for parking and hit a parking lot worker, police carry out an inspection.
This is reported by vl.ru, citing the press service of the Russian UMVD on the city.
The incident occurred on Friday, July 24, in a parking lot near the mall.
The driver of the car refused to pay for parking, which caused a conflict with the parking attendant.
The verbal dispute escalated into ordnance.
The man punched the employee in the face, he fell unconscious.
He was hospitalized.
As the source told the publication, the victim suffered a moderate head injury and was taken to the neurosurgery department.
Police are now establishing the full circumstances of what happened.
The Russian was previously charged with beating a disabled man who died later in hospital.
According to the investigation, the victim was visiting his acquaintance - a 45-year-old local resident.
The men drank alcohol together, after which there was a conflict between the pals.
The owner of the apartment beat the guest, he went home.
Two days later, the man became unwell; he was hospitalized.
He died of his injuries.
Cyberattacks on the business world have increased recently.
Access to data from companies such as JP Morgan, Yahoo, Home Depot and Target caused them losses of hundreds of millions, and in some cases even billions of dollars.
It doesn't take too many attacks like this to damage the global economy.
Nor is the public sector safe from such problems.
From 2012 to 2014, there was a significant data leak in the U.S. Office of Personnel Services.
Access to welfare checks and fingerprints of 22 million employees were disrupted.
Attempts by state-sponsored hackers to influence election results in a number of countries with stolen data are known.
The two most recent cases involving the Bundestag, Germany's federal parliament, and the theft of US Democratic National Committee imails.
The cyber threat affects our democratic processes.
The situation is even getting worse.
As computer technology evolves, data protection systems become increasingly vulnerable.
A new kind of computer technology is also of concern — computing on quantum computers, which exploits nature's microscopic properties to dramatically increase computing power.
It is so powerful that it will be able to hack many modern encryption systems.
Is the situation so hopeless?
Maybe it's time to pack our vital data and prepare for a rapid digital apocalypse?
I'd say, 'Not time yet. '
Quantum computers are still in development and it will take many years before they are put into practice.
More important is that there are major breakthroughs in encryption.
For me, this is a particularly exciting time in the history of secure communications.
About 15 years ago, when I learned about the new possibility of creating quantum effects that don't exist in nature, I got very excited.
I was intrigued by the idea of applying the fundamental laws of physics to create more secure encryption.
Today, a number of companies and laboratories around the world, including mine, are working on these technologies to put them into practice.
That's right.
We are now preparing to fight the quantum with a quantum.
So how does it all work?
First, let's take a little exus into the world of encryption.
To do that, we'll need a briefcase, some important documents that we want to send to our friend, James Bond, and a lock to keep everything safe.
Since our information is top secret, we need a special portfolio.
It has a special code lock: when closed, converts all text in documents to random numbers.
You put documents into a portfolio, close the lock — at this very moment all documents are converted to random numbers — and send the briefcase to James.
While the briefcase is on the way, you call James to report the code.
After getting the briefcase, he enters code, documents are decrypted, and voila — you've just sent an encrypted message to James Bond.
(Laughter) A funny example, but it illustrates three important elements of coding.
Code — we call it the “encryption key.”
It's like a password.
Call James to message him the combination code of the zamká.
This is called “key exchange” —
guarantee that you get the encryption key securely from the right place.
And the lock that encodes and decodes the document.
This is called a “coding algorithm”.
Using the key, it converts the text in documents to random numbers.
A good algorithm would encode in such a way that a keyless document is very difficult to decrypt.
The importance of encryption is that if someone takes possession of a briefcase and hacks it without the help of an encryption key and a coding algorithm, they still won't be able to read its contents.
The information would look like a set of random numbers.
Most security systems rely on a secure way of exchanging keys to transmit the encryption key to the right place.
However, the rapid development of computing power puts a range of modern key exchange techniques at risk.
Consider one of the most widely used systems today, RSA.
When it was invented in 1977, it was speculated that it would take 40 quadrillion years to crack the 426-bit RSA key.
In 1994, just 17 years later, the code was hacked.
As computers got more powerful, we had to use more complex codes.
Today, we usually use 2,048 or 4,096 bits.
As you can see, code creators and hackers are engaged in an ongoing battle, trying to outsmart each other.
And when quantum computers arrive in the next 10—15 years, they will be able to crack even faster the complex math that underpins many modern encryption systems.
A quantum computer is likely to turn our current reliable fortress into a simple house of cards.
We have to find a way to protect our fortress.
In recent years, research has been increasing in the use of quantum effects to enhance crypto protection.
Some interesting discoveries have been made.
Remember the three main elements of encryption: high quality keys, secure key sharing, and a complex algorithm?
Advances in science and technology put two of these three elements at risk.
First, the keys themselves.
Random numbers are the fundamental building blocks of encryption keys.
But to date, they're not exactly random.
Today, we create encryption keys from random number sequences generated from software, so-called pseudorandom numbers.
There is a pattern in numbers generated by a program or mathematical formula in one way or another.
The less random numbers are — in scientific terminology: the less entropy they contain — the easier it is to predict them.
Recently, several casinos were victims of an inventive attack.
Combinations at the output of slot machines were recorded for some time, after which were subject to analysis.
This allowed cybercriminals to redesign the pseudo-random number generator that controls the drums.
Which in turn allowed the reels to predict the rotations of the reels with high accuracy and gain big gains.
Encryption keys may also be exposed to similar risks.
Secure encryption requires a truly random number generator.
For years, scientists have been looking for the possibility of creating such a generator.
But most attempts for today are either not random enough, not fast enough, or they are difficult to repeat.
But the quantum world is based on chance.
So it makes sense to take advantage of that fact.
Devices that can measure quantum effects can also create an infinite stream of random numbers at high speed,
that would prevent all those would-be criminals in the casino.
A number of top universities and companies around the world are dedicated to creating truly random number generators.
The first quantum generator created in my company was one by two meters in size and fit on an optical table.
Later we were able to reduce it to the size of the server box.
Today, it is the size of a PCI-card plugged into a standard computer.
It's the world's fastest truly random number generator.
Its performance is a billion random numbers per second.
Today it is used to enhance security by cloud providers, banks, government agencies around the world.
(Applause) But even with such a generator, the second big problem remains unsolved: the threat to secure key exchange.
Modern key exchange methods are not compatible with a quantum computer.
A quantum solution to this problem is called the “quantum key distribution” or QKD, which is based on a fundamental, paradoxical characterization of quantum mechanics.
The quantum particle changes depending on its observation.
Let's give an example of how this works.
Let's go back to sharing zamká codes with James Bond.
Only this time, instead of calling James with a code message, we'll use quantum effects on the laser to create the code and send it to James over a normal optical fiber.
We believe that Dr. Nou will try to hack access to data sharing.
Fortunately, his attempts to catch quantum keys en route will leave fingerprints that James and you will be able to detect.
This will eliminate intercepted keys.
And the remaining keys can be used for enhanced data protection.
Because this security is based on the fundamental laws of physics, a quantum computer or even any supercomputer of the future will not be able to crack it.
My team and I are working with leading universities, as well as the defence sector, to develop this promising technology into the next generation of security.
The Internet of Things heralds an era where 25—30 billion devices will be interacted by 2020.
For our society to function properly in the IoT world, trust in the systems that support these devices is vital.
I bet that quantum technology can provide that trust, allowing us to take full advantage of the amazing innovations that will enrich our lives.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Video of cats helping injured dog cross road
A video of two cats who helped an injured dog get across the street in Krasnodar Krai is becoming popular online.
The touching procession was recorded by a DVR of one of the drivers.
The events occurred during the dark time of day, the man noticed traffic on the road and slashed speed.
“Look, the delegation is a whole thrall,” the driver ironizes first.
And then notices that the dog moves around with great difficulty.
The company reached the roadside safely and then headed towards the woods.
“There's a lot for people to learn from animals,” the comments wrote.
On Sunday, Russian Navy Day parades were held in St. Petersburg and near all major bases in the fleet, including in Syrian Tartus.
219 different ships and 15,000 personnel took part.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, who hosted the main parade in St Petersburg, said that in 2020 the Navy will be filled with 40 new vessels of different classes, as well as the latest weapons - including hypersonic strike complexes and unmanned underwater vehicles.
In 2020, the parade was held for the first time in Kaspiysk, where the Caspian Fleet base was relocated from Astrakhan.
Besides Petersburg, parades were held in Baltiysk, Kaspiysk, Severomorsk, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Vladivostok, as well as in annexed Sevastopol and on the raid of the Syrian port of Tartus.
The main parade in Neva and the Gulf of Finland was attended by 4,000 troops and 46 vessels, including nuclear and diesel submarines, as well as helicopters and Marine aircraft.
Before the parade began, Putin accompanied by Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, Navy Commander-in-Chief Admiral Nikolai Yevmenov and commander of the forces of the Western Military District, Colonel General Zhuravlev bypassed several ships standing on the Kronstadt Raid and in the Gulf of Finland, greeting the personnel.
The parade was also a copy of the first Russian liner ship “Poltava”, recreated from archival drawings.
Emperor Peter the Great took part in its design.
In his speech, Putin recalled that this year marks the 200th anniversary of the discovery of Antarctica as a result of the expedition of Russian navigators Faddei Bellinsgausen and Mikhail Lazarev.
And snipers were seen providing security on the roof of the Senate and Synod building during the parade.
More than 46 combat ships and more than 1.5 troops took part in the parade in Baltiysk, where the Baltic Fleet is based, and the large gunship “Kaliningrad” made landings of a naval landing.
In annexed Sevastopol there was a parade involving 30 ships and a performance dedicated to the history of the Black Sea Fleet, which included the exit of a group of divers from beneath the water.
The parade in Severomorsk involved a new strategic nuclear submarine, Knyaz Vladimir, accepted into the Northern Fleet in June.
In Vladivostok the holiday ended with a salute.
Russian Navy to receive forty ships and vessels this year
Forty ships and vessels will replenish the Russian Navy this year, Russian President Vladimir Putin said.
“The level of equipment in our military fleet is constantly increasing.
This year, forty ships and vessels of different class will be accepted into its membership,” he said, speaking at the main parade for Navy Day in St. Petersburg.
Putin also recalled that six more new far-sea zone ships were laid up in three shipyards in Russia a few days ago.
Earlier, it was reported that a Navy Day parade had begun in St. Petersburg.

How Central Bank's decision to cut key rate will affect the economy
The Bank of Russia expected to cut its key rate again.
It dipped another 0.25 percentage point, to 4.25% APR - formally another historic low.
Judging by the return of the short step of the rate cut, as well as the tone of the Central Bank's statements and updated forecasts on the Russian economy, the regulator is looking more optimistic than before.
That means the current monetary easing cycle may soon stop.
“We continued monetary easing, primarily considering that there are still risks of deflecting inflation down from 4% in 2021,” Bank of Russia governor Elvira Nabiullina said.
They are associated with significant declines in economic activity, falling domestic and external demand.
Recovering the economy, Nabiullina said, will take more than a year and a half.
At the same time, she noted that economic processes had been revived since the removal of restrictions due to the pandemic: energy consumption, consumer and investment demand were restored, construction and consumer goods output, slowed the annual rate of decline in transport and industrial production.
According to the Central Bank's clarified forecast, the economy will shrink 4.5-5.5 per cent in 2020 (up to 4 per cent expected) and recovery growth of 3.5-4.5 per cent in 2021, and 2.5-3.5% in 2022.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised its forecast for annual oil prices to $38 and $40 per barrel Urals in 2020 and 2021 respectively.
The central bank had previously expected $27 and $35 a barrel.
Finally, the Bank of Russia's 2020 inflation forecast was 3.7-4.2% against the previously expected 3.8-4.8%.
The Bank of Russia's view of the economy is becoming more optimistic, bringing us closer to the end of the easing cycle, according to Russian and Renaissance Capital CIS economists Sofia Donets and Andrei Melashchenko.
For example, the Bank of Russia has consistently cut its key rate for more than a year, since the beginning of last summer it has already fallen by 3.5 percentage points.
At its last meeting in June, the Central Bank downgraded it by one percentage point due to low inflation due to depressed demand and the need to stimulate a stalled pandemic and related with it constraints the economy.
The chances of pre-tuning monetary policy remain (at the next meeting on September 18 and before the end of the year), but the limit is close, agrees Rosbank's chief analyst Yevgeny Koshelev.
The combination of pro-inflation risks also indicates the proximity of a pause in interest policy easing - broken supply chains, possible cost increases due to epidemic prevention measures, and faster ( compared to expectations) a recovery in demand, he says.
In addition, the Bank of Russia's subsequent actions will require greater attention to inflationary processes during the harvest season, as well as external volatility that has increased amid geopolitical conflicts, Koshelev indicates.
One way or another a key rate cut will further cut rates for the most reliable borrowers, as well as possibly on mortgages, says a senior economist at the bank's analytical office” Opening” Maxim Petronevich.
The rate correction will be less pronounced than a key rate cut, he elaborates.
Consumption rates could fall another 0.3-0.6 percentage point during the second half, mortgage rates could end the year in the range of 6.2-7 per cent, BCS Premier economist Anton does not rule out Pocatovich.
Average deposit rates, he believes, will fall too - they could dip towards 4.2-4.5 per cent in the coming months (now barely above 4.5%).
Next, they could drop as much as 4% if the Central Bank cuts its key rate in the autumn, according to Pocatovic.
Centrist party vows to pay all its debts by the end of the year
Mikhail Korb, Secretary General of the Centrist Party, spoke about this in an interview with ERR.
He said the total amount of payments the party is to make is about 300,000 euros.
“On today's financial forecasts, the Centrist Party will reckon with its current debts and liabilities by the end of this year,” Korb said.
Earlier, it was revealed that the prime minister's party had returned 110,100 euros to the state, which was deemed a prohibited donation.
Car and caravan collide in Harjumaa: four people hurt

The incident injured the drivers of both vehicles, as well as passengers in the house on wheels: a 10-year-old child and a 48-year-old woman who was taken to hospital.
The remaining victims were given first aid on site, and they did not need to be hospitalized.
The exact circumstances of what happened are being clarified.
Ukrainian military to control ceasefire in Donbass
The Ukrainian military has begun preparations for a ceasefire on the demarcation line in Donbass, which will be controlled by military personnel with experience in peacekeeping missions, reports the headquarters of the United Forces on Facebook.
“Units from within the United Forces have begun preparations for a full and comprehensive ceasefire on the demarcation line, which comes into effect from 27 July 2020,” it said.
It is noted that, starting from 00:01 on 27 July, in each of the Ukrainian positions, additional control of the ceasefire will be carried out by specially commissioned Ukrainian servicemen, most of which have combat experience and have been directly involved in profile issues while participating in UN peacekeeping missions.
Such a move would “not divert personnel from United Forces units from carrying out combat missions and prevent possible provocations,” it said.
At Wednesday's meeting of the contact group on Donbass, the parties agreed on a set of additional measures to control the truce, reconnaissance teams and a ban on fire, including sniper.
13 coronavirus patients die in Moscow
In Moscow, 13 more coronavirus patients have died in the past 24 hours.

Psychologist: “Emelianenko still can't forget breaking up with her beloved woman.”
Psychologist Veronika Stepanova, who has more than 1m subscribers on Youtube, spoke about MMA fighter Alexandra Emelianenko, who is her sister's ex-husband.
Olya met Sasha, they started having a violent love,” Stepanova said in a video on her YouTube channel.
- It was a very beautiful story, they instantly had a baby, everything was lovely and wonderful.
At one point, Sasha was all about it, wanted him to walk a little bit.
And if any other woman takes it normally (you'll think, went for a walk, dance a little bit), it's not about Olyu.
She doesn't tolerate such things.
And his story of walking a little bit ended with his sister instantly marrying another man and immediately giving him a baby.
When Sasha came to his senses from what had happened, he couldn't believe it.
He tried to crawl on his knees, diamonds give.
His lion pride blew his head off.
He wanted it back, and how to get it back - he didn't get it.
They maintain friendships, they have a child in common, but he still can't come to his senses.
His destructive behavior is a cry of despair, trying to either get killed, or get her attention.
The Carolina prospect will leave to play Sweden.
Carolina prospect Jack Drury will be appearing in the Swedish championship next season, according to The Hockey News reporter Ryan Kennedy on Twitter.
A player of the United States youth team played in the NCAA for Harvard during the past season.

Drury was selected by Carolina at the 2018 draft as the overall 42nd No.
Albert Prose signs with Tallinn's Legion
Prose's last club was Tartu Tammeka, who he played for last season.
'Because of injury I've been out of football for over a year.
On April 30, he underwent surgery.
But it's OK now - ready to play again.
True, so far my form is far from optimal.
When am I making my debut for Legion?
It is possible that I will play some amount of time for the Estonian Cup on 29 July and I will be in the bid for the championship match against Paide on August 1.
But it all depends on the coach's decision, he will decide whether I'm ready or not.
I think I still need to recruit,” Albert Prose told ERR on Sunday.
In the current Estonian Football Championship, Legion is ninth in the standings after 14 rounds with 10 points.
'At the moment, if you look at the table, we can't speculate about fighting for high places, but Legion is an ambitious team, we've got a reasonably good squad.
I think we'll have better results next year.
And the challenge for this year is to keep a place in the top league and play more confident,” Prose added.
“I don't set any personal goals.
Getting back into football after such a big pause is not easy.
Right now my main task is to help the team stay in the top league and get up the table as high as possible,” the striker said.
Previously, Prose also played for the Capitals Flora and Infonet, Finnish ROPS and TPS, Maltese FC Valetta.
Prose made 7 appearances for the Estonian national team.

Among newly identified cases - 49.2 per cent - are in people aged 18 to 45, 30.6 per cent are 46 to 65, 9.6% from 66 to 79, and another 3.3 per cent are over 80.
Children among them - 7.3 per cent.
Main Naval Parade Marked With New Ships and Shooting Technologies
At the General Naval Parade in St. Petersburg, a new shooting technology was applied: a video camera “passed” under one of the ships, showing it “from out of the out”.
In such a perspective, the passage of the newest serial small rocket ship Sovetsk along Admiralty Embankment was filmed.
The main naval parade was broadcast by Rossiya 1 and the Russia.tv website.
Earlier, on June 24, at the 75th Anniversary Parade of the Great Victory, the camera, when transitioning from one plan to another, “passed” through the tank's muzzle inside the armored vehicle, and during the flight of aerobatic fighters “Russian Vityazi” and “Strizhi” camera “flew out” from the nozzle of the aircraft's engine.
The main naval parade of 46 combat ships, boats and submarines, 41 naval aircraft and helicopters, and more than 4,000 troops ended in the Kronstadt waters.
The parade included the large anti-submarine ship “Vice Admiral Kulakov”, the corvette “Stoyky”, the large landing craft “Minsk” and “Patriot”, the nuclear-powered submarine missile cruiser “Eagle”, submarine Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, patrol ship Vasily Bykov, small anti-submarine ships “Kazanets” and “Urengoy”, small rocket ships “Liven” and “Passat”, and “Chuvashia” missile boat.
The Kronstadt raid in the Gulf of Finland could be seen for the first time the large amphibious ship “Pyotr Morgunov”, built to the 11711 Nevsky PCB project at the Baltic factory “Yantar”.
The head ship of this series, Ivan Gren, is already serving in the Northern Fleet, TASS reports.
Other newcomers who had recently entered service with the Navy included the first production frigate, Admiral of the Kasatons Fleet, built to design 22350 at the Northern Shipyard factory.
Another Navy novice is the Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky diesel-electric submarine of Project 636.3 of Rubin Marine Machinery, built at Admiralty Shipyards.
She replenished the Russian Pacific Fleet in December 2019.
Other newest ships recently included in the Navy are the small rocket ships Sovetsk and Mytishchi Project 22800 (“Karakurt”) developed by CICD Almaz.
The parade on Neva also involved small rocket ships “Veliky Ustyug” and “Serpukhov” Project 21631 “Buyan-M”.
And the biggest contributors were the nuclear-powered submarine missile cruiser Eagle and the large anti-submarine ship “Vice Admiral Kulakov” - they could be seen in the Gulf of Finland.
In recognition of the great contribution of the Russian Navy to ocean exploration, two of the latest hydrographic boats, “Georgi Zima” and “Mikhail Kazansky”, passed along with warships on the Neva. And the Kronstadt raid was the oceanographic research vessel Admiral Vladimirsky, which completed a joint scientific circumnavigation expedition with the Russian Geographic Society in June Antarctica commemorates the 200th anniversary of its discovery by Russian navigators Faddei Bellinsgausen and Mikhail Lazarev.
And at the Palace Bridge, the first Russian line ship of the 16th century, the Poltava, recreated at the historic shipyard, could be seen.
This 54-gun sailboat was launched in 1712, fought in the war with the Swedes, and in 1717 provided landing on the island of Gotland.
The ship was withdrawn from Baltfleet in 1725 and, after its re-creation, launched in St. Petersburg on 27 May 2018.
Passage to Kronstadt this year was limited for the duration of the parade due to the prevention of COVID-19 coronavirus, RIA Novosti reported.
1 Killed in U.S. Protests
Protests were held in Seattle, Portland, Louisville and Denver, Actual Camera reported Sunday.

The protester was shot with a rifle as he sat in his car.
The suspect in the crime has already been detained.
In other cities, demonstrators clashed with law enforcement officials.
Protesters rioted and police were forced to fire tear gas and light stun grenades.
Poll: Lithuania's ruling Union of Peasants and Greens tops party ratings again
The Union of Peasants and Greens of Lithuania, which leads the ruling coalition of the Sejm, topped the parties' rankings.
It was shown by a survey conducted by sociological research company Vilmorus pore commissioned by the newspaper Lietuvos rytas.
After winning the 2016 parliamentary elections, “peasants” lost their first seat and was long led by Russia's chief critic in Lithuania, the opposition “Fatherland Union - Christian Democrats ( conservatives).
However, recently, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda, assessing the electoral opportunities of the parties, said that the Peasants and Greens Union will probably be able to again after this year's parliamentary elections form a coalition.
The statement angered conservatives.
The latest poll showed: if parliamentary elections were held today, 17.6 per cent of voters would vote for peasants and 17.2 per cent for the Conservatives.
In the words of Vilmorus director Vladas Gaidis, the breakaway is within the margin of error, and yet the ruling has stopped falling behind the conservatives.
In Gajdis's view, the sociological success of the “peasants” was helped by the news that Prime Minister Saulus Skvernjalis would lead their electoral list.
This politician was first on the list of “peasants” and in the 2016 election.
In third place is the Social Democratic Party, with 7.1 per cent of respondents now willing to vote for.
It unexpectedly lost 2 per cent for the mesya.
Fourth is the Labour Party, led by Russian-born businessman Viktor Uspassky (6.2 percent).
The rest of the political organizations, judging by the poll, can't break the 5 percent electoral barrier yet.
Putin talks about unique advantages of Russian fleet
Russian President Vladimir Putin said at the General Naval Parade in St. Petersburg that the unique advantages and enhanced combat capabilities of the Russian fleet would be achieved through the introduction advanced digital technology.
As the head of state stated, domestic hypersonic strike complexes, unmanned underwater vehicles are unparalleled by the world.
In addition, the Russian leader drew attention to the most effective means of defense of the Russian Federation.
According to the Russian leader, the Russian Navy's equipment level is constantly increasing, so 40 ships and vessels of various classes will be accepted this year.
It is noted that the emphasis will be placed on equipping unique hypersonic percussion complexes.
Today, the Navy is in service with the latest ships equipped with precision weapons, strategic submarine cruisers and multi-role submarines, as well as unique examples of special vehicles, added president.
Putin also stressed that military sailors perform the most difficult tasks in serving the Fatherland with dignity.
Emergency Situations Ministry warned residents of Moscow region of thunderstorm
A thunderstorm and wind gusts up to 15 m/s are expected in the Moscow region. This was reported by the regional department of the Emergency Situations Ministry on Sunday, July 26.
Residents have been advised to remove household items from yards and trim dry trees that can damage housing.
The car must be placed in a garage or parked away from trees or weakly fortified structures.
In order to avoid lightning, it is recommended not to sink a stove in the house in a thunderstorm or use electrical appliances, and outside not hide under trees (especially lonely ones) or bathe in water bodies.
Those in the car are advised to close their windows and stay inside.
On 24 July, the Emergency Situations Ministry also warned residents of the Moscow region of a thunderstorm.
Excess requirements for public procurement applications shall be excluded by law
Legislation may establish comprehensive requirements for procurement applications.
In the autumn session of the plenary session, the State Duma plans to consider a bill in second reading that sets the requirements for the content and composition of an application for participation in a procurement that may be participants be only small and medium-sized businesses.
The Government is amended by the Government to the Procurement of Goods, Works, Services of Individual Legal Entities Act.
The bill was drafted in accordance with the roadmap for implementing the Strategy for Development of Small and Medium Enterprises in Russia to 2030, approved by the Government.
It provides for a draft law on an exhaustive list of documents that customers are entitled to require as part of an application from procurement participants - small and medium-sized entities entrepreneurship.
As well as the list of requirements for those documents.
To date, the Procurement of Goods, Works, and Services of Certain Legal Entities Act regulates the procurement of certain types of legal entities.
Requirements for the content, form, clearance and composition of the purchase application are set by customers on their own in the purchase documentation.
“As a result, customers are subject to excess requirements for the content, application application, mandatory reference, certificates, statements for which the commissioners receive bodies are comparable to the deadline for submission, which results in the inability to participate in such procurement and a reduction in the number of participants in the purchase,” the bill explains.
The new bill provides for an exhaustive list of documents that customers are entitled to require as part of an application from procurement participants who are small and medium-sized entities entrepreneurship.
“The adoption of the document will prevent customers' arbitrary determination of requirements for the composition and content of applications of participants who are small and medium-sized enterprises,” the explanatory note.
As an artist, the relationship is very important to me.
In my works, I try to show that humans are inseparable from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I first visited Antarctica almost 10 years ago, where I saw icebergs.
I experienced awe-mongering.
My heart scored faster, my head fizzled, trying to understand what opened up in front of me.
The icebergs around floated nearly 200 feet out of the water. And I couldn't help but wonder that it's one snowflake on top of another, year after year.
Icebergs are born when they break off gletblack ice or break away from shelf glaciers.
Each iceberg has its own personality.
Everyone interacts with the environment in their own way and accrues their experience.
Some refuse to give up and hold on until the bitterest end, while others can no longer fight and die in a fit of bright passion.
Looking at the iceberg, it's easy to think that it's isolated, that it's confined and alone, just like we humans often see ourselves.
But things are very different in life.
When the iceberg melts, I inhale its ancient atmosphere.
When an iceberg melts, it releases fresh, mineral-enriched, water that feeds many life forms.
I approach photographing these icebergs like creating portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these individual moments they exist in this kind of image, and that it will never happen again.
They don't die when they melt; it's not the end, but the continuation of their journey in the cycle of life.
Sometimes the ice in the icebergs I photograph is very young — it's only a couple thousand years old.
And some icebergs are over 100,000 years old.
The last photos I want to show you have captured the iceberg I photographed in Kirtartivatziak, in Greenland.
It's a very rare instance of managing to see an iceberg spinning.
So here it is.
A small boat is visible to the left
It is approximately 4.5 meters long.
Please note the shape of the iceberg and its place of contact with the water.
Here, it can be seen starting to spin and the boat has swam over to the other side, and there is a man standing there.
It is a medium-sized Greenland iceberg.
It protrudes from the water at about 120 feet or 40 meters.
And here's this live recording.
(Music) And so it's simple, the iceberg shows us a different side of its personality.
Thank you.
(Applause)
One winter morning a few years ago, I was driving to work in Johannesburg, South Africa, and noticed fog looming over the city.
I drive there almost every day, so it's unlikely I hadn't paid attention to it sooner.
Johannesburg is known for its special horizons that I could barely see that morning.
I soon realized it was a huge cloud of polluted air.
The contrast between my usual picturesque environment and that sky-shrouded in smog has swung something in me.
I was horrified that this city of colourful and picturesque sunsets would be swallowed up by mgli.
At that point, I had a strong desire to do something, but I didn't know what.
I only knew that I couldn't stand aside.
The main difficulty was that I wasn't very versed in ecology, air quality management or atmospheric chemistry.
I'm a computer engineer, and I was sure I couldn't deal with this problem with code.
(Laughter) Who am I to make any difference?
But I was a resident of this city.
In the years that followed, I took one very important lesson — a lesson to be taken seriously if we strive for a better future.
Even if you are not an expert in any field, your outside experience can be the key to solving complex problems in this field.
Sometimes your unique vision can spill out into an extraordinary idea that will shift everything from a dead point, but you have to be brave enough to try to do it.
That's the only way out
Then I realized that in order to at least try to change things for the better, I would have to work out the air pollution to begin with, and that's how I became a student again.
At the beginning of my research, I learned that air pollution is the most important environmental hazard.
According to the World Health Organization, nearly 14 per cent of deaths worldwide in 2012 were caused by home air pollution and ambient air pollution, which is particularly common in low- and middle-income countries.
Air pollution alone causes more deaths annually than malaria or HIV/AIDS.
In Africa, premature deaths due to unsafe sanitation or malnutrition among children does not compare to the number of deaths due to air pollution, and it costs huge economic cost: more than $400 billion as of 2013, according to a study by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.
Now in my work, I am exploring new opportunities in artificial intelligence, where symbiotic communication between humans and the machine will help to find a favorable basis for making the right decisions.
As we study the issue of air pollution, it became clear that we need to find a way to make better decisions to control air pollution, and given the extent of this problems, it is necessary to do this together.
So I decided to meet people who work in the field.
I started meeting with the officials of Johannesburg and other nearby cities, and I also brought in the local scientific community, and made some cold calls.
The networking process I was engaged in helped me gain a deeper understanding of the problem.
It has also helped me not fall into the trap that my colleagues often fall into, trying to innovate when we quickly apply the technology before clearly becoming aware of the problem at hand.
I started thinking about what I could do to improve things.
I just started asking myself how I could effectively combine all my programming and artificial intelligence skills with the experiences of people I met.
I wanted to create an online air quality management platform that would identify patterns in pollution, look ahead and determine what we should expect.
I was going to put my idea into practice, but faced uncertainty, I had no guarantee of success.
I only had a certain set of engineering skills, skills that I had learned in my profession (Laughter) and that people who had not had in the air pollution problem for many years.
I realized that sometimes just one fresh look, some new skills create the conditions for something outstanding to emerge.
Willpower and imagination are our guiding star, giving us the ability to find new ways and circumvent complexities.
Armed with a deep understanding of air pollution and by examining decades of information on pollutant concentrations and meteorological conditions in Johannesburg and beyond, we with my colleagues from South Africa and China, have set up a support system to make decisions about air that is in the cloud.
The software system analyzes historical data and data in real time to identify spatial and temporal trends.
We then used new machine learning technology to predict pollution levels for different pollutants a few days in advance.
This means residents can make better decisions about their movements and their choice of residence for their families.
We will be able to predict pollution in advance, calculate the culprits of pollution, who will be forced to reduce their activities by the authorities.
With scenario planning, urban planners will be able to make good decisions in infrastructure development such as residential settlements, industrial zones.
We completed testing our technology, which lasted about 120 days, covering all of South Africa.
The results were welcomed when we demonstrated a strong relationship between the forecast data and the data we received on the spot.
With our leadership, we have created cutting-edge, innovative technologies that can predict air quality with unprecedented precision, improving the city I was driving on one not long ago winter morning and thought, “Something's wrong here. What can you do?”
And here's my conclusion: what if I didn't then study the problem of air pollution?
What if I hadn't expressed concern about the state of the environment and just hoped someone somewhere was already dealing with the problem?
Here's what I learned: when we're tackling a complex enterprise that contributes to what we strongly believe in, it's important to focus on success and take into account the consequences of inaction.
We should not go out of our way in the face of obstacles and difficulties, it should motivate us even more.
Wherever you are, when you realize that your natural curiosity is excited by something and that's what you care about, and you have crazy and bold ideas, and maybe it's outside your competencies, ask yourself: why not?
Why not act and solve the problem as you can in your way?
And perhaps you'll be pleasantly surprised.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Republicans to offer $1 trillion to support US economy
Republicans will offer to spend another $1 trillion to support the United States economy, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin confirmed on Fox News on Sunday, July 26.
“Inside the $1 trillion package, there are the highest priority and urgent things,” the head of the US finance ministry noted.
The support package includes new direct payments to Americans.
The proposal must pass congress and signed by U.S. President Donald Trump.
Representatives of the Democratic Party of the United States believe that the funds offered are insufficient.
In the spring, about $3 trillion was allocated to support the economy in the United States.
On April 24, Trump signed a nearly half trillion dollar bailout bill for the American economy to combat the coronavirus and its consequences.
According to analysts, US GDP in Q2 2020 will fall 25% on an annual basis, which will be the strongest decline in the country's history.
Microsoft will force update old versions of Windows 10
Microsoft has confirmed the move to the next stage of distribution of May 2020 Update for Windows 10 operating system, BetaNews reports on July 25.
No package needed: FAS questioned the validity of Microsoft's anti-virus offer
By obtaining remote work from US corporation, government agencies may violate legislation
The company will expand the user range with the new version of the OS.
For this purpose, computers with older versions of the system are decided to update automatically.
It is expected that the company's custom-designed algorithm will identify devices with old versions of the software platform, whose support period is about to be completed and automatically installed on them Windows 10 May 2020 Update.
This will soon affect computers with Windows 10 (1809) and Windows 10 (1903), whose support expires on November 10 and December 8 respectively, the publication notes.
On July 21, it was reported that after the Windows 10 operating system update, users experienced problems connecting to the internet - there was no access to the network.
The difficulties were not related to the network connection itself, but rather the connection status.
Dr. Myasnikov Names Top Human Health Indicators
In the “death quartet,” one zee of the main criteria turned out to exceed waist volume
Doctor and TV presenter Alexander Myasnikov spoke about key indicators by which a person's health can be determined.
His so-called “death quartet” included four criteria - it was an increase in pressure, cholesterol, sugar and waist volume, the doctor told Rossiya 1 television.
Butcherykov urged everyone to pay attention to these factors.
In his words, controlling waist volume is even more important than weight.
For men, this parameter should not exceed 102 centimeters, and for women 88 centimeters.
Exceeding these norms may suggest that health is at risk.
It is primarily about heart condition - waist volume above normal is a risk factor for stroke, heart attack, as well as cancer and diabetes.
Let us remind, earlier Myasnikov told why you can eat candy overnight.
The doctor explained that sugar alone is not dangerous to health, it will only become harmful to dessert when eating such food in large quantities, and overnight candy is not the worst snack.
Touring and Super Production Winners Decide at Igor Drive
The Touring and Super Production events have ended at the Igora Drive Circuit, which hosts the main stage of the Russian Ring Racing Series.
It was reported by Channel Five on Sunday, 26 July.
The leaders in Turing were Kirill Ladygin, Dmitry Bragin, Alexey Dudukalo, Pavel Kalmanovich, Ivan Lukashevich.
The Super Production was won by Andrei Petukhov, Vladislav Nezvankin, Nikolai Vikhansky, Vadim Antipov, Dmitry Lebedev.
In the RSCG SMP Trophy, Rustam Fathutdinov became the best, and the runners-up were Lev Tolkachev and Pavel Yashin.
The documentary John Lewis: The Good Trouble has been released online.
The film biography, which was supposed to be a kind of visual congratulation to Congressman John Lewis, who celebrated his 80th birthday at the beginning of the year, became an unfurled epitaph.
On July 17, a prominent human rights activist and politician died after a long battle with pancreatic cancer.
There are numerous mourning events in his memory in the US on these days.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows floated the idea of passing a law focused on several topics, including federal unemployment payments that expire in Friday.
The remaining issues are proposed to be addressed later
Moderna Inc said Sunday that it had received $472 million additional from the U.S. Office of Higher Life Biological Research to develop a vaccine for the new coronavirus.
The US-based firm that makes medicines explained that the additional funding is intended to help the company's work in late-stage clinical trials.
Without any warning, the UK removed Spain from its list of safe to travel countries and imposed a two-week quarantine for all entering the country from Spain.
British Foreign Minister Dominic Raab made no apology for the sudden decision, attributing it to the recent jump in COVID-19 incidence in Spain.
Protests
Protests have been held in a number of US cities to draw attention to the issue of racial injustice.
In Seattle, police fired light stun grenades and tear gas and arrested 45 people, after demonstrations in support of protests in Portland escalated into violence.
Police said more than 20 police officers were injured.
In Austin, Texas, a man died Saturday when someone shot marchers in the “Black Lives Matter” movement.
Media reports suggest the man may have approached the car with a rifle when it was fired on.
US experts call Pompeo the worst secretary of state in country's history
International affairs experts Aaron David Miller and Richard Sokolsky called Mike Pompeo the worst Secretary of State in the history of the United States.
Material with their opinions on July 23 was published by CNN.
“In just two short years, Mike Pompeo - with an eye on the presidency in 2024 and the support of President Donald Trump - has become not only the worst Secretary of State in US history but also the most politically biased,” the text reads.
Specialists accused Pompeo of “politicizing the position of secretary of state and desecrating the institution he runs,” for the sake of promoting his personal political agenda and protecting Trump “from responsibility and the rule of law.”
According to them, the Secretary of State, in particular, is covering up the “Trampov blackmail of Ukraine” and is willing to frame American foreign policy officials for their cooperation with Congress on this cause.
Pompeo was also remembered to be cheering with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who took partial responsibility for the murder of The columnist Washington Post's Jamal Hashkaji.
Trump announced the decision to appoint Mike Pompeo to head the State Department on March 13, 2018, following the firing of former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.
Prior to that, Pompeo headed the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
In Tikhoretsk, foreign car entered the shop
Today, on July 26, in Tikhoretsk on Menshikov Street, a Land Cruiser SUV drove into the shopping hall of a chain supermarket at speed.
The PE recorded outdoor surveillance cameras.
The crash injured a boy, who ended up in the shop at this time.
The child was hospitalized with injuries and cuts.
Storefronts and counters were destroyed in the hall of the retail facility.
Eyewitnesses claim the driver of the foreign car was intoxicated.
Do you know how many species of flowering plants exist?
A quarter of a million — at least those we know — a quarter of a million species of flowering plants.
Flowers are a real problem for plants:
they are hard to create,
they require a huge amount of energy and resources.
Why do plants go for such complexities?
The answer to this, like many other questions, is sex.
I know what you're thinking when you look at these pictures.
The reason sexual reproduction is so important is there are many other ways plants reproduce.
They can be propagated with cuttings; they can fertilize themselves or pollinate themselves.
But it's very important for them to spread their genes to blend them with the genes of other plants - that's how they will be able to adjust to natural niches.
That's how evolution works.
Plants transmit genetic information through pollen.
Some of you may have seen some of these images earlier.
As I like to say, every house has to have a bitmap electron microscope to look at these things.
There are as many different types of pollen as flowering plants.
By the way, this can be used in forensics and not only.
Basically, pollen that causes allergies is pollen from plants that use wind to spread it. It's a very inefficient process, that's why it's crammed so hard into our noses.
Plants have to throw out huge masses of pollen, in the hope that sex cells, male sex cells that are contained in pollen, will somehow accidentally reach another flower, absolutely by accident.
The pollen of all grasses, and therefore all cereals, and pollen of most trees, is carried by the wind.
However, most of the species use insects for this. To some extent, it's more reasonable because less pollen is required.
Insects and other species can take pollen and carry it where they need it.
It is clear that we know the relationship between insects and plants.
It's a symbiotic relationship: whether it's flies, birds or bees - they all get something in return, and that something is usually nectar.
In some cases, this symbiosis has led to amazing adaptations — so, the hummingbird hawk-moth is beautiful in its adaptation.
The plant gets its own - the hawkish moth spreads pollen elsewhere.
Plants have evolved so that they created little landing strips in different places for bees so that those don't get lost.
Many plants have coloration making them look like insects.
These are lily anthers, cleverly made so that when an unsuspecting insect sits on them, the anther flips and strikes it on the back, showering with plenty of pollen with which the insect then goes to another plant.
And here's an orchid that looks like it has jaws. In a way, she has them, which makes the insect crawle, covered in pollen, which it will then spread.
There are at least 20,000 species of orchids — and all of them are remarkably diverse.
They go for a variety of tricks.
They are forced to attract pollinators to breed.
This orchid, known as Darwin's orchid, because he was the one who studied it and made a startling prediction when he saw it. You can see a very long nectar tube that comes out of the orchid.
You see the middle of the flower: the insect must stick the hobot right into the middle and get to the bottom of this tube to get the nectar.
Darwin claimed, looking at this flower, “I assume something evolved in conjunction with it.”
And indeed, here comes the insect.
Usually his hobo is in a curled state, but in its straightened form, it looks like this.
One might think that if nectar — so valuable and expensive to produce — attracts so much attention from pollinators, then, as with sex in humans, cheating can begin.
Flower might say, “I have a bit of nectar.
Will you look in?” Here's a plant.
This is a plant that insects adore in South Africa. In the process of evolution, they acquired a long hobo to get nectar from the bottom.
And this is imitation.
This plant emulates the previous one.
And here's the long-nosed fly, which didn't get a drop of nectar from the fake. Because the copycat plant didn't give her the bottom. She thought she was going to get something.
But not only did the fly not receive nectar from the fake plant, but also — if approximated — near the bottom of the head, snagged a bit of pollen, which it would transfer to another plant, unless There will be some nerd and not riveting it on a pigeon cardboard.
(Laughter) Deception spreads in the plant realm as well.
This flower has black dots: they seem black to us, but for male insects of a particular species, they look like two females ready for anything.
(Laughter) When an insect reaches this flower and lands on it, it dips itself in pollen, which of course it will transfer to another plant. If you look at the raster electron microscope that each house needs to be, you can observe a specific three-dimensional pattern layout here.
So it probably even brings nice sensations to the insect, other than what looks attractive.
The electron microscope image — an orchid imitating the insect — shows that different parts of this structure have different colors and textures, but insects can perceive them completely different.
This plant has adapted to emulate the shiny metallic surface of some beetles.
Under the raster electron microscope, it can be seen that the surface is very different from the surfaces we looked at.
Sometimes the whole plant mimics an insect entirely, even from our perspective.
I think it looks like some flying critter.
It's a striking, amazing flower.
And smart. It's called obsidian.
I call him hoodwdian.
For a bee of a certain species, it resembles another very aggressive bee, and it flies up and hits it's head many times to ward off the “bee”, and is of course covered in pollen.
This plant also imitates another orchid, which has a marvellous warehouse of food for insects.
And this one has nothing for them.
So she cheats on two levels — just unheard of.
(Laughter) Here's ylang ylang, a component of many perfumes.
I recently hunched someone who pouted them.
Flowers don't need to be so fragrant in principle.
They emit a striking range of smells for any insects with a sense of smell.
And this doesn't smell so good.
It's a flower that smells very, very dour, and has evolved to look like a fall.
Flies like it a lot.
They fly in and pollinate.
Here's this one, helicodyceros, also known by the name “dead horse lily.”
I don't know what a dead horse really smells like, but this one definitely smells very similar.
It's really awful.
And meat flies just can't resist.
They fly in and reach the bottom.
There they lay their eggs thinking it's a great piece of falling, and not realizing that there is no food for the larvae and the larvae will die, however, the plant has benefited because the bristles relax , and the fly flies away to pollinate the next flower. It's awesome.
Here is arum, arum maculatum, or in the US — aronnius spotted.
I took a picture of it the previous week in Dorset.
It warms up to about 15 degrees above ambient temperature — astounding.
If you look at it from above, there is something that looks like a dam behind the coB. Flies attract heat — evaporation of volatile compounds — and they get stuck at the bottom in that container.
They drink divine nectar and become sticky.
Overnight they are covered in pollen streaming them on top, and then the bristles we saw above loosen up and release the pollen-covered flies. Awesome thing.
If you think this is astounding, here's one of my favourites.
Philodendron Sello.
Those from Brazil should be aware of this plant.
That's the most striking thing.
Here's this phallic thing about 30 centimeters long.
It does something that no other plant known to me does: when it blooms — in the middle of the cob — for about two days, its metabolism is similar to mammalian metabolism .
Instead of starch, which is food for plants, it takes something similar to brown fat and burns it at such a rate, digest just like a small cat.
This recoil of energy, at equivalent weight, is twice as high as that of a hummingbird — utterly astounding.
And it's also doing something else that's unusual too.
Not only does it warm itself up to 115 Fahrenheit, or 43-44 Celsius, for two days, but it also keeps the temperature constant.
It has a thermoregulation mechanism that maintains a constant temperature.
You ask, “Why is he doing this?”
Well it's like you didn't know there were bugs that just adore making love at that temperature.
They get inside, and that's where it starts.
(Laughter) And the plant showers them with pollen, and they go to pollinate.
Amazingly made up.
Most of the pollinators we know are insects, but in the tropics also many birds and butterflies pollinate.
A lot of tropical flowers are red, and we feel like this is because butterflies and birds have their vision similar to ours, and that they see red very well.
But if you look at the spectrum, man and bird see red, green and blue - they see that spectrum.
Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet, and they distinguish between different hues of ultraviolet,
who are at that end of the spectrum.
Surely you think, “It would be great if we could see them.”
Yes, we can.
So what does the insect see?
Last week, I took these pictures of the colnce-blossom, a family of lapel, in Dorset.
These are the smallest yellow flowers that we see everywhere.
That's how it looks in daylight.
And that's what it looks like if you put the red away.
Most bees don't see red.
Then I put on the camera ultraviolet filters and did a very, very long excerpt with certain frequencies of ultraviolet, and that's what turned out.
The most thing about eating “bullseye”.
Of course, we know exactly what bees see, no more than you know what I see when I call it red.
We can't tell what's going on in our neighbor's mind, we don't talk about an insect already.
But the picture will be about as contrasting, standing out strongly in the background.
Here's another small flower — a different range of ultraviolet frequencies, other filters, to match pollinators.
They're going to see about this.
In case you think this applies to all yellows — no flower in the filming process was harmed, this one was just attached to a tripod rather than ripped off - when they're in ultraviolet light , then take a look at this one.
By the way, it could have served as the basis of sunscreen because such creams work by absorbing ultraviolet.
Maybe this connection would be useful.
Finally, here's one of the enoters that Bjorn Rohrslett of Norway sent me — a fantastic hidden pattern.
I like the idea of something hidden.
I think there's something poetic about it. These photos were shot with an ultraviolet filter, which is mostly used by astronomers to shoot Venus — actually the clouds of Venus.
This is the primary purpose of this filter.
Venus is, of course, the goddess of love and fertility, and this is in tune with flowers.
Not only do the flowers spend a lot of effort in attracting pollinators, they also somehow managed to persuade us to plant whole fields of flowers and give them to each other at times of birth and death, to a wedding, which, if you think about, is a moment that represents the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
China's Yangtze River has its third in a year
After a powerful downpour in the upper course of the Yangtze River — China's longest water artery — there have been floods for the third time in a year.
Flooding was caused by rising water levels in the river's tributaries in its upstream stream, resulting in a rapid increase in water intake to the reservoir of the Chinese Sanxia HPP /"Three Gorges”/.
At 14:00 on July 26, the reservoir experienced an influx of 50,000 cubic m/s, expected to reach a maximum of 60,000 cubic m/s on the evening of July 27, the Yangtze River Water Committee said under the Ministry of Water Management of the PRC.
The committee today issued flood alerts on one section of the headwaters of the Yangtze River and the overflow of the Sanxia Hydroelectric Power Station reservoir.
My job is to help computers make messages about the world around them.
There are many ways to do this, but I like helping computers tell what they see and understand.
For example, in this picture, a modern computer vision algorithm can recognize that it is a woman and this is a dog.
He can tell the woman is smiling.
He is even able to say that the dog is extraordinarily cute.
I work on it thinking about how people understand and process data about the world.
What thoughts, memories and stories can awaken in people such a picture.
Anything to do with situations like this.
You may have seen a similar dog before or have spent time running along the beach, and this in turn brings up thoughts and memories of the past vacation, the time spent on the beach, or time, when you were running somewhere with other dogs.
One of my main principles is to help computers understand what it means to have such experiences, understand what we share, what we believe and what we feel, because then we'll be ready to get involved computer technology into processes that complement our own experience.
If I get deeper, I started helping computers write stories based on a series of images a few years ago.
And one day in the course of work, I asked the computer what he thought of going to Australia.
He took a look at the pictures and saw a koala.
He didn't know what a koala was, but said he thought it was a curious creation.
Then I shared with him a series of images about burning houses.
He looked at the pictures and said: “Amazing view! Awesome!”
I had goosebumps running down my back.
He looked at a terrible, life-destroying event and thought it was something positive.
I realized that he recognized the contrasts, shades of red and yellow and thought it deserved a positive assessment.
Partly he did it because most of the images I gave him were positive.
Because people tend to share positive images when they talk about their experiences.
When was the last time you saw a selfie at a funeral?
I realized that by improving artificial intelligence, task after task, array of data by array, I created huge gaps, holes and gaps in what he could understand.
And in doing that, I coded all possible kinds of biases.
Preconceptions that reflect a limited vision limited to a single dataset. Gaps that reflect human biases encoded in the data, such as bias and stereotypes.
I thought about the evolution of technology that led me to where I ended up then — how the first color photos were calibrated by white women's skin, which means the color photos weren't adapted to dark faces.
And that same bias, this same gap was seen in the 90s.
And this same information gap we have today in how well we can recognize diverse human faces with facial recognition technology.
I was thinking of the latest research where we tend to limit our thinking to one dataset and one problem.
And by doing so, we created more gaps and biases that AI could develop even more strongly.
I realized there was a need to think more about how the technologies we're working with today would look like in 5 and 10 years.
Humanity evolves slowly, over time correcting problems in the interaction between humans and the environment.
Artificial intelligence, by contrast, is evolving at incredible speed.
And that means it's really important, to think carefully about it right now - to reflect on our own gaps, our own biases and how it affects technology, that we are creating and discuss what modern technologies will mean in the future.
Top managers and scientists around the world are talking about what they think artificial intelligence will be in the future.
Stephen Hawking cautions: “AI can end humanity.”
Elon Musk warns that this is one of the greatest existential risks our civilization has ever faced.
Bill Gates is perplexed: “I don't understand why people aren't concerned.”
But those opinions are only part of the story.
Mathematics, models, fundamental bricks of artificial intelligence are what we call access and what we work with.
We have open source tools for machine learning and intelligence that we are willing to share.
And beyond that, we can share our experiences.
Sharing your knowledge of technology, and how it worries us, and how it excites us.
We can discuss what we love.
We can anticipate which aspects of technology can become the most useful over time and which are the most problematic.
If we all focus on an open dialogue about AI in the future, it will help create an atmosphere of shared awareness of what AI is now what it can become, and what we should do to get the most appropriate result for us.
We already see and know all this about the technologies used today.
We use smartphones, digital assistants and vacuum cleaners.
Are they evil?
Maybe sometimes.
Are they useful?
Absolutely.
And they are all different.
And in them you already see a beam of light illuminating our future.
The future begins in what we're creating and building right now.
We're launching the domino effect that will determine the path AI develops.
Right now we're shaping the AI of the future.
Technologies that immerse us in augmented realities bring past worlds back to life.
Technologies that help people share experiences when they have difficulty communicating.
Technologies based on understanding streaming visual worlds are used for driverless cars.
Technologies based on image understanding and language generation are evolving into technologies that help visually impaired people better access the visual world.
But we also see how technology can lead to problems.
Today, we have technologies that analyze our innate physical characteristics — such as skin color or facial features — to determine whether we can be criminals or terrorists.
We have technologies analyzing data about us, even data like gender or race, to determine if we can get credit.
All we see now is just one frame from the evolution of artificial intelligence.
Because where we are now is just a moment of this evolution.
That means everything we do today will have an impact on our future.
If we want AI to evolve to help humans, we need to identify the goals and strategies that will set that path now.
I'd love to see something that suits people well, combined with our culture and environment.
Technologies that help those of us who suffer from neurological or other diseases to make life equally difficult for all.
Technologies that work regardless of your skin color or demographics.
Today, I'm focused on technology that will be with us tomorrow and 10 years from now.
AI can become anything.
But in this case, it's not a self-driving machine with no final destination.
This car is driven by us.
We choose when to accelerate and when to slow down.
We choose when we need to turn.
We choose what the AI of the future will be.
There are countless things that artificial intelligence can become.
And he will become a lot of things.
And our task today is to find out what exactly we have to put into AI so that the results are the best for all of us.
thanks

Dagestan head Vladimir Vasiliev held a meeting with reigning UFC lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov, according to the website of the head of the republic.
The occasion was the sport facilities, whose late champion father, Honored Coach of Russia Abdulmanap Nurmagomedov, showed great interest in constructing.
They are a sports complex in Dubki village of Kazbekovsky district and the Martial Arts Sports Training Center in Sildi village of Tsumadinsky district.
First of all, Vladimir Vasiliev said that the construction of these sports facilities is also a tribute to the great coach.
Father of Abducted Salska Infant Discovered Details of Accident
The father of a newborn abducted from a maternity hospital in Salsk, Rostov region, has revealed details of the incident.
Alexander Rusikov reported that the kidnapper went into his wife's chamber when she was going to go to the bathroom.
The mother of the abducted infant could not have thought that a person with malice might be in the maternity hospital.
The woman walked away from the ward literally a couple of metres when she heard a neighbour scream.
The infant was no longer on the ward.
Everything happened between three and four o'clock in the morning, Rusikov said.
He also said that the couple's ward was located between two medical posts, but there were no nurses on the site at the time of the incident.
Also, the father of the abducted infant said no comment or apology followed from hospital staff.
We recall that a newborn baby boy abducted on Saturday from a maternity hospital in Salsk was found on the same day in the Republic of Kalmykia.
Police have detained a 40-year-old kidnapping suspect.
The baby was already returned to the mother
Medics took tests from the infant to ensure he was healthy and unharmed.

Expert evaluated the role of vitamins in forming immunity
Andrei Shishulnikov, head freelance specialist for adult primary health care in the Moscow Department of Health, assessed the role of vitamins in forming immunity.
“It is impossible for extradoses of some drugs, vitamins or foods to create stable immunity in a very short period,” he told the radio station Says Moscow.
There are certain rules, he said.
For example, summer is better to spend more time outdoors, including in the sun.
Shjesulnikov also noted that during the summer you need to consume large quantities of seasonal fresh vegetables and fruits.
“It generally strengthens immunity, gives a certain supply of vitamins and a certain supply of health,” he added.
Earlier, Zjesulnikov cited several differences in flu from coronavirus.
Russia registered 5765 COVID-19 patients per day

Region head Igor Kobzev meets with mayors of Ust-Ordynsky Buryat District
During the workshop, which took place today, July 24, the government of Irkutsk region discussed the main areas of development of remote agrarian territories.
During working trips in the areas of Ust-Ordynsky Buryat District, the head of the region gave a number of instructions.
Today, the mayors reported on their performance.
First of all, construction of the Sports House in Ust-Orda has been resumed.
The commission for this facility was given by the President of the Russian Federation fourteen years ago.
But it's only now that the situation has managed to shift from a dead point.
866 million rubles will be spent on construction.
The completion date of the structure is 2022.
And as early as this year, a school in Bayandai village is due to be commissioned.
The finishing of the rooms has been completed at the moment.
Of the remaining works are landscaping of the grounds.
In general, the program of construction of preschool and secondary education facilities is of particular importance to the region.
For your county - in particular.
The demographics here are the best in the region.
And we are obliged to create all educational and leisure conditions for children of all ages, - said Igor Kobzev, Governor of the Irkutsk Region.
At the meeting, the head of the region instructed all mayors to actively participate in the development of human settlements general plans.
This is one of the main conditions for the complex development of the county.
All settlements must have established boundaries and a master plan.
This is necessary for the development of the territory, for the construction of socially important sites, as well as infrastructure and cultural heritage, - the head of the region stressed.
The conversation also raised a problem with a 30% reduction in milk intake from cooperatives.
This was due to the redistribution by the processing plant of milk buying in favour of peasant farms.
Because of this, the share of product intake from cooperatives decreased.
The head of the region instructed the Acting Minister of Agriculture to go to the site, examine the structure of milk delivery, analyze the experience of other territories and identify solutions problems.
Kuzminov won two races of the second stage of the RSKG SMP at Igora Drive.
Igora Drive hosted the second race of the second stage of the RSCG SMP Championship.
Pavel Kuzminov won his second consecutive victory.
He started fifth, but was in the lead on the first lap.
The second-ranked Alexander Dudarev moved up from the sixth position.
Sergei Tikhomirov lost his position, repelled Alexander Chernyak's attacks and first secured third place, but got a penalty drive through and after driving down the pitlane he was out of contention for the podium.
Ivan Pugachev was third, who won five positions.
Moscow region authorities tell of the fate of closed landfills
Solid waste landfills continue to be closed in Moscow.
This year, authorities are promising to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 landfills that existed in the field are being upgraded into modern garbage processing complexes.
But this option is not possible for every landfill site - many of them have grown with dense residential development.
Once the landfill is closed, it is reclaimed - the polygon's body is filled with soil, degassing and infiltrate diversion systems are mounted.
This allows chemical processes inside the landfill to stop so that it does not ignite, exude stench, and poisons soil and groundwater.
And then the former dump is left to be towered by a useless pile among its residential developments.
Why not make something useful out of her?
For example, in Ruse, where the reclamation of the Annino range finished just the other day, authorities are considering the option of making a ski slope out of the pile.
This landfill, which operated from 1976 to 2016, has grown so far beyond the boundaries of the land allocated to it.
Therefore, in reclamation, it was necessary to buy back adjacent sites, de facto long already littered with litter.
“Some time will pass, the range will “fit,” the fortress will be set up, and we will think what can be done to make it a good start.
The ski resort is thrown right in the eye,” Nikolay Parfenov, the head of the Ruz district, told reporters.
Two landfills to be renewable energy production sites
The Torbeevo landfills in Lyubertsy and Timokhovo in Bogorodorod Okrug will be sites for the extraction of renewable energy from landfill and biological gases.
Torbeev will launch a gas piston power plant by the end of the year, capable of generating up to 8 million kilowatt hours of electricity and about 0.95 gigacalories of thermal energy per year, which will provide the landfill's own needs - the heating supply of administrative and production facilities.
Timokhovo will produce 72.5 million kilowatt-hours and will continue to operate as a waste processing complex.
And a museum could be set up at the Kucino Balashikha training ground, which was closed after complaints from residents about a “Straight Line” with the country's president.
“This idea was to create a museum for the reclamation of landfills in Moscow,” said Dmitry Kurakin, Deputy Chief Minister of Ecology and Environmental Management of the region.
Israel reported drone crash in southern Lebanon
An Israeli army drone landed in southern Lebanon.
The armed forces reported it had collapsed “during operational activities.”
No reason for the fall of the apparatus is reported
“Some time ago, while operating near the border with Lebanon, an Israeli army drone landed in Lebanese territory.
There is no risk of information leaking,” Israel's army said on Twitter.
As a reminder, this week the Israeli army decided to reinforce its military units on the border with Lebanon, fearing revenge by the Lebanese Hezbollah movement for the killings of its fighters in Syria.
Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah vowed not to leave the deaths of any of his “brothers” unanswered.
More on the situation - in Kommersant's piece “Israel awaits Hezbollah revenge.”
Furgal changer walks out to protesters for the first time
Mikhail Degtyarev, the governor of Khabarovsk Krai, came out for the first time since his appointment in support of Sergei Furgal, arrested ex-head of the region.
A broadcast of the meeting took place on his Instagram page.
“Moscow hears everyone, so it sent you a vrio to keep the region from rolling down without power... I repeat Furgal again: he “a” is my comrade, “b” is a fellow party, “c” - I am very worried about his fate, the party gives him assistance, hands him products, Zhirinovsky knocks to all offices.” stated the governor's office
According to Degtyarev, Khabarovsk Krai cannot remain without a leader, so he was appointed by a decree of President Vladimir Putin to head the region to “a wonderful building ( the government of the province) functioned, everything worked, the budget was spent on social needs.”
The governor's Vrio explained that he had not gone out to the protesters before because he could not communicate with thousands of demonstrators.
Therefore, he conducts broadcasts on social networks and reads all the comments on them.
On 25 July, two consecutive protests took place in Khabarovsk.
Rallies in support of the former governor have been taking place in the region since July 11.
On the eve of the next action, Mikhail Degtyarev said he would leave the city on the day of the rally.
His motorcade was stopped by protesters and urged to speak out about the fate of arrested ex-governor Furgal.
Degtyarev had previously refused to go out to participants in the shares
“There is more to do to the leader really than to go out and communicate with those who are screaming under the windows,” the governor said.
Today, I would like to show you how we're going to do different things in the future.
I believe that soon our buildings and cars will be self-assembling, reproducing and mending themselves.
So, I'm going to show you what I think is the current stage of industrial development and then compare it to some natural systems.
So, in the current stage of industrial development, we have skyscrapers - 2.5 years, 500,000 to a million pieces, sophisticated enough, awesome new technologies in steel, concrete and glass.
We have amazing machines that can get us into space - 5 years, 2.5 million parts.
But on the other hand, if you look at natural systems, we see proteins of two million species that can gather in 10,000 nanoseconds, or a DNA chain with three billion major pairs that we can copy somewhere in an hour.
So, natural systems for all their complexity are extremely efficient, far more efficient than anything we can build, far more complex than anything we can build.
They are much more energy efficient.
They are almost never wrong.
And they can rebuild themselves over a long life.
So, there's something very interesting about natural systems.
And if we can carry that into our man-made environment, our way of creating things will have tremendous potential.
And I think the key is self-assembly.
So, if we want to use self-assembly in our physical environment, I think we need to consider four key factors.
One: we need to decipher the complexity of what we want to build - our buildings and machines.
And you need to decompose them into a simple sequence - the basic DNA of construction processes.
Then we'll need the spreadable pieces that can understand that sequence and use it to curl up or reassemble.
We're going to need some amount of energy that will enable all of this to activate, make the parts capable of being collected under the program.
And we need some kind of backup bug-fixing system to ensure that we can successfully build what we want.
I'm going to show you some of the projects that my colleagues at Emaiti and I are working on to achieve this self-gathering future.
The first two are Macrobot and Decibot.
These are projects - large-scale reconfigurable robots - 2.5 and 3.5 metre squirrels.
Mechanical electrical devices, sensors are built into them.
You paint what you need to curl into, into a sequence of angles - minus 120, minus 120, 0, 0, 120, minus 120 - something like that; a sequence of angles or turns, and you send this one sequence by cord.
Each unit gets its message - minus 120. He turns to that corner, checks to see if everything is right and passes the information to the neighbor.
And these are brilliant scientists, engineers, designers who worked on this project.
And I think it actually brings out the question: Are other scales possible here?
I mean, thousands of dollars, lots of man-hours to make this 2.5 meter robot.
Will we actually be able to zoom in? Can you really build robotics into every part?
The next project resolves this issue, considers a passive nature, or attempts to obtain modification program passively.
But it goes a step further and tries to get a real computation.
At its core, it has the most fundamental building block of computing, the logical element of a digital integrated circuit directly in each part.
It's an “I-NOT” element.
You have one tetrahedron - an element that will do all the calculations, and two tetrahedra to input.
One for user input, it's the way you put bricks.
Another for information from the previous laid brick.
And then it outputs information in three-dimensional space.
So, this means that the user can start to start moving the bricks in the right direction.
His calculations are built on what was done earlier and on what you told him to do.
And now it's starting to move in three-dimensional space - up or down.
On the left side, [1,1] input is 0 at the exit, moving down.
On the right side, [0,0] input is 1 on the output, which means moving up.
And crucially, our structures now contain blueprints of what we want to build.
They have all the information built into them about what was built.
So, that means we have some form of self-reproduction.
In this case, I call it self-directed reproduction because the structures contain clear blueprints.
If errors appear, you can replace the part.
All local information is saved so you know how to fix it.
So you may have something that moves and reads information and can transmit it from one part to another.
It is built directly inside, without external control.
The last project I'll show you is called Offset Chains, and this may be the most exciting example of what we have now of passive self-assembling systems.
It combines the ability to reconfigure and graph and creates a fully passive system.
At the core we have a chain of elements.
All elements are completely identical, and offset.
So every chain or every element wants to turn right or left.
And when you put together a chain, you essentially program it.
You tell each block where it should turn: right or left.
So when you shake the chain, it collapses into the configuration you programmed - in which case into a spiral, or in this case - two cubes next to each other.
So in general you can program any three-dimensional form - or one-dimensional, two-dimensional - out of these absolutely passive chains.
So what does that tell us about the future?
I think it tells us that for self-assembly, replication, repair in our physical structures, buildings, machines, there are new possibilities.
New software is possible in these parts.
And from here, you have new possibilities in computing.
We'll have spatial computers.
Imagine that our buildings, bridges, cars, all our bricks could make calculations.
It's an amazing parallel and distributed force of cleanup, new design capabilities.
It's incredible potential.
I think the projects I've shown you are only a small step towards the future, if we implement these new technologies, to a new self-assembling future.
Thank you.

Number of coronavirus deaths worldwide exceeds 640 thousand
More than 15.7 million people are infected
The number of coronavirus victims worldwide has exceeded 640,000, and nearly 15.7 million cases have been confirmed.
Such data on Sunday, July 26, is cited by the World Health Organization (WHO).
According to this report, 200,625 new cases of coronavirus and 4,823 deaths were reported worldwide over the past day.
Over all time, pandemics worldwide have already recorded 15,785,641 people with coronavirus infections, and the number of deaths has risen to 640,016.
The US remains the leader in the number of infected and dead, with more than 4.3 million infections and more than 149,000 deaths.
Brazil is second in the anti-rating position, where the number of people who have so far exceeded 2.4 million, and 86.5 thousand coronavirus patients have died.
India is followed with 1.4 million infected and nearly 33,000 dead.
A day earlier, the number of coronavirus infected in the world within a day broke a new record.
Within 24 hours, doctors identified 284,196 new cases.
The previous record was 247,225 infected.
what linked the Vatican and Nazi Germany
This week is another date - 87 years since the treaty between the Vatican and Nazi Germany.
The document, signed a few months after Hitler came to power, became the basis on which the Holy See's relationship with the fascists was built.
One of those who prepared the treaty was Cardinal Pacelli, who became pontiff Pius XII 6 years before the outbreak of World War II.
In Sochi, a dump truck body collapsed onto the cab of a truck, killing the driver.
Footage has emerged on the Web that captured the accident that took place last Saturday, July 25, at a construction site in Sochi.
The recording shows how, while carrying out, the raised body of the dump truck collapsed down, chucking directly into the cab of the truck.
A 59-year-old man who was driving died on the spot from his injuries, the Emergencies Ministry said.
Rescuers were needed to retrieve the body of the deceased.
Beautiful high minarets only decorated Ayia Sofia
Once again about Ayia Sophia, the text of Vladimir Zelinsky was caught up, which, maul, should be protested.
First, there became free admission - hooray!
I haven't been to Istanbul, but the House of God is better free admission than paid.
Second, Muslims conquered this land as honestly as the Orthodox conquered the Volga-Oksk interregnum, the Muslim Caucasus (and put the church in Grozny) and planted apple trees on Mars.
God in aid!
Jews conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans conquered America.
Are we going to give everything back to everyone?
Do you think there will be no heathens who will demand the return of their capital, where the Tithe Church is in place?
Third, Muslims have improved this building, invested in it.
That is, they are the same as the factories and estates that the Leninists took from the bourgeois in their ownership, belong to the Leninists - Putin and other nomenclature.
They've improved everything - from the Kremlin to Angara, so it's all their rightfully progressors.
Beautiful high minarets very decorated Ayia Sofia, very much.
There was a stupid inkwell, became a stupid inkwell with beautiful minarets.
Fourth, there are no “Islamic” and “orthodox” civilizations.
There are believers, there are hypocrites, there are hanzhi combining faith and hypocrisy.
A believer in the categories of civilization does not think.
This is the thinking of British MiD official Toynbee, a believer ashamed to think so.
There's a place of prayer to the faithful everywhere.
And always.
The believer does not pray only where he is asked to remove from - removed elsewhere and prays there.
He's a believer, not an advocate.
We are cologs, not grub-stones.

Camera 'passed under ship' during Navy Day parade broadcast
Also on Victory Day, the camera flew through a tank's muzzle
Today, July 26, the Navy Day parade is being held in St. Petersburg.
During filming, one of the cameras filming the technique “passed under the ship.”
The application of new shooting technology allowed viewers to see the underwater part of the parade.
The latest serial small rocket ship Sovetsk was shown in the same angle.
It ran along Admiralty Quay.
In a parade on June 24, marking the 75th anniversary of Victory, the camera passed through the barrel into the tower of one of the tanks and showed what equipment was inside the grand military machine.
Then a record number of military equipment - 234 combat vehicles - took part in the Victory Jubilee Parade.
The new products that went to the main square of the country for the first time, such as the modernized T-90M and T-80BVM main battle tanks were shown.
The updated BMP-2M infantry fighting vehicles with the Berezhok Combat Module were also passed through Red Square on June 24 for the first time.
Almost half of Britons believe in Kremlin intervention in Brexit referendum
Almost half of Britons - 49 per cent - believe Russia tried to influence the course of the 2016 referendum on Britain leaving the European Union.
The Guardian reports this, citing the results of a survey conducted by Opinium.
23% of those surveyed are reported to hold the opposite view on the issue.
47% of respondents also believe the Kremlin interfered in the last UK general election of 2019 as well.
July will leave with heat, August will start with cool
Over the weekend, Moscow and the region experienced the coldest night in July.
No chilling soul and body apocalypse frosts certainly didn't happen.
But for summer, it's a dabble.
Before recounting the weather in Moscow on July 27 - August 2, 2020, it is worth noting that the air cooled to +8.8 degrees in the capital on the night of Saturday, July 25.
Kolomna has even set a new temperature record: +7 degrees (the former low for July 25 has been held since 1964, over half a century).
Cherusti steel cold pole near Moscow - thermometers showed +3.9 degrees.
However, the afternoon and Saturday and Sunday were quite comfortable.
Although it is still 2 to 3 degrees cooler compared to climate standards.
On working days, Moscow will return not just heat, but real heat.
On Monday, July 27, the Hydrometcenter of Russia promises +26 degrees, Tuesday and Wednesday +28... +29, Thursday, July 30, +26 degrees.
Short showers - every day, midweek with thunderstorms.
The last day of July and the first days of August (ie the following weekend) will be cool, no higher than +19... +24 degrees.
And it won't be without precipitation.
Rwandan exec admits setting fire to Nantes cathedral
The Rwandan, who worked at the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul in the French city of Nantes on a voluntary basis, confessed to setting him on fire a week after the fire.
This was reported on Sunday by France-3 television.
According to him, the man, who had already been detained on July 19, the day after the fire, had been detained again the day before.
He appeared before an investigating magistrate on Saturday night.
After being charged with intentionally damaging property, the man admitted to orchestrating arson attacks in three locations - under a large organ, under a small organ and by a power shield.
He now faces up to 10 years in prison and a €150,000 fine.
The 39-year-old Rwandan's motive for the actions of the 39-year-old is not yet reported.
It is only known that he volunteered to assist in the cathedral and had to close its doors on the day of the fire.
However, according to CCTV footage, he left the religious establishment 15 minutes after receiving calls about a fire in the building.
The ignition at the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul occurred on 18 July.
More than 200 firefighters fought for a Gothic architecture monument for hours.
Yet they failed to salvage stained glass from the time of Louis XII and the unique organ of the Baroque era.
It was not possible to bring the situation under control until three hours after the fire started.
No one was injured as a result of the accident.
The current fire is not the first during the temple's existence.
In 1972, fire destroyed its roof.
It took 13 years to deal with the effects of that ignition.
For parishioners, the cathedral was not reopened until 1985.
Legendary goalie traveler PfannenStil could become an Inter scout.
Former German goalkeeper Lutz PfannenStil could enter Inter's HQ.
According to Kicker, the 47-year-old was given the position of head of the scout department.
Pfannenestil held a similar position at “Fortune” from Düsseldorf from December 2018 to May 2020, and before that worked at Hoffenheim.
As a footballer, PfannenStil became famous for his frequent transitions.
He is the only professional player to have appeared in all six FIFA confederations, succeeding over 20 clubs, which included representatives from Singapore, South Africa, New Zealand, Canada, Namibia and several other countries.
It is thought only sighted people may be driving the car.
Still recently, it was believed that safe and self-driving was an impossible task for the blind.
Hello, I'm Danis Hong, and we give the blind freedom and independence by designing cars for the visually disabled.
Before talking about this car for the blind, I'll briefly talk about another project I've been working on, called DARPA Urban Challenge.
The project was to create a self-driving robot car.
The driver presses “start” and without his involvement, the car reaches its destination.
In 2007, our team won half a million dollars, finishing third in this competition.
Around the same time, the National Federation of the Blind, or NFS, set a task for the research committee to develop a vehicle that can independently and safely drive a blind man.
We decided to try our hand because we thought, “Hey, what's tough here?
We already have an autonomous car.
Let's put a blind man in it - and the end of it, really?”
(Laughter) But we were deeply misguided.
The NFS wanted not just a car to carry the blind, but a car that the unsighted could drive on his own.
So we had to pick everything up and start from scratch.
So, to experience this crazy idea, we developed a small prototype buggy car to test the feasibility of the project.
And in the summer of 2009, we invited unsighted youth from all parts of the country and gave them the chance to experience this vehicle.
It was an amazing experience.
But the hitch is that this car was designed to be controlled in a tightly controlled environment, namely in a flat enclosed car park where even lanes are restricted to red signal by cones.
Due to this success, we decided to take the next big step and develop a real car that could be driven on real roads.
So, how does it work?
Well, it's a pretty complex system, but let me clarify maybe even simplify it.
So, it includes three components.
These are tactile perception, computation, and non-visual interfaces.
Since the driver can't see anything, the system must perceive the environment and collect information for the driver.
The initial parameter meter is used for this.
It measures acceleration, angular acceleration, similar to a person's inner ear.
This information is then transferred to a GPS device to assess the vehicle's location.
Two cameras are used to detect lane on road
and three laser rangefinders.
Lasers scan the space around the vehicle to detect various objects: an approaching oncoming or overtaking vehicle, any obstacles encountered on or around the car.
Then all this huge amount of information is fed into the computer and the computer performs two steps.
First of all, it's processing that information to get an idea of space: identifying lanes on the road, identifying obstacles, and then bringing that information to the driver.
The system is also smart enough to calculate the safest way to operate a car.
So, we can also make recommendations on how to operate the car.
But the problem is, how do we convey that information and instructions to an unsighted person lacking the fast and accurate response needed to drive?
For this purpose, we have developed a range of interface technologies for the unsighted:
A 3-D ping sound system, vibrating vest, handlebars with beeps, a special prosthetic leg, and even shoes that put pressure on the foot.
But today we're only going to talk about three kinds of these special interfaces.
The first interface is called DriveGrip.
It's a pair of gloves with motors on the joints of his fingers instructing the driver how to steer: direction and angle of turning.
Another device is SpeedStrip.
It is originally a massage chair.
It was disassembled and rearranged vibrating elements in it. Vibration is used to communicate speed information to the driver, and to guide the use of gas and brake pedals.
So, you can see how the computer perceives the space around the car. Because the vibration cannot be seen, red LEDs are installed on the driver to demonstrate the process.
This is touch data and is transmitted to devices by computer.
DriveGrip and SpeedStrip devices are very efficient.
But the problem is that these are instructional prompting devices.
They don't actually give freedom to govern, do they?
The on-board computer gives the driver commands: left, right, add speed, stop.
We call it “the annoying backseat passenger.”
So we move away from learning prompts and focus our attention on informing devices.
AirPix is a great example of such an interface.
It's a kind of monitor for the blind.
A small panel with many holes through which compressed air exits, thus creating images.
An unsighted person can take a palm to this panel and “see” lanes on the roadway and obstacles.
Also the driver can change the frequency at which the air exits and possibly the temperature of the air.
I.e., it is an interface for displaying multidimensional data.
So here you see the left and right camera of the car, and how the computer processes and sends that information to the AirPix panel.
Here we demonstrate an exercise machine, a blind man driving a car using AirPix.
This simulator proved to be very useful for training blind drivers as well as to quickly test ideas for using different kinds of special interfaces.
That's how this system briefly works.
After all, it's a prototype car for the unsighted. And he won't be released onto the roadway until convinced of its absolute safety.
And I sincerely believe that's quite likely.
Yet, will society accept such a radical idea?
How much will auto insurance rules change?
On what conditions will a driver's license be issued?
Beyond technological challenges, there are so many pitfalls to overcome before this becomes a reality.
Of course, the main purpose of this project is to develop a car for the blind.
However, it is possible that the spin-off technologies developed during this project will prove to be an invaluable contribution to our lives.
Our sensors work regardless of time of day, fog and rain.
We can use these technologies along with new special interfaces to improve car safety for the sighted.
Or for the unsighted. Find them use in everyday appliances, in educational institutions, offices.
Just imagine: a teacher in a classroom writes on a blackboard, and a blind student can see and read what is written using these special interfaces.
It's priceless.
So what I showed you today is just the beginning.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Second 'Bill & Ted' trailer with Keanu Reeves is released
The second trailer for the third installment of the “Bill & Ted” franchise appeared on Orion Pictubes' YouTube channel.
The trailer opens up some details from the current life of the dapper friends: they settle in a suburban neighborhood, married to their girlfriends Joanna (Jaima Mayes) and Elizabeth (Erinn Hayes) from “Incredible the adventures of Bill and Ted” (1989), moreover, restless adventurers have long been raising daughters.
Brigitte Landy-Payne (“Glass Castle,” “Atypical”) plays Billy, Ted's daughter, and Samara Weaving (“I Go Looking”) is Thea, Bill's daughter (yes, Bill and Ted named their daughters Billy and Thea, such is a pun).
On top of all, another great adventure awaits them: they must go to the future to steal their own song - the only way they can save the world.
In the trailer, American rapper Kid Cudi and William Sadler (“August Rush”, “Deaths in Contrary”, “Green Mile”) replaying the role of Death.
The film was originally scheduled to be released on August 21, but the date was pushed back to September 1.
The creators reportedly have no plans to re-reschedule the film's release date.
The picture will also be immediately available online.
We previously wrote that Keanu Reeves will be the scriptwriter of the comic book about the demigod Berserk.
I want you to think for a second that almost all our knowledge of the universe is derived from light.
We stand on Earth and with the naked eye see stars in the night sky.
Bright Sun can burn the retina of the eye,
but this same light we see in the reflection of the moon.
Since Galileo, who observed celestial bodies into his primitive telescope, we have been contemplating the universe thanks to light passing through the heedless ages of cosmic history.
With state-of-the-art telescopes, we were able to put together a stunning silent film about the universe, spanning our entire history right up to the Big Bang.
However, cinema is not without sound at all, because the universe is not voiceless.
I want to prove to you that the universe has its own sound track, and it is “played” by the cosmos itself, because outer space vibrates like a drum.
It features peculiar sounds that accompany the most vivid events as they occur.
Today, we would like to complement the luxurious visual image of the universe we have with a soundtrack.
So far, we've never heard sounds from space, but we should listen carefully to what's going on there any time soon.
So, in order to record the “song” of the universe, we focused on black holes as the most promising objects, because they “beat” in space-time as a bell, and give a characteristic sound. Now you'll hear what we think this song will sound like.
Maybe one day we'll see the shadow that the black hole casts away in a bright background, but we haven't seen such a thing yet.
However, the black hole, however invisible, can be heard as it “beats” in space-time as a drum.
The assumption that space is like a drum membrane belongs to Albert Einstein, to whom we owe so much.
Einstein concluded that if space were empty, if the universe were empty, it would look like in this pic, except, of course, for such a visual grid.
If we were to fall freely through space, even without a convenient coordinate grid, mentally we could image it ourselves, as we would notice that we were moving in a straight straight straight way through the universe.
Einstein also understood — and that's the very essence — that if you put energy or mass into the universe, it would cause space to warp, and a free-falling object would envelope, for example, the Sun, veering along natural curves in space.
It was Einstein's great general theory of relativity.
Even light curves along such a trajectory.
The deflection can be so severe that an object will simply get into orbit, and will orbit the Sun as Earth, or as the Moon — around Earth.
These are natural contortions in space.
And then Einstein didn't understand — if you take our Sun and compress it to 6 kilometers in diameter, a mass 1 million times heavier than Earth in an object 6 km in diameter, it would turn out to be a black hole, so dense that the light that passed too close to it will never break out. A dark shadow in the universe.
However, he always considered black holes to be merely a mathematical curiosities.
Einstein didn't believe they existed in reality.
He believed that nature should protect us itself from their appearance.
Decades passed before the term “black hole” was invented, and people realized that they were real astrophysical objects — in fact, they are very massive stars in a posthumous state, catastrophically destroyed at the end of their life cycle.
Our Sun will not turn into a black hole.
Its mass isn't enough for that.
But we'll do a little thought experiment — Enstein loved them very much — and imagine how the Sun shrinks to 6 kilometers in diameter, and around it the tiny Earth revolves around it, about 30 km away black hole of the sun.
This Earth is glowing, the Sun is no longer there, and there is no other light source, so we will make our little Earth self-luminous.
Turns out we can put Earth in a very close orbit, just 30km from that black hole.
It is not much larger than Manhattan in size.
Perhaps she would have hooked a little bit and Hudson before destroying Earth.
But the scale is roughly so.
We're talking about a facility that would occupy roughly 1/2 of Manhattan's area.
So, putting this Earth very close — just 30 km away — we'll notice that it orbits perfectly around a black hole.
It's kind of a myth that black holes absorb everything indiscriminately — you have to get very close to it.
But what's striking — from our perspective, we're going to see Earth all the time.
She can't hide behind a black hole.
Some of the light the Earth emits is absorbed by the hole, but part of it kind of envelops it and returns back to us.
So nothing can be hidden behind a black hole.
If you suddenly get into the Star Cruiser Galaxy series and fight Cylons, don't hide behind a black hole.
They'll see you!
Our Sun will not turn into a black hole — it's not massive enough for that. But there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
And if one of them had obscured the Milky Way, that's what it would look like.
We would see the shadow of a black hole amid hundreds of billions of stars and glowing dust.
If we were on the verge of falling into this black hole, we would have seen all that light enveloping it, and even already entering that shadow, would not notice a near disaster.
It would already be useless to start the engines and try to get out because nothing, including the light, can escape from it.
Although the black hole looks so on the outside, it is not dark inside, as all the light falls into it with us.
According to the relativistic effect known as time stretching, our clocks as if it would slow down its course relative to the galactic time, but we would, by contrast, see the evolution of the galaxy in accelerated by a blink to death inside the black hole.
It would be like a near-death experience where you see light at the end of the tunnel, but only not “about” but absolutely mortal.
(Laughter) And you won't tell anyone about the light at the end of the tunnel.
Scientists haven't been able to see the shadow of the black hole yet, but we can hear it, however unseen.
Let's imagine the real astrophysical situation — two black holes that have lived together a long life.
Perhaps they were stars first and then turned into black holes. Each is 10 times heavier than the Sun.
Squeeze them up to 60 km in diameter.
They can spin quickly: hundreds of revolutions per second.
At the end of their life cycle, they rotate around each other at virtually the speed of light.
They cover thousands of km in a fraction of a second, and not only curve space, but also leave behind them a trail: cause oscillations, a wave trail in space-time.
Space shrinks and stretches, liberating themselves from these black holes fluctuating in the universe.
And they travel through space at the speed of light.
This computer simulation is done by Goddard's team at NASA studying the theory of relativity.
For almost 30 years the world's scientists have been bashing over the problem
It was one of the groups.
You see two black holes spinning around each other — and again here clearly depicts curves.
If you see — a little pale turned out — they emit red waves, gravitational waves.
That is the sounds of vibrating space, and they will come from these black holes at the speed of light while they quieten and merge into one rotating, quiet black hole — that is the outcome.
If you stood close enough, your ear would resonate, as space squeezed and stretched.
You would actually hear the sound.
Sure, and your head would shrink and stretch, so you would have a hard time understanding what was going on.
But I'd like to play you that sound like we predict it.
It's my band's work, so the graphics here are more ambling.
Imagine a light black hole falling into a very heavy one.
The sound you hear produces a light hole, bending out space, coming step by step to the end.
If it is removed, the sound becomes quieter.
But it is like a hammer “bumping” into a space that vibrates like a membrane.
And we can predict what that sound will be.
We know that as the hole absorbs, it gets faster and louder.
At the end we'll hear the little hole just fall into the big one.
I haven't heard the record so loud yet — really, quite impressive.
It turns out much more modest at home.
Just quiet clicks.
It's a different sound made by my band.
I'm not showing you the picture here, as black holes leave no visual marks behind them, there are no visible curves in space.
If you went on a space cruise and heard that sound, I'd recommend flying off soon.
(Laughter) Away from that sound.
Both black holes move.
They approach each other.
In this case, they both fluctuate greatly.
And now there will be a merger.
This “dragonfly” is very characteristic of fusing black holes, this is the acceleration at the end.
We assume it would have sounded exactly like that.
Thankfully, we're a safe distance right now, in Long Beach in California.
Undoubtedly, somewhere in the universe, two black holes merge.
And without question, the space around us is vibrating, and these oscillations may have passed millions of light years, meaning a million years moved towards us at the speed of light.
But the sound is too quiet, we can't hear it.
There is a very complex project today: LIGO (Laser Interferometric Gravitational-Wave Observatory) — it tracks deviations in space fluctuations, the smallest ones by 4 kilometer.
This is an extremely ambitious experiment, and in the next few years it will be dedicated to capturing such waves.
One space program is also planned that will hopefully be launched in the next 10 years: LIKA (Laser Interferometric Space Antenna).
It will be able to see super-heavy black holes, millions and billions of times more massive than the Sun.
In this image from the Hubble telescope, we see two galaxies.
They look like they're dead in a kind of “hug,”
and each probably contains a super-heavy black hole in its core.
But they didn't go dead. In fact, they merge.
These two black holes collide, and will last this for more than a billion years.
It's beyond our perception — to hear a song of such duration.
But LIKA could see the finale of the fusion of two superheavy black holes that began a long time ago: the last 15 minutes of this action.
We're not just talking about black holes, but any serious overshits in the universe, and the most important one is the Big Bang.
When the expression came up, it was ironic — “Maul, who is going to believe in the Big Bang?”
This animation from my friend at Proton Studios shows the Big Bang from the outside.
Any observer would like to be inside this moment, because it is impossible to be outside the universe.
Imagine you're inside the Big Bang.
It's everywhere, around you, and the space vibrates chaotically.
It's been 14 billion years now and this song still sounds around us.
Galaxies are born and generations of stellar forms are born in them. And around one star, at least one, there is a habitable planet.
And here we persist in doing these experiments, making calculations, writing programs.
Imagine — a billion years ago, two black holes collided.
All the while, their song sounds in space.
We haven't even come to light yet.
The sound is coming, closer and closer — 40,000 years ago, we're still doing rock paintings.
If we were going to “hear” the Big Bang, it would have sounded like this.
The noise is in pure form.
It's white noise, just chaotic sounds.
But it probably surrounds us everywhere, unless it has been silenced by some other processes in the universe.
And if we catch it, it will be the most enjoyable music for us, because it is a quiet echo of the moment of our creation, the birth of the observable universe.
Over the next few years, we'll be able to add volume a little bit, and hear the universe in sound.
But if we catch an echo of those early events, it will bring us much closer to understanding the Big Bang, which will allow us to ask some of the most difficult, elusive questions.
Scrolling through a movie about our universe in front of us, we'll find out that there was a Big Bang in the past, and maybe we'll even hear its cacophony, but was this explosion the only one?
I mean — didn't it happen before that, too?
Will it not happen again?
In the spirit of TED, urging us to regain our faith in miracles, we can now ask questions that have always eluded us.
But we have to ask: is it possible that our universe is just a trace of some more meaningful history?
Or — aren't we just one of the branches of the multiverse — each of which has had its own Big Bang in the past? Maybe with black holes and their “songs,” or without them, can with intelligent life, and possibly without — they're not in our past, not in our future, but somehow connected to us?
We'll ask — in such a multiverse, in its other offshoots, is there life there?
Here are my fellow multiverse.
But are there other creatures out there that think about us, and their origins?
And, if they are, I can imagine them leading calculations, like us, building instruments, trying to detect that faint sound of their creation moment, and thinking — who else is there but us?
Thank you. Thank you.

Minneapolis residents create squads to patrol streets
The Wall Street Journal reports: Squads are being set up in Minneapolis to patrol the streets.
Locals want to help the guards of order.
Some of the friends have weapons with them.
Armed citizens are assured that no fire will be opened, it is possible only if necessary.
According to journalists, the creation of patrols is linked to cuts to the police budget.
Law enforcement agencies will receive $10 million less per year (this amount may be reduced).
The former law enforcement budget - $193 million
The Minneapolis City Council made such a decision in connection with the death of George Floyd and rallies against police arbitrariness for the past two months.

City and Real will be able to host Champions League 1/8 final return leg in Manchester
Britain's The Guardian reports that Manchester City and Real Madrid will still be able to play the return leg of the Champions League 1/8 final in Manchester at the Etihad Stadium on August 7.
Yesterday, on 25 July, the UK Government issued a ruling that all people arriving in the UK from Spain are required to undergo a 14-day quarantine due to the new outbreak coronavirus pandemic.
For Real Madrid, though, there will be an exception.
The possibility of relaxing quarantine standards for sports teams and film crews was previously announced by UK Ministry of Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden.
Real Madrid lost 1-2 to Manchester City on their pitch in February.
The return leg is scheduled for August 7.
Russian, Ukrainian Presidents Discuss Implementation of Truce in Donbass
Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky discussed the implementation of the Donbass truce agreements reached during the Normandy summit in December 2019. the Kremlin press office and the office of the President of Ukraine.
The phone conversation between Vladimir Putin and Vladimir Zelensky took place at the initiative of the Ukrainian side, according to the Kremlin press service.
The interlocutors welcomed the agreement on 22 July at the meeting of the Minsk Contact Group on a full and comprehensive ceasefire in the Donbass region starting from 00:01 on 27 July 2020; The Russian president supported the arrangement.
The leaders agreed on the urgent need to implement additional measures to support the ceasefire in Donbass.
At the same time, Putin criticized the decision adopted by the Verkhovna Rada on July 15 to organize local elections in the autumn, which the Russian side believes ignores the Minsk agreement.
The situation regarding the coronavirus pandemic was also discussed.
The 22 July agreement calls for a complete waiver of any military action, including reconnaissance, sending sabotage reconnaissance teams and sniper warfare.
Tinkov shown video footage of bone marrow transplant
Oleg Tinkoff, a Russian entrepreneur, founder of the group Tinkoff, released a video showing how he was transplanted with bone marrow.
Recall, a businessman is fighting leukemia.
On the record, the businessman lies in a ward, bone marrow transplanted using a drip.
Tinkov noted that in the same way, the collection of donor material happens.
“The skull is not cut,” he added.
Judging by his pose during surgery, he feels comfortable and relaxed.
His donor was a girl from Germany.
The businessman regretted that there are only 130,000 bone marrow donors in Russia, while Germany has about 8 million.
Oleg Tinkou's bone marrow transplant was carried out at a London clinic.
Destroying Russian Pantsirei in Ethiopia
Two Russian-made Pantsir-S1 anti-aircraft missile and gun complexes in service with the Ethiopian Army were destroyed.
This was made aware of the Telegram channel “Military Observer” on Sunday, 26 July.
According to the canal, two vehicles that secured the Hidase Hydroelectric Power Plant on the Blue Nile River were taken out of service by lightning.
No other details of the incident were given.
In May, Turkey's Anadolu Agency reported the destruction in Libya of nine Russian-made Pantsir-C1s ZPKK.
They belonged to the forces of the commander of the Libyan National Army (LNA), Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, and were destroyed by Turkish Operational Tactical Multi-Purpose Unmanned Aerial Bayraktar TB2 complexes.
Defense Express then called what happened a “real genocide.”
Another Panciry-C1" in Libya was destroyed by a strike drone in early July.
1.5 thousand people evacuated in Warsaw due to bomb

Putin spoke to Shoigu in the cabin:
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke with Defense Ministry chief Sergei Shoigu and Navy chief Nikolai Evmenov.
Relevant footage on Sunday, July 26, was published by journalists of the RIA Novosti Kremlin pool in its Telegram channel.
The brief meeting took place in the cabin of the boat in which the head of state, along with Shoigu and Evmenov, headed to the parade of ships in the Gulf of Finland before a parade to coincide with Russian Navy Day.
They exchanged a couple of phrases while sitting at a table.
Earlier it was reported that Putin had arrived in Kronstadt to attend the ceremonial events.
From there, the president headed to St. Petersburg, where he is due to host a holiday parade.
On July 26, parades are held across Russia to mark Navy Day celebrations.
The main naval parade takes place in St. Petersburg.
It employs more than 4,000 troops, 46 ships, submarines and boats, and naval aviation.
One of the Tyumen Public Public was called to take part in the “Buy from Grandma” action.
Organizers are calling for granny to buy vegetables, flowers and berries they have grown on their vegetable gardens and not to bargain.
The author of the post even gave an example by giving the specific address at which Grandma trades cherries.
But the Tyumens suddenly erupted with angry comments.
She saw this grandmother immediately approaching a merchant from near abroad and giving a new portion of goods “from Grandma's vegetable garden” for sale.
Watch closely what you buy!!! - Nadiya Grigorieva shared her observations.
I saw more than once when greens were taken from traders from near abroad and sold.
There is no trust,” Larisa Harlamova agreed.
A long time ago, look, Granny's viktoria has a “glitter” and we haven't been in the vegetable garden, I ask, “Is that from your vegetable garden?”
“- Yes!”
I bought a taste of rag, well not a fresh vegetable garden, then I watch these “yes” on every corner, cheated me by my grandmother, took me to implement it, - Tatiana Krasilnikova said about her experience.
At the same time, users emphasize that they are not encouraged not to shop with grandmothers, but only share their opinions and advise paying attention to the quality of the products.

decision to expand the RPL would not have been supported by either UEFA or FIFA
Alexander Dyukov, president of the Russian Football Union (RFU), believes it is wrong to expand the Russian Premier League (RPL) to 18 teams at the moment.
“First, it was the decision of the RPL, but I will agree to them as it is wrong to change the rules once the tournament is complete.
It violates the integrity of the tournament and the sporting principle.
And certainly this decision would not have been supported by either UEFA or FIFA,” Dukov said after the Russian Cup final Zenit vs. Khimki (1-0).
There are currently 16 clubs competing in the RPL, but an option was considered with an increase in the number of teams to 18.
More than a hundred Russians returned from Yerevan to their home country on departure flights
More than a hundred Russians who were unable to leave Armenia amid the spread of the coronavirus returned to their home country on departure flights.
This was reported by the press service of the Russian Embassy in Yerevan on Sunday, July 26.
“We are pleased to announce that 106 Russians were able to return home on July 26 on Yerevan — Rostov-on-Don flights,” TASS quoted as saying.
The embassy noted that the process of check-in and boarding passengers on the flight was coordinated by diplomats.
In total, 2,822 Russian citizens have been removed from Armenia since the flight restrictions were imposed.
On July 24, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin announced the opening of flights with several countries on August 1.
Kirilenko shares memories of playing with Bryant and Jordan in NBA
Andrei Kirilenko, head of the Russian Basketball Federation (RFB), shared memories of his games against legendary Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan in National Basketball Association (NBA) games.
I knew Bryant's smugness couldn't be caught up with any thrash current to discourage his athletic rant.
Kobe had a killer instinct, so on court I tried to talk him in a way that he didn't take the game in an aggressive way.
On set, I gave him compliments: “Oh!
Kobe, well scored, great pass!
Listening to my enthusiastic responses, he was a little oblivious to the fact that he had to take his hands on the ball again and score 3 - 4 more points.
We communicated well with Kobi,” Kirilenko quoted Vespers Moskva as saying.
He also talked about his first game against Jordan.
“I took care of him.
For the first three minutes of the match I was running in full admiration from being next to me a legend seen only on TV.
While I got joyfully in the gob-breathing, Michael scored a lot of points.
I soon moved away from raptures, covered his throws a couple of times...
In that game, my team won and Jordan still scored 44 points,” the RFB chief added.
In the NBA, Kirilenko spent 12 seasons.
He was selected by the Utah Jazz at the 1999 draft as overall 24th.
In addition to Utah, for which he spent ten seasons, the Russian forward played for the Minnesota Timberwolves and Brooklyn Nets.
His total of 797 games in which he averaged 11.8 points, performed 5.5 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 1.8 block shots.
Earlier it was reported that Kirilenko would nominate for the election of the head of the RFB.
Degtyarev surprised at information about Sakhalin-1 gas purchase for dollars
Acting Governor of Khabarovsk Krai, Mikhail Degtyarev, on Sunday, July 26, marveled at the fact that the region was purchasing Sakhalin gas, mined by American company Exxon Neftegas, for dollars.
American gas is finished in dollars until 2025.
'Honestly, I didn't know that and I'm in such a knockdown because of this information.
I didn't even have any idea that this could be possible in 2020 in Russia,” RIA Novosti quoted him as saying.
Degtyarev said the issue was discussed with Russian Energy Ministry chief Alexander Novak during his visit to Khabarovsk on July 24.
The Governor also stressed that Gazprom is moving to supply Russian CHP and capacity by 2025, which means that Russian gas purchased in rubles will be used “according to normal prices.”
The Sakhalin-1 project is implemented through a product sharing agreement, where the project operator with 30% share is Exxon Neftegas Ltd, another 20% by Rosneft, Japan's Sodeco 30% and India's ONGC ~ 20%.
Khabarovsk Krai has been acquiring gas from this project since 2005.

Russian TV series actor responds to accusations of 'promoting LGBT and feminism'
The actor of the Russian TV series “Chiki,” whose creators have been accused of “promoting LGBT and feminism,” responded to claims about the film.
The authors “understood the poignancy of the topics raised and did not want to offend anyone,” American Stephen Thomas Oxner said in a conversation with Rise.
“It seems to me that this is a story about the power and the general aspects of human life.
It has nothing to do with LGBT and feminism,” said the actor, who played the father of a boy who changed into women's clothing.
He stressed that he was “proud of the work” and did not consider it propaganda.
At the same time, the American added, he was frightening by some people's reaction to the series' storyline: for example, there was a case where “a man in deep constipation shot the set and said it was all not true.”
'Then a couple of occasions were when we met disgruntled local people who didn't understand what we were doing.
But we were open, so the people who first came in with claims were starting to help us,” he summed up.
The case of the shooting, the publication explains, took place in September 2019 in Kabardino-Balkaria: a drunk man attacked a camera crew's car with a weapon, and then he was detained by police officers.
Earlier, it was reported that Olga Baranets, the public commissioner for family protection, sent a complaint to the Interior Ministry and Roskomnadzor against more.tv, which hosted the Russian TV series “Chiki”.
Baranec accused the series' creators of “promoting unconventional sexual relationships and feminism”, drawing attention to the fact that the film's main characters are working as prostitutes and the series itself contains “scenes physical and psychological violence.”
The Ombudsman also outraged that “there is a lot of emphasis on homosexual sexual orientation” of a minor character in the series.
The comedy-drama “Chiki” is about three prostitutes who started a new life and set up a business on the advice of a friend.
