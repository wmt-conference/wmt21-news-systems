Xinhua Review: Turning Outstanding Returning Migrant Workers into a New Force for Rural Revitalization
Talent is the key to rural revitalization.
Where to find talent?
The outstanding group of returning migrant workers is an indispensable fresh force.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 26, Telegram Question: Turning Outstanding Returning Migrant Workers into a New Force for Rural Revitalization
The 34-year-old Zhang Xiong, whose family lives in Orchard Village in Meishan City, Sichuan, quit his job in Beijing with a monthly salary of tens of thousands of dollars to start a business in 2010.
After several years of struggle, now the grape-growing family farm he runs has an annual income of more than a million yuan, has become a well-known leader of wealth, and has also been selected into the team of the village "two committees".
In recent years, inspired by a series of policies to support and benefit farmers, such as the national fight against poverty and rural revitalization, more and more outstanding migrant workers like Zhang Xiong have chosen to return home to start their own businesses, activating a pool of spring water in rural areas.
Sichuan, a province with a large population and a large labour export province in western China, has led the implementation of the "Return and Training Project for Outstanding Migrant Workers" due to favourable circumstances. In 2019 alone, more than 8,000 village party branch secretaries were produced from among the outstanding migrant workers returned, 61,000 village reserves were trained and more than 20,000 party members were developed, providing a strong guarantee for winning the battle against poverty and implementing the strategy of rural revitalization.
Well-off is not well-off, the key is to look at the villagers.
Since the reform and opening up, a large number of young and middle-aged workers in rural China have gone out to work to increase their income, and some have set up their own enterprises through hard work.
However, objectively, it has also led to the emergence of "hollowing out" in rural areas to different degrees, especially the weakening of rural grass-roots organizations, and the ranks of village Party branch secretaries and Party members show the characteristics of "one old and one low", that is, old age, low education, weak ranks of leaders of village Party organizations, and the lack of access to young and yellow.
If rural talents and other factors have been flowing one way to the city, the countryside has long been in the state of "blood loss" and "anemia", revitalization is an empty word.
Attracting rural migrant workers who are capable, conscious and interested in serving their hometown back, guiding them to return home and start their own businesses to become rich leaders, choosing their best to train them into Party members and rural cadres, and enriching the ranks of cadres at the grass-roots level, is the solution to the root cause of the problem of the lack of youth and yellow among rural Party members and grass-roots Party organizations.
Excellent migrant workers can be brought back, but also let them stay and do a good job.
In recent years, Sichuan has started by paying close attention to the Party construction of rural migrant workers and, on the basis of strict candidate standards, has established institutional mechanisms such as targeted return, service guarantee, training and ability enhancement, selection and use of outstanding rural migrant workers, so that they can improve their abilities, secure their jobs and have expectations in their lives, truly take root in rural areas and have a sense of accomplishment in their entrepreneurship.
This year is the closing year of the decisive battle against poverty. Talents are the key factor in the connection between poverty eradication and rural revitalization.
Party committees and governments at all levels should attach great importance to this group of outstanding returning migrant workers, and adopt comprehensive measures to turn them into a task force and fresh force that can stay, fight and not take away, so as to provide strong organizational security and talent support for rural areas to lift themselves out of poverty and strive for a well-off, development and revitalization.
Because of the epidemic, this year's college graduates are a very special class. On the evening of July 11, the bilibili summer graduation song will bring a special live online performance for the graduates. Old Wolf, Park Shu, Li Yuchun, Mao Yi and other musicians sent songs and blessings to the fresh graduates.
The well-known up master SealWu Yifan Wu also brought with him a song called "Wild Grass," a rap song based on Lu Xun's poems of the same name, which is very popular among young people.
Due to the epidemic, many graduates did not experience the ritual sense of dialing ears and awarding degrees, so they transferred the sense of ritual to the line.
Data show that the 2.5-hour-long song concert peaked at more than 35 million viewers.
"Follow your heart, seize the opportunity, regardless of the consequences, and sometimes there will be unexpected gains."
Although it is a graduation song, many songs also moved non-fresh graduates.
"Look at the whole scene really want to cry, whose youth is full of beauty and regret, but all worth remembering, all have to go on bravely."
The sustainable improvement of Beijing's natural ecology attracts more than 500 species of wildlife to "settle" in the city.

The capital's natural ecology continues to improve to attract wildlife to "settle" in the city
There are more than 500 species of wildlife in Beijing
The reporter of this newspaper (reporter Wang Bin) Beijing Youth Daily learned from the Municipal Bureau of Landscape and Greening that with the continuous improvement of the natural ecological environment in the capital in recent years, the species and number of wildlife have also continued to increase.
At present, the number of terrestrial spinal wildlife living in Beijing has increased to more than 500 species, including state-level protected animals such as brown horse chicken and black stork, as well as state-level protected animals such as gazelle, swan, gray crane and mandarin duck.
Whether the urban forests planted everywhere in the Second Ring, or the small wetlands embedded in the buildings, not only bring natural wild interest to the citizens of the capital, but also attract wildlife to "settle" in the city.
In the middle of summer, the Songshan National Nature Reserve, located in the Yanshan Mountains in the northwest of Yanqing District, is vibrant.
A raccoon was playing leisurely by a mountain stream, while two badgers played with each other.
Looking back, a wild boar couldn't resist the "sting" on his body and was rubbing hard against the bark of the bark.Hu Qiaoli, director of the Songshan National Nature Reserve Administration, said that by the end of 2019, 178 species of wild animals, including gold eagles protected by the national level and chickens and wildebeest protected by the national level, lived in the Green Sea, which covers a total area of more than 6,200 hectares. Nearly a third of the wildlife species in the city could be found here.
"In Songshan, wild animals are the real 'owners', and our staff can only be the 'bodyguards' of people at best."
Hu said that in order to understand the situation of wildlife in the protected area on the ground, more than 30 professional rangers patrol along 16 carefully formulated protection routes every day, and there is a "big circle" once a month, which takes a whole day to travel almost all over the protected area.
"When patrolling, we should not only check and record biodiversity, but also check the installation of artificial bird nests, rescue injured wildlife, install field infrared cameras, and so on."
More than 200 infrared cameras have been installed in Songshan National Nature Reserve to record the living conditions of wildlife in the forest.
Hu Qiaoli said that with the continuous enrichment of biodiversity in the protected areas in recent years, more and more wild animals appear in the camera, leopard cats, raccoons and pig badgers have become "permanent guests", and the "appearance rate" of gazelle, an animal protected by the state at the second level, has become higher and higher.
Zhang Zhiming, Director of the Wildlife and Wetland Protection Division of the Beijing Landscape and Greening Bureau, said that the number of species of terrestrial spinal wildlife in Beijing has increased from 461 in 1994 to more than 500 now. The species and number of wildlife in Beijing have continued to increase in recent years.
The figure of wild animals in cities is becoming more and more common, which is closely related to the upgrading of urban greening in the capital in recent years.
In particular, the new round of million-mu afforestation and greening construction, which began in 2018, proposes to reshape the urban ecological environment, enhance the ecological function of woodland green areas, and highlight the concept of "near-nature".
The plan strives to achieve interconnection and interaction with the surrounding green areas to facilitate wildlife to "visit relatives and friends", and the trees planted are also the favorite source of honey and food plants for animals.
I am committed to helping computers communicate with the world around us.
There are many ways to do this, and I like to focus on helping computers talk about what they see and understand.
Given this scenario, a modern computer vision algorithm can tell you that there is a woman and a dog.
It can tell you that the woman is smiling.
It can even tell you that the dog is very cute.
I deal with this issue and think about how humanity understands and lives with the world.
Those thoughts, memories, and stories may arouse human attention in such a scene.
Interconnection of all relevant situations.
Maybe you've seen such a dog before, or you've spent time running on such a beach and further evoking memories and thoughts of past holidays, the time you spent running around with other dogs when you went to the beach.
One of my guiding principles is that by helping computers understand what this experience is, and thus what we believe and feel in common, we have the ability to start constantly developing computer technology in a way that complements our experience.
So, digging deep into this, I began working a few years ago to help computers produce human-like stories from image sequences.
So one day, while I was working on my computer, I asked it what it thought of the trip to Australia.
He looked at the picture and saw a koala.
It doesn't know what a koala is, but the computer says it thinks it looks like an interesting creature.
Then I shared a series of images of burning houses with the computer.
The computer looked at the picture and said, "This is an amazing view! This is spectacular!"
It chills my spine.
Computers see a terrible, life-changing and life-destroying event and think it's a positive thing.
I realized that the computer recognized the contrast between red and yellow and thought it was a positive thing.
Part of the reason is that most of the images I enter into the computer are positive.
That's because people tend to share positive images when talking about their experiences.
When was the last time you saw a selfie at a funeral?
I realized that in the process of improving artificial intelligence, the task belongs to the task and the data set belongs to the data set, creating huge gaps, defects and blind spots in the computer's understanding.
In doing so, I am coding biases.
Biases reflect limited views and stem from a data set that reflects the same human characteristics, such as stereotypes and stereotypes.
I recall the development of technology that brought me to the situation I was in that day - the first color image was calibrated to the skin color of a white woman, which meant that color photography was biased against black faces.
And the same bias, that blind spot continued into the 1990s.
Even today, the same blind spot exists in how to recognize the faces of different people in the application of facial recognition technology.
In today's research, I think of the most advanced technologies, which tend to limit our ideas to one data set and one problem.
And in doing so, we are creating more blind spots and biases that will be further amplified when using artificial intelligence.
At that time, I realized that we had to reflect on how the technology we invented today would be seen in five to ten years.
In the interaction between humans and the environment, humans take time to correct problems, so evolution is slow.
Artificial intelligence, by contrast, is developing at an incredible rate.
This means that it is really important, and we need to think carefully about this now - to reflect on our blind spots and biases, to consider how these biases affect the technologies we create now, and to discuss what today's technology means for the future.
CEOs and scientists have weighed their ideas about the future development of artificial intelligence.
"Artificial intelligence will destroy humanity," Stephen Hawking warned.
Elon Musk has warned that this is an existential risk and one of the greatest risks we face as a civilized society.
"I don't understand why people aren't more worried about AI," Bill Gates said.
But these views - are only part of the story.
Then mathematics, models, these basic components of artificial intelligence, are what we can all access and use.
We have source code tools open to the public to learn machines and make our own contributions at the same time.
In addition, we can also share our experience.
We can share the technology and how it relates to us, and what makes us happy.
We can discuss what we love.
We can communicate with the foreseeable future, about the technical aspects, which may be more useful, or over time, more problems may arise.
If we all focus on opening up the discussion of AI and looking to the future, this will help to create a regular dialogue and awareness of what AI is, what it can be, and everything we need to do to achieve the results that best suit us.
We have seen and understood this in the technologies used today.
We use smartphones, digital assistants and automatic vacuum cleaners.
Are they evil?
Maybe sometimes.
Are they useful?
Yes, so are they.
They are not identical.
There you have seen the light of the future.
The future will continue to start with what we build and create now.
We started the domino effect, which opened the evolutionary pathway for AI
In our time, it has shaped the artificial intelligence of tomorrow.
Let us immerse ourselves in augmented reality technology and revive the world of the past,
When people have difficulty communicating, technology helps them share their experiences.
Technology based on online visual media can be used in self-driving cars.
Technology, which produces language based on the understanding of images, can evolve into technology to help visually impaired people better own the visual world.
We also see how technology causes problems.
Today we have the technology to analyze the physical characteristics of our birth - such as the color of our skin or the expressions on our faces - to determine whether we are criminals or terrorists.
We have the technology to process data, to process data on gender or ethnicity to determine whether we can get loans.
Everything we see now is just a snapshot of the evolution of artificial intelligence.
Because where we are now is a moment of evolution.
This means that what we do now will affect the future development of things and extend to the future world.
If we want AI to help human ways evolve, we need to identify strategies and goals to open that path right away.
What I want to see is the development direction of culture and environment suitable for human beings.
Technology can help us cure patients with neurological diseases or other disabilities, making them as challenging as everyone else.
Technology works without regard to your features or skin color.
My focus today is on the technology of tomorrow and ten years from now,
Artificial intelligence can occur in many different ways.
But in this case, it is not a driverless vehicle without any destination.
This is a car we can drive and control at the same time.
We choose when to accelerate and when to slow down.
We choose whether we need to turn.
We choose what the AI of the future will be.
There will be a vast arena. Allow artificial intelligence to be everything.
It will turn into a lot of different things.
It is now up to us to figure out what needs to be implemented to ensure that the results of AI are better for all humans.
Thank you. Thank you.

Black land "planted" for agricultural modernization
Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 26, telegram question: Black land "planted" out of agricultural modernization
In the middle of summer, two spraying planes passed the 10,000-acre high-yield demonstration field in the second operation station of the fifth management area of Friendship Farm, forming two white lines. The words "the first field in the world" planted with black rice seedlings in the green fields were particularly striking.
Kong Lingqiang, the station director of the operation station, said the aircraft could spray more than 6,000 acres of arable land in a day, with an efficiency of about eight times that of a drone and hundreds of times that of man.
This farm is located in the territory of Friendship County of Heilongjiang Province, China's largest grain-producing province. From the sound of "rice cutting" in the past to the sound of "rumbling" today, Chinese traditional farming and farming have transformed in this black soil belt.
In addition to aircraft, satellites are also used in the modern agricultural production of Friendship Farm.
Kong Lingqiang introduced that, on the one hand, they use satellite remote sensing technology to realize accurate fertilization, reduce agricultural input and reduce pollution. On the other hand, satellite navigation technology can improve the standardized operation level of agricultural machinery in the field.
In the course of rice production this year, the farm expanded the operational area of satellite navigation unmanned seedling transplanting technology from 3,000 mu last year to 30,000 mu.
This technology makes the planting of seedlings more uniform, can maximize the utilization of sunlight and cultivated land resources, and can save 16 yuan per acre of labor cost.
Farms have tried new technologies such as informationization and intelligence in agricultural production, forming the largest group of agricultural machinery in China from the ground to the sky.
According to statistics, there are currently a total of 49,000 farm machinery units (pieces), and the comprehensive mechanization rate in the field has reached 99.8%.
The operation of agricultural machinery has achieved 100% GPS satellite navigation, 100% precision seeding in drylands and 100% high-power locomotive operation in drylands.
"Green agriculture, intelligent agriculture and digital agriculture are the direction of agricultural modernization."
Liu Hualien, director of Friendship Farm, said.
The key to agricultural modernization is scientific and technological progress.
Agricultural reclamation in Heilongjiang, represented by farms, has played a demonstration and leading role in the "aircraft carrier" of modern agriculture in recent years, and has initially established a modern agricultural industry system led by large-scale cultivation, standardized production and industrial management.
In the suburb of Friendship County, there is an agricultural machinery extensive reading garden with an area of 350,000 square meters.
There is a concentrated display of more than 140 (pieces) agricultural machinery tools introduced and used in Heilongjiang agricultural reclamation over the years.
These agricultural machinery and farm have witnessed the development of China's agricultural modernization.
Xie Xiao Family for Everyone --Anhui Hefei Jiang Kou River Union Direct Attack on Mass Transfer - Xinhua Net
Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, July 26, Telegram Question: Xie Xiao Family for Everyone - Anhui Hefei Jiang Kou River Union Direct Attack on Mass Transfer
Xinhua News Agency reporters Chen Shangying, Wang Liwu, Liu Xia Village
At more than 4 p.m. on July 25, Fu Kunbao, wearing mud-covered rubber shoes, went from the front room to the back room, and his wife Zhou Yan was busy packing things back and forth.
"I received a phone call from village cadres to allow the transfer, and I was still mowing grass in the field."
Fu Kunbao said that he moved more than 60 acres of land and planted rice, which is now growing well. "I also took medicine yesterday, and the tools and everything have not been packed up yet."
Fu Kunbao pointed to the pesticide sprayer placed in the corner. "No one wants their home to be flooded, give up a small home for everyone."
In order to cope with the continued high water level pressure of Chaohu Lake and possible heavy rainfall, Hefei City, Anhui Province, is ready to use the Jiangkou River Union, where Fu Kunbao's family is located, to divert flood water on the 26th.
Jiang Kou Lianhe is located in Feixi County, next to Chaohu Causeway.
There are thousands of villagers involved in Yandian Township and Sanhe Town that need to be relocated.
As of 16: 00 on May 25, the water level of Chaohu, the fifth largest freshwater lake in China, remained at a high of 13.2 meters, exceeding the guaranteed water level by 0.7 meters.
Fu Kun Bao's kitchen was clean and tidy, with a pot of pumpkin head dishes on the table, eggs and some brine in the fridge.
"I didn't expect to move, the water of Jiangkou River looks good at present."
Zhou Yan said that the home is a bungalow, and some large items have not thought about where to put for the time being.
"Pack up the expensive items first. Large items such as refrigerators and TV sets can be temporarily placed in the homes of high-lying neighbors or relatives."
Village cadre Wang Lijing gave Fu Kun Bao advice.
Wang Lijing was responsible for the transfer and resettlement of 13 villagers, notifying each household and confirming each person's resettlement plan.
The nearest settlement to Fu Kun Bao's home is Su Xiaoxue, Yan Dian Township, about 2 kilometers away.
In addition to large pieces, Fu Kunbao and his family have a headache of more than 1000 jin of grain and some newly bought furniture.
"The grain is ready to be dragged to relatives' homes, the furniture can not be moved."
After a discussion, the couple put a stool under the newly bought bed and raised the bed by about half a meter.
At 6 p.m., Fu Kunbao began to use a tricycle to transport things to relatives' homes, and Zhou Yan continued to clean up at home.
At more than 11: 00 p.m., the couple looked in front of and behind the home, pulled on the electric switch, ready to go to the placement site.
"I hope the water will recede early."
Fu Kunbao said.
At 9: 30 a.m. on July 26, the reporter saw that the local area had made all preparations before the flood diversion.
Zhang Jicolin small house team up strong muscular youth - Xinhua Net
The sports youth competitive show "Sports Bar Youth" officially landed on Hunan TV on July 11.
Sports team leader Zhang Jike and sports assistant Lin Xiaoyu shared the stage, Lindane and Fu Yuanhui commented on their respective styles, and the hard core of the "giant" power pull-out rod device made the program "burning".
In the first episode, 11 sports teenagers appeared on the power circuit, the shape of which surprised the live audience, while the "strong conflict", "strong confrontation" and "strong heart" on the competition stage were also paid attention to.
Among them, the "strong conflict" came from super-A sports student Qiao Wenyi, who openly provoked Xu Zhibin, known as the "flower-beautiful man" on the same track before the race, choked Xu Zhibin's appearance condition should sing the dance program, and even let out the cruel words "don't spend the make-up crying if you lose".
A remark made the teenagers on the field and the sports leaders take a breath of breath.
And the "strong confrontation" is more like an immortal fight, Sun Jian Qi, known as the "Great Demon King", met the same strong Zhang Xindong and staged a strong confrontation.
And their identity is also unexpected. Sun Jian Qi is a fitness-loving actor, and Zhang Xindong is a retired special combat player and three-time Warrior Medal winner.
At the beginning of the game, the two teenagers worked hard to pull out the small pole quickly, and the lasting confrontation on the pole made the live audience sweat for them.
In the tense competition situation, Zhang Jike, as one of the sports leaders of "Sports Bar Youth", is also carefully watching the battle.
In the comment section, he is also very careful to the losing side of the game to patiently encourage the youth to help every mistake point in the recovery process.
And sports assistant Lin Xiaojiu is a fancy assist, she makes no secret of her appreciation for the face value strength online of the teenagers.
When learning about the overloaded daily training of sports teenagers, they are even more admired.
Lindane and Fu Yuanhui, who are also sports leaders, have their own styles, one is an idle "prophet" and the other is a "flood girl" who uses a smile to disperse the tension.
In addition, Jike Yinyi and Liu Ye, as sports assistants, also created a lot of laughing topics around sports teenagers.
Church Fire in Nantes, France: Parish Volunteers Admit to Arson
China News Network, July 26: On July 18, the famous St. Peter and St. Paul Cathedral, a treasure of religious and historical architecture in Nantes, France, was severely damaged in a fire and the cathedral organ was completely destroyed, foreign media reported.
On the 26th local time, the Nantes prosecutor announced that a parish volunteer responsible for guarding the cathedral had been charged with "arson and destruction".
He has admitted that he lit the fire in the church.
Local prosecutor Senas said the 39-year-old diocesan volunteer from Rwanda admitted to setting fires in three places in the middle of the cathedral at night.
The man's lawyer said the arsonist now regretted doing so.
This person entered France through the way of asylum a few years ago, was sheltered in the parish where the fire occurred, and was taken in in the church.
The prosecution pointed out that he had recently tried to renew his visa and was talking to the police about it.
But the church said it still could not believe that the normally very kind, smiling but not very talkative believer would destroy the church he loved so much.
On the day of the fire on July 18, the volunteer had already been questioned by the police for illogical problems in his account, but he was later released.
The picture shows firefighters rescuing at the scene.
On the evening of the 25th, he was summoned again as professional engineers at the laboratory of the Paris Central Police obtained new evidence.
This time, the man admitted to the arson.
It was reported that if convicted of arson and vandalism, the suspects could face 10 years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros.
The report said the fire caused serious damage to the Cathedral of St. Pierre and St. Paul, where the organ was completely destroyed and the stained glass windows behind the organ were severely damaged.
According to Brunet, the chief architect of French historic preservation, it is conservatively estimated that the restoration of Nantes Cathedral will take at least three years.
Comprehensive news: US unilateralism undermines bilateral relations International public opinion supports China's countermeasures against the US - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26: On the morning of July 24, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the US Embassy in China that China had decided to revoke the license for the establishment and operation of the US Consulate General in Chengdu, and made specific requests for the Consulate General to cease all operations and activities.
International public opinion believes that the unilateral measures taken by the United States have caused serious distress to China-US relations. It is legitimate and necessary for China to respond to the unreasonable provocations of the United States and take countermeasures.
Andrés Bolquez, Director of the Center for China Studies at the Institute of International Studies of the University of Chile, said that the unilateral measures of the United States have destroyed the bridge of understanding between the Chinese and American peoples and put the relations between the two major countries in crisis.
China's notification to the United States to close its Consulate General in Chengdu is a countermeasure to the unilateral measures of the United States and is in line with diplomatic practice.
Patricio Justo, a professor at the Argentine Catholic University and director of the Center for Arab-China Studies, believes that the above-mentioned decision by China is a legitimate and necessary countermeasure to the previous provocations by the United States, not against the ordinary American people.
The United States is trying to divert the attention of the American public by pressuring China to cover up its inadequate response to the new epidemic.
Bambang Suryono, chairman of the Asian Innovation Research Center, an Indonesian think tank, said the provocative diplomatic posture adopted by the United States has caused serious distress to China-US relations and bilateral relations are facing serious challenges.
China's notification to the United States of the closure of its Consulate General in Chengdu is a normal countermeasure and is in line with diplomatic practice. It reflects both China's principled position of firmly safeguarding its own interests and the rational and beneficial nature of China's diplomacy.
Tanzanian commentator Francis Semwinza said that China's decision is a legitimate and necessary response to the US provocation.
For China-US relations to return to normal, the US should take the initiative to improve its relations with China and stop interfering in China's internal affairs.
The United States should focus on how to achieve win-win results with China economically and politically, and how to benefit the two peoples and even the international community as a whole.
Ali Youssef, executive director of the Sudan-based Federation of Arab-Chinese Friendship Associations, said that the countermeasures China was forced to take were a legitimate and necessary response to the unjustified actions of the United States and were in line with international law and the basic norms governing international relations, as well as with diplomatic practices.
Earlier, the United States called for the closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, a serious violation of international law and the basic norms governing international relations.
We hope that the US will rescind its previous relevant decisions and create the necessary conditions for bilateral relations to return to normalcy.
Singapore's Lianhe Zaobao published an editorial saying that the larger strategic intention of the United States is to encircle China and prevent its continued rise.
In the face of the pressing steps of the United States, although China is very reluctant to see China-US relations continue to deteriorate, it has to take countermeasures.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 26 (reporter Mao Xin) learned from the Guangdong Maritime Police Bureau that recently, the Bureau, in conjunction with the customs and public security departments of Guangzhou, broke down a large smuggling gang of refined oil products, and preliminarily verified that the gang had smuggled about 120,000 tons of refined oil products since 2019, with a case value of about 800 million yuan and tax evasion of about 240 million yuan.
The Guangdong Maritime Police Bureau and the anti-smuggling department of the Customs have gradually mapped out the division of personnel and organizational structure of the group.
On July 8, the maritime police, customs and public security departments carried out unified net collection operations in Guangzhou, Foshan and other places, as well as in the sea area of the Pearl River Estuary, respectively, seizing four suspected smuggling vessels on the spot, seizing a total of 4,700 tons of refined oil products from the vessels involved and the oil depots, and freezing a number of fund accounts.
It is understood that a total of eight ships and two helicopters were deployed in the joint operation, which was divided into multiple operational groups to work together to carry out a full-chain crackdown on links such as maritime smuggling and illegal operations on land, and all 35 major criminal suspects arrived at the case.
The case is currently under further investigation.
The relevant person in charge of the Guangdong Maritime Police Bureau said that it would continue to maintain a high-pressure situation in the future, crack down on all kinds of illegal and criminal smuggling activities at sea and maintain good order in the maritime areas under its jurisdiction.
Hurricane Hanna makes landfall in Texas or causes river surges and flash floods
At 5: 00 p.m. local time on July 25, Hurricane "Hanna" made landfall in the U.S. state of Texas, which will bring strong winds, torrential rain, swollen rivers and possibly life-threatening flash floods, according to a comprehensive foreign media report.
The National Hurricane Center says Hurricane Hanna is expected to bring heavy rainfall across parts of southern and northeastern Texas, causing swollen streams and life-threatening flash flooding.
It was reported that the area most affected by Hurricane Hanna was south of the city of Corpus Christi to the mouth of the Rio Grande, while widespread flash flooding could occur in the Rio Grande Valley.
Texas Governor Abbott said on the 25th: "Any hurricane is a huge challenge."
Thirty-two counties in the state declared a disaster emergency due to the hurricane.
The city of Corpus Christi, with a population of more than 320,000, has closed its libraries and museums and residents are waiting.
Abbott also said the hurricane cannot be allowed to bring more casualties to Texas at a time when the state is being hit hard by the new outbreak.
It is reported that precipitation in southern Texas is expected to reach 6 to 12 inches on the night of the 26th, and 3 to 5 inches of rain will also occur in northern Texas and coastal Louisiana.
Due to global warming and other factors, Hanna formed earlier than previous Atlantic hurricane seasons.
Typically, the first hurricane in the Atlantic does not form until mid-August.
Poland to withdraw from European treaty to prevent violence against women
Poland's Justice Ministry said Saturday that Poland will take steps next week to withdraw from the European treaty on the prevention of violence against women.
Poland's right-wing government cabinet said the treaty violated the rights of students' parents by requiring schools to teach students about gender issues.
Speaking at a press conference, Polish Justice Minister Joblo said his ministry will submit a request to the Ministry of Labor and Family Monday to start withdrawing from the treaty.
That treaty is also known as the Istanbul Convention.
"The treaty contains elements of a meaning-form nature that we consider harmful," Gioblo said.
Poland's ruling Law and Justice Party and its ruling coalition partners have a close alliance with the Roman Catholic Church and advocate a conservative social agenda.
Polish President Andrzej Duda made hostility to gay rights one of his main issues during his successful re-election campaign this month.
On Friday, thousands of Poles (mostly women) protested in Warsaw and other cities against the withdrawal.
"The purpose of withdrawing from the treaty is to legitimize domestic violence," Lempat, one of the protest organizers, said at a protest march in Warsaw.
Some protesters held banners reading "Law and Justice is a hell for women."
PiS has long complained about the Istanbul Convention.
Poland's previous centrist government ratified the Convention in 2015.
The PiS government said the treaty did not respect religion and called for liberal social policies to be taught in schools.
To date, however, the party has not decided to withdraw from the Convention.

Brazilian President tested positive for the new crown virus.
Xinhua News Agency Brasilia, July 25 (Reporter Zhou Xingzhu) Brazilian President Bolsonaro announced on his personal social media account on July 25 that his latest coronavirus test result was negative.
In addition to announcing the latest test results, Bolsonaro posted photos on social media of himself holding a hydroxychloroquine cartridge.
Bolsonaro has always insisted that the drug is effective in treating coronavirus infection and has repeatedly shown himself taking it live on social media.
According to Brazilian media reports, after announcing the virus test results on the same day, Bolsonaro traveled by motorcycle to the capital Brasilia, where he also met with a member of Congress.
Previously, Bolsonaro had been working in isolation at the presidential residence.
Bolsonaro announced in a joint broadcast by various local media on the 7th of this month that he himself tested positive for the new crown virus on the 6th, and two more tests on the 14th and 21st, both positive.
Jiangxi Province Opens "Green Channel" for Youth on the Front Line of Anti-Flood Enlistment
Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, July 26 (Guo Dongming, Xiong Liang) The Recruitment Office of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government has recently made it clear that priority will be given to the recruitment of individuals or their children who have shown outstanding performance in the flood rescue and relief mission, who meet the recruitment conditions and who have passed both medical and political examinations.
"After the enlistment of young people is registered, we will give priority to the enlistment of young people after verification by the communities where the enlistment is located, the Street Armed Forces Department and the Luoyang District Recruitment Office."
Wang Hui, Vice Minister of People and Military Affairs of Luoyang District of Jiujiang City, said that affected by the floods, they focused three days on organizing medical check-ups for young applicants from the 25th.
Zhou Jingfan is a 22-year-old college graduate. His mother is a community worker and his father is a retired veteran of a department of the Air Force. Zhou's parents have been on the front line of flood prevention and control for the past 10 days.
"These days, seeing in the news that the people's children and soldiers are desperate to defend their hometown on the anti-flood front, I also want to be like them."
Zhou said he had a dream of joining the army since he was a child, and the fight against the floods strengthened his determination to join the military camp.
Jiujiang City has also taken anti-flood and rescue as a "living teaching material" for conscription propaganda. Taking the community as a unit, they called on the young conscripts to voluntarily take part in the tasks of patrolling the embankment and on duty. They now understand the nature and purpose of the people's army and strengthen their confidence in joining the army and serving the country.
Luo Jiuyu, political commissar of the People's Military Department of Luoyang District of Jiujiang City, said that by giving priority to the recruitment of soldiers, he hopes to inspire more young conscripts and create a good social atmosphere in which it is glorious to take part in the mission and join the army.
According to the Viet Nam News Agency, Grivoli believes that Vietnam has made a great contribution to the development of ASEAN over the past 25 years.
Vietnam is not only a responsible member of ASEAN, but also the locomotive of ASEAN.
Grivori said that Russia and even the Asia-Europe Economic Union believe that Vietnam has contributed to ASEAN to enhance its status and promote its image abroad.
"ASEAN should therefore thank Vietnam," he stressed.
Grivoli said analysts endorsed the peace initiative put forward by Vietnam.
Viet Nam is ready to share its experience with ASEAN countries and propose constructive and peaceful measures to the problems facing the Asia-Pacific region, including the East China Sea issue.
With regard to the cooperation between Vietnam and Russia within the framework of ASEAN, Grivori believes that Vietnam supports the cooperative relations between Russia and ASEAN and helps Russia gain benefits under this cooperation framework.
The Asia-Europe Economic Union, including Russia, will be able to enter the ASEAN market after signing a free trade agreement with Vietnam.
Grivori proposed to maximize the free trade area between the Asia-Europe Economic Union and ASEAN countries in order to create a platform for economic and security stability.
Grivori also believes that Russia, Vietnam and ASEAN are on track and will achieve their goals.
From now until the end of 2020, Beijiang Province will have the necessary conditions, especially in the areas of infrastructure, human resources and land, in order to proactively welcome the inflow of foreign capital, especially transnational groups with value chains and the transfer of advanced technologies.
In addition, Bejiang Province will handle and submit the proposal of the Prime Minister of the Government to decide on the investment of infrastructure construction and operation projects in the industrial zone of Vietnam and the Republic of Korea and the document approving the addition of the two industrial-city-service zones of Anshan-Beigang and Ankang in this province to the general plan for the development of the industrial zone of Vietnam up to 2020.
At the same time, Beijiang Province has focused on accelerating the progress of various projects, especially the infrastructure construction and operation projects in industrial park clusters such as Hefufu, Gwangzhou and Shuangxi-Neigang, so as to form a land fund for attracting investment.
In 2020, the Bureau of Industry and Trade of Beijiang Province will make suggestions and suggestions on the planning of industrial zones and industrial clusters in order to be incorporated into the provincial plan.
Beijiang Province has decided to combine the development of industrial park clusters with ensuring national defense security, protecting the ecological environment and ensuring food security, thus helping to promote balanced industrial development. It has comprehensive infrastructure such as electricity, water supply, transportation and telecommunications, and is integrated with urban construction, trade services, workers' housing and other social infrastructure such as medical and health care and education.
In the industrial zone, Beijiang Province has focused on calling for high-tech and clean technology investment projects in the fields of power, electronics, telecommunications equipment, precision machinery and auxiliary industries.
In the industrial park cluster, the province calls for small and medium-sized investment projects in the fields of production and utilization of local labor, especially agricultural products and food processing.
In the future, Beijiang Province will focus on accelerating the investment in the infrastructure of the logistics and logistics center of Beijiang City, developing in parallel with the cluster of industrial parks, in order to optimize the circulation of goods and currency, help reduce the cost of production, improve the value of goods, optimize the supply chain and develop multimodal transport, thus creating an attraction for investors to invest in the province.
The upgraded version of the Russian helicopter gunship Ka-52M was first produced at the end of the year.
MOSCOW, July 25, 2020 / PRNewswire / -- According to the plan of the Russian Ministry of Defense, the upgraded version of the Ka-52M of the Russian helicopter gunship (hereinafter referred to as the Wu-Zhong) Ka-52 will be upgraded and replaced for the first time in December this year. The aircraft will be significantly improved in reconnaissance, communication and weapon performance.
The contract for the development of the Wuzhika-52M, called "Super Alligator," was signed by the Russian military and military industrial units in April last year. At present, the first two upgraded versions of the Wuzhika-52M are being modified and replaced at the Far East Helicopter Manufacturing Plant of the Russian "Progressive" Aerospace Group, and the completion of its national-level testing and improvement will be completed by October 2022, the Russian Yediot reported recently.
According to Russian experts familiar with the above-mentioned upgrading work, the "predecessor" of the "Super Alligator", the Kun-Wuzhika-52, was officially installed in November 2011, and some weaknesses were exposed in the use of the model, which was upgraded to "make up for the short plate".
It is reported that, compared with the Ka-52, the Ka-52M will partially use new protective materials that will not increase weight, its pilot cockpit will be strengthened and equipped with new equipment to resist missile attacks, thus increasing the probability of battlefield survival; it will be equipped with a more powerful generator to power more complex on-board electronic equipment; the photoelectric system will be upgraded to be able to detect and identify more distant battlefield targets; it will be equipped with a new light multi-purpose missile that mainly attacks armoured combat vehicles and reinforced concrete fortifications, with a range of 20 kilometers, which is about one time higher than the similar missile used in active service in Russia. Its defense weapons and communication equipment will be used to the maximum extent with the Mi-28NM helicopter that can attack air targets, thus making the maintenance simple and economical.
In addition, the Ka-52M will have a more advanced electronic guidance system, weapon aiming system and navigation equipment.
Russian experts also said that it is worth noting that the Ka-52M will be equipped with communication equipment to communicate with the UAV in order to obtain real-time information transmitted by nearby UAV in the air, such as displaying the UAV images on the cockpit screen of the helicopter.
As planned, the pilot of the Ka-52M can directly control the UAV with which it cooperates, thus improving the pilot's mastery of the battlefield situation and the guidance of long-range missiles.
According to Russian media reports, Russian Deputy Defense Minister Krivoruchko said last December that the Russian Defense Ministry plans to purchase more than 110 Wuzhika-52Ms by 2027.
The new decree stipulates that masks must be worn in indoor public places in Campania from today, with a fine of up to 1,000 euros.
On June 1 local time, the Colosseum reopened in Rome, the capital of Italy.
It is reported that, according to the latest epidemic prevention decree issued by the regional government, people in Campania must wear masks in accordance with the epidemic prevention requirements on all public transport, as well as in and out of indoor public places such as shops, bars, supermarkets and exhibition halls.
Violation of this provision is punishable by a fine of up to 1,000 euros.
The decree also stipulates that all passengers from non-Schengen countries entering the Campania region must be quarantined.
Regional governments will authorize health institutions to coordinate arrangements for specific hotels to isolate positive and asymptomatic persons.
The decree entered into force on 25 July.
In less than an hour, three customers who entered the supermarket were fined.
Hebei river and lake ecological water recharge 1.75 billion cubic meters since this year
Xinhua News Agency Shijiazhuang, July 26 (Reporter Wang Kun) learned from the Hebei Water Conservancy Department that, since this year, Hebei Province has made overall use of water from diversion rivers and local reservoirs, and has successively implemented ecological water recharge to 28 rivers and Baiyangdian, including the Lutuo River, the Tanghe River and the Qianmahe River, accumulating 1.75 billion cubic meters of ecological water recharge from rivers and lakes.
Hebei Province clung to the favorable opportunity of increasing the flow and water delivery of the middle line of the South-to-North Water Transfer Project and implemented ecological water replenishment by using river water diversion to Tanghe, Shahe and Shulong rivers.
At the same time, nine large and medium-sized reservoirs such as the Western Ocean, East Wushi and Baiyangdian have been used to carry out ecological water recharge to rivers such as the Luoyang River and the Qinglong River, resulting in a cumulative surface area of more than 90 square kilometers.
In order to do a good job in the work of ecological water recharge, the Hebei Water Conservancy Department has actively organized and carried out the investigation of hidden dangers, remediation, reinforcement and river cleaning of recharge rivers, refined practical measures and strengthened inspection and management protection.
Through supervision and inspection and centralized unannounced visits, all kinds of problems were solved in time to ensure the safe and orderly recharge of the river.
According to the relevant persons in charge of the Hebei Water Conservancy Department, the orderly implementation of the ecological water recharge of rivers and lakes has effectively repaired the ecological environment of rivers and lakes in Hebei Province, promoted the recharge and conservation of coastal groundwater, greatly improved the human settlements environment and the economic development environment along the route, and is of great significance to the realization of the river and lake management and protection goals of "clear water, coastal green, river smooth and beautiful".
You should all know the facts I'm going to tell.
My intuition that inequality can cause social fragmentation and corruption existed before the French Revolution.
The difference is that we can now find evidence that we can understand the impact of inequality by comparing societies with different levels of equality.
I'll show you some of the data and explain why that data is really relevant.
But first, look at how hard our lives are.
(Laughter) I want to start my speech with a contradiction.
This chart shows the relationship between our average life expectancy and gross national income, which measures the average wealth of a country.
You can look at the countries on the right, like Norway and the United States, which are twice as rich as the countries on the left, such as Israel, Greece and Portugal.
But this has not affected the average life expectancy of their citizens.
There are no signs of correlation.
But if we look within societies, we can find great differences in health status within their societies as a whole.
This picture still shows life expectancy.
These are all small towns in England and Wales - the poorest on the right and the richest on the left.
There are great differences between the poor and others.
Even those just below the top are in worse health than those at the top.
So income means very much in our society, but the comparison between different societies is not meaningful.
The explanation for that contradiction is that, in our society, we look at relative income or social status, identity - that is, the relationship between us and the size of the gap between people.
Once you have that idea, you should immediately think: What happens if the gap widens? What happens if the gap narrows? What happens if the income gap widens or decreases?
That's what I'm going to tell you right away.
I'm not using any hypothetical data.
My data comes from the United Nations - like those of the World Bank - on the income disparities between these rich, developed-market democracies.
The method we use, which is simple and easy to understand, and which you can download, is to compare the income gap between the top 20% and the bottom 20% in each country.
You can see that the countries on the left are more equal - Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden - and their top 20% are about 3.5 to 4 times richer than the bottom 20%.
But on the other side of inequality - the United Kingdom, Portugal, the United States, and Singapore - the income gap has doubled.
In this way of comparison, inequality in our country (the UK) is twice as high as in other equally successful democratic markets.
Next I will show how this affects our society.
We have collected data on problems arising from differences within society, which are more prevalent at the bottom of society.
Internationally comparable data include life expectancy, children's performance in mathematics and language, infant mortality, suicide rates, the prison population, teenage pregnancy rates, levels of mutual trust, obesity, mental illness - all of which meet the standard diagnostic categories, including drug and alcohol addiction - and social mobility rates.
We put all this into one coefficient.
They are all weighted equally.
A country's score is the average of these factors.
As you can see, these scores are related to the inequality comparison I've just shown, and I'll show these data over and over again.
The more unequal the country, the worse it performs on social issues.
The correlation is very strong.
But if you look at the same health and social issues compared with national income per capita and the GNI index, you don't find anything. There's no correlation.
We had a bit of a concern that people might think we were picking specific issues to suit our theory and then creating artificial evidence, so we also published a paper on the UNICEF Child Well-being Index in the British Medical Journal.
It contains 40 different parts, from the summary of others.
It includes whether children can talk to their parents, whether there are books at home, what immunization rates are, and whether there is bullying in schools.
Everything is included.
This is how the index relates to the same level of inequality.
In more unequal societies, children perform worse.
The relationship is significant.
But once again, if you look at the relationship between child welfare and per capita national income, you will get nothing. There is no sign of a link.
All the data I have shown you so far reveal the same thing.
The average welfare of our society no longer depends on national income and economic growth.
They are important in poorer countries, but not in rich developed countries.
And the differences between us and where we are relative to others now seem very important.
Below I will show you some parts of our index.
This is an index of mutual trust.
It refers to the proportion of people who agree that the majority of people are credible.
This is data from the World Values Survey.
As can be seen, on the more unequal side, about 15% of people feel that they can trust others.
However, in more egalitarian societies, the proportion rises to 60 or 65 per cent.
If you look at community participation or the assessment of social capital, there are very similar associations that are closely related to inequality.
I would like to say that we have repeated this work twice.
The first was for these rich developed countries, and we then changed the test subjects and repeated it to the 50 US states - asking the same question: Do the more unequal states do worse on all these assessments?
This is the relationship between mutual trust and inequality drawn by the Federal Government in a general social survey.
Very similar scatters are distributed over similar trust levels.
The same thing continues.
Basically, we found that almost all the factors related to mutual trust reflected in the international survey were also reflected in the 50 states we surveyed.
This is no coincidence.
This picture is mental illness.
The World Health Organization collects data through random sampling using the same diagnostic interview method, which allows us to compare the rates of mental illness in each society.
This is the proportion of the population with any kind of mental illness in the previous year.
It ranges from 8% to more than 24% - suggesting that the rate of mental illness in society as a whole is three times higher than in other societies.
Again, these are closely linked to inequality.
This picture shows the crime rate.
The red dots represent U.S. states and the blue triangle represents Canadian provinces.
But look at the difference in their numbers.
The murder rate ranged from 15 to 150 per million.
This is the ratio of the prison population.
This is a 10-fold gap, and the exponential function amplifies the gap.
However, the prison population varies from 40 to 400.
Crime is not the main reason for this relationship.
In some places, crime can partly explain why.
But there are more harsh trials, or harsher trials.
The more unequal the society, the more inclined it is to retain the death penalty.
This chart shows the situation of children dropping out of high school.
Similarly, the gap is wide.
If we discuss the selection of social talents, we will find that the harm of this gap is very serious.
This chart shows the social mobility rate.
In fact, it is based on the income flow rate calculation.
Basically, what it asks is: Do rich fathers have rich children and poor fathers have poor children, or is there no relationship between the two?
On the more unequal side, Dad's income is more important - for example, in the UK and the US.
In northern Europe, Dad's income is less important.
There is more social mobility there.
As we often say - and I know there are many American listeners here - if Americans want to realize their "American dream", they should go to Denmark.
(Laughter) (Applause) What I've already shown is marked here in italics.
I can also show some other questions.
Those problems are more prevalent at the bottom of the social gradient.
But there are endless problems with the social gradient, which are worse in unequal countries - not just a little worse, but twice as bad as everything.
Think about the cost, the human cost.
I'd like to go back to this diagram shown earlier and we combine everything to illustrate two points.
First, through one chart after another, we find that the countries that perform poorly, whatever, seem to be the more unequal countries, but those that perform well seem to be Northern Europe and Japan.
So what we see is the relationship between general social disorder and inequality.
Not just one or two things went wrong, but almost everything.
Another important point I would like to point out on this chart is that if you look at the bottom, Switzerland and Japan, they show in all respects that they are very different countries.
The status of women and their adherence to small families are at two extremes in rich and developed countries.
But another important difference is how they achieve greater equality.
Sweden has large differences in income, but it uses taxes, state benefits, generous relief, and so on to close the gap.
Japan is quite different.
First, the pre-tax wage gap in Japan is relatively small.
It has lower taxes.
It also has relatively few benefits.
In a study of American states, we found a stark contrast.
Some states perform well through redistribution, while others do well because of small pre-tax income disparities.
So we conclude that how to achieve greater equality is not important, what is important is to achieve such equality.
I am not talking about complete equality. I am talking about what does exist in rich and developed market democracies.
Another surprise about this chart is that it is not just the poor who are affected by inequality.
There seems to be some truth in the words of John Donne (English poet): "No man is an island."
Through a series of studies, we can compare the behavior of people from each social class in different countries with more or less equal degrees.
This is just one example.
This chart shows the infant mortality rate.
According to the UK's general socio-economic classification records, some Swedes have very kindly classified many infant deaths.
This is an anachronistic classification based on paternity, so single mothers form their own set of data.
But we look at the so-called "lower class of society", which is unskilled manual work.
In the middle is manual work that requires skills, from high-level non-manual work to professional jobs - doctors, lawyers, managers of large companies.
It can be seen here that Sweden has done better than Britain and has done better in every social class.
The biggest differences occur at the bottom of society.
But even at the top, living in a more egalitarian society has some advantages.
We presented five different sets of data, including US and international educational outcomes and health status.
It seems that overall, more egalitarian societies show the most obvious differences at the bottom of society, but there are also some advantages at the top.
I should explain what happened.
I think I'm showing and discussing the psychosocial impact of inequality.
It is more concerned with the sense of superiority and inferiority, being valued and looked down upon, respected and denigrated.
Of course, those feelings generated by the competition for identity status have prompted the advancement of social consumerism.
But it also leads to status insecurity.
We are more worried about how others judge and view us, whether we appear attractive, smart, or something like that.
Social value evaluation reinforces the fear of these social value evaluations.
Interestingly, some similar work is also being done in the field of social psychology: some people reviewed 208 different studies, in which volunteers were invited to a psychological experimental center and then tested their stress Holman and their response to stress tasks.
In this observation, scientists are interested in which type of stress can best raise levels of cortisol in the body, the most important stress, Holmont.
The result is precisely those tasks that include the threat of social evaluation - tasks that threaten self-esteem and social status - in which others can negatively evaluate your performance.
These stresses have very specific effects on stress physiology.
So far we have accepted the criticism.
Of course, some people don't like this, and others find it surprising.
However, I should still tell you that when people criticize us for picking data, we have never done so.
We have an unconditional rule that if our data sources contain data from the countries observed, then we include them in the analysis.
Our data sources determine whether the data is valid, not us.
Otherwise, there will be a deviation.
What about other countries?
In academic peer-reviewed journals, 200 studies were on the relationship between health and income and equality.
This is not limited to these countries here. There is a very simple proof.
The same measurement of inequality in the same countries, one problem after another.
Why don't we control the other factors?
I have shown you that per capita national income has not had any impact.
Of course, others have applied more complex methods in the literature to exclude factors such as poverty and education in the experiment.
What about causality?
Correlation by itself does not prove a causal link.
It took us quite a while.
Indeed, the causal links of our results are well understood.
The biggest change in our understanding of the drivers of long-term health in rich countries is how important long-term stress from society is to immunity and the cardiovascular system
Or, for example, violence is becoming more common in more unequal countries because people are sensitive to being looked down upon.
I would like to say that, in order to solve this problem, we should solve a series of after-tax and pre-tax problems.
We should limit income and curb the bonus income culture at the top.
I think we must do everything we can to hold our leaders accountable to their employees.
Finally, I would like to conclude that we can improve our real quality of life by reducing our income gap.
In this way, we will find that we suddenly solve the socio-mental health problems of the whole society, which is great.
Thank you. Thank you.

(Deutsche Welle) In the past two weeks, the number of new confirmed cases in Spain has risen sharply, with thousands of new cases appearing on several days.
The British government made a provisional decision on Saturday night (July 25) to remove Spain from the safe travel list from midnight local time on July 26, and people entering the UK from Spain must be quarantined for 14 days.
British tourists on holiday in Spain expressed surprise, fear and even anger at the decision, as the news came suddenly and took them by surprise.
British Transport Secretary Grant Shapps is also reportedly on holiday in Spain.
Prior to the UK's quarantine measures, Norway had also announced a 10-day quarantine for people returning to Norway from Spain.
France and Belgium have advised their residents to forgo holidays in and around Barcelona.
Beaches in these areas were overcrowded and people could not maintain social distancing, and the police had to take measures to reduce the number of beach visitors.
Tourism is an important pillar industry in Spain
Spain: It's safe here
In response to the decision made by the United Kingdom, the Spanish Foreign Ministry said Sunday that the epidemic in the country was under control.
Spanish Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya stressed to the media: "Spain is safe, not only for Spaniards, but also for tourists."
The Spanish government will try to persuade the British government to exclude the Balearic Islands and Canary Islands from the quarantine measures.
The reason is that the infection rate in these two resorts is much lower than in the UK.
In order to prevent the spread of the epidemic, the "ban on foot" has also been reintroduced in Catalonia, Spain.
Tourism is an important pillar industry in Spain, and Spain is one of the most popular holiday destinations for British tourists.
The British decision is expected to greatly affect Spain's tourism industry.

First Day of Medium Volt: Temporary Absence of High Temperature and Heat in Beijing to Open Rainfall Mode - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26, by wire (reporter Ni Yuan Jin) July 26 is the first day of "neutralization" this year.
The wind and rainstorm convective weather in the early morning of the 26th dispersed the high temperature and heat that had enveloped the Beijing area for days, and a new round of rainfall weather will last for several days.
The Beijing Meteorological Observatory announced at 11: 00 on the 26th that there were scattered showers (with weak thunder and lightning) in Beijing on the 26th, and the daily maximum temperature was only 27 degrees Celsius.
Previously, from 24 to 25, the whole city of Beijing was under a high temperature blue warning, and the daily maximum temperature in most areas was around 37 ° C, with local high temperatures exceeding 40 ° C.
Futian is the highest temperature, humid and sultry day of the year. There are "three volts" and the hottest is in the middle, which is when the Chinese people say "bitter summer".
When entering the barn, families fill the barn, and there is a folk saying of "one-volt dumplings and two-volt noodles."
According to the current forecast, Beijing will have cloudy and rainy weather in the next three days.
The meteorological department advised the public to minimize visits to mountainous areas and guard against geological disasters.
It is understood that this year's "mid-volt" will have 20 days, from July 26 to August 14.
After entering the "middle volt", people will feel physical weakness and loss of appetite.
Diet can choose mung beans, coix and other foods with the effect of clearing heat and relieving heat, strengthening spleen and appetizing, as well as bitter foods such as bitter cabbage and bitter gourd, which can help to enhance appetite and dispel heat.
The FAA ordered an urgent inspection of 2,000 Boeing airliners.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an emergency airworthiness directive on the 24th, requiring an emergency inspection of about 2,000 Boeing 737NG and 737 Classic aircraft registered in the United States, because the corrosion of the air check valves of the above-mentioned aircraft could cause the engines to stop in the air.
The FAA said that so far, it has received four reports of 737NG and 737Classic engines stopping in the air, so it has made a request for an urgent inspection of airliners that have been parked for more than seven consecutive days and those that have flown less than 11 times since re-entering flight.
The Federal Aviation Administration warned that if the stage 5 check valves of all two engines were corroded, they could jam in the open position, causing the aircraft to lose power and be unable to restart the engines.
The aviation regulator ordered that once the check valve was found to be corroded, air operators must replace this key component before the aircraft could be put into service again.
Boeing responded later in the day that the outbreak of the new epidemic had reduced travel demand, resulting in many airliners being sealed or less used, and "check valves are more vulnerable to corrosion."
At the same time, Boeing said it had advised air carriers to inspect the airliners covered by the directive and that if problems were found, Boeing would provide assistance in repairing and replacing check valves.
Major US airline operators' airliners usually fly several times a day, but a large number of airliners have been grounded after the outbreak of the new epidemic, and some have returned to operation as passenger travel demand has recently grown slowly, AP reported.
The FAA did not release details of the four air parking reports.
Alaska Airlines revealed one of the incidents late on the 24th.
The airline operator said in a statement that one of its aircraft was flying from Seattle, Washington, to Austin, Texas on July 15 when one of its engines suddenly failed, and the aircraft finally made a successful emergency landing at Austin Airport.
Alaska Airlines said it had replaced the aircraft's engines and had inspected the engines of six aircraft in accordance with FAA directives.
American Airlines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines said on the 24th that their airliners had no engine failure related to the air check valve.
Four American Airlines aircraft will be inspected and 28 United Airlines aircraft will be inspected.
Delta Air Lines said it would inspect its 20 aircraft, but did not say whether there had been any engine failures.
Several media reported that the FAA emergency airworthiness directive is another blow to Boeing.
A Boeing 737 MAX from Lion Air Indonesia and Ethiopian Airlines crashed in October 2018 and March 2019, respectively, killing 346 people.
This series of airliners was subsequently grounded worldwide, stopped production in January this year, and resumed production in May.
FAA Director Steve Dickson admitted in June that the FAA had "made a mistake" in regulating Boeing with regard to the 737MAX.
"Ding Dong Online! Good Teacher" goes online next week Xue Zhaofeng leads "Knowledge Initiator" - Xinhua
There is also a new variety online.
The interactive knowledge-sharing program "Ding Dong Online! Good Teacher" will be broadcast on Hunan TV from July 20.
It is understood that the program will create a brand-new all-age youth classroom, and a group of attractive and talented teachers will play to challenge the output of interesting knowledge.
Unlike the serious impression of the previous group of teachers in the hearts of the public, "Ding Dong Online! Good Teacher" gathers a group of knowledge representatives with both face value and talent.
They are not only young knowledge role models from various disciplines, but also a group of all-round "paragraph hands" who can shake the burden and are good at teaching and fun.
In the program, this group of outstanding young knowledge role models, as "knowledge sharing officers", will challenge the interesting knowledge classroom.
They need to impress the audience by having an attitude of knowledge output and showing the most interesting side of their subject.
The "Tao Question Group", composed of all-age viewers, will ask changing questions live, make the teaching of the "knowledge sharing officer" more difficult, and also add a little exciting atmosphere to the program.
It is revealed that the "knowledge sharing officers" include outstanding young teachers such as Li Yongle, a physics teacher at a middle school attached to Renmin University of China, Zhang Xuefeng, a famous teacher of research examination guidance, and Wang Lei, a history teacher with 10 years of experience, who will show the "hard core" knowledge of various disciplines to the live audience in an unexpected way.
In addition, the program also invited Xue Zhaofeng, a professor of economics, as the "knowledge initiator" of the program, to join "Ding Dong Teaching Assistant" Du Haitao and Jin Mengjia to talk about youth with the audience and create an "open class on youth for all".
Chief Secretary for Administration of the HKSAR Government: The situation is serious and we will fight the epidemic.
Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 26: The Chief Secretary for Administration of the HKSAR Government, Mr Matthew Cheung Kin-chung, said on July 26 that the situation of the new pneumonia epidemic in Hong Kong continues to be severe. If the epidemic worsens, the HKSAR Government will decisively take more stringent control measures, further restrict the operation of business premises and reduce the space for citizens to go out.
However, at this stage, the HKSAR Government has no intention of introducing a "stay-at-home order" or a "no-foot order" to restrict citizens from going out.
On the same day, Zhang Jianzong published a blog entitled "The situation is serious and make every effort to fight the epidemic".
He said the epidemic is the most severe in half a year, and the next two weeks will be critical to prevent further spread of the virus in the community.
In addition to the necessary measures taken by the HKSAR Government, public self-discipline and cooperation are also very important.
He urged the public to stay at home and reduce social contact and eating out.
Members of the public should cooperate with the mandatory measures to wear masks to protect themselves and others, pay attention to personal and environmental hygiene and wash hands frequently. They should also suspend non-essential gatherings or meals of relatives and friends and reduce them to markets.

The "Nutrition Agent" of the Party History and New China History
2020-07-26 17: 37: 29 Source: People's Tribune Network Author: Zhu Yanjing Responsible Editor: Zhu Yanjing
Recently, during a visit to the Siping Battle Memorial Museum, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed that "1.4 billion people and more than 90 million Party members, especially leading cadres at all levels, should learn the history of the Communist Party of China and the history of New China well."
Studying Party history and the history of New China conscientiously is a compulsory course for Party cadres not to forget their beginnings and remember their mission. They should draw rich nourishment from it, enrich their national feelings and take the long road to the new era.
A magnificent history of the Party and the history of New China records the hard struggle and glorious course of the Communist Party of China since its birth, and shows the belief and loyalty forged by the Communists with their lives and blood, and the original heart and mission that they will always adhere to.
History is the best textbook. For Party members and cadres, Party history and New China history are the most brilliant chapters in this textbook.
Every Party member cadre should constantly strengthen the historical thinking of learning from history and moving towards the future, based on the new mission of the new journey, take the "baton" of the times and take the long journey of the present generation.
Shape the soul with history and adhere to the original mission in the study of Party history and new China history.
Turning over the history of the Party and the history of New China is full of the Chinese Communists' immutable original mission and rock-solid belief, demonstrating the simple feeling that the Communists will always be with the people.
To understand the important events, important meetings and important figures in the history of the Party and New China in close proximity is not only an intuitive mind shock and ideological baptism, but also to read the connotation of the first heart belief from the depths of the soul, and to know the weight of the mission.
For Party members and cadres, if they want to continuously strengthen their original mission and always preserve their original advanced character, it is necessary to find the original point of our departure and the fulcrum of our initial heart from the history of the Party and the history of New China, maintain a clear understanding and a firm position, inspire the strength of fighting bravely for the country and the people, and ensure that the red rivers and mountains laid down by the forefathers of the revolution with blood and life are handed down from generation to generation.
Study history wisely and inherit the noble spirit in the study of Party history and new Chinese history.
Since the founding of the Communist Party of China, it has shaped a series of great spirits, such as the spirit of Red Ship, the spirit of Jinggangshan, the spirit of the Long March, the spirit of Yan'an, the spirit of the Anti-Japanese War, the spirit of Xibaobo, the spirit of "two bullets and one star" and the spirit of space.
These great spirits precipitated by history have provided strong spiritual inspiration for our Party to overcome various risks and challenges on the way forward, and are valuable spiritual wealth that cannot be defeated, scattered or robbed.
The process of studying Party history and Chinese history is a process of revisiting and shaping these spirits. We should consciously take the noble spirit of the forefathers of the revolution as a mirror, adhere to the spiritual home of the Communists, build a solid spiritual base for the promotion of great causes and the realization of great dreams, inherit and carry forward these spirits and radiate the light of the new times.
Read history and introspect, constantly correct and dispel evil spirits in the study of Party history and new China history.
For Party members and cadres, there has never been any period of history that can bring more profound warning, enlightenment and reference than the history of the Party and the history of New China.
In the history of the Party and the history of New China, we can see not only the great deeds of the older generation of revolutionaries who committed themselves to their faith and worked tirelessly to achieve the set goals, but also the profound lessons of certain figures who were shaken by their ideals and beliefs and walked to the opposite side of the revolution. They enlighten and warn us to never stagnate or slacken with firm determination and will, always maintain a full and tenacious spirit of struggle, constantly purify the Party spirit and discipline ourselves.
To truly become a firm believer and faithful practitioner of the lofty ideal of communism, it is necessary to brush away the "dust" of ideas and strictly prevent "dirt" from dyeing themselves. The history of the Party and the history of New China should be the basis for every Party member cadre to examine himself and warn himself.
Knowledge of history and motivation to take on the important tasks of the times in the study of Party history and new China history.
General Secretary Xi Jinping once pointed out: "Learning Party history and national history is a compulsory course to adhere to and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics and continue to push forward the various undertakings of the Party and the state."
Looking back at history and asking about the original heart in order to continue the glory and move towards the future.
Every Party member and cadre should take the study of Party history and new Chinese history as a lifelong pursuit, constantly correct the course of life in his study, courageously undertake the historical mission, dare to take responsibility and take the initiative in his respective posts.
We will continue to take the advanced deeds of the older generation of revolutionaries as a reference and guide, constantly polish the political essence of the Communists, maintain the attitude of struggle that only works day and night, and the spirit of struggle that is more difficult and more dangerous, and move forward, and write our own brilliant piece in the vast journey of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
"Putting on the Jiangnan" and Pursuing the Poetic "Dream of the Yellow River"
(China's Poverty Reduction Story) The Search for Poetic "Yellow River Dream"
China News Agency Yinchuan July 26 (Yang Di) "Jiuqu Yellow River thousands of miles of sand, the waves from the Tianya."
The Yellow River, which aroused the pride of countless literati Chizi Wanzhang, gave birth to the beautiful and rich Ningxia Plain. Now, Ningxia, which is known as "Putting on the Jiangnan", is adhering to the concept of "ecological priority and green development" and pursuing the poetic "Yellow River dream".
"Blue Wave Dream" of River Clear Water Show
"The world's Yellow River is rich in Ningxia", and the Yellow River flows 397 kilometers through Ningxia, which is the "mother river" of raising one side.
However, with the rapid advancement of industrialization and urbanization, the development, utilization, management and protection of rivers and lakes are unbalanced, and chaotic images such as exceeding the standards for sewage discharge, encircling lakes for land and encroaching on water areas have emerged, leading to the black odor of water bodies, exceeding the standards for water quality, environmental mess and ecological degradation.
Now, Ningxia is promoting the diverse restoration of water ecology and working hard to return the Xiuhe Qing of the Yellow River.
Treat water from the source.
In Yinchuan, Ningxia, the local method of "raising the bid + controlling pollution + strict management" was adopted, all sewage from industrial parks was centrally treated, all urban sewage treatment plants achieved Grade I A standard discharge, black and smelly water bodies were basically eliminated in urban built-up areas, and the third batch of Chinese black and smelly water demonstration cities was successfully declared.
In addition, Ningxia fully implemented the long-term river and lake system in 2017, and has now achieved full coverage of the five-level long-term river and lake responsibility system in districts, cities and counties and villages, and long river and lake patrols have become the norm.
Gu Jincheng, 64, who lives in a village on the edge of the Yellow River, witnessed the changes in the Yellow River: "The water used to have a bad smell, and the smell has disappeared after remediation."
Gu Jincheng said that the ecological environment is better and his life is more comfortable. Now he often walks along the Yellow River with his family to feel the clear water and blue sky.
The "Wetland Dream" of Sha Luoxiang Collection
Flying birds, green trees, trestle roads, clear water.. Fan Zhongyan wrote that the beautiful scenery of "sand and informative collection" has become a reality in the Yellow River Wetland Park in Yinchuan, Ningxia.
As the Yellow River flows through Ningxia, a variety of wetlands such as river wetlands, lake wetlands and swamp wetlands have been formed along the way, which plays an important role in promoting the rational utilization of water resources and water ecological balance, and has also become an important international migration channel for birds.
Since 2009, the relevant departments in Ningxia have invested a total of about RMB 3.45 billion in wetland protection projects. At present, the area of Yinchuan wetlands is 19.2 million hectares, with a wetland protection rate of 78.5 per cent. There are nearly 200 natural lakes and swamp wetlands, with five national wetland parks, one national urban wetland park, six autonomous region-level wetland parks and eight municipal parks.
Lu Jinhu, deputy director of the Yinchuan Wetland Protection Center, told reporters that wetland protection has increased biodiversity, which is particularly evident in birds. "The remaining gull is an endangered bird, with only more than 20,000 in the world, of which more than 2,000 live in the Yinchuan Wetland."
At the same time, Ningxia has demarcated the red line of the 500-meter zone for the protection area of wetlands on both sides of the Yinchuan section of the Yellow River in accordance with the law, stipulating that no unit or individual may carry out development, construction and business activities within the protection area except for public welfare projects.
Zhao Shaoyong, deputy director of the Yinchuan Water Conservancy Service Center, said that through the control of pollution sources, the comprehensive improvement of the ecology of rivers and lakes and the construction of end wetlands, the water quality of the nine main yellow drains in Ningxia has now reached 100% of the standards. "Now the water is also clear, the fish swim and the flowers bloom."
Pu Huimin's "Drinking Water Dream"
Ningxia Yinchuan City once had an "awkward" title: the only city along the Yellow River that "guards the Yellow River for water and drinking".
Since 2010, Yinchuan City has been faced with a persistent problem of water shortage at the peak of summer, and the "pain of water shortage" in the past decade has become a painful summer experience for many high-rise residents. However, with the fact that major water sources are at the limit of overmining and a large area of groundwater overmining funnel area has been formed underground in the city, the water shortage has become a difficult problem perplexing Yinchuan City.
Thanks to the improvement of the water quality of the Yellow River, drinking the purified Yellow River has become a good solution to the drinking water problem of local residents.
Ding Ming, Deputy Director of the Yinchuan Water Affairs Bureau, said that in order to improve the living and production water needs of urban and rural residents in Yinchuan, Ningxia launched the Yinchuan Metropolitan Area Urban and Rural Western Line Water Supply Project in a timely manner, replacing the original underground water source with high-quality Yellow River.
"On December 29, 2019, the water supply project officially opened water to the three districts of Yinchuan City, and in 2020, residents of Minning Town and Helan County also drank the Yellow River."
Ding Ming said the Yinchuan water conservancy department will give overall consideration to the transformation of the integration of regional rural drinking water and urban water supply. "As a next step, we will integrate all the decentralized rural water supply points into the Western Line water supply project, and it is expected that the integrated urban and rural water supply in Yinchuan region will basically be realized by the end of this year."
The departments responsible for compaction strengthen flood prevention and relief work
The departments responsible for compaction strengthened flood prevention and relief work
CCTV news (news broadcast): News from the Ministry of Water Resources, at 12: 00 today (July 25), the river below Wangjiaba in the main stream of the Huai River exceeded the warning level by 0.64 ~ 3.31 meters, and the river below Sand City in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the two lakes exceeded the warning level by 0.05 ~ 2.02 meters.
Taihu Lake has lasted for 28 days since it exceeded the warning level on June 28.
At 12: 00 today, the average water level of Taihu Lake was 4.67 meters, exceeding the guaranteed water level by 0.02 meters.
Today, after consultation and deliberation, the State General Administration of Flood Prevention decided to continue to maintain the second-level flood control response of the Yangtze and Huaihe rivers, requiring all localities to consolidate their responsibilities and further implement the work of flood prevention and relief.
Today, the State Prevention Office and the Ministry of Emergency Management urgently deployed specialized flood drainage vehicles from Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Fujian to help Jiangxi solve local problems such as internal waterlogging caused by heavy rainfall.
US launches first countervailing investigation against China for "undervalued RMB exchange rate"
In response to the recent announcement by the US Department of Commerce, it decided to launch an anti-dumping countervailing investigation against strap (strap) products from China, and launched an investigation into the "RMB exchange rate undervaluation" project.
China's Ministry of Commerce pointed out that this is the first time that the United States has filed a case to investigate the alleged "undervaluation of the RMB exchange rate" in a countervailing case, which China firmly opposes.
China's Ministry of Commerce issued a special press release in this regard on the evening of the 23rd, saying that China implements a managed floating exchange rate system based on market supply and demand and adjusted with reference to a basket of currencies, and that the market plays a decisive role in the formation of the exchange rate.
The press release stressed that, on the whole, the RMB exchange rate is at a reasonable equilibrium level and is not undervalued.
Since 2005, the RMB has appreciated cumulatively against the US dollar by more than 17%.
According to the data released by the Bank for International Settlements, from the beginning of 2005 to May 2020, the nominal effective exchange rate of the Renminbi appreciated by 38 per cent and the real effective exchange rate by 49 per cent, making it the strongest currency among the G-20 economies and one of the largest currencies in the world.
The Ministry of Commerce pointed out that the exchange rate issue exceeds the competence of members to conduct countervailing investigation in accordance with the rules of the World Trade Organization.
The United States, which amended its laws and regulations in February this year to conduct countervailing investigations against other countries' exchange rates, has been suspected of violating WTO rules and has been opposed by many parties.
The press release said that even in accordance with US regulations, the content of the applicant's complaint contained a large number of errors and did not have the necessary elements of countervailing, such as financial support, granting of benefits and exclusivity.
China urges the US to abide by existing international rules and stop countervailing investigations into the so-called "undervaluation of the RMB exchange rate."
Affected by the further rise in tensions between China and the United States, the offshore and onshore RMB exchange rates fell sharply against the US dollar on the 22nd, both falling below the RMB 7.0 mark against the US dollar.
It is worth noting whether the US Commerce Department's move is intended to force up the renminbi.
The spot exchange rate of RMB against the US dollar rose above the 7.0 mark on the 23rd to close at 6.9961.
The middle price of the officially regulated RMB-US dollar exchange rate was cut by 17 basis points on the 24th to 6.9938.
With the gradual improvement of the epidemic, the film and television industry, which has been silent for nearly half a year, has gradually returned to normal.

Chen Baoguo, Huang Lei and Sun Honglei are all highly qualified Mesozoic actors. 37-year-old Lei Jiayin is also a solid actor, while 32-year-old Zhang Ruoyi is the youngest finalist.
In 2016, the 34-year-old Hu Ge won the White Magnolia Award for Best Actor for "Lang Liang", becoming the youngest emperor in the award. If Zhang Ruoyi can beat several other predecessors this year, he will set this record.
The competition for the best actress was also finally decided in Hai Qing, Mai Yong, Qin Hailu, Sun Li and Yan Ni, the mainstay of the film and television industry, none of which was shortlisted.
It is worth mentioning that Sun Li was shortlisted for the role of "Home" Room Xijin, which is her sixth nomination for the award. She won "Best Actress" twice for "The True Story of the Hot Mother" in 2014 and "The Story of the Moon" in 2016.

Venezuela's foreign minister accuses US of fabricating lies to attack China unprovoked - Xinhua
Arreaza said that the United States government has recently exerted constant pressure on China in the political, diplomatic, economic and public opinion fields, which is a baseless attack on a sovereign state.
Arreaza retweeted a tweet posted by Chinese Ambassador to Venezuela Li Baorong on his personal account earlier that day and made the above comments.
Li Baorong said in a tweet that China strongly condemns the forced entry of the US into the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, which constitutes a serious violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and the China-US Consular Treaty, to which China will make a legitimate and necessary response.
Venezuelan Vice President Rodriguez, Vice Foreign Minister for North American Affairs Carlos Long and other government officials, prominent social figures and mainstream media journalists also retweeted Li Baorong's tweets, condemning the actions of the United States as a serious violation of international law.
On the 26th, the day before Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte delivered his fifth State of the Union Address (SONA), more than 80,000 new cases of pneumonia were confirmed in the Philippines, of which the number of cases confirmed by the Presidential Information Department (PCOO) and its staff increased to 25.
To this end, the PCOO has prepared a special working group that has not been in contact with the diagnosed staff to cooperate with the press release of President Duterte's SONA.
PCOO Minister Martin Anandar said in an interview with DZBB Radio on the 26th that two sets of plans have been prepared for President Duterte to publish the SONA approach.
According to Plan A, Duterte will deliver SONA on the afternoon of the 27th at the Philippine Congress (Batasang Pambansa) Building in Quezon City.
Due to the epidemic, only 50 seats were arranged for some government cabinet members and legislators, and a special video conference room was set up for other cabinet members, local government officials, etc.
All participants passed a rapid test on the same day to enter the Capitol.
Once one of the participants tests positive, Plan B is activated, whereby President Duterte delivers SONA at the Malakanan Palace of the Presidential Palace, and fewer seats are arranged for the hearing.
As is customary, SONA will broadcast live to the Philippines in real time.
At the time of writing, the Philippine presidential palace had not confirmed whether Duterte's family would attend SONA.
Andanal said President Duterte's SONA will highlight how the government will lead the Philippines in dealing with the new pneumonia epidemic and restoring socio-economic life. It will also refer to his commitment when he took office to fight government corruption, combat illicit drugs and reduce poverty.
Duterte will also describe his administration's other plans, including creating more jobs, reviving the economy, promoting education, and helping overseas Filipino workers suffering from the epidemic.
Yinchuan: Classified Policies to Support the Stabilization of Teachers in Kindergartens
Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, July 26 (Reporter Ai Fumei) As a result of the epidemic, kindergartens in Yinchuan City, Ningxia, have not yet reopened, especially the increased financial pressure on private kindergartens, which has had a certain impact on the stability and sustainable development of kindergarten teachers in the future.
In response to this, Yinchuan City has taken a number of measures, such as pre-allocating subsidy funds to inclusive private kindergartens, providing job stabilization subsidies to non-inclusive private kindergartens, and reducing and reducing the rent of private kindergartens, to support these kindergartens in stabilizing the number of teachers.
According to the relevant policies of Yinchuan City, if, during the epidemic period, the organizers of inclusive private kindergartens (including those that have been transformed into inclusive kindergartens after the management of supporting kindergartens in urban districts) pay not less than 1,660 yuan per person per month to the basic living expenses of teaching staff and staff with reference to the minimum wage standard of the three districts, the municipal financial administration will pre-allocate six-month subsidy funds in accordance with the standard of 1,000 yuan per year per student of inclusive private kindergartens to cover teachers' salaries and social insurance costs.
For non-inclusive private kindergartens that also pay not less than 1,660 yuan per month to each of the teaching staff and staff for basic living expenses, Yinchuan City will arrange six-month subsidy funds as job stabilization subsidy funds for preschool teachers in accordance with the average subsidy standard of 500 yuan per student per year.
At the same time, for private kindergartens that rent houses operated by state-owned assets, Yinchuan City will reduce and reduce the housing rent for three months during the epidemic prevention and control period, and encourage developers and other rental subjects to assume social responsibility, reduce and reduce the rent of kindergartens for more than three months, and reduce and reduce the relevant taxes and taxes in accordance with the policy.
The formation of the No. 3 flood of 2020 of the Yangtze River by the Ministry of Water Resources to elaborate and concretize the response measures
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26, by wire (reporter Hu Lu) On July 26, the Yangtze River Flood No. 3 of 2020 formed.
When presiding over the meeting on the 26th, Minister of Water Resources Huo Jingping requested that the Three Gorges Reservoir be carefully dispatched, that incoming water from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and Dongting Lake be considered in a coordinated manner, that staggered peak scheduling be implemented, that sufficient storage capacity be left to prepare for possible major floods, and that the flood control safety of the central and downstream main flow and the important dikes of Dongting Lake be ensured.
It is predicted that there will be heavy to heavy rain in parts of eastern southwest China, southern Jianghuai, western northern Jiangnan, eastern Hubei and central Guangxi in the next three days, including heavy rain in northern Hunan and southwestern Jiangsu, and moderate to heavy rain in central and western North China, including heavy rain in central Hebei.
The Ministry of Water Resources predicts that, as a result of the impact, the reservoir flow of the Three Gorges Reservoir in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River may reach about 60,000 cubic meters per second after 28 days. The water level in the middle reaches of the main stream of the Lotus Tong River and Dongting Lake will rise again and exceed the guarantee by about 0.20 meters. The water level in the middle reaches of the Huai River will generally slow down and the water level in Hongze Lake will continue to rise slowly.
Wu Jingping suggested that the Huaihe River basin should further strengthen the flood discharge, reduce the water level of Hongze Lake as soon as possible, and prepare to face the possible major flood.
We should fully do a good job in the response to rainstorms and floods in the Yilu Surabaya system.
He said that the Taihu Lake basin should not relent and continue to increase flood discharge, reduce the water level of Taihu Lake and the surrounding river network as soon as possible, and reduce the risk of high water level of Taihu Lake and typhoons.
In addition, he stressed that floods in northern regions such as Inner Mongolia and Hebei rise and fall sharply, the early warning time is short, it is easy to cause flash flood and debris flow disasters, and it is difficult to defend against them. There are many small and medium-sized reservoirs and silt dams, and there are safety hidden dangers.
More than 10 listed companies involved in the exposure of 58 APPs infringing on users' rights and interests - China New Net
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology informed that, in accordance with the Network Security Law, the Regulations on Telecommunications and the Provisions on the Protection of Personal Information of Telecommunications and Internet Users and other laws and regulations, third-party detection agencies have recently been organized to inspect mobile phone applications and urge enterprises with problems to make corrections.
The 58 APPs have problems, including private collection of personal information, overcollection of personal information, frequent application for permissions, excessive request for permissions, difficult account cancellation, private sharing to third parties, denial of permissions, etc.
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology requires that the implementation of the rectification of the 58 APPs should be completed by July 30. If the rectification is not made within the time limit, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology will organize the relevant disposal work in accordance with the rules and regulations.
It was found that behind the 58 APPs announced, more than a dozen US, Hong Kong and A-share listed companies were involved.
For example, "Fudo" is a product of Fudo, a US-listed company. There are five major problems: collecting personal information privately, collecting personal information beyond the scope, sharing it privately to third parties, forcing users to use targeted push function, and frequently applying for permission.
According to public information, Fangdo was listed on Nasdaq in November 2019 and is "the first real estate intermediary company in China with the industrial Internet SaaS (software service) model", providing online solutions for many intermediary businesses.
In response to the "Go Where" APP account cancellation problem pointed out in the circular, according to the Beijing News, Go Where responded that in order to prevent black producers from taking advantage of frequent registration and cancellation for profit, Go Where has been registered and cancelled at an interval of one month on the basis of independent cancellation.
Taking into account the convenience of write-off and account security, it has been changed to write-off with immediate effect and is currently awaiting review.
A network security expert, who did not want to be named, told a client that the Ministry of Industry Information and Communications had issued three APP notices this year.
Among them, there are three problems: private collection of personal information, excessive request for permission and difficult account cancellation.
From the circular, it can also be found that more and more attention has been paid to the invasion of privacy by APP.
On July 24, the day of the announcement of 58 APPs infringing on users' rights and interests, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said that it had issued a notice to carry out in-depth special remedial actions to promote the infringement of users' rights and interests by APPs.
The special improvement will strengthen supervision and inspection in accordance with the rules, urge relevant enterprises to strengthen the protection of APP personal information, correct and eliminate outstanding problems such as illegal collection and use of user personal information, harassment of users, deception and misleading of users, and inadequate implementation of the management responsibility of the application distribution platform in order to purify the APP application space.
Lewis family: John Lewis was "fighting for the weakest"
Congressman and civil rights fighter John Lewis was remembered at his memorial service on Saturday (July 25) as a fighter who "fought for the weakest".
Lewis' public memorial service began Saturday in Alabama.
There were two memorial services on the first day.
At a public memorial service Saturday at Troy University in Alabama, Lewis' five siblings and a nephew spoke of him as a loving, fearless, family-oriented man.
"He devoted his life to helping others," Lewis' youngest brother, Henry "Grant" Lewis, said at the meeting.
Samuel Lewis said his mother had warned John "not to get into trouble, not to get into trouble."
He added that John did not heed his mother's warning, saying, "We all know that John is always going to get into trouble, always getting into trouble, but that's because he insists on the right thing, which is a good trouble."
Lewis's brothers and sisters reminded people at the memorial service that John's most famous argument was to make "good trouble", that is, to avoid provoking trouble as long as it is for the sake of justice.
John had applied to Troy University, his birthplace in Troy, Alabama, but Troy University, then an all-white school, rejected his application.
John Lewis, who preached to chickens on his farm as a child, eventually earned a degree in religion and philosophy from Fisk University.
Years later, Troy University awarded Lewis an honorary doctorate.
Senator Doug Jones of Alabama said the current protesters are "peacefully, nonviolently protesting" as Lewis did during the civil rights movement.
Jones said: "Even if President Trump immediately turned a boat over and described all the protesters as thugs, he was wrong.
The protesters are patriots who want America to move towards a more equal country.
A six-day series of events in memory of Lewis will culminate this week with a funeral in Georgia.
Lewis' coffin was parked Saturday at a public memorial at Troy University, where people came to pay tribute to the civil rights pioneer.
Later Saturday, a private ceremony paid tribute to him in a chapel in Selma, Alabama, followed by a public memorial.
On Sunday, Lewis' body will pass over the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma.
It was in front of the bridge in 1965 that he and black voting rights protesters were beaten and tear-gassed by Alabama state police.
Lewis was almost killed.
This day became known as Bloody Sunday.
Lewis' body will be transported to Montgomery, the capital of Alabama.
Mayor Steven Reed encouraged people to line up on the sidewalk for the final walk with Lewis.
At the same time, officials require the public to wear masks and maintain social distancing when participating in events.
Alabama Governor Kay Ivey ordered flags to be flown at half-staff on Saturday and Sunday in honor of Lewis.
During the nearly week-long commemoration, Lewis' body will be briefly placed at the Alabama State Capitol in Montgomery, the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta, and the United States Capitol in Washington.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced last week that people could come to the U.S. Capitol on Monday and Tuesday to pay their respects to Lewis.
Due to the coronavirus epidemic, a public memorial to Lewis will be held outdoors.
Shenzhen Public Consultation on Issuing Health Regulations
Xinhua News Agency, Shenzhen, July 26 (Reporter Mao Siqian, Bai Yu) encourages residents to do medical check-ups diligently to detect problems as early as possible; prohibits the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors; establishes an online game health review system; employers should be equipped with full-time and part-time health managers... Recently, the Regulations on Health in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone (Consultation Draft) were officially issued, and Shenzhen residents will have their own "health law".
In order to encourage residents to do frequent medical check-ups and detect problems as early as possible, the above-mentioned consultation draft proposes that the health department should formulate a basic catalogue of health check-ups according to different age, occupation and other factors.
The health check-up expenses that fall within the scope of the basic catalogue of health check-up items shall be paid by the Social Medical Insurance Co-ordinating Fund at the rate of once per person per year.
The consultation draft makes it clear that the employing units shall rationally allocate human resources, arrange employees' working and rest hours, implement a rotation rest system for employees with heavy mental and physical labour loads, so as to avoid excessive loss of human function or injury to the health of the employees, and strictly implement the paid leave system for employees.
In addition, employers should be equipped with full-time and part-time health managers and organize regular health check-ups for employees.
With regard to the physical and mental health of minors, the consultation draft proposes that the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors is prohibited, while the location of the sale of alcoholic beverages is restricted. Those who violate the regulations will be ordered by the market supervision and administration department to make corrections and impose a fine of 30,000 yuan.
In addition to "prohibition of alcohol", minors should also "exercise more".
According to the requirements of the consultation draft, schools should arrange students' sports activities for more than one hour a day.
With regard to online games, the departments of public security, cultural, radio and television tourism and sports, network supervision, health and health should improve the health supervision system of Internet service business places, establish an online game health review system, and create a good communication space and communication culture for the healthy growth of young people.
In addition, the consultation draft also proposed that influenza patients must wear masks when entering and leaving public places, and that medical and health institutions be fined 20,000 yuan for disclosing patients' privacy without consent.
It is worth noting that, in addition to the physical and mental health of residents, the consultation draft also requires that all departments in Shenzhen should assess the impact of the implementation of public policies on the health of the population before formulating plans and normative documents relating to urban spatial planning and construction, the planning and construction of industrial parks, the exploitation and utilization of resources and ecological environmental protection, and the development of the biomedical industry, as well as approving major construction projects and implementing major public service projects.
Where it has not been evaluated or will have a more serious adverse impact on urban public health or the health of residents, it shall not be formulated, promulgated or approved for implementation.

Recently, during his visit to Jilin Province, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed the need to strengthen the Party's leadership, promote the extension of Party organizations to the grass-roots level, improve the working system of grass-roots Party organizations, and provide a strong guarantee for urban and rural community governance.
It is a fundamental requirement for the direction of governance at the grass-roots level to take the Party's construction as the lead and implement the Party's leadership in all fields and aspects of governance at the grass-roots level.
To improve the level of governance at the grass-roots level, we must adhere to the leadership of Party construction, promote the transformation of the Party's political, organizational and mass work advantages into governance advantages by strengthening political leadership, building battle bastions and pooling red forces, and transmit the Party's strength and ideas to the "nerve endings" and the "last kilometer".
Pay attention to calcium supplements and casting spirits and strengthen political leadership.
To strengthen the political leadership of governance at the grass-roots level, it is necessary to implement the "calcium supplement casting soul" project well.
We should make it a top priority to learn deeply and understand Xi Jinping's thought of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, take "not forgetting the initial heart and remembering the mission" as the eternal subject of Party construction and the lifelong subject of Party members and cadres, strengthen the reading of the original text of the original study to understand the principles, continue to promote the implementation of the Party's innovative theory through special training, batch training, seminars and exchanges, hold large lecture halls, and promote Party members and cadres to further enhance the "four senses", firmly "the" four self-confidence "and" two maintenance ", and better perform their duties.
Through the combination of online and offline learning methods, we will broaden the channels of learning and education, and guide grass-roots Party organizations and Party member cadres to truly integrate learning and education into their daily lives.
Pay attention to practical exercise, in the process of solving key and difficult problems in the field of governance at the grass-roots level, solve the troubles and troubles of the masses, and hone the Party's character and ability.
Grasp to improve the norms and build battle forts.
The grass-roots Party organization is not only an important part of the grass-roots governance system, but also an important carrier of governance ability.
In promoting the standardization construction of grass-roots Party organizations, it is necessary to start with the regulations on the work of Party branches, focus on issues such as the weakening and falsification of the leadership of Party organizations, and strengthen the foundation, make up the shortboard and promote development by establishing a joint mechanism up and down, innovating the form of setting up branches, normalizing the weak and weak rectification, establishing and improving the decision-making and deliberative mechanism and serving the masses.
In rural areas, we will strengthen the standardized construction of Party organizations at the village level, standardize organizational forms, study activities and management mechanisms in accordance with the standardized construction standards of Party branches, and effectively promote the detailed implementation of systems such as the "Three Sessions and One Course" and thematic Party day activities.
In cities, we pay attention to street communities, explore innovative forms of branch setting, focus on weak areas, "blocking points" and "pain points", and actively build urban Party construction alliances so that the Party's work can be effectively covered.
At the same time, we will establish and improve the governance system and mechanism of grass-roots governance, improve the decision-making and deliberative mechanism led by major events, practical matters, matters to be decided together, urgent matters to be discussed together, difficult matters to be solved together, and grass-roots Party organizations to improve the mechanism of Party members and cadres to contact and serve the masses, gather the hearts and minds of the people in serving the people, enhance the sense of acquisition, happiness, honor and pride of Party members, and make governance at the grass-roots level more warm.
Play a pioneering role and consolidate the red power.
Party members and cadres at the grass-roots level are the cornerstone of grass-roots governance.
To enhance the governance capacity at the grass-roots level, emphasis is placed on enhancing the governance capacity of Party members and cadres at the grass-roots level, giving full play to the exemplary and leading role of "red cells" in grass-roots governance, and consolidating red forces at the forefront of connecting and serving the masses.
We should take the improvement of governance ability as a compulsory course for Party cadres at the grass-roots level, continuously strengthen ideological hardening, professional training and practical training, carry forward the spirit of commitment in their own positions and in urgent and dangerous tasks, and consolidate the foundation and contribute to the modernization of the national governance system and governance ability.
"Community whistleblowing and Party members reporting" activities should be widely carried out to enable Party members to play a role in community governance by participating in thematic Party Day activities, contacting people in need, determining service projects, claiming small wishes and making reasonable suggestions.
We should give full play to the role of rural non-official Party members, and guide the vast majority of grass-roots Party members to take an active part in poverty eradication, ecological construction, maintaining the stability of letters and visits, and prohibiting the burning of straw to better integrate the red forces and serve the people by setting up vanguard posts for non-official Party members and forming task forces for non-official Party members.
The foundation of the building is strong.
The grass-roots Party organization is the foundation of the ruling building.
Only by adhering to the principle of closer relations between the Party and its cadres and increasing the well-being of the people, and taking the leadership of Party construction as the fundamental way to promote the innovative development of governance at the grass-roots level, can the foundation be firmly established so that grass-roots Party organizations can go out and stand up, and grass-roots Party members and cadres can catch up and move up, so as to promote governance at the grass-roots level with a "soul", order, strength and effectiveness.

Kochai Xili Tibetan antelope enters migration season
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 25, by wire (reporter Wang Jinjin) The reporter learned from the Wudaoliang Protection Station of the Kokoxili Management Office of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration, Changjiang Yuan Park, that monitoring showed that the Tibetan antelope that had previously migrated to the Zhonai Lake area in the hinterland of Kokoxili to give birth to their offspring were gradually ending their calves and began to return to their original habitat with their young.
Surveillance footage near the Wudaoliang Protection Station shows that on July 25, about 40 female Tibetan antelope led three Tibetan antelope cubs through 3002 km of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway and the Wudaoliang North Bridge of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway. The Tibetan antelope has begun to move back.
According to expert analysis, in recent years, the number of Tibetan antelope young in returning sheep accounts for a quarter to a fifth of the total number of Tibetan antelope herds.
"In the early stage of remigration, the Tibetan antelope faces a higher risk of being preyed upon, so the number of young in the sheep will be relatively small, and there may even be no young," said Lien Xinming, an associate researcher at the Northwest Plateau Institute of Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
According to the statistics of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration, the number of Tibetan antelope relocating is generally increasing year by year. In 2019, the number of Tibetan antelope relocating was 4,860, 338 more than in 2018.
"The return migration of Tibetan antelope this year is expected to end in early September, and the number of returning Tibetan antelope is still expected to continue to increase," Lien said.
The Tibetan antelope is a nationally protected animal.
At the end of May every year, Tibetan antelopes from Sanjiangyuan in Qinghai, Qiangtang in Tibet and Aljinshan in Xinjiang go to Zhonai Lake, located in the hinterland of Kokoxili, to give birth.
Wu Xiaomin, a Chinese expert on Tibetan antelope protection and researcher at the Shaanxi Provincial Institute of Zoology (Northwest Institute of Endangered Animals), said: "The return migration of Tibetan antelope is a process in which female Tibetan antelope return to their habitat with their young after giving birth. At first, the return group leaving the breeding site is relatively large, but then the Tibetan antelope will return to their respective habitat along different paths according to different geographical populations."
In order to ensure the safe return of Tibetan antelope groups, the reporter learned that the management office of the Changjiang Source Park of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration has arranged for staff to continuously carry out video monitoring and district patrols in the main return areas.
If a herd of Tibetan antelope is found trying to cross the road, the mountain patrol team will carry out temporary traffic control at the first time to allow the sheep to pass safely through the wildlife passage and ensure that they are subject to as little human interference as possible during their return migration.
So, how to relieve the heat in daily life after all?
Experts suggest that when going out in summer, it is best not to walk or work in the hot sun around noon, because the sun is strongest during this time, the likelihood of heatstroke is higher.
If you have to go out at this time, you must do a good job of protection, such as playing a sunshade, wearing a sunshade hat, wearing sunglasses, the best conditions to apply sunscreen to prevent sunburn.
Clothes as far as possible choose light color, good breathability of cotton, hemp, silk texture, wear less chemical fiber clothing, so as to avoid a lot of sweating can not dissipate heat in time, causing heatstroke.
In hot and sultry weather, be prepared to drink plenty of water, drink it in time, do not wait for thirst to drink water, because once you feel thirsty, the body is already short of water, drink water from 150 ml to 200 ml at a time, drink warm water, do not drink ice water.
Depending on the temperature, general staff drink 1.5 to 2 liters of water per day, while high-temperature workers drink 3 to 5 liters of water per day.
When sweating more, you can properly supplement some salt water to make up for the salt lost by sweating.
In addition, the human body is prone to lack of potassium in summer, making people feel tired and tired. Potassium-containing tea is an excellent summer drink.
In summer, eat more fruits and vegetables with high water content, such as lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, etc. Fresh fruits, such as peaches, apricots, watermelons and melons, with 80% to 90% water content, can be used to supplement water. Dairy products can both replenish water and meet the nutritional needs of the body.
In addition, people working in a high-temperature environment should properly supplement drinks containing potassium, magnesium and other elements.
Summer days and nights are short, the temperature is high, the human body metabolism is exuberant, the consumption is also large, easy to feel tired.
Sufficient sleep can relax the brain and all systems of the body, which is not only conducive to work and study, but also a measure to prevent heatstroke.
Experts said that the best bedtime is 22 to 23, and the best time to get up is 5: 30 to 6: 30.
When sleeping, pay attention not to lie under the air-conditioning outlet and electric fan to avoid air-conditioning disease and hot cold.
Experts suggest that people who are engaged in outdoor activities or high-temperature work can take heat prevention drugs such as 10 drops of water, human hair, patchouli Zhengqi water or patchouli Zhengqi pills with them, or put them in the nearby workplace to be used at any time to prevent heatstroke.
I want you to take a moment to consider the very simple fact that, so far, most of what we know about the universe comes from light.
We stand on the earth looking up at the night sky and can see the stars with the naked eye.
The strong sunlight is so blinding,
We can see the light reflected back from the moon,
Since Galileo aimed his humble astronomical telescope at the objects in the universe, the universe as we know it today appears before our eyes through light.
With the help of modern astronomical telescopes, we have been able to collect dazzling and silent images of the universe - a series of images dating back to the Big Bang.
However, the universe is not a silent play, because the universe is not really silent.
I want to tell you that the universe has its own soundtrack, and the universe itself is constantly playing, because space can vibrate like a drum.
So when something important happens, it can make a series of sounds to the universe.
Today, we hope to be able to give voice to this magnificent visual work about the universe.
Although we have never heard sounds from outer space, we should be able to turn up the volume and hear what's going on there over the next few years.
With the ambitious goal of capturing the sounds of the universe, we have focused on black holes and the prospects they present, because black holes can make very special sounds like a drumstick hitting the drum, and I am very pleased to play you some of the sounds we predicted.
One day we may be able to see a shadow A black hole can leave a shadow on a very bright background, but it has not yet been observed.
Although black holes cannot be seen, they can be heard because they hit space-time like a drum.
The idea that the universe can sound like a drum came from Albert Einstein, and in fact many of our ideas came from him.
Einstein realized that if the universe were empty, if the universe were empty, it would look like this picture, except for the auxiliary lines painted on it.
But if we were in free fall in the universe, even without these auxiliary lines, our trajectory would draw these lines, because we would find that we move in a straight line, crossing the universe in a straight line that does not bend.
Einstein also realized - and this is really the most crucial part (matter also means "matter") - that if you put energy and matter in the universe, the universe will bend. Objects in free fall will be deflected along the curved path in space as they pass through bodies such as the Sun.
This is Einstein's great theory of general relativity.
Even the path of light can be bent.
When the bend is large enough, it will revolve around the orbit of the sun's motion, just as the earth revolves around the sun and the moon revolves around the earth.
This is the natural curve in the universe.
But Einstein did not realize that if you compressed the sun into a ball six kilometers in diameter - that is, you compressed matter a million times the mass of the Earth into a ball six kilometers in diameter - you would create a black hole, an object so dense that if light were too close to it, it would not be able to escape - leaving a huge dark shadow in the universe.
But Einstein always believed that a black hole was just a mathematical singularity.
He did not believe in black holes.
He believed that nature would stop the formation of black holes to protect us.
It took decades before people began to use the term "black hole" and realized that black holes were real objects - in fact, they were the dead state of some very massive stars after a catastrophic collapse at the end of their lives.
Our sun does not collapse to form a black hole.
It's not really big enough.
But if we do some thought experiments - which Einstein very much liked to do - we can imagine compressing the sun to within six kilometers after it shatters and then placing a small Earth in orbit around it, such as 30 kilometers from the black hole sun.
The earth will shine on its own, because now that the sun has disappeared, we have no other source of light - so our little earth has to shine on its own.
You'll find that you can even put the Earth in orbit 30 kilometers away from the black hole and make it orbit happily.
The black hole is actually about the size of Manhattan.
It could expand to Hudson Street before it destroys Earth.
But basically that's what we're talking about.
We're talking about an object compressed to the size of half Manhattan.
So we moved the Earth close to the black hole - 30 kilometers - and we noticed that it was in a perfect orbit around the black hole.
There are some rumors that black holes will devour everything in the universe, but in fact you have to be very close to fall in.
But what is impressive is that, from our perspective, we can always see the Earth.
It cannot hide behind a black hole.
Some of the light emitted from the Earth falls into the black hole, but some is bent by the black hole and seen by us.
So you can't hide anything behind a black hole.
If this is a story in Battlestar Galactica and you're fighting the Cylons, don't hide behind a black hole.
They can see you.
Our sun does not collapse into a black hole; it is not massive enough, but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
If one of them were engulfing the Milky Way, it would look like this.
We will see the shadow of a black hole cast on hundreds of billions of stars in the Milky Way and the dust belt illuminated by the stars.
If we fall into the black hole, we will see light refracted around the black hole, and we will not even feel that some huge changes are happening quietly as we begin to enter the shadow.
If we try to start the rocket and get out of there, it won't be good because we can't escape, not even the light.
Although black holes are dark from the outside, this is not the case from the inside, because the light of all galaxies can fall into the black hole with us.
And even so, due to the relativistic time dilation effect, our clocks seem to slow down compared to the time of the Milky Way, which looks as if the outside galaxy is accelerating change, just before we ourselves are destroyed by a black hole.
It's like experiencing the feeling of dying. You see the light at the end of the tunnel, but it's a complete death experience.
(Laughter) You can't tell anyone you saw light at the end of the tunnel.
So far, we have never seen the shadow of such a black hole, but black holes can be heard, even if they cannot be seen.
Imagine, in a real astronomical scenario - imagine two black holes that have been together for a long time.
Perhaps they used to be stars and then collapsed into two black holes - each 10 times the mass of the Sun.
Now we've compressed them to within 60 kilometers.
They can rotate hundreds of times per second.
At the end of their lives, they approach each other at the speed of light.
Thousands of kilometers can be crossed in a fraction of a second. In the process, they not only bend space, but also vibrate space in the wake, a real space-time wave.
Black holes squeeze and stretch space when they collide with the universe.
These vibrations travel through space at the speed of light.
The computer simulation was done by NASA's Goddard Relativity Group.
It took nearly 30 years to solve this problem.
This is one of many groups.
It shows two black holes rotating around each other, and these are imaginary curves.
As you can see - it may be a little fuzzy - you can see red waves being emitted, and these are gravitational waves.
They are real cosmic sounds that will travel out of these black holes at the speed of light as they fuse with each other until the two black holes merge into a quietly rotating black hole.
If you stand close enough, your ears will resonate with the squeezing and stretching of these spaces.
You can really hear these sounds with your own ears.
Of course, you will helplessly find your head squeezed and stretched, so you may not be able to understand what's going on.
But I'd like to play the sound of our prediction for you.
This is the work of my team - a relatively simple computational model.
Imagine a less massive black hole falling into a more massive black hole.
The sound you hear comes from the collision of a small black hole with space as it approaches the massive black hole.
If they are far away, the sound will be very low.
But gradually the sound becomes like a drumstick hitting the space, making the space vibrate like a drum.
We can predict what this sound will become.
We know that small black holes become faster and louder as they fall.
Eventually, we will hear the small black hole fall completely into the large black hole.
I've never felt the sound so loud - it's actually amplified here.
When listening at home, I think the sound is a little weak.
Sounds like, Ding, Ding.
This is another sound that our research team simulated.
I won't show you images here, because black holes don't leave any useful traces, and real space won't show you those virtual curves.
But if you hear this sound while on vacation in the universe, I suggest you run.
(Laughter) It's best to stay away from the sound.
Both black holes are moving.
Two black holes are approaching each other.
In this case, they are all shaking violently.
They will then be integrated.
That sharp sound is a sign of black hole fusion - when fusion ends, there is a sharp sound.
This is our prediction of what we will see.
Fortunately, we are very safe in Long Beach, California.
There is no doubt that two black holes have merged somewhere in the universe.
There is also no doubt that the space around us can also feel these vibrations across a million light-years, or from a million years ago, which travel at the speed of light and eventually meet us.
But the sounds are so small that we can't hear them at all.
Some experiments around the world take a lot of effort to build - including one called LIGO, which will be able to detect space vibrations of less than one nuclear range every four kilometers.
This is a very bold attempt, and its sensitivity will not be exceeded in the next few years - it will be used to detect space vibrations.
Another research project on the universe is expected to start within the next decade, called LISA.
LISA will be able to see supermassive black holes - those millions or even billions of times the mass of the Sun.
From the Hubble images, we see these two galaxies.
It looked like they were in a silent embrace.
They may each have a massive superblack hole at their center.
But they are not static; they are actually merging.
The two black holes will collide, and their fusion will take billions of years.
So collecting the sounds they make is beyond the limits of our human perception.
But LISA can see the final stages of two supermassive black holes that began to fuse long ago, 15 minutes before their fusion.
This detection is not limited to black holes. It can also be used to detect any large disturbance in the universe - the largest of which is the Big Bang.
When the term was coined, some people mocked and said, "Oh, who would believe in the Big Bang?"
This animated short, produced by my friends at Proton Studios, shows the Big Bang from the outside.
We would never want this to be true; we want to be inside the universe, because there is no such thing as being outside the universe.
So imagine you're in the middle of a big explosion.
The universe is everywhere, everything in the world surrounds you, and space swings in a disorderly manner.
Fourteen billion years have passed, and the sound still haunts us.
Gradually galaxies form, and groups of stars form in galaxies. On a given planet, there is at least one such planet, suitable for life.
Here, we frantically build experiments, do calculations, and write computer code.
Imagine, a billion years ago, two black holes collided.
The sound has been traveling through space and time.
We're not even here.
It's getting closer and closer - 40,000 years ago, we were painting on the stone walls of the cave.
If the sound we were trying to get was from the Big Bang, it would sound like this.
Strictly speaking, it is noise.
It was a white noise, a chaotic bell.
But it is everywhere around us, as long as it is not offset by some other process in the universe.
If we can detect these sounds, it will be like music to our ears, because the quiet echo comes from the moment we were created, from the universe we look up at in the distance.
So in the next few years, we will be able to turn up the volume of these scores a little bit and present the universe to us in audio form.
But if we can detect those earliest moments, it will also take us a step closer to understanding the Big Bang, allowing us to ask some of the most difficult and elusive questions.
If we play the history of the universe backwards, we can know that there has been a Big Bang in the past, and we can even hear its noisy sound, but is our Big Bang the only Big Bang in the universe?
I mean, we can't help but ask, has there been a similar big explosion before that?
Will it happen again in the future?
I would like to say that if the significance of this question rises to the level of rethinking advocated by TED, at least in this last minute, we can ask some questions that we may indeed never answer.
But we can't help but ask: Will our universe be just an episode in a larger history?
Or will we be just one branch of the multiverse - each of which has experienced its own Big Bang - maybe some of them have buzzing black holes, maybe some don't - maybe some have conscious life, maybe some don't - they don't belong to our past, they don't exist in our future, but are connected to us in some way?
Therefore, we cannot help but guess that if there is a multiverse, is there life in other branches of this multiverse?
This is life in our multiverse.
Are there other life in the multiverse, and will they also be speculating about our existence, thinking about their own origins?
If so, I can imagine them, like us, doing calculations, writing computer code, building experimental instruments, trying to detect the faint sounds from their origins, and wondering who else was there.
Thank you. Thank you all.

Graduates' art exhibition moves into shopping mall public welfare exhibition - Xinhua
In the "cloud graduation" season of major colleges, a rare offline graduate art exhibition opened warm last weekend.
However, it is neither in the art gallery nor on campus, but in the public space of Dayue City in Chaoyang, which is open to the public free of charge and will last until August 23.
The reporter learned that the art exhibition of 2020 graduates collected 50 works / groups of 57 young artists from the Central Academy of Fine Arts, the Communication University of China and the Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts. The exhibition space was extended from 2 to 6 floors, and made full use of the light box in the building for the display of graphic works to maximize the artistic atmosphere of the graduation season.
The significance of this exhibition is particularly special under the epidemic.
Ge Ping, head of Chaoyang Dayue Chengmei Chen, said: "We choose to bring the graduation exhibition to the 'cloud end' back to the offline space again. We also hope to let more people see young people's exploration of themselves and their understanding of the world, and to amplify the healing power of art to society and the soul."
She revealed that the works participating in the exhibition were solicited from the graduates of several major art colleges and selected those suitable for commercial space display. The forms of the works range from traditional shelf painting and sculpture to new media devices, interactive animation and VR panorama, with the highest volume and richness in years.
Among them, in "The First Battle of 2020", Li Yunshao expressed his feelings in the epidemic through a mixture of mechanical and manual creative language; Liu Jiaying's work "Sound Money", created through Ethereum blockchain, discusses themes such as "cryptocurrency", "credit creation" and "transaction"; Zhang Jiaqi's "Cat Forest" and Qiu Daqiang's "Bohemian" show animals that often accompany humans, in which young artists can see their understanding of the relationship between people and animals; and Zhu Zhongyu's work "Winter of Faith - Gift" reminds young people growing up, "When you have a successful career one day, remember that simplicity and sincerity."
Among the few graduates who personally arranged the exhibition was Li Jingyin from the Department of Sculpture of Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts.
"I came to Beijing on July 7, when I was actually a little worried about the epidemic. I also did a nucleic acid test three days in advance. I came to the exhibition with alcohol cotton and the test report."
His work "Yesterday as a Mystery" has a complex structure and must be done in person.
At the same time, he also undertook the task of helping his classmates repair damaged works.
"The cloth was displayed until 4: 30 a.m., then it was repaired. The time was very tight, and I forgot to take a picture with the work, which was also a bit regrettable."
He hopes that when the epidemic is more stable, he and his classmates will come to Beijing to see the exhibition of his works.

That morning, Bolsonaro, 65, tweeted a photo of him in sneakers and without a mask, sitting at a table with breakfast, smiling, thumbs up in one hand and holding up a box of hydroxychloroquine in the other.
He tweeted: "Good morning everyone! Corona virus test results: negative."
However, Bolsonaro did not say when the test was conducted.
On July 5, Bolsonaro developed symptoms of new pneumonia, tested positive for the virus on July 6, and on July 7, he announced via live television that he had been diagnosed with new pneumonia.
On the 14th and 21st, Bolsonaro was tested twice for the new crown virus, and the results were still positive.
During his quarantine, Bolsonaro repeatedly demonstrated the hydroxychloroquine drug he was taking through social media live broadcasts, and said that hydroxychloroquine had a good effect on new crown pneumonia, that he felt good after taking it, that his good health was due to hydroxychloroquine, and that Brazilian medical institutions should use hydroxychloroquine to treat new crown pneumonia.
According to Brazilian media reports, so far, five cabinet ministers and 10 state governors have been diagnosed with the new pneumonia.
A small plane crashed in the Swiss Alps, killing all four people on board.
On July 25, local time, the Swiss police informed the media that a small plane had crashed in the Swiss Alps on July 25.
All two Swiss and two Austrians on board were killed in the accident.
According to reports, Wallis police in southern Switzerland stated that a small plane crashed at an altitude of more than 3,000 meters near an Alpine mountain in Valais. Rescuers rushed to the crash scene and confirmed that all four people on board were killed.
Valais police said the witness called the police at 12: 25 p.m. on the 25th to report that he witnessed a small plane crash from the sky.
A few minutes later, witnesses again informed police that smoke was billowing from the crash site.
After receiving the alarm, the police quickly coordinated fire officers, medical and rescue personnel and rushed to the scene of the accident by helicopter.
When rescuers arrived at the crash site, they found that all four people on board had been killed.
Police verified that the victims in the accident included two Swiss, aged 50 and 66, and two Austrians, aged 46 and 50.
The police said that at present, the police are cooperating with the Swiss Transport Safety Investigation Commission to jointly investigate the cause of the crash.
Yellow and orange flood warnings issued after heavy rain in 33 districts and counties in Chongqing

Reward 50,000 Yuan Hubei for "First Person of Early Warning" for Sand Dam Landslide
Hubei Daily News (reporter Lin Jing) On July 26, the city of Enshi commended Chen Guangming, the geological disaster site monitor who had made an important contribution to the early warning of sand dam landslide, and sent him a prize of 50,000 yuan.
At the same time, Party members and cadres throughout the city are called upon to learn from his spirit of dedication, courage, initiative and dedication.
On July 21, a landslide occurred at the sand dam in Ma Village, Tunburg Township, Enshi City, leading to the formation of a barrier lake in the main channel of the Qingjiang River. Chen Guangming, 58, was the first person to warn of the landslide.
On the afternoon of July 17, Chen Guangming learned of the cracked walls of the villagers' homes and immediately went to the scene to inspect them.
As soon as he walked out of his home, he saw the village road split four or five centimeters, extending along the road to the cornfield, about 50 meters long.
Chen Guangming Tang Sheng alert, the first time to send the photos of the road cracking to the township "geological disaster monitor contact group."
After the site inspection and judgment of the relevant person-in-charge of the Tunpu Township Nature Planning Institute, the possibility of the landslide was great, and then the decision to evacuate the masses was made.

The new drug developed by the University of Australia is expected to be used to treat the blockage of blood vessels caused by the new crown.
Xinhua News Agency Sydney, July 26 (Reporter Chen Yu) Researchers at Monash University in Australia are developing a new drug to help prevent heart disease and stroke and hope it can be used to treat blood vessel blockages caused by the new crown virus.
The researchers found that an enzyme in platelets accelerates platelet clotting before a heart attack or stroke.
As a result, they developed a drug that temporarily inhibits platelet clotting, thereby avoiding clogging blood vessels and preventing heart disease and stroke.
The researchers said the drug only inhibits the clotting effect of platelets when there are signs of a heart attack or stroke.
Since studies have shown that similar vascular blockages are one of the leading causes of death in severely ill patients, the researchers hope the drug can be used to treat such patients in the future.
At present, the drug has achieved good results in animal model experiments, and the researchers are ready to conduct human clinical trials in the next stage.
The research results have been published in the American journal Science and Transformative Medicine.
He became the first spectator to enter the CBA league to allow spectators to watch live after the game.
On the same day, during the second stage of the resumption of the Chinese Men's Professional Basketball League (CBA) of the 2019-2020 season (Laoshan Competition Area) held in Qingdao, Shandong Province, medical staff, teachers and members of the public security front entered the field after completing the relevant procedures, including nucleic acid testing, through the official ticket purchase platform to watch the match between the Shanghai Jiuzhi team and the Shandong Xiwang team.
During the viewing period, spectators are required to wear masks throughout the course, sit opposite numbers and strictly maintain one-meter intervals.
When exiting, the audience must exit in order to maintain the "one-meter line" social distance according to the order from back to front, first to two sides and then to the middle.
Good Clean Energy for Deep Cultivation of "Sunflower Field" in Xinjiang

China News Agency, July 26, Hami, Xinjiang: Use good clean energy for deep cultivation of "sunflower fields" in Xinjiang
More than 6,000 pentagonal sunsetting mirrors, each 48 square meters, are arranged neatly in a circle, such as a silver "sunflower field", which rotates with the sun and reflects sunlight to the central 200-meter-high heat-absorbing tower to generate electricity.
The reporter saw this scene on the 25th at the Hami molten salt tower photothermal power station of the China Electric Power Project in the town of Maohu, Ywu County, Hami City, Xinjiang.
"The so-called molten salt tower photothermal power generation is to reflect sunlight centrally through the mirror to the heat absorbing tower to form heat, and then convert heat into electricity through traditional power generation technology."
Zhang Yong, deputy general manager of CLP Hami Solar Thermal Power Generation Co., Ltd. introduced that the design principle is similar to that of the solar cookers used in rural areas in northwest China, which should concentrate sunlight.
Construction of the power plant began in October 2017 and was connected to the grid at the end of last year, covering an area of 6,600 acres, with a total plan to install 14,500 sunsetting mirrors.
"The biggest advantage over traditional solar power generation technology is that it can store the accumulated heat and generate electricity at night."
Zhang Yong said that the 13-hour heat storage system deployed in the project can enable the generator sets to maintain continuous and stable operation, not affected by light changes, and can also quickly participate in the peak adjustment of the grid according to the peak and valley demand of the grid load.
After its complete completion, the project will generate 198 million degrees of electricity per year, save more than 60,000 tons of standard coal per year, reduce emissions of more than 60 tons of sulphur dioxide, more than 60 tons of nitrogen oxides, about 20 tons of soot and more than 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide, and provide a continuous supply of clean energy to the local area.
In addition, there is another silver "sunflower field" in the Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park in Hami City.
The Hamifuguang Solar Photovoltaic Power Station covers an area of more than 2,300 acres. The 714 power generation equipment built also follows the rotation of the sun, always maintaining a right angle between the sun and the concentrated plate surface of 90 degrees.
"We use two-axis tracking concentrated power generation technology. Through unified integrated control, all power generation equipment will adjust the angle according to the height of the sun to maintain the power generation efficiency."
Duan Mengqi, the station director of the power station, said that under good light weather conditions, the power generation technology can improve the efficiency of photovoltaic power generation by about 20% compared with traditional photovoltaic power generation.
In the first half of this year, the power station has generated more than 7 million degrees of electricity, supplementing the local demand for electricity.
Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park is currently the largest single-scale photovoltaic industrial demonstration park with the most complete types of photovoltaic components in Xinjiang, with a total of 38 photovoltaic power generation projects with a total installed capacity of 820,000 kilowatts.
The amount of electricity generated in the first half of this year exceeded 110 million degrees, an increase of 6% over the same period in 2019.
Hami is one of the regions with the best solar energy resources in China.
The average annual total solar radiation is more than 6,200 megajoules per square meter, and the annual sunshine hours are about 3,200 hours.
In recent years, the city has vigorously developed the photovoltaic industry and planted "sunflower fields".
More than 2.5 million kilowatts of solar power have been installed, and the city's photovoltaic power generation in the first half of this year exceeded 1.4 billion degrees, an increase of about 14 per cent over the previous year.
At present, more than 330 grid-connected photovoltaic power stations in Xinjiang have an installed capacity of more than 10 million kilowatts.
The total amount of photovoltaic power generation is expected to reach 15 billion degrees this year, which can replace more than 6 million tons of standard coal.
Police report details of "missing female university students traveling to Qinghai" search and rescue work continues - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 26, by wire (reporter Wang Jin Jin Zhou) Recently, "a female college student lost contact after traveling to Germ in Qinghai" attracted the attention of netizens.
The Public Security Bureau of Germu City, Hainan Mongolian Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, informed on the 26th that Huang Mou, a student at a university in Nanjing, is still in the state of disconnection, and many police are actively looking for work along the lost area of Huang Mo.
On July 10, 2020, the Public Security Detachment of the Public Security Bureau of Haiyangermu City received notification from its superiors that Huang Mou, a student of a Nanjing university, took the Z164 train from Nanjing to Germu on July 5, and on July 9, his mobile phone was turned off and lost contact at the southwest area of Qingshuihe Protection Station in Quemalai County, Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, requesting assistance in locating him.
According to the investigation of the Germ City Public Security Bureau, Huang entered the territory of Qinghai Province at 19: 54 on July 6, and arrived in Germ City at 4: 00 on July 7.
At 8: 00 on the same day, the missing person, Huang Mou, took a taxi from the Yellow River Hotel in Germ City to the G109 National Highway, and at 12: 00 he arrived at the Ke Xili Sonandajie Protection Station. The taxi driver returned alone, and Huang Mou went to the Qingshui River area near the Sonandajie Protection Station at 15: 00 on the 7th until his plane was shut down in the area at about 18: 00 on the 9th.
In further investigation, the police found that Huang had passed through the Naigou checkpoint at 17: 07 on July 13.
Naigou Checkpoint is a checkpoint set up by Naqu City of the Tibet Autonomous Region in the South Pass of Germ City. Since there is no video surveillance at the checkpoint, it is impossible to determine the information of myself and the vehicle in which I am travelling. The police can only drive along the way to search, and coordinate with the checkpoints along the way in Tibet. If Huang is found, immediately contact the Germ City Public Security Bureau.
According to the latest situation, at 1 a.m. on July 26, the Germ City Public Security Bureau organized rescue forces to carry rescue equipment to the Unfrozen Spring Protection Station and the Sonam Dajie Protection Station along the Qinghai-Tibet Highway to conduct a search, and actively contacted the Sichuan Police, the Tibet Police and the Nanjing Police to carry out joint work. At present, the search and rescue work is still continuing.
The local police hope that if the vast number of netizens and all sectors of society have relevant clues, they will provide them to the Germ police and the Jiangning police in Nanjing in a timely manner, so as to try to find the lost member Huang Mou and Mou as soon as possible.
At the same time, relevant experts suggest that tourists should be standardized, rational and civilized in outdoor activities, pay attention to roadside warning signs at all times, do not venture into no man's land, encounter unexpected situations, call the police in time.
American media has uncovered the truth about the US unprovoked demand for China to close its Consulate General in Houston.

The American media uncovered the truth about the US unprovoked demand that China close its Consulate General in Houston
On the 24th, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the US Embassy in China that China had decided to revoke the permission for the establishment and operation of the US Consulate General in Chengdu, and made a specific request for the Consulate General to stop all business and activities, as a countermeasure to the US sudden request for China to close the Consulate General in Houston on the 21st.
This act of the US government has attracted much attention, and its political motivation has been questioned by the foreign media and scholars.
Why ask China to close the Consulate General?
Several foreign media said it was not clear why the United States would select the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, but for the purpose of the move, the foreign media said bluntly: for the election.
CNN (CNN) reported on the 23rd that the US demanded that China close its Consulate General in Houston, prompting the public to question its political motives.
The article said that the US government's disastrous response to the new epidemic resulted in President Trump's low poll approval rating before the election.
White House officials privately say the tough approach to China is intended to save Trump's approval ratings and to deflect responsibility for the White House's failure to respond to the pandemic.
The article argued that the Chinese Consulate General in Houston was a "politically driven and very cautious" target chosen by the United States, and that the US government chose it "to create a tough attitude while avoiding the risk of causing a major conflict".
The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) agreed that, as the US election season approaches and the US economy is severely hit by the pandemic, Trump believes that "playing the 'China card' has a political advantage".
The current situation is "a spiraling and tit-for-tat struggle", which is partly driven by the US government from the perspective of domestic considerations, and will only exacerbate the tension between China and the United States.
CBS (CBS) reported that Trump's re-election prospects are under pressure due to the outbreak, which he has repeatedly blamed on China.
Almost every day, the United States takes new action against Trump's absurd claim that "China exploits the United States".
"The Consulate General of Houston is very important in establishing contacts between the two countries."
The Associated Press commented that the US demand that China close its consulate-general in Houston has exacerbated tensions between the world's two largest economies.
In addition to the diplomatic implications of the closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, Chinese citizens in the southern United States face difficulties in obtaining consular services, as do American citizens seeking visas and other services.
A Houston business group expressed regret that the United States had asked China to close its Consulate General in Houston, saying the Consulate General had played an important role in establishing trade, investment and cultural ties between the two countries.
The Associated Press believes this reflects the importance of China's economy.
The website of the US magazine Foreign Policy said the US move was "part of a series of provocative measures that will only worsen US-China relations."
Reuters quoted Jonathan Pollack, an expert on East Asia at the Brookings Institution, a US think tank, as saying that since the US and China established full diplomatic relations in 1979, he could think of no action comparable to the US action against the Chinese Consulate General in Houston.
The Hong Kong South China Morning Post reported that the US move is unprecedented in more than 40 years of diplomatic relations between China and the United States.
Analysts believe the move could cause lasting damage.
Established in 1979, the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is the first Chinese Consulate General to be opened in the United States.
At present, China has one embassy and five consulates general in the United States.

After the outbreak of the epidemic, Tianshan Mountain invested a total of more than 1.05 million yuan in the first time, which was urgently allocated to 23 grass-roots trade unions directly under its authority.
After receiving the company's notice on epidemic prevention and control, Zhao Xiangguo, deputy secretary of the Party committee and chairman of the trade union of China Construction Xinjiang Construction Industry, chose to stay on duty and escort the workers.
He sent cooking utensils, food and daily necessities to live in unit dormitories and new employees, and organized personnel to send them necessary supplies for life every two days.
"From July 21, cadres and workers who adhere to the front line of the fight against the 'epidemic' were surveyed, and by means of online orders and door-to-door delivery by businesses, the masses of 704 front-line workers in Urumqi were first replenished with anti-epidemic supplies and living materials."
The head of the Xinjiang Transportation and Transportation Union told reporters that, in the face of the sudden epidemic, they made every effort to do a good job in the service guarantee of epidemic prevention and control, steadily promoted all aspects of transportation development, and created a strong atmosphere of fighting the "epidemic" together.
At present, during the summer heat, trade unions at all levels pay close attention to front-line workers in key areas of epidemic prevention and control, and put "send cool" care into practice.
On July 19, the Urumqi County Federation of Trade Unions launched a "send cool" sympathy campaign to frontline workers in epidemic prevention and control, and police stations, card points and health systems throughout the county received drinks, fruits and other comfort items.
"Trade union cadres should further enhance their political position, strengthen their responsibility, warm their hearts with care and encourage their fighting spirit with actions.

The relevant head of the General Trade Union of the Autonomous Region said.
Direct recruitment of non-commissioned officers will be fully launched in 2020
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 (Reporter Jia Qilong) The Political Work Department of the Military Commission and the National Defense Mobilization Department of the Military Commission recently jointly issued a notice to start the direct recruitment of non-commissioned officers from graduates of ordinary institutions of higher learning in 2020.
The direct recruitment of non-commissioned officers this year covers more than 270 general military and local specialties in 64 categories, such as computers, automation and machinery, with emphasis on increasing the recruitment of specialties such as drones, navigation, aerospace, electronic information and small languages, with an increase of nearly 2,000 compared with last year.
This year, the direct recruitment of non-commissioned officers was organized and implemented in parallel with the recruitment of conscripts, which began on August 1 and ended on September 30.
Young conscripts can check the conditions for direct recruitment of non-commissioned officers and the distribution of local recruitment specialties through the National Conscription Network (http: / / www.gfbzb.gov.cn), submit online registration information if they meet the professional scope and recruitment conditions, and participate in follow-up recruitment work such as medical examination and political examination in accordance with the uniform requirements of the military service organs of the places where they are recruited.
Qualified young people who cannot be recruited as non-commissioned officers due to the professional and planned restrictions on recruitment may participate in the conscription of conscripts. When they are selected as non-commissioned officers at the end of their compulsory military service, the number of years of study in the prescribed academic system of ordinary institutions of higher learning shall be treated as the length of military service.
This year, the recruitment of non-commissioned officers will be uniformly organized by the conscription offices of the people's governments at the provincial or municipal levels. The majors with rich registration potential will be selected on the basis of merit on the basis of a comprehensive measurement of the educational level of the applicants, the achievements of professional courses during the school period, and the acquisition of vocational qualification certificates. The scarce majors will be directed to local institutions that meet the professional requirements and have recruitment advantages.
In accordance with the requirements of normalizing epidemic prevention and control, this year's direct recruitment of non-commissioned officers will not, in principle, arrange for their own reporting, and will organize transportation into the camp at the same time as conscripts.
The time for direct recruitment of non-commissioned officers into the army will start from September 1, 2020, and the time for the army to issue the order for the appointment of non-commissioned officers will be December 1, 2020.
The receiving units of the armed forces will formulate plans for enlistment and professional training scientifically and carefully organize the delivery of training. After the completion of the training, the recruited non-commissioned officers will be uniformly and accurately assigned to the corresponding professional and technical posts in accordance with the principle of professional matching and uniform recruitment.
A spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in the UK: The Chinese Government is a staunch defender of cybersecurity.
China News Network, July 26: According to the website of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom answered questions on the wrong remarks about the cyber attack on July 25.
The spokesman stressed that the Chinese Government is a staunch defender of cybersecurity and has always resolutely opposed and combated any form of cyberattacks and cybercrime.
A reporter asked: According to the media, hacker groups related to China have interfered with the network system of a British company, launched an attack on Anglo-American technology companies with patent data, and invaded the government networks of European Union countries.
The spokesman said that the Chinese Government is a staunch defender of cybersecurity and has always resolutely opposed and combated any form of cyberattacks and cybercrime.
Cyberspace has strong virtuality, difficult traceability and diverse actors. When investigating and characterizing cyberincidents, sufficient evidence should be produced, and there should be no unfounded speculation.
The spokesman said that a series of incidents such as "Prism Gate" in the past proved that the United States has been conducting the largest network theft operation in the world.
Maintaining peace and stability in cyberspace is in the common interest of all countries.
The spokesman pointed out that China's achievements in science, technology and innovation were not stolen or stolen, but achieved through self-reliance and hard work.
In 2019, China submitted about 59,000 patent applications through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), with an annual growth rate of 10.6 per cent, making it the country with the largest number of international patent applications.
China has become a big country in innovation and intellectual property.
Data from the Urumqi Central Branch of the People's Bank of China show that in the first half of the year, the increase in new loans for agriculture-related and small and micro enterprises in Xinjiang exceeded the increase for the whole of 2019.
In the first half of this year, the Urumqi Central Sub-branch of the People's Bank of China used a variety of monetary policy tools to guide the banking sector to continuously increase its loan investment, and provided sufficient funds for epidemic prevention and control and the resumption of work and production.
Most free nucleic acid testing areas in Urumqi have basically completed secondary testing in high-risk areas.
Urumqi, July 26 (reporter Sun Tingwen Zhao Yarmin) Zhang Wei, director of the Urumqi Municipal Health Commission, said on July 26 that the work of free nucleic acid testing in Urumqi has been basically completed in most districts of the city.
The expert group of the State Council and experts from the autonomous region and the city of Urumqi are further evaluating the development of the epidemic based on the results of nucleic acid testing and epidemiological investigation.
The Press Office of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region held a press conference on the 26th to report on the epidemic and prevention and control in Xinjiang.
According to him, from 00: 00 to 24: 00 on July 25, there were 22 new confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia in Urumqi (of which 5 were transferred to confirmed cases by asymptomatic infected persons) and 38 new asymptomatic infected persons.
As of 24: 00 on July 25, there were 135 confirmed cases and 147 asymptomatic infections in Urumqi.
The new asymptomatic infected people on the 25th were also basically through the city's free nucleic acid testing and active screening.
Zhang Wei, director of the Urumqi Municipal Health Commission, said on the 26th that most of the free nucleic acid testing in Urumqi had been basically completed.
He also said that from the experience of other parts of China, there are many factors that affect the results of nucleic acid testing, such as the sensitivity of the testing reagent, the time of infection and detoxification of the tested person, the cooperation of the tested person when the specimen was taken (the poor cooperation may lead to the specimen not being taken in place), the testing environment and the operational proficiency of the inspectors.
For various reasons, nucleic acid tests can also produce false negative results.
The so-called false negative means that the person tested is indeed infected, but the nucleic acid test result is negative.
In addition, for people who have had close contact with confirmed and suspected cases, two nucleic acid tests are usually needed to exclude them.
For people who have been to high-risk areas in the epidemic, if fever and respiratory symptoms occur, one negative nucleic acid test may be false negative, so two nucleic acid tests are also needed to exclude.
He said that, in view of the above situation, and for the sake of the health of the people of the whole city, from today, the city of Urumqi will conduct second free nucleic acid tests in key areas such as Tianshan District and Shaybak District, while carrying out "residue detection and leak filling".
It is reported that Tianshan District and Shaybak District are high risk areas.
Streamlining "Cloud" Offline Warm Shanghai International Film Festival Reveals Uncommon Industry Confidence
2020-07-26 06: 52: 39 Source: Wen Report Author: Wang Sisuo Responsible Editor: Wang Sisuo
Offline streamlining "on the cloud" is enthusiastic, and the Shanghai International Film Festival reveals unusual industrial confidence
This newspaper (Chief Reporter Wang Yan) yesterday, the 2020 Shanghai International Film and Television Festival, held under the background of strict epidemic prevention measures, opened the curtain of the 23rd Shanghai International Film Festival with an industrial summit forum on "comprehensively pursuing a well-off and building a new era of dreams".
As the first international film and television festival to be held since the global epidemic continued to spread and China's epidemic prevention and control became normal, this year's Shanghai International Film Festival is of great significance.
On the basis of doing a good job in normalizing the work of epidemic prevention and control, holding the Shanghai International Film and Television Festival is not only a sign of confidence, but also a declaration of determination - our confidence and determination to overcome the epidemic will remain unchanged, our confidence and determination to run the people's festival well will remain unchanged, and our confidence and determination to build a global film and television creation center and launch the "Shanghai Culture" brand will remain unchanged.
Every year's Shanghai International Film Festival, with continuous innovation and progress, is a fresh start.
Therefore, it is necessary to take every step to serve the spiritual life of the people and the high-quality development of the film and television industry.
This is particularly true this year.
In order to cherish the hard-won situation of epidemic prevention and control, the Shanghai International Film Festival, on the one hand, strictly abides by the requirements of epidemic prevention and control and details the implementation of epidemic prevention and control measures. On the other hand, with the vision of gathering wisdom for Chinese film creation and meeting the needs of film fans, the Shanghai International Film Festival opened multi-plate activities online and offline.
On the opening day, the related activities of the film festival strictly implemented the relevant epidemic prevention policies, from offline viewing to industry forums.
Forum activities are limited to 50 people, and attendance is strictly limited to 30%.
As the film festival organizing committee maintains, in any case, "putting the people's lives and health first" is the main premise.
Offline activities have been greatly streamlined, and "on the cloud" has been lively.
In order to implement the important concept of "the people's city is built by the people, the people's city is for the people", and as a festival for the people, this year's Shanghai International Film Festival is innovative and seeking transformation, using measures such as online "cloud screening" and "cloud sharing" of master classes to meet the diverse needs of film fans.
On the opening day of the festival, the official partners of the festival, Migou Video and Oriental Pearl Hundred Television, respectively, will give back to fans a number of "Belt and Road" films.
That evening, the opening forum of Jin Jie and Jia Zhangke Master Class were also launched on a number of platforms such as Central Video, Learning Power, Wenhui App, so that people can follow the latest trends of Chinese films without leaving their homes.
At the opening forum yesterday, Yan Xiaoming, a member of the party group and deputy director of the Central Radio and Television Station, delivered a speech and announced the opening of the film festival, Zhou Huilin, a member of the Standing Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Committee and Minister of Propaganda, delivered a speech, and Vice Mayor Zong Ming attended.
White House epidemic expert Fauci: Cautiously optimistic that a vaccine will be developed by early 2021
Fauci said in an online video conference hosted by the International Leadership Foundation on the 25th.
He cautioned that it was not clear how the new epidemic would develop in the autumn and winter, nor what the ultimate impact of the epidemic would be, and that "the only way to end it is for each of us to choose to be part of the solution."
According to Johns Hopkins University, as of 21: 00 on May 25, the number of new confirmed cases in the United States had reached 4.176 million, with 146,000 deaths.
Fauci said some parts of the United States are now struggling with a rebound in the epidemic.
Although the epidemic is different from place to place and needs to be adapted to local conditions, the diversity of anti-epidemic strategies does not mean that there is no close link between regions.
An outbreak in one region will eventually affect others.

Brazilian study shows that hydroxychloroquine is ineffective in the treatment of mild to moderate new crown pneumonia.
Recently, a Brazilian study showed that hydroxychloroquine was ineffective in patients with mild to moderate new crown pneumonia.
The study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
The Pakistani researchers divided 667 patients from 55 hospitals across the country into three groups and conducted clinical trials to compare the therapeutic effects of hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with other antibiotics azithromycin, and to analyze whether it helped to improve the condition of patients with mild and moderate new crown pneumonia.
The results show that hydroxychloroquine not only has no therapeutic effect, but may have damaging side effects on organs.
The study was carried out by several leading Brazilian hospitals such as Hospital Israeli Albert Einstein, Cardiology Hospital (HCor), Hospital Sírio-Libanês in Syria, in conjunction with the Brazilian Clinical Institute (BCRI) and the Brazilian Intensive Care Research Network (BRICnet).
On the 25th local time, Brazilian President Bolsonaro announced through social platforms that the fourth nucleic acid test result was negative.

On the 25th, the 2020 Hunan Red Tourism and Culture Festival and the first Xiangtan Red Cultural Industry Expo opened in Shaoshan.
In recent years, the demand for red tourism has gradually increased.
However, the development of the red tourism industry is also faced with difficulties such as the small number of young groups, the homogenization of tour projects and the single commercialization channel.
In particular, the epidemic hit this year, the national cultural and travel industry suffered a serious setback, and the red tourist attractions also faced serious challenges.
For example, the use of technological means such as drone photography and VR immersion experience can meet the tourist demand of "no one has arrived and the scenery has arrived"; the introduction of live webcasting means to promote the famous and special products of red scenic spots can directly enhance the economic benefits of red tourism; the introduction of "cloud" technology to create a display of fine products with prominent themes, clear guidance and rich connotation to fully display and enhance the educational function of red scenic spots; and the innovation of the dissemination of red culture to make revolutionary cultural relics "live", make red tourism popular, allow red genes to be passed on and enhance the attractiveness of red scenic spots.
The cultural festival uses the popular method of "county and city (district) chief + professional anchor special presentation" to introduce the special products of Red Culture Travel, and uses 5G technology to provide real-time scenery viewing and smart city demonstration services to promote the attractions of Red Culture Travel, all of which are an effort to insert the wings of wisdom for red tourism, and expect Hunan red tourism to become more and more popular.
Representatives of US-China Trade Talks to meet in August
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post on August 25 quoted an anonymous person familiar with the matter as reporting that the head of China's trade negotiation team, Vice Premier Liu He of the State Council, and the co-leader of the US team, Trade Representative Lai Haizhe, are expected to hold formal talks in August to assess the implementation of the China-US Phase 1 trade agreement.
The report said that although China has significantly increased its purchases of US agricultural products in the past few months, China's purchases are still some way from the amount promised in the trade agreement due to factors such as the new coronavirus epidemic.
Analysts say the recent closure of consulates between the United States and China, along with other disputes, could derail any progress on trade.
The China-US Phase I trade agreement will enter into force one month after it was signed on January 15. The agreement stipulates that the high-level trade framework group of the two sides shall hold talks every six months.
People familiar with the matter said the meeting would be "an important turning point", allowing the two sides to assess the progress of the agreement.
But the person also said that if the tension between the United States and China leads to a lack of willingness to talk at this time, the two sides may agree that the May 8 teleconference between Lai Haizhe and Liu He has met the terms of the semi-annual talks in the trade agreement.
Since this year, China-US relations have deteriorated rapidly, with disputes between the two sides including a series of issues such as the origin of the new crown virus, trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the South China Sea and ideology.
While US President Donald Trump boasted about his achievements in the first phase of the agreement at the beginning of the year, his attitude has recently changed.
Although China has recently purchased a record amount of US corn in a single day and bought a lot of soybeans, "this trade agreement is less meaningful to me now than it was when it was reached," he said at a White House press conference on the 23rd.
An anonymous Beijing government adviser also said that a new round of trade negotiations is unlikely due to poor US-China relations and that "trade issues have lost weight in China-US relations".
However, he revealed that the relevant Chinese economic and trade units met on the 23rd to discuss a series of issues, including how to increase the volume of imports from the United States. "We have done our best to buy, so any additional purchases will be difficult."
Peng Jining, vice-president of the US-China National Committee on Trade, said it was "more important than ever" to maintain the momentum of the first-phase agreement, noting that China had made progress in further opening up its financial markets to US companies this year.
"It's better to talk than not talk, even though it may just be routine," said an analyst at Planum, an independent research firm.
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 (reporter Wei Yukun) A reporter from the Ministry of Emergency Management learned from the Ministry of Emergency Management that the State Prevention Office and the Ministry of Emergency Management, together with the State Grain and Material Reserve Bureau, once again urgently transported to Anhui Province six categories of central reserve flood control materials, including 1.35 million woven bags, 1.2 million square metres of woven cloth and 130,000 square metres of geotextile, to support Anhui's flood relief and rescue work.
According to the relevant persons in charge of the Ministry of Emergency Management, at present, the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Huaihe River basin maintain high water level fluctuations, and the "No. 3 Flood of 2020 of the Yangtze River" formed in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River on the 26th, increasing the risk in local areas.
Meteorological authorities expect heavy rainfall in Chongqing, Guizhou and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in the next three days, and the flood control situation is still severe and complex.
According to the report, since the beginning of the flood, the Ministry of Emergency Management has deployed national comprehensive fire and rescue teams to pre-position professional rescue forces in key flood prevention areas, participated in 10,364 anti-flood rescue and rescue cases of various kinds, deployed more than 130,000 soldiers, 17,778 fire engines and 1,1887 boats, rescued 37,777 people in distress and evacuated and transferred more than 107,000 people in distress.
Hao Yusheng, Chief Representative of NASDAQ China: Now is the best time point for Chinese companies to IPO in the US - Economic Observation - Professional Financial and Economic News Website
Economic Watch Network reporter Zhang Bin because of the Rui Luckin Coffee counterfeiting incident, the US market has implemented stricter supervision of Chinese stocks, combined with the long-term pressure on valuation, and the pressure on Chinese stocks listed in the United States, such as Netease, Jingdong and other Chinese stocks have recently begun their journey back to Hong Kong to list.
Recently, shell, ideal car and other companies have gone to the United States to list enthusiastically.
Under the epidemic and China's general stock crisis, is now the best time for Chinese enterprises to list in the US?
"As far as the recent IPO cases and the next companies to list in the US are concerned, the US IPO has not been affected in essence, but the market is now very good, and even now this point in time is the best point in time for Chinese companies to IPO in the US in the past 10 years."
Hao Yusheng, chief representative of the Nasdaq Stock Exchange in China, said at the "Stock Overview Chapter of the 2020 Listed Company Leaders Summit" hosted by Snowball.
In April this year, the US Securities Regulatory Commission (SEC) and the American Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) issued the Statement on the Important Role of Audit Quality and Regulatory Access to Audit and Other International Information - A Discussion on the Current Challenges of Information Access for US Listed Companies with a Large Business in China.
The statement said that despite the significant increase in international cooperation and coordination in recent years, there are still problems in obtaining information from US regulators, and the SEC and PCAOB still face legal and practical challenges. Correspondingly to the document, the PCAOB website details the list of listed companies that have encountered audit obstacles and their audit institutions, with a large number of medium-sized companies listed.
In addition, in May this year, the US Senate passed the Foreign Corporate Accountability Act, which introduced additional information disclosure requirements for foreign companies to list in the US.
In Hao Yusheng's view, the stock crisis did not affect the appetite of investors.
"When this news first came out, everyone was asking if they could go public in the United States in the future, but later we found out that these questions are not a matter for investors, investors may ask these questions during the recent US IPO roadshow, or even become standardized questions, but this has not been used by investors as an important factor in whether or not to invest in a Chinese company.
It is suggested that we try to take a normal view of the current situation.
Of course, this may appear to be the most serious situation in the past two years, but in terms of investor appetite, there has been no impact.
So the boom in US IPOs will continue from now until the end of this year or before the US election.
On May 9 this year, Jinshan Yun officially listed on the US Nasdaq, becoming the first Chinese company to IPO in the US after the epidemic.
"The listing of Jinshan Yun gives great confidence to Chinese companies preparing for an IPO."
Hao Yusheng said.
According to the mid-term stock summary data report for the first half of 2020 released by Snowball, a total of 20 Chinese enterprises went to the US to IPO in the first half of this year, an increase of 17.6% over the same period last year. In terms of the total initial capital raised, 20 enterprises raised a total of 2.725 billion yuan, an increase of more than 52.4% compared with the same period last year. In terms of industry distribution, the number of IPOs in the health care industry in the first half of this year was prominent, an increase of 100% over the same period last year.
According to Hao Yusheng, the Chinese companies that went to the United States to IPO in the first half of this year are of higher quality, and high-quality companies with strong fundamentals and growth will be more favored by investors.
In the short, medium and long term, Hao Yusheng continues to be optimistic about Ming China's IPO in the US.
"In the short term, the rush to IPO in the US will continue; in the medium term, Chinese companies will have more choices, with A-shares, Hong Kong stocks and US stocks, and the US election and China-US relations will be taken into account as market choices and timing factors. In the long term, everything will return to normal, market fluctuations are cyclical, both political and economic, and will eventually return to the normal stage, and the stock market has always been volatile."
Hao Yusheng also said, "There are more uncertain factors this year, but for high-quality companies, whether the market is good or bad, as long as they are solid and have the growth that investors can see, other factors are relatively secondary, investors need to invest in excellent Chinese companies."

Commentator of the People's Daily: Concentrate on Doing Your Business Well and Build New Advantages for Future Development--On Learning and Implementing the Important Speech by General Secretary Xi Jinping at the Symposium on Entrepreneurs - Xinhua Net
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 25, 2007, People's Daily, July 26, Commentator's article: Concentrate on doing your own business and build new advantages for future development
At present, the global epidemic and the world economic situation are still severe and complex, and the challenges facing China's development are unprecedented.
Maintaining strategic strength, enhancing confidence in victory and concentrating our efforts on doing our own business well are the key for us to meet various risks and challenges.
At the recent Symposium on Entrepreneurs, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed that, in the current external environment of rising protectionism, the downturn of the world economy and the shrinking of the global market, we must concentrate our efforts on doing our own business, give full play to the advantages of the super-large domestic market, gradually form a new development pattern with the major domestic cycle as the main body and the mutual promotion of domestic and international cycles, raise the level of modernization of the industrial chain supply chain, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation, accelerate the resolution of key core technologies, and create new advantages for future development.
He who checks the situation is wise, he who is weak wins.
Under the external environment of deepening economic globalization, the market and resources have played an important role in China's rapid development.
Now, under the impact of the epidemic, the world is undergoing profound changes, facing more unstable and uncertain factors, and economic globalization is experiencing headwinds and waves.
A very important aspect is to take the expansion and satisfaction of domestic demand as the strategic basis for development, give full play to its own advantages, and add impetus to China's economic development by prospering the domestic economy and smoothing the domestic circulation.
We should deeply realize that the construction of a complete domestic demand system is related to China's long-term development and long-term stability.
The Party Central Committee reviewed the current situation and made it clear that it firmly implements the strategy of expanding domestic demand, which is the need to deal with the impact of the epidemic, to maintain the long-term sustainable and healthy development of China's economy and to meet the growing need of the people for a better life.
The advantage of large economies is that they are internally recyclable.
China has the most complete and largest industrial system in the world, strong production capacity and perfect supporting capabilities. It has more than 100 million market subjects and more than 170 million talents with higher education or various types of professional skills, as well as a super-large domestic demand market formed by a population of 1.4 billion, including more than 400 million middle-income groups. It is at the stage of rapid development of new industrialization, informatization, urbanization and agricultural modernization, with great potential for investment demand.
Public ownership is the main body, the economy of multiple forms of ownership develops together, distribution according to work is the main body and various modes of distribution coexist. The socialist market economic system and other basic socialist economic systems can not only stimulate the vitality of various market subjects, liberate and develop the social productive forces, but also promote the organic unity of efficiency and fairness and continuously realize common prosperity.
We should firmly grasp the strategic basis of expanding domestic demand, make all links of production, distribution and circulation rely more on the domestic market to achieve a virtuous circle, clarify the strategic direction of supply-side structural reform, and promote the dynamic balance between total supply and aggregate demand at a higher level.
We must accelerate the construction of a complete domestic demand system, vigorously promote scientific, technological and other innovation, accelerate the promotion of strategic new and emerging industries such as the digital economy, intelligent manufacturing, life health and new materials, form more new growth points and poles, and gradually form a new development pattern in which the domestic large cycle is the main body and the domestic and international dual cycles promote each other.
Opening up brings progress, and closure is bound to lag behind.
General Secretary Xi Jinping has repeatedly stressed that China's open door will not be closed, but will only get bigger and bigger.
Taking the big domestic circulation as the main body is not to operate behind closed doors, but to achieve stronger and more sustainable development by giving full play to the potential of domestic demand, making the domestic market and the international market better connected, and making better use of the two international and domestic markets and resources.
At the same time, expanding domestic demand and opening up are not contradictory. The smoother the domestic circulation, the more conducive to the construction of a new pattern of opening up and the more conducive to the formation of new advantages in participating in international cooperation and competition.
Although the trend of protectionist thought is now on the rise in the world, we should stand on the correct side of history, deepen reform, expand opening-up, strengthen opening-up and cooperation in the field of science and technology, promote the construction of an open world economy and promote the construction of a community of human destiny.
The Chinese nation has experienced many tribulations in its history, but has never been crushed, but has become more and more courageous, constantly growing up and rising from the tribulations.
On the road to progress, with the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, the remarkable advantages of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, the strong mobilization ability and strong comprehensive strength, and the united struggle of the whole Party, the whole army and the people of all ethnic groups in the country, we will surely be able to overcome all difficulties and obstacles, maintain the momentum of China's sound economic and social development, build a moderately well-off society in an all-round way, and successfully launch the new journey of building a modern socialist country in an all-round way!
Balance treasure earnings down "90 after" but "revenge" to save money?
With the balance treasure's earnings falling, "after 90" not only did not flee the balance treasure, but began to save money with "revenge"?
The Report on Saving Money after the Balance Treasure 90 (2020 Edition), recently released by the China New Economic Research Institute in conjunction with Alipay, shows that in the first half of the year, "after 90" likes to save more money: the amount of money saved per capita increased by nearly 40% compared with 2019.
Interestingly, "after 90" is more inclined to save from a "small amount of money", with 60% of the average amount of money saved below 20 yuan..
Saving money with balance treasure has also become the "after 90" saving habit.
The data show that of the 700 million balance treasure users, 134 million users are "after 90".
There are 174 million "post-90" in China, which means that about three out of every four "post-90" in the country are saving money with balance treasure.
At present, the 7-day annualized yield of the balance treasure fund has fallen to about 1.5% from above 2% at the beginning of the year.
Even so, it did not affect the pace of saving money after "90.
Under the background of the improvement of the "saving effect" of balance treasure, many young people who are used to using balance treasure have also been directly transformed into "basic people".
Alipay data shows that as of July 13, the number of new "people" on Alipay has more than doubled year-on-year in the past month, and more and more young people have realized "advanced" financial management on Alipay.
Some analysts believe that the inflow of funds from the balance treasure into the stock market is also an important reason for the clear decline in the share of the IMF in June.
The report also showed that "after 90", girls were more likely to save more money, on average 20% more than boys. Of the users holding funds on the Alipay platform, 60% were men, and women tended to choose a more robust way of managing money than men.
After saving money, what's the plan for "after 90"?
Alipay data shows that "after 90" has the habit of saving money for the goal, with the largest number of users taking travel as the goal of saving money.
Affected by the epidemic, many "post-90" people saved money to prepare for travel after the epidemic; the reopening of cinemas also provided a new way to switch from saving money to consumption.
Let a bright party flag fly high on the anti-flood levee
Recently, the southern part of China has been affected by continuous rainfall, and the situation of flood prevention and control is very serious, resulting in 26 provinces (districts and cities) such as Guizhou, Sichuan, Hunan, Guangxi, Guangdong and Hubei being affected by disasters.
The disaster is the order, the disaster area is the battlefield, and in the face of the disaster, the Party flag is the war flag. Party organizations at all levels, Party cadres and the people's children and soldiers resolutely implement the spirit of the important instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping on flood prevention and relief work, quickly take part in the first line of flood prevention, flood rescue and relief, and become the backbone of the people in the disaster area and the living force in the fight against floods.
The bright Party flag flying high on the anti-flood levee is an expression of loyalty and a call to mission.
In the face of disaster, a Party organization is a battle fortress, and a Party member cadre is a flag.
On the front line of the fight against floods everywhere, Party organizations at all levels and Party cadres at all levels have demonstrated a high degree of loyalty to the Party, heeded the call of the Party Central Committee, and with the actions of "look at me", "follow me" and "I go first" courage, built an indomitable steel fortress and raised the indomitable backbone of China.
The bright Party flag flying high on the anti-flood levee is the adherence of the position and the horn of the charge.
In the face of floods and waterlogging disasters, Party organizations at all levels acted quickly, sounded the anti-flood "emergency call", planted the bright Party flag on the anti-flood levee, and the vast majority of Party cadres and people's children and soldiers stuck to the anti-flood position, using the will and action of "the Party flag is in the position" and "the flood will never retreat", thus becoming the most secure and trusted solid barrier for the people in the disaster-stricken areas.
The bright Party flag flying high on the anti-flood levee is a selfless dedication and a responsibility.
At a time of crisis, the true character of Party members is highlighted. At a time when the lives and property of the people are seriously threatened, Party members, cadres and people's children and soldiers give up their homes and take care of everyone, selfless dedication, dare to take responsibility, and take the hard battle of flood prevention, flood relief and relief as the main battlefield and parade ground for the comprehensive inspection of their ability, style and literacy. It is this spirit of selfless dedication and commitment that greatly encourages the people in the disaster-stricken areas to overcome the disaster, and gathers the strong spiritual force of flood prevention, flood relief and relief.
"People first, life first" is tested not only in peacetime, but also at critical moments.
On the anti-flood dike, the vast majority of Party cadres and the children and soldiers of the people should allow the people to see the bright red Party flag, the figure of struggle and the voice of encouragement everywhere at any time, use the iron and steel dike that cannot be washed down by the flood to add luster to the Party flag, and let one bright Party flag fly high on the anti-flood dike!

China News Network Manila, July 26 (reporter Guan Dongdong) The Department of Public Information of the Philippine Presidency (PCOO) issued a notice on July 25 that the Minister of the Ministry, Martin Ananar, was tested negative for the new crown pneumonia on July 24.
As of the afternoon of the same day, the PCOO accumulated 13 staff members tested positive, the previous three positive, one dead and two still receiving treatment.
Due to contact with an infected PCOO employee, on the 24th Andanal and 49 PCOO employees were tested for new crown pneumonia.
The report released on the 25th showed that 10 of the staff tested positive.
PCOO Deputy Minister for Administration and Legal Affairs Marvin Gatpayat said that the ministry, located in the new executive office building of the presidential palace, was scheduled to resume work on the day of President Duterte's fifth State of the Union address on the 27th.
On the same day, Martin Andanal assured the public that the PCOO would continue to fulfil its responsibilities to the Filipino people, ensuring that important information was provided to the public in a timely manner, while strengthening contact tracing and testing to avoid further spread of the new crown pneumonia virus among PCOO staff, and prayed for the speedy recovery of the staff who had tested positive.

France Increases Military Investment in Space - Xinhua
French Defense Minister Florence Parly said on the 24th that France will add hundreds of millions of euros to its space defense budget to develop its space military forces in order to guard against possible "unfriendly actions" by other countries in outer space.
On the same day, Parly told Le Provence that between 2019 and 2025, the expenditure budget for French military space projects will increase from the previously proposed 3.6 billion euros (about US $4.2 billion) to 4.3 billion euros (US $5 billion).
In accordance with the Act on French Military Planning 2019-2025, approved by the French Parliament in 2018, France is expected to upgrade its existing observation and communications satellites, launch three electromagnetic interception satellites and modernize its space surveillance radar.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced last July that a military space command and an "aviation and space force" would be established within the French Air Force.
Parley said she will officially announce the creation of the space force when she visits a military school in Salon, Provence, later this month.
Parley said the space force is part of the Air Force and will have a strength of 500 by 2025.
"The idea that space serves the common interests of science is gone forever. Today, space is a place where countries compete for global hegemony," she said.
Parly reiterated Macron's previous statement that France has no intention of provoking an arms race.
"We are by no means engaged in an arms race. But it is my responsibility to be fully aware of the threats we may face."
Palley recalled the surveillance of a military satellite shared by France and Italy in 2017.
She said the "sneak peek" was a Russian satellite.
The Russian side denied this claim.
Parly said France would "soon" have small patrol satellites capable of detecting and targeting "those behind unfriendly actions."
The French media believe that the reason why France seeks to establish a space force is due to the fact that US President Donald Trump asked the US Department of Defense to draft a bill to establish a Pacific Air Force last February.
Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act last December, approving the establishment of the Pacific Air Force, the sixth US military force.
Some experts worry that these US measures have accelerated the pace of US space militarization and could trigger a new arms race in space.

Report says the shared accommodation market has picked up since March
According to the "China Shared Accommodation Development Report 2020" (hereinafter referred to as the "Report") recently released by the Sharing Economy Research Center of the National Information Center, the transaction volume of China's shared accommodation market decreased by 72.1% year-on-year in the first five months of 2020 due to the impact of the epidemic.
However, the shared accommodation market began to warm up since March, and the market turnover, order volume and reception number gradually recovered.
The Report shows that the volume of transactions in the shared accommodation market has declined significantly. On the one hand, due to the significant decline in the demand for travel and accommodation under the prevention and control of the epidemic, the number of orders decreased sharply, with the total number of orders falling by 65 per cent year-on-year and the number of receptions falling by 63 per cent year-on-year in the first five months. On the other hand, the weakness of demand also led to a more significant decrease in overnight prices, with the average overnight price falling by 16 per cent year-on-year in the first five months.
However, market turnover in March, April and May increased by 78%, 199% and 35% respectively; the number of orders increased by 141%, 152% and 50% respectively; and the number of receptions increased by 81%, 112% and 28% respectively.
The Report points out that the development of the shared accommodation industry has been promising for a long time, but there are still many uncertainties in the near future.
In this regard, Yu Fengxia, deputy director of the Sharing Economy Research Center of the National Information Center, told the Worker's Daily that the development of shared accommodation needs stronger policy support. On the one hand, it is necessary to do a good job in the implementation of the policies already issued in the previous period, further strengthen policy advocacy and coherence, and focus on creating a better business environment. On the other hand, it is also necessary to further strengthen policy guidance and support in terms of stimulating consumer demand, enriching the supply of tourism and accommodation services, innovating service methods and strengthening cooperation between the government and platform enterprises.

Xiamen, July 26 (Yang Fushan Zhang Shushan Xu Jingyi) China's famous vascular surgery center, Shanghai Changhai Hospital Vascular Surgery, Shanghai-Naval Military Medical University, signed a contract with Zhongshan Hospital Vascular Surgery, affiliated with Xiamen University, on July 25 to jointly set up a collaboration center to promote exchanges and cooperation between the two sides in the field of vascular surgery, especially aortic emergency and severe disease.
The Zhongshan Hospital, affiliated with Xiamen University, said that after the vascular surgery of the two hospitals formally formed a collaborative unit, it will conduct remote consultations, formulate treatment plans with real-time online consultations with Changhai Hospital, select and send talents for further training, and jointly carry out weekly surgical technical exchanges, teaching room inspections, etc. For complex cases, experts from Changhai can be invited to the hospital to perform operations according to the needs of the patients, thus realizing that patients in southwest Fujian Province can enjoy the country's top medical resources.
The two hospitals will also work together to carry out innovative surgical scientific research, popular science and early screening of aortic diseases, etc.
A special seminar on the aorta organized by the Beijing Health Promotion Association and hosted by the Zhongshan Hospital attached to Xiamen University was held in Xiamen on the same day.
At the same time, the two well-known hospitals in Shanghai and Xiamen held the signing ceremony of the vascular surgery collaboration center and announced the formation of collaborative units to jointly improve the treatment level of vascular surgery-related diseases in southwest Fujian.
Shanghai Changhai Hospital Vascular Surgery is the only Institute of Vascular Surgery in the Army and the only Clinical Medical Center for Vascular System Diseases in Shanghai. It is also the first national key discipline in vascular surgery. It has led the establishment of the Intraperitoneal Angiology Professional Committee of the Chinese Physicians Association, and is a top team with a deep history in the industry.
Professor Huang Xiaojin, Director of Vascular Surgery, Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University, gave an interview to the media.
Vascular surgery of Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University is the first independent subject of vascular surgery in Fujian Province. It has long been dedicated to the diagnosis and treatment of aortic and peripheral vascular diseases, and was approved to build a provincial key clinical specialty in 2018.
In the treatment of aortic diseases, in addition to the treatment of dissection aneurysms and aortic aneurysms, there is extensive experience in emergency ruptured aortic aneurysms.
"The history of vascular surgery in Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University and the breadth, difficulty and complexity of the operation are outstanding in the region, so this time we set up a collaboration center to carry out in-depth cooperation in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases such as lower extremity artery and carotid artery in addition to the aorta."
Professor Feng Rui, deputy director of vascular surgery at Shanghai Changhai Hospital, said.
Zhongshan Hospital affiliated with Xiamen University and Shanghai Changhai Hospital signed a contract to establish "Li Zhaoshen Famous Medical Studio" in digestive medicine in 2018.
Professor Huang Xiaojin, director of vascular surgery at the hospital, told CNN.com that the hospital also has a long history of exchanges with Changhai Hospital.
He said that the hospital will regularly invite Shanghai experts to the hospital to carry out surgical technical exchanges, teaching room visits, discussion of difficult cases, and further carry out remote consultations, which are currently planned to be held once a week. In addition, the department will also send personnel for further study exchanges to strengthen the training and development of the contingent of talents in the subject.
At the meeting, the reporter learned that vascular diseases are the leading cause of death in China. The aorta, as the main channel of all organs of the human body, flows from the heart to the whole body and plays an important role.
The occurrence of aortic diseases is often accompanied by high risk, high mortality and high difficulty of treatment. The thickest section of the aorta is up to 4 cm in diameter. Once a hemangioma is formed, there is a rupture, or the rupture of the intima produces a dissection, which will cause heavy bleeding and is very dangerous.
In recent years, with the change of people's lifestyle and the acceleration of the pace of life, China has become the largest country in the world with hypertension, and aortic diseases have increased. Today, with the development of surgical technology and industrial materials, the treatment of aortic diseases has continued to develop in the direction of minimally invasive, rapid and efficient.
Doctors can achieve good results by piercing the thigh and placing a stent in the aorta to properly "change the channel" of blood flow, thus avoiding the impact of an aneurysm or ruptured dissection, and some operations even require only local anesthesia.
More than a dozen domestic experts were invited to attend the seminar to discuss the new progress in the treatment of aortic diseases, and the cutting-edge technical training and discussion of difficult cases were carried out in the form of a conference salon.
At the meeting, the reporter learned that with the development of surgical technology and industrial materials, the treatment of aortic diseases continues to develop in the direction of minimally invasive, rapid and efficient.

China News Network Chongqing July 26 (reporter Han Lu) The reporter learned from China Railway Chengdu Bureau Group Limited on July 26 that the 18.9-kilometer-long Zheng Wan High-Speed Rail Little Three Gorges Tunnel ran through the entire line on that day.
It is understood that the Little Three Gorges Tunnel is not only the longest high-speed rail tunnel in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, but also the longest single-hole two-line high-speed rail tunnel designed to reach a speed of 350 km / h in China.
Located in the three provinces and cities of Henan, Hubei and Chongqing, the Zheng Wan High-Speed Railway connects Beijing-Guangzhou and Xulan High-Speed Railway in Zhengzhou to the north, and the South-Lien-Yuwan High-Speed Railway in Wanzhou to Chongqing. It is an important part of the "eight-vertical and eight-horizontal" high-speed railway network in China.
The entire line of the Zheng Wan High-Speed Rail Xiao Three Gorges Tunnel opened on the 26th.
The picture shows the through site.
The Zheng Wan high-speed railway begins in Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, and runs southwest through Pingdingshan City, Nanyang City, Xiangyang City, Hubei Province, to Wanzhou District, Chongqing City. The new line is about 818 kilometers long, with a design speed of 350 kilometers per hour, and about 184 kilometers in Chongqing.
Among them, the Zhengzhou to Xiangyang section was first opened for operation on December 1, 2019, and the Chongqing section is stepping up its construction.
The Little Three Gorges Tunnel, which runs through the whole line on the 26th, is the full-line control project of Zheng Wan High-Speed Rail. The project is located at the border between Fengjie County and Wushan County in Chongqing. It is about 18.9 kilometers long and has a maximum burial depth of 890 meters.
Construction of the tunnel began in February 2017 and the entire line opened on July 26, 2020.
According to Wang Jun, who is in charge of high-speed railway tunnel design of Zheng Wan Engineering Group of China Railway Second Academy of Engineering, the survey and design party, the Xiao Three Gorges Tunnel is located in a very complex terrain and geological condition, facing the risks of karst, mud inrush water and large deformation of soft rock. It is a Grade I high-risk tunnel, and the tunnel design and construction are very difficult.
"In the course of the construction of the project, we used the methods of geological investigation, geophysical exploration and advanced drilling to advance geological prediction, and adopted special design plans for more than 30 caverns of various types. For example, a bridge with a length of 24 meters was designed and built, crossing a large cavern with a longitudinal length of more than 10 meters and a depth of more than 55 meters in the tunnel to avoid tunnel settlement," the Royal Army said.
According to the China Railway Tunnel Bureau, the construction party, the construction of the tunnel adopted the combination of diversion and blocking, through the construction of cross-hole leveling, grouting to block water, the strengthening of tunnel structural support and the construction of sewage treatment station, which not only ensured the orderly progress of the project, but also avoided the damage of the construction drainage to the water body in the Xiaotangxia Scenic Area. At the same time, it successfully overcome construction difficulties such as bad geology such as the large deformation of soft rock up to 7 kilometers long, and multi-inrush water with a maximum daily water inrush of 157,000 cubic meters.
After the completion and opening to traffic, the entire line of Zheng Wan high-speed railway will become a new convenient and fast passenger transport route from the southwest of China to the Central Plains, North China and Northeast China. It is of great significance to improve the capacity and quality of the northeast-to-northeast railway corridor in the southwest, improve the layout of the regional road network, accelerate the development of tourism resources and urbanization along the route, promote coordinated regional development and promote the implementation of the strategy for the development of the western region.
Experts say the collection of immigration data through the US census for the allocation of seats in the House of Representatives is unconstitutional
Some civil rights groups and several U.S. cities and counties have sued the federal government, saying the Trump administration's attempt to exclude undocumented immigrants from the U.S. census is unworkable and unconstitutional.
The U.S. Census will determine the distribution of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
"This is not going to work," Sarah Brannon, executive attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, told VOA.
She went on to say that Trump's request to determine the citizenship of those surveyed in the census was difficult to do and "not very reliable."
Another civil liberties group, Common Cause, filed a lawsuit Thursday challenging Trump's executive order.
Several cities in New Jersey and Georgia joined the lawsuit.
Arlington County, Virginia, joined the lawsuit Friday.
"The United States Constitution requires an accurate count of our population every 10 years. We must accurately count everyone living in Arlington County and not allow this illegal attempt to scare people away and depopulate our immigrant community to succeed," said Garvey, chairman of the Arlington County Board of Management.
Other organizations and individuals praised President Trump's executive order.
Alabama Attorney General Marshall called the executive order a "victory" for the state.
"The allocation of seats in the House of Representatives and the Electoral College to each state must be based on the number of residents residing in the state and the number of residents legally residing," he said.
The U.S. Supreme Court last year blocked the Trump administration from including a citizenship question in the 2020 census form.
President Trump signed an executive order earlier this week directing Secretary of Commerce Ross of the U.S. Census Bureau to oversee the submission of census data on undocumented people so that the administration can exclude these undocumented people from state census figures in order to determine whether each state increases, decreases or maintains seats in the House of Representatives.
The United States redistributes seats in the House of Representatives every 10 years according to demographic changes.
Local Emergency Response to Flood Control in 33 Districts and Counties of Chongqing
Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, July 26 (reporters Ke Gaoyang, Li Song) The reporter learned from the Chongqing Flood Prevention and Drought Control Command that Chongqing has ushered in a new round of heavy rainfall weather process since July 25, with torrential rains in 33 districts and counties, and floods exceeding warning levels in four sub-small and medium-sized rivers, and the local emergency response at the flood control level has been launched.
According to the monitoring of the Chongqing Hydrological Monitoring Terminal, from 8: 00 p.m. on the 25th to 8: 00 p.m. on the 26th, heavy to heavy rainfall occurred in most parts of Chongqing, including 33 districts and counties, including Jiangjin, Luojiang and Wulong, including 16 districts and counties, including Wanzhou, Yunyang and Nanchuan.
The maximum daily rainfall was 197.5 mm in Longshan Village, Jinshan Town, Nanchuan.
Affected by the heavy rainfall, four sub-small and medium-sized rivers in Donkey Creek in Jiangjin District, Oil River in Yuling District, Yingyang River in Kaizhou District and Wutan River in Yunyang County experienced floods that exceeded the warning level, and the water level is still rising.
The heavy rainfall also caused a landslide in Liujing Village in Wulong District, causing the disruption of village road and road traffic, and the slippery body slid into the tributaries of the Wujiang River along the Canghe River, blocking the river to form a quake lake. The local area has urgently organized the transfer of people downstream.
In response to the heavy rain, the Chongqing Municipal Flood Prevention and Drought Control Command issued the Grade III early warning information for river floods at 13: 00 on the 26th, and launched the Grade III emergency response for flood control, requesting relevant districts, counties and units to strengthen inspection duties, mobilize emergency rescue teams and materials in a timely manner, and evacuate and transfer people in threatened areas.
Moving in Response to the Situation and Promoting the Construction of Industrial Projects - View Headline - Hunan Daily Network - Huasheng Online
In midsummer, heat waves hit Hunan.
However, the enthusiasm released by the promotion of on-site observation meetings in the construction of industrial projects throughout the province overcame the heat of Sanfu Day, and encouraged Sanxiang and Sishui with the clear guidance of "industrial comparative strength and project theory heroes".
The development of Hunan always depends on building projects and cultivating industries.
In the face of the very unusual first half of the year, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee, with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, the whole province adhered to a game of chess, made every effort to fight the two hard battles of epidemic prevention and flood prevention, and took industrial projects as the "forehand" to implement the "Six Stability" and "Six Guarantees".
From a 1.9% year-on-year decline in GDP in the first quarter to a 1.3% year-on-year growth in the first half of the year, the difficulties and enormous efforts during the period are self-evident.
On this precious report card, the construction of industrial projects is the key support for Hunan's economic recovery and stable development.
The potential is smooth and irreversible.
The construction of industrial projects should be placed in the overall situation and be good at not only accumulating, accumulating and planning momentum, but also at recognizing change, seeking change and adapting to it.
Under the background of the current complex and severe international situation, in addition to the hard work of attracting business and attracting investment, it is necessary to calm down and study the new characteristics of the current new situation, better grasp the law, be more scientific and accurate, and better integrate into the new development pattern with the domestic great circulation as the main body and the domestic and international two cycles promoting each other.
Pay more attention to upgrading the basic capacity of industry.
In the first half of the year, a large number of heavyweight investment projects in new industries in our province not only broke ground and sowed hope, but also enterprises in traditional advantageous industries accelerated their deployment and fell in the transformation of digital, intelligent and green industries.
The Yiyang Aoshkang Third Science Park project revamped the existing production line, the high-end printed circuit board intelligent production line took the lead; the new factory area of Changde Cigarette Cigarette Factory in Hunan is committed to the process of intelligent transformation and the construction of modern factories, which is also a vivid reflection of the "new shoots of old trees"... Around the major national strategy and "two new and one heavy", efforts are made to consolidate and promote superior industries, actively cultivate and develop new industries, and comprehensively increase the strength of scientific and technological innovation and the substitution of domestic production.
Pay more attention to the cultivation and development of a new economy, a new business model.
The sudden new epidemic has brought about the popularity of the "cloud economy", stimulated the potential of the digital economy and provided a new opportunity for industrial transformation: in the first half of the year, the computer and office equipment manufacturing industry and the electronic and communication equipment manufacturing industry in our province grew by 12.6%, the online retail sales of wholesale and retail enterprises above the limit increased by 32.2% year-on-year, and the online meal fee income of catering enterprises increased by 35.6% year-on-year.
It is the general trend to cultivate new machines in the midst of the crisis, open new bureaux in the midst of the changes, actively promote digital industrialization and industrial digitization, and guide the integration and development of the digital economy and the real economy.
Pay more attention to optimizing and stabilizing the industrial chain supply chain.
Engineering machinery is the main force of Hunan industry, but two-thirds of the supporting enterprises are outside the province, and there is still space and potential in the supporting chain.
The project of strengthening the thinking and grasp of the industrial chain requires not only the continuous accumulation of leading enterprises to achieve technological breakthroughs in the key links of the industrial chain, but also the dedicated cultivation of local areas to stimulate the "chain" lock response by strengthening the chain to complement the chain, promote the coordinated layout of the relevant supporting industries, and accelerate the construction of an independent, controllable, safe and reliable industrial chain supply chain.
To overcome difficulties and support enterprises, Hunan remains a hot and happy land with a good business environment and emerging market business opportunities.
All parts of the province have made frequent offers, new offers and practical offers in the hope that the "burden reduction" of enterprise relief will lead to the "acceleration" of high-quality development; Shaoyang implements "shareholder-style" services, does business for enterprises without prevarication, implements policies without discount, and solves problems without overnight... In the process of recovering the losses caused by the epidemic, all kinds of "every effort" has been made to find the right pain points and achieve fresh stories that turn danger into opportunity.
Focusing on industry research, nurturing and developing industries, and firmly optimizing the business environment, will win the favor of more investors.
The wind and waves are still ahead, but the state of taking advantage of the wind and waves has become the norm for the construction of industrial projects up and down the province and promoting high-quality development.
During this critical period, we must learn and implement the spirit of a series of important instructions and instructions from General Secretary Xi Jinping, use the certainty of our own work to effectively address external uncertainties, persistently promote the construction of industrial projects, share enthusiasm and sweat, and ensure the successful conclusion of the 13th Five-Year Plan and the establishment of a moderately well-off society in an all-round way.

Cultivating New Business Mode and Opening New Employment Space
New forms of employment are constantly emerging, opening up new spaces for employment, and a number of innovative service policies have been introduced to help new forms of employment thrive.
According to the latest data from the National Bureau of Statistics, the unemployment rate in the national urban survey was 5.7 per cent in June, down 0.2 percentage points from May.
This is also the two consecutive declines in the unemployment rate in the national urban survey since April. Behind the monthly decline in the unemployment rate data is the new employment opportunities emerging from new business patterns.
Now the salary of more than 5,000 a month, coupled with the novelty of embracing information technology, has made Guo Mei more and more motivated.
In the innovation incubation base of Shanxi transformation and comprehensive reform demonstration area, there are more than 2300 data taggers.
Not only data taggers, but since this year, the State has also defined 25 occupations, such as nucleic acid testers and online learning service providers, as new occupations, developing vocational skills standards and launching skills training programmes to help the development of practitioners.
Aiming at the new way of employment and the new way of entrepreneurship, the state is also innovating employment services.
Recently, the National Development and Reform Commission and 13 other departments jointly issued the "Opinions on Supporting the Healthy Development of the New Business Model and Activating the Consumer Market to Promote the Expansion of Employment", so as to provide workers with diverse employment opportunities.
Multi-departments will jointly cultivate new individuals in the market and further reduce the cost of online entrepreneurship and employment for self-employed persons. Policies such as the protection of the rights and interests of flexible employment and social security will be introduced to provide greater security for new business operators.

The overall stability of employment and prices shows that there is a "temperature" in the economy

The overall stability of employment and prices shows that the economy has a "temperature"
Economic Daily China Economic Network reporter Lin Huan
In the first half of this year, in the face of the impact of the new crown pneumonia epidemic, China made overall efforts to promote epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development. The situation of epidemic prevention and control continued to improve, the steady economic recovery was evident, the performance of employment and prices, which are closely related to the people's livelihood, was generally stable, and the Chinese economy handed over a report card of warm economic operation.
In the first two months of this year, the surveyed unemployment rate rose.
In particular, in February, the production and operation activities of many enterprises were basically shut down and shut down, the demand for employment by enterprises was reduced, recruitment was delayed or cancelled, and the unemployment rate in urban surveys rose.
With the gradual improvement of the epidemic prevention and control situation, the order of production and life of the whole society has been continuously restored.
The Party Central Committee adheres to the general tone of seeking progress in stability, further strengthens the hedging of macroeconomic policies, comprehensively strengthens the priority employment policy, and actively promotes the work of assisting enterprises to stabilize jobs and expand employment.
China has increased its policy to hedge and stabilize jobs, played a policy combination of "relief, relief and slow return compensation", reduced and reduced the payment portion of three social insurance units in stages, allowed the postponement of the payment of social insurance premiums, expanded the benefits of unemployment insurance stabilization and job return for small and medium-sized and micro-enterprises, and provided absorption subsidies and internship subsidies to enterprises to absorb the employment of key groups.
With the detailed implementation of various stable employment policies, the demand for employment by enterprises has steadily recovered, the employment situation has gradually improved, and the urban survey unemployment rate has gradually declined. In June, the survey unemployment rate was 5.7 per cent.
Zhang Yi, Director of the Department of Population and Employment Statistics of the National Bureau of Statistics, said that in the second quarter, various employment policies continued to bear fruit, with the labor force that had withdrawn in the previous period due to the impact of the epidemic returning, and the urban labor force participation rate rose by about 10 percentage points in June compared with February, close to the level of the same period last year.
Data show that the total amount of urban employment in June increased by more than 19% compared with February, and most industries reached pre-epidemic levels; the average weekly working hours of employees in enterprises reached 46.8 hours, 6.6 hours higher than in February and 0.1 hours higher than in January.
Prices also concern thousands of families.
In January this year, the CPI rose 5.4% year-on-year, a multi-year high.
Entering February, the CPI year-on-year increase, although slightly reduced, is still in the "5 range."
The year-on-year increase in CPI is at a high level, not only the consumer demand-driven factors before the Spring Festival, but also the wrong month of the Spring Festival and the low year-on-year base factors.
However, the impact of the new pneumonia epidemic on prices is particularly evident.
Affected by the epidemic prevention and control, in January and February, all parts of the country experienced delays in logistics, untimely supply of materials and materials, and increased transport costs of materials, as well as hoarding and panic-buying by some citizens, resulting in a marked increase in the prices of some necessities of life.
In order to deal with the disturbance of the price situation caused by the prevention and control of the epidemic, the relevant departments have included important living materials in the emergency transport guarantee to ensure the smooth transportation of materials.
Under the influence of a series of policy measures, the market supply of vegetables, melons and fruits has been strongly guaranteed.
In response to the rapid rise in pork prices at the beginning of this year, after the Central Government introduced the policy of guaranteeing supply and stabilizing prices, all regions and departments quickly implemented it, the supply of pork reserves improved significantly, pig production capacity was restored in an orderly manner, and the order of production and marketing was gradually normal.
Since March, pork prices have fallen continuously, and the year-on-year increase in food prices fell to 10.6 per cent in May. In June, pork prices rose slightly on an annualized basis, influenced by factors such as the slowdown in the export of pigs, the reduction in the volume of imports and the rebound in group consumer demand.
The seasonal variation of fresh vegetable prices was obvious, with an average increase of 3.4% in the first half of the year.
Affected by the high comparative base in the same period last year, fresh fruit prices continued to decline year-on-year, with an average decrease of 13.3% in the first half of the year.
The basic livelihood of the people is effectively guaranteed, and the overall economic and social situation is stable and orderly.
With the gradual recovery of transportation and logistics, all places have increased the strength of guarantee and supply, and the market supply and demand situation has improved.
Beginning in March, the CPI ring-to-ring ratio declined for four consecutive months, and the year-on-year increase fell from 4.3 per cent in March to 2.5 per cent in June, and the overall price level returned to stability.
In the second half of the year, China's prices will continue to maintain a moderate level and the overall inflationary pressure will not be great, but we should still promote the restoration of the order of production and life on the premise of normalizing epidemic prevention and control.
We will effectively respond to natural disasters such as floods, droughts and other natural disasters in major producing areas of grain, fruits and vegetables, strengthen market supervision, and resolutely crack down on acts that disrupt market order such as hoarding and inflating prices.

As an artist, connection is very important to me.
Through my works of art, I try to make it clear that human beings are not separated from nature but that everything is interconnected.
I first went to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and I first saw an iceberg.
I was in awe.
My heart pounded quickly, dizzy, trying to understand what was in front of me.
The iceberg next to me surfaced almost 200 feet. I can only feel surprised that this is one snowflake covering another snowflake, forming year after year.
Icebergs form when they break away from glaciers or from ice shelves.
Each iceberg has its own unique personality.
They interact with their surroundings and their circumstances in a distinct way.
Some icebergs refuse to compromise and stick to it, while others cannot stand to collapse under a surge of intense passion.
When you look at icebergs, it's easy to think that they are all isolated, that they are independent, single, more like what we humans sometimes think of ourselves.
But the reality is much more than that.
As the iceberg melted, I breathed its ancient smell.
As the iceberg melts, it releases fresh water rich in minerals that nourish everything.
I set out to photograph these icebergs as if I were taking portraits of my ancestors, learning that icebergs existed in that way at these individual moments but never again.
When they melt, it is not death; it is not an end, but a continuation of the road to life.
I've photographed icebergs, and some of the ice is very young - thousands of years old.
Some of the ice is more than 100,000 years old.
The last image I want to show you is an iceberg I photographed on Kekertsuatsiak, Greenland.
This is a very rare opportunity for everyone to actually witness an iceberg roll over.
So that's what the diagram shows.
You can see a small boat on the left.
This is a boat of about 15 feet.
I want you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and its deformation on the surface of the water.
Here you see it start to roll, the boat moves to the other side, and a man stands there.
This is an average size Greenland iceberg.
It rises to the surface about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video was shot in real time.
(Music) Like this iceberg, they show you different aspects of their personality.
Thank you. Thank you.

Qinghai-Hainan July 26 Telegram Question: "Flower Sea Direct Broadcast Room" by Qinghai Lake: "Sweet" Bring Goods to Help Farmers Increase Income
Author Hu Guilong Pan Yujie
"In the middle of summer, the Qinghai Lake is full of golden flowers and thousands of bees flying. There is a high altitude, large temperature difference between day and night and less air pollution. The intense light breeds the most tenacious and generous swarm of bees, creating the characteristics of high activity, high protein, high nutritional value, low sugar and low fat in Qinghai royal jelly."
On the 26th, Zhang Jianxun, deputy director of the Industry and Information Administration of Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Qinghai Province, said.
On the same day, the "Tongxin War Epidemic Spring Pulp to Help Farmers" live delivery event for bee products was held on the Qinghai Lake, and the China Bee Products Association, representatives of entrepreneurs, bee farmers and other parties gathered to introduce Qinghai characteristic bee products. A total of nearly 10,000 bottles of Qinghai Plateau royal jelly were sold online and offline, with a total delivery amount of nearly 3.8 million yuan.
The picture shows bee farmers demonstrating bee products.
It is reported that the live-streaming and delivery activity uses the Beijing Houde Gift Bee Industry chain network, fast hand, Taobao and other well-known domestic bee products retail enterprises, live streaming and e-commerce platforms to promote the exchange and cooperation of "enterprises + bee farmers + growers", and continues to issue "Qinghai Plateau spring pulp consumption vouchers" to consumers through online and offline channels, with an estimated total annual profit of nearly 5.28 million yuan.
In this regard, Yan Na, president of Beijing Houde Li Bee Industry Co., Ltd. thought it was "very worthwhile": "This move will expand the visibility of Qinghai bee products, attract more consumers to understand and like bee products without adding pure nature, and drive bee farmers to increase their income."
At present, the company has signed a production cooperation strategy agreement with Qinghai Yun Bee Industry Co. Ltd. and Qinghai Huabao Bee Industry Joint Stock Cooperation Company, hoping to jointly promote the rapid development of the local bee industry in Qinghai.
The picture shows the rapeseed sea along Qinghai Lake.
This spring, due to the need to set up road checkpoints for epidemic prevention and control, the way of bee farmers "chasing flowers for honey" was blocked. Many bees died due to missing the flowering period and lack of food, and the income of bee farmers was seriously affected.
"Throughout the year, bee farmers travel long distances following the flowering period, moving all the way north from Yunnan and Sichuan to the northwest. They live in the open, unsettled and very hard.
As businesses, we have a responsibility to help them.
Tina said.
"Small bees are 'environmental scouts', and bees in heavily polluted areas can't survive," said Zhao Xiaochuan, executive vice-president of the China Bee Products Association.
At the same time, honeybee pollination can improve crop yield and quality, especially in areas with widespread cultivation and poor management conditions, pollination is of greater significance.
Research data show that pollination can increase rapeseed production by about 15-30%.
The picture shows Zhao Xiaochuan (right), executive vice president of China Bee Products Association, introducing Qinghai bee products.
"The economic, ecological and social benefits created by bee pollination far exceed the value of bee products themselves. The bee industry has great potential in human health, crop production, vegetation reproduction and ecological protection, which has been poorly understood."
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
Today, the number of beekeepers is less and less. In addition to the perennial bee farmers, there are still many poor households with limited mobility who choose to share in cooperatives with beehives.
"The state has financial support, and we contact technical personnel to help guide. Bee farmers lack understanding and judgment of the market environment. To open a market, they also need the help and coordination of the government, enterprises and industry associations."
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
"I hope you will pay more attention to and help the beekeeping community in the future," she said. "Our bee products are also screened and controlled strictly in accordance with national standards, ensuring quality, and protecting the rights and interests of consumers while helping bee farmers."
Under the influence of continuous rainfall, since July 22, the soil on the back edge of the Zhongbao landslide in Liujing Village, Zhongtai Formation, Wulong District, Chongqing, has cracked, causing a large area of slip deformation, completely blocking along the Canghe River, forming a barrier with a water level of 13 meters in front of the dam and an estimated water capacity of about 550,000 cubic meters in the reservoir.
In order to ensure navigation safety, the maritime department of Chongqing decided to implement temporary traffic control from the boundary stone plate of the Yangtze River to Guanyin Beach.
According to the monitoring by the Chongqing Department of Meteorology and Hydrology, moderate to heavy rains have been common in the central, western and northeastern regions of Chongqing since the 25th, with heavy and locally heavy rains in some areas.
Luojiang Xiaohe Dam Station will have the highest water level on the night of the 26th, and the highest water level is close to the warning level.
In order to ensure navigation safety, the maritime department of Chongqing decided to implement temporary traffic control from the boundary stone plate of the Yangtze River to Guanyin Beach.
After an urgent meeting between the Chongqing Municipal Prevention Office and the departments and units of meteorology, water conservancy and hydrology, the Chongqing Flood Prevention and Drought Control Command decided to issue the Grade III early warning information of river floods and launch the Grade III emergency response to flood control.
The Chongqing Flood Prevention and Drought Control Command requests that the counties of Jiangbei, Shapingba, Hungnan, Wulong and other districts of Chongqing and the relevant member units of the Chongqing Prevention and Drought Control Index should pay high attention to the rainwater situation, especially the changes of the rising water of the Yangtze, Jialing and Wujiang Rivers, analyze and study in advance, issue early warning, strengthen inspection and duty, resolutely and decisively evacuate and transfer the people in threatened areas, mobilize emergency rescue teams and materials in a timely manner, deal with disasters (risks) quickly and efficiently, and avoid mass deaths and injuries.
Zheng Shixin, Minister Counsellor of the Vietnamese Embassy in Laos, the Vietnamese Buddhist Association in Laos, the Lao Vietnamese General Association, representatives of the Vientiane Provincial Government and the Lao Veterans Association participated in the laying ceremony.
The ceremony was held in a solemn atmosphere, with representatives offering incense to the heroes in memory of their great achievements and special ties of solidarity.
In his speech, Minister Counsellor Zheng Shixin said that this is an opportunity for the old Vietnamese and Lao people to jointly remember the revolutionary heroes of the two countries and jointly express their gratitude to the heroes who died for the independence and freedom of the two countries. It is also a good opportunity for the two peoples to recall that the two countries work together to fight the common enemy, strive for national independence, national reunification, jointly build national development and consolidate bilateral relations.
Seventy-four years ago, on January 23, 1946, 28 soldiers of the Lao-Vietnamese Combat Alliance died bravely while attacking the Phonehe position.
The victory of the attack became a historic victory for the two countries in the early stage of the revolutionary struggle for national liberation.
Ms. Zheng Shixin stressed that the two peoples will always remember all the heroes who died for the cause of the national liberation struggle of the two countries. At the same time, she stressed that the young areas of the two countries will continue to carry forward the heroic and strong tradition of their old predecessors and make due contributions to the continued blossoming and fruitful development of the relations between the two countries.

The statement did not mention the cause of the drone crash.
Israeli media reported that the drone may have broken down.
It is reported that Israeli Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gantz said during a visit to northern Israel that afternoon that in order to ensure its security interests, Israel will continue to take action against Syria and Lebanon.

Israel has repeatedly carried out air strikes against targets in Syria on the grounds of striking the group.
Liu Yunlong, the old face of spy drama, plays a stuttering hero.
Produced by Liu Yunlong, directed by Yin Fei and starring Liu Yunlong, Su Qing, Liang Guanhua, Li Liqun and others, the large-scale spy drama "Chance of Winning" landed on Guangdong Television's "Dynamic Theatre" at 7: 30 p.m. on July 16.
The play tells the story of Tang Fei (Liu Yunlong), an underground member of the Communist Party of China lurking in the Japanese fake police station, who joins forces with Soviet agents to assassinate the leader of Japanese agents and crush the shocking plot of the Japanese.
Chances of Winning is based on historical facts, and the material is taken from the dusty Soviet military archives for many years.
During the defense of Moscow, the elite of the Soviet Red Army in the Far East advanced westward to assist, at which time the "northward advance" of the Japanese Kanto Army thought it was an opportunity and intended to send troops.
In order to alleviate the danger of being exposed to the enemy, the Communist Party of China and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union jointly implemented the "Mudanula" project.
According to this historical background, the famous screenwriter Deng Yuan has polished several times, making the plot twists and turns to burn his brain.
Liu Yunlong served as both producer and lead actor in "Chance of Winning" this time.
In the play, he plays Tang Fei, the Chief of the Criminal Section of the Linhe Police Department, who is a very happy and even a little ruffian stuttering police officer, whose real identity is an underground member of the Communist Party of China.
The heroine, Cai Meng, who plays opposite him, is the head of the Linhe Security Bureau, who is deeply appreciated by the Japanese superior, Fuyuan, and has an ambiguous and delicate relationship with Tang Fei.
Su Qing has experimented with many different types of characters in recent years, from Lu Ruowen in "Those Years We Are Young" to Er Qing in "The Yanxi Strategy", which have impressed the audience and recognized her acting skills.
This time Su Qing and Liu Yunlong are partners for the first time. The stuttering sheriff with the charming policewoman set-up is quite interesting and innovative.
In addition to the two main characters, Liang Guanhua, Li Liqun, Qian Bo, Lei Han, Shen Junyi and other solid actors joined the cast in "Chances of Winning." The old drama is also one of the viewing points of the play.
It is understood that "Chance of Winning" is also very well produced, with the crew shooting nearly 2,000 kilometers across Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Liaoning provinces.
In order to restore the strange urban style of the period of Japanese rule in Northeast China, the props team of the production crew worked day and night to carefully polish every detail of the scene construction and props, so as to make the scene picture delicate and rich in historical texture.
Flooding in two provinces in western Yemen kills 16
Xinhua News Agency Kuwait City, July 26 (reporter Nie Yunpeng Wang Wei) Sana'a News: Local Yemeni media reported on July 26 that Hodeida and Hajjah provinces in western Yemen were hit by heavy rainfall, and floods have killed at least 16 people in the past 48 hours.

Yemen's health system has nearly collapsed as a result of years of military conflict.
According to statistics from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, more than 1 million people have been infected with cholera in Yemen and more than 2,000 have died since 2017.
Yemeni medical institutions fear that continued flooding could lead to a renewed cholera epidemic.
"Strike of the Jedi" is a dream life in the boxing ring.
Directed by young director Gao Zhuangzhong, the online film "Strike of the Jedi" starring Liao William, Dongyu, Yang Xinyi, Wang Yibo and others was officially released at Aki Arts.
The film tells the story of fallen boxer Venus returning to the ring and fighting for dignity, and shows a hot-blooded and reckless dream journey.
The film "Strike of the Jedi" takes Thailand as the main plot and takes "Thai boxing" as the starting point for the fallen boxer Venus to pursue his dream. The whole story is based on the adaptation of traditional Chinese cultural values. Whether Venus decided to fight fake boxing for his master in the early stages, or the later efforts to reinvigorate the fight for dignity with the support of friends and lovers, all show the pursuit and great love of men for family and dreams in traditional Chinese culture.
Combining with the classic Hollywood sports film story mode and the strong joint efforts of the professional teams of China and Thailand, The Jedi Strike not only presents an international effect, but will also impress different types of viewers.
At the same time, "Jedi Strike" shows a lot of Thai boxing fighting and training plot, the scene is intense and hot-blooded.
In the film, the game designer Zhang Xiaoliang, played by Dongyu, helps Venus, played by William Liao, return to the ring and take off the crown through the fighting game, combining novel and interesting high-tech with the hot-blooded competitive competition, and also shows the brotherhood between Zhang Xiaoliang and Venus, which seems to be "different" and actually has the same goal.
In addition, the long-flowing love between Venus and Jingjing is also very touching. Jingjing's silent support for Venus and Venus's firm commitment to Jingjing let the audience see the "iron man's tenderness" on Venus, which also added a lot of human feelings to the down-and-out boxer.

Green Area Launches a New Round of Mixed Reform Proposed Transfer of 17.5% Shares by Shanghai State Investment - Economic Observation Network - Professional Financial and Economic News Website
Economic Watch Network reporter Rao Xianjun on July 26, Greenfield Holdings (600606.SH) issued the "Indicative Notice that state-owned shareholders intend to agree to transfer part of the company's shares and resume trading by means of public solicitation of the transferee".
The contents of the announcement show that, in order to further deepen the reform of state-owned enterprises, optimize the structural adjustment of state-owned enterprises and improve the ownership structure of green space, Shanghai Real Estate (Group) Co. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Shanghai Real Estate") and Shanghai City Investment (Group) Co. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Shanghai City Investment") intend to transfer some of the shares held by the transferee by agreement through public solicitation, and the total proportion of shares to be transferred shall not exceed 17.5% of the total share capital of green space.
The price of the proposed transfer of shares shall not be lower than the higher of the following: the arithmetic average of the daily weighted average price of the first 30 trading days of the indicative announcement date (July 27, 2020); and the audited net asset value per share of the company in the most recent fiscal year.
At present, there is still uncertainty about the new strategic investors in greenfield. According to the information published in the announcement, it is estimated that the new strategic investors need to pay about 14 billion yuan to take the 17.5% stake transferred in the mixed reform of greenfield.
It is worth noting that after the completion of the share transfer, it is expected that Greenfield still has no controlling shareholder and actual controller, but the control structure may change greatly.
Since its inception, Greenfield Holdings has carried out a number of institutional and institutional reforms: from 1992 to 1997, it operated in accordance with market-oriented rules under the purely state-owned system; from 1997 to 2013, it established and continuously improved the state-owned holding and employee-owned shareholding system; from 2013 to 2015, it introduced strategic investors to form a mixed ownership system in which state-owned and non-public capital are cross-held and integrated; and from 2015 to the present, it has been listed as a public company.
Greenfield's current reform plan is similar to that of Glee. In December 2019, Zhuhai Mingjun, led by Gaoyi Capital, took over a 15% stake in Glee Electric (000651.SZ) at a cost of 41.662 billion yuan, and Glee Group retired as a minority shareholder. After completing the reform, Glee Electric implemented modern enterprise management methods such as executive incentive plan and no real control structure.
Shanghai real estate and Shanghai city investment are all state-owned enterprise groups wholly owned by the Shanghai SASAC. Zhang Yuliang, chairman and president of Greenfield Holdings, said that the Greenfield move is an important measure for Shanghai to promote the comprehensive reform of state-owned enterprises and accelerate the reform of state-owned enterprises in the new phase, in accordance with the requirements of the Party Central Committee, and fully demonstrates the new ideas of reform adapted to local conditions and tailored to local conditions. By introducing new excellent strategic shareholders to listed companies, support enterprises to further improve the degree of marketization, enhance the freedom of operation and management, and accelerate the comprehensive release of reform vitality.

US White House adviser "backbites" states back to work too soon
White House advisers "bite back" on states returning to work too soon
On July 23 local time, the number of confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia in the United States exceeded 4 million, accounting for 30% of the global cases.
For months, US President Donald Trump has repeatedly asked states across the country to return to work and school, but only recently changed his attitude and took the initiative to wear masks in public, while his advisers "bitten back" that some state governments returned to work too early.
On the 22nd, White House presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway said at a press conference that some state governments had not complied with the return-to-work standards and had reopened places such as bars prematurely.
Conway also referred to the previous claim that the president had "absolute authority" to decide on the return to work in the states as a false rumor.
"The president is a federalist. He believes in state autonomy."
She defended Trump.
However, what Conway called a "rumor" came from Trump himself during a White House briefing on the pandemic on April 13.
This self-facing operation has been ridiculed by netizens as "rewriting history".
Kellyanne Conway wants to rewrite history. She's a liar.
Trump called Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer a dictator because she followed medical guidelines and insisted on a work stoppage.
Trump wants to push for a return to work so he can hold a rally.
This is not the first time Kellyanne Conway has been controversial.
On April 15, in an interview with Fox News, Conway blurted out, "This is COVID-19, not COVID-1, friends!"
She seems to understand "19" as a version number, which has been ridiculed by netizens: read the newspaper without common sense!
Recently, we have seen the impact of cyberattacks on the business world.
Data leaks from companies like JPMorgan Chase, Yahoo, Home Depot and Target have resulted in hundreds of millions, or even billions, of dollars in losses.
With a few more such attacks, the entire world economy would collapse.
The public sphere is not immune.
From 2012 to 2014, the United States Office of Personnel Management experienced very serious data breaches.
Security clearances and fingerprint information were stolen, affecting 22 million employees.
You may also have heard that some government-funded hackers are trying to use stolen data to influence election results in some countries.
The last two were large-scale data theft from the German Bundestag and email theft from the Democratic National Committee.
Cyber threats have affected our democratic process.
And there is a growing trend.
The more advanced computer technology is, the more vulnerable the means we use to protect data will be.
In particular, a new computer technology, called quantum computer, uses natural microparticles to greatly increase the computing power of the computer.
Its computing power is powerful enough to crack many of the encryption systems we use today.
So are we hopeless?
Should we start packing up our electronic survival gear for the coming data apocalypse?
I don't think we're there yet.
Quantum computers still exist only in the laboratory, and it will be years before they are actually used.
More importantly, there have been many major breakthroughs in the field of encryption.
For me, this is a very exciting era in the history of secure communications.
About 15 years ago, I learned that we had unlocked new skills to create quantum effects that do not exist in nature, and I was very excited.
The idea of using the basic laws of physics to advance the development of encryption technology thrills me.
Today, a number of selected companies and laboratories, including mine, have advanced this technology to the stage of practical application.
That's right.
We intend to use quantum against quantum.
How can this be achieved?
First, let's take a quick look at the world of encryption.
You need a briefcase. You have some important documents to give to your good friend, James Bond. Lock them up and keep them safe.
Because these materials are top secret, we're going to use a super-advanced briefcase.
It is equipped with a special password lock, which, once locked, converts the contents of the file into random numbers.
So you just put the file in, lock it, and by this time the file has been converted to a random number, and you give the briefcase to James.
When the briefcase hasn't arrived yet, you call and tell him the password.
Once he got the briefcase, entered the password, the file was deciphered perfectly, and you successfully passed an encrypted message to James Bond.
(Laughter) It's a fun example, but it illustrates the three key points of encryption.
Cryptography - we call it encryption keys.
You can think of it as a password.
The phone call that told James the code.
We call it secret key delivery.
This ensures that we can safely deliver the secret key to the specified location.
and locks used to encrypt and decrypt files.
We call it an encryption algorithm.
Through the secret key, it converts the contents of the file into random numbers.
A good algorithm can do this, and it is difficult to crack the password without the secret key.
The importance of the algorithm is that if someone gets the briefcase and opens it, without the secret key, without knowing the encryption algorithm, they can't read the contents of the document.
All we got were random numbers.
Most security systems rely on the secure way of passing the secret key to the correct place.
However, the rapidly growing computing power threatens many of the secret key delivery methods we currently use.
As an example, we now use a very extensive system called RSA.
When it was invented in 1977, it took about 4 trillion years to crack a 426-bit RSA secret key.
In 1994, only 17 years later, the code was cracked.
With more and more powerful computers, we need longer and longer passwords.
Now we often use 2048 or 4096-bit passwords.
As you can see, there is a battle going on between the cryptographer and the decrypter, both trying to defeat each other.
Over the next 10 to 15 years, the arrival of quantum computers will more quickly crack the complex mathematical algorithms that underpin the encryption systems we use today.
In fact, quantum computers will turn our safe castle into a touch-down house of cards.
We'll try to protect our castle.
In recent years, many research institutions have emerged to study how to enhance encryption with quantum effects.
Some exciting breakthroughs have been made.
Remember the three key points of encryption? High-quality secret key, secure key delivery, and strong algorithms.
However, advances in science and engineering have jeopardized two of these priorities.
The first is the secret key.
Random numbers are the basis of the secret key.
But today, they are no longer really random.
At present, we generate the secret key, which is generated by software according to the frequency of random numbers, which we call pseudo-random numbers.
There are always some, perhaps less obvious, rules in the numbers generated by programs or mathematical methods.
The less random these numbers are, or in technical terms, the lower they contain, the easier they are to predict.
Recently, some casinos have been attacked in creative ways.
They filmed the slot machines for a while and then analyzed them.
Cybercriminals use reverse engineering to create a pseudo-random digital generator behind the turntable.
This gives them a good chance of predicting the turn of the turnaround and making a lot of money.
The secret key is equally insecure.
Having a real random number generator is important for generating secure passwords.
For years, researchers have been trying to create truly random digital generators.
But most designs are either not random enough, not fast enough, or difficult to reuse.
But the quantum world is truly random.
It is important to take advantage of this true randomness.
Devices capable of measuring quantum effects can generate a continuous stream of random numbers very quickly.
The casino crime just said is no longer possible.
Several universities and companies from around the world are focusing on making real random digital generators.
In my company, our Quantum Random Digital Generator was born from an optical table 2 meters long and 1 meter wide.
Then we reduced it to the size of a box.
Today, it can be installed on a PCI card and plugged into an ordinary computer.
This is the fastest, truly random number generator in the world.
By measuring quantum effects, it can generate 1 billion random numbers per second.
Today, it has been widely used around the world to improve the security of cloud service providers, banks and government agencies.
(Applause.) But even with a real random digital generator, we face a second major cybersecurity threat: the secure delivery of secret keys.
The current secret key transmission technology can not fight against quantum computers.
The quantum solution to this problem, called quantum secret key distribution, or QKD, takes advantage of one of the fundamental counterintuitive properties of quantum mechanics.
Observing this behavior of a microparticle changes the particle.
Let me give an example to illustrate.
Let's look back and give the code to James Bond.
This time, however, instead of calling him, we used the quantum effect to carry the code with a laser beam through an ordinary optical fiber to James.
Let's assume Dr. No wants the code.
Fortunately, Dr. No will leave an electronic fingerprint in his attempt to intercept this quantum secret key, which James and you can detect.
In this way, the intercepted secret key will be invalid.
The secret key left behind can provide powerful protection for the data.
Because this security mechanism is based on the basic principles of physics, it is impossible for a quantum computer, or any future supercomputer, to crack it.
My team and I are working with many top universities and the defense sector to improve this exciting technology and develop the next generation of security products.
The Internet of Things heralds a highly interconnected era, with 25-30 billion devices expected to be connected to the Internet by 2020.
Trust in these interconnected device systems is essential if our society is to function properly in the world of the Internet of Things.
We believe that quantum technology will be very important in building this trust. It will ensure that we fully enjoy these magical innovations and enjoy these innovations that will enrich our lives.
Thank you all.

Is it reasonable for a 3-year-old child to sue the university after being smashed in the playground?
2020-07-26 05: 01: 11 Source: Legal Daily Author: Wang Sishu Responsible Editor: Wang Sishu
Children sue school after playground smashed
- Zhao Yifan, correspondent of this newspaper
Three-year-old Xiao Wen was accidentally hit in the head by Chen Mou of the softball team while pitching while playing on the playground of a university.
After Chen Mou's compensation, Xiao Wen's father, Mr. Wen, as Xiao Wen's legal representative, sued the school to the court, demanding that the school where the playground was located apologize, and pay a total of 20,000 yuan in compensation for medical expenses and moral damage.
Recently, after hearing the case, the Haidian District People's Court of Beijing concluded that the school had set up a protective net in the playground at the time of the incident, that it had fulfilled its appropriate safety and security obligations, and that Chen had made compensation, according to which the judgment rejected the plaintiff's claim.
Mr. Wen complained that during the 2019 summer vacation, he took Xiao Wen to play on the school playground while the softball team was training on the playground.
In order to avoid the resulting risks, Xiao Wen, Mr. Wen and many other children and parents operate in the safe area designated by the softball team.
But then softball team member Chen Mou took off his hand while pitching, causing the softball to fly over the net to the above-mentioned safe area and hit Xiao Wen in the back of the head.
Mr. Wen immediately took Xiao Wen to the hospital for treatment and was diagnosed with head trauma.
Mr. Wen was of the view that the facilities of the school stadium did not comply with the relevant safety regulations and did not effectively manage the team and related facilities.
The school's negligence led to the above-mentioned events, which caused Xiao Wen to suffer great physical and mental suffering, as well as greater suffering to his family, for which the school should bear legal responsibility.
In response, the school argued that the school had set up a protective net in the playground and posted management regulations and training notices informing people to enter the playground at a safe distance from the training site and reminding them of their own safety. The plaintiff could not prove that the school had "failed to fulfil its safety and security obligations" and therefore did not agree to compensation.
After the hearing, the court held that the site of the incident was open to the public free of charge by the university involved. Although the school has a safety and security obligation to the management of the playground, this safety and security obligation only needs to meet the general duty of care.
At the time of the incident, the school set up a protective net in the playground, which had fulfilled its appropriate safety and security obligations, and Chen Mou also compensated Xiao Wen for more than 2,000 yuan in losses such as medical and transportation costs in accordance with the previous compensation agreement. The two sides agreed to settle the dispute at one time.
Later, Xiao Wen's parents again claimed compensation from the school, which was not based on the law, and the court ruled to reject all the plaintiffs' claims.
Neither party appealed the verdict, which is now in effect.
According to Article 37 of the Tort Liability Law of China, schools, as administrators of public places, have safety and security obligations; in cases where the actions of a third party cause damage to others, the third party bears the tort liability, while the administrators of public places who fail to fulfil their safety and security obligations shall bear the corresponding supplementary responsibilities.
The judge stated that since, as the manager of a public place, he is most likely to know the actual situation of the whole place, to anticipate the possible dangers and damage, and thus to take the necessary measures to prevent the loss or mitigate the extent of the damage, and the cost of avoiding and mitigating the damage is the lowest, the law stipulates that he shall bear the corresponding guarantee obligation to engage in social activities.
In this case, for the non-specific group of people who enter the playground open to the public free of charge, the safety and security obligations of the school should be commensurate with the social activities it engages in. In particular, it should mainly take basic safety measures and have the obligation to inform the hidden dangers.
In judicial practice, it is not appropriate to impose excessive safety and security obligations on the managers of public places.
If the school has taken measures to set up a protective net and fulfilled its obligation to inform, it can be concluded that the school is not at fault and should not bear legal liability.
In addition, with regard to the infringement of the third party, even if the administrators of schools and other public places fail to fulfil their safety and security obligations, their liability is also a supplement to damages. According to the newly promulgated Civil Code, after assuming the supplementary liability, the administrators can also recover compensation from the third party.
Therefore, in such accidents, after the victim has received compensation from the direct infringer, the scope of claim should not be expanded.
Today I want to show you how we make things in the future.
I believe that soon our buildings and machines will be able to assemble, replicate and repair themselves.
So I would like to show you what I think is the current state of manufacturing and then compare it with some natural systems.
So in the current manufacturing industry, we have skyscrapers - 500,000 to millions of parts in two and a half years, very complex, using new technologies in steel, concrete and glass.
We have exciting machines that can take us into space - five years, 2.5 million parts.
But on the other hand, if you look at natural systems, we have two million types of proteins that can fold in 10,000 nanoseconds, and we can replicate DNA with three billion base pairs in about an hour.
This is the complexity of our natural systems, but they are very efficient, more efficient and more complex than anything we can build.
They are more energy efficient.
They rarely make mistakes.
They can repair themselves and live long.
There's a super interesting thing about natural systems.
If we can transform it into our built environment, then the way we build things has great potential.
I think the key is self-assembly.
If we want to use self-assembly in our own physical environment, I think there are four key factors.
The first is that we need to decode all the complexity of what we are building - that is, our buildings and machines.
We need to decode them into simple sequences - basically the DNA in which our buildings work.
Then we need the programmable part that can accept the sequence and be used for folding or reshaping.
We need some energy to activate so that these parts of us can fold according to the program.
We need some types of error correction redundancy to ensure that we succeed in building what we want.
So I would like to show you some of the projects that my colleagues and I are working on to achieve this self-assembled future.
The first two projects were MacroBot and DeciBot.
These projects are large-scale reconfigurable robots - 8-foot, 12-foot-long proteins.
They are embedded in electromechanical devices, sensors.
You need to decode the way you want to fold into, decode into a series of angles - negative 120 degrees, negative 120 degrees, 0 degrees, 0 degrees, 120 degrees, negative 120 degrees - things like that; a series of angles, or turns, that can be wired to pass the order.
Each cell gets its own message - such as negative 120. It rotates to check that the rotation is in place and then passes the sequence to its neighbor.
There are many outstanding scientists, engineers and designers working on this project.
I think this project really reveals: Is this really scalable?
I mean, it costs thousands of dollars for a lot of people to build this eight-foot robot.
Can we really expand it? Can we really embed robots in every part?
The next question is to look at passivity, or passively trying to make the reorganization programmable.
But it goes a step further by trying to make practical calculations.
Basically embedded in the basic building module of most calculations, the digital logic gate, directly into each part.
This is the door to Africa.
Each door to be used for the calculation has a tetrahedron and two input tetrahedra.
One is input from the user, like you're building a brick.
The other is the input of a brick placed before coming.
It then gives the three-dimensional output.
This means that users build bricks the way they want.
It makes calculations based on what has been done before and your instructions.
Now it begins to move in three-dimensional space - up or down.
Looking to the left, the input of [1,1] is equal to zero output, indicating down.
On the right, the input of [0,0] is 1 output, indicating up.
So what this really means is that our structure now contains the blueprint we want to build.
So information about what you want to build is all embedded in it.
This means that we have some form of self-replication.
In this case, I call it self-directed replication because your structure contains a precise blueprint.
If you encounter an error, you can replace a part.
All the local information is embedded in it, telling you how to fix it.
So you have something that you can climb and read it and output one by one.
It is directly embedded; there is no external instruction input.
The last project I'm going to show is called the eccentric chain, which is probably the most exciting example of the passive self-assembly system we see now.
Its reconfigurability and programmability make it a completely passive system.
Basically, you have a series of elements.
Each element is identical, and they are eccentric.
Each chain, or each element, wants to turn right or left.
If you want to assemble a chain, you need to program it.
Tell each unit whether to turn left or right.
When you shake the chain, it folds up to program whatever structure you encode for it - so in this case, a helix, in this case fire, two connected cubes.
Basically, you can program <unk> in three-dimensional space - or in one or two dimensions - and the chain is completely passive.
What does this portend for us?
I think this tells us about the possibility of this self-assembly, self-replication, and self-repair in our body structures, our buildings, and machines.
There is new programmability in these sections.
From this you can get new possibilities for calculation.
We will have space to calculate.
Imagine our buildings, bridges, machines, all the bricks can actually be calculated.
What amazing parallel and distributed computing capabilities and new design possibilities.
This is an exciting potential.
I think the projects I have shown you are only a small step towards the future if we implement these new technologies for a new self-assembled world.
Thank you. Thank you.

Under the normalization of epidemic prevention and control, people's enthusiasm for sports and fitness is high.
With the gradual liberalization of inter-provincial tourism business, the tourism market is about to recover.
Fujian Province resumed inter-provincial tourism business from July 21, and Xiamen, as a popular tourist destination, welcomed the peak of passenger flow in the first weekend after its opening.
As a popular tourist destination city, many tourists arrive in Xiamen on weekends.
Xiamen Railway Station expects to send 3.7 million passengers during the summer transport, while the airport's passenger flow is dominated by students, tourism and family visits.
The tourism market is gradually warming up. In July, Xiamen Airport operated an average of 440 flights a day, and domestic flights have returned to 80% of their pre-epidemic level.
Airlines have encrypted the air express routes from Xiamen to Shanghai, Beijing, Kunming, Xi'an and other major cities to seize the tourism market after the recovery.
At present, many travel agencies in Xiamen have successively launched a number of domestic cross-provincial summer travel products, and the team's itinerary is mainly outdoor attractions.
In response to the summer passenger peak at railway stations and airports, relevant units have deployed additional personnel to guide and guide check-in counters, security check-in passageways and other areas where people easily gather. Fujian has also optimized and upgraded the "Bamuan Health Code", thus realizing the sharing and mutual recognition of health data with 31 provinces, and promoting the orderly recovery of the tourism market.
Andy Lau Can Liu Qingyun "Remove" the New Spark?
"Bomb Destroyer Expert 2" recently announced that it will be released on December 24, becoming the first film to be scheduled for the New Year.
The second part is still directed by Qiu Litao, produced and starring Andy Lau, with a new story.
It is reported that the addition of "nuclear bomb" elements in the second part also makes the challenge faced by the bomb disposal experts more difficult. The preview contains several startling glimpses of the scene, which has left the heart hanging, the mushroom cloud of the big explosion, the airport engulfed by the fire, the scene is quite shocking.
Three years ago, "Bomb Demolition Expert", produced by the original team, won the first box office in May of that year, and won seven nominations at the Hong Kong Film Awards. Qiu Li Tao × Andy Lau also became the gold medal partner in the eyes of the audience.
This time, "Bomb Destroyer Expert 2" also makes people look forward to whether this ace combination can wipe a new spark.
Bomb Demolition Expert 2 tells a whole new story: former bomb disposal expert Pan Yingfeng (Andy Lau) fainted at the scene of the bombing and was listed as a suspect by the police.
In order to find the truth, he has to ask his friend Dong Zhuowen (Liu Qingyun), who is also a bomb disposal expert, for help.
The female supervisor eager to solve the case, who is also Pan's ex-girlfriend Pang Ling (Nini), is also involved.
He is still a bomb disposal expert, but the complexity of Andy Lau's new role can be felt from the filed trailer: he broke a leg, wore a prosthetic limb, was chased by Liu Qingyun, who is also a bomb disposal expert, and was directed by his ex-girlfriend Nini.
What kind of relationship between the three, what Andy Lau did in the Fragrant Island Hotel, what kind of case he was involved in, and what kind of ups and downs his career as a bomb disposal expert has experienced, various mysteries make people curious.
It is understood that the main scenes of the film are the field filming of the world landmark buildings in Hong Kong, combined with the top special effects production team, which brings a shocking and realistic visual impact.

July 26 is the Russian Navy Day. The main military parades to celebrate the Navy Day were held in St. Petersburg and Kronstadt.
Russian President and Supreme Commander of the Russian Armed Forces Vladimir Putin arrived in Kronstadt to participate in the celebration, where 15 ships and submarines were reviewed.
On July 28, 2019 local time, a grand military parade was held in St. Petersburg, Russia to celebrate the Naval Day.
It is reported that Putin congratulated the naval officers and soldiers on Navy Day, and took a small boat in the Gulf of Finland past the ships that will take part in the naval review, and then reviewed the troops on the main observation deck.
Putin said that the Russian naval fleet is equipped with the latest type of ships and special equipment, and the level of equipment is constantly improving.
"The Russian naval fleet has warships equipped with high-quality weapons, strategic diving cruisers and multi-purpose submarines, the latest aircraft and other aircraft, unique weapons and special equipment," Putin said at the Russian Navy Day military parade.
On June 24 local time, a military parade on Red Square was held to commemorate the 75th anniversary of Russia's victory in the Great Patriotic War.
He also said that the Russian naval fleet will rely on digital and effective defense means to gain unique advantages.
It is reported that the main naval parade to celebrate Russian Navy Day was held in St. Petersburg and Kronstadt, with the participation of 46 ships, including the frigate "Admiral Kazatonov" and the large anti-submarine "Vice Admiral Kulakov", as well as large landing ships, small missile ships, frigates and submarines.
Among them, the series of ships were on static display next to the Winter Palace Bridge in St. Petersburg, the most notable of which was the reproduction of the first Russian battleship in the early 18th century, Poltava.
In order to avoid the spread of the new virus, only local residents and special guests will be able to enter Kronstadt during this year's naval parade.
The last Sunday of July is Russian Navy Day.
Founder of Beijing Philharmonic Choir Yang Hongnian died at the age of 86.
Beijing News (reporter Liu Zhen) On July 26, the Beijing Philharmonic Choir published an obituary. Yang Hongnian, founder of the Beijing Philharmonic Choir, a famous Chinese conductor and music educator, a lifelong academic member of the Central Conservatory of Music and a professor of the Command Department, died in Beijing at 13: 55 on July 26, 2020, at the age of 86.
Photo from Beijing Philharmonic Choir official website.
Born in 1934, Yang Hongnian, a native of Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, has loved music since childhood.
He was the conductor of the choir of Nanjing People's Radio in 1951, and was admitted to the Music Department of East China Normal University in Shanghai in the autumn of 1951. He studied conducting under Professor Yang Jiaren and German conductor Hitzmann, and studied musical styles and polyphonic tunes by former Soviet expert Arzamanov.
In 1958, he taught in the Department of Music of the Beijing Art Normal College, and in 1973 he was transferred to the Department of Composition and Command of the Central Conservatory of Music.
Yang Hongnian founded the Beijing Philharmonic Choir in 1983.
Over the past 30 years, in keeping with the purpose of "love and dedication", he has led the choir to sing all over the world and won dozens of awards in important competitions at home and abroad.
He has conducted the performances of more than 30 groups, including the choir of the Central Orchestra, the Central Ethnic Song and Dance Ensemble, the Oriental Song and Dance Ensemble and the Shanghai Choir, and held a number of symphonic and choral concerts.
The works include "Band Training", "Choral Training", "Two Songs Writing", "Children's Songs" (the first and second volumes), "On the Problem of Choral Pronunciation", "On the Sound Level Layout of Orchestra Music", and translations of "Choral Instruments" and "Debussy's Harmonic Language".
Do you know how many medium flowering plants there are?
There are 250,000 species - at least as many as we know - and 250,000 flowering plants.
And flowers are a nuisance.
It's really difficult to breed plants.
It requires a lot of experience and a lot of resources.
Why is it so troubling?
The answer, of course, is that, like many other things in the world, gender.
I know what's on your mind when you look at these pictures.
The reason why sexual reproduction is so important is that plants can reproduce in many other ways.
It can be by means of cuttings; it can reproduce sexually in the same plant; it can be pollinated in the same plant.
But they do need to spread their genes and mix with other genes so that they can protect the environment.
That's how evolution works.
The way plants now transmit this information is through pollen.
Some of you may have seen these pictures before.
As I said, every family should have a scanning electron microscope that can see these.
There are as many different types of pollen as there are flowering plants.
This is actually quite useful for forensic medicine and so on.
Most of the pollen that causes hay fever comes from plants that use the wind to spread pollen. This is a very inefficient process, which is why pollen always runs into our noses.
Because most of them are discarded, it is hoped that the germ cells contained in the pollen, the male germ cells, will happen to fall on another flower.
All grasses, which means all grains, and most trees spread pollen by the wind.
But most species actually use insects to do this. To some extent, this is smarter because it doesn't require much pollen.
Insects and other species can carry pollen and transfer it directly to where it is needed.
Obviously, we notice the relationship between insects and plants.
This is a symbiotic relationship in which both birds and bees are rewarded, usually with nectar.
Sometimes this symbiosis can lead to wonderful adaptive changes - the little red-skirt moth is a beautiful adaptive change.
Plants were also harvested, and Tianjiao spread the pollen elsewhere.
Plants have evolved to create landing runways everywhere, and bees can get lost in them.
Many plants have markings that look like other insects.
These are the pollen sacs of lilies and are so ingenious that when an unsuspecting insect falls on it, it turns over and hits the insect's back with a lot of pollen so that it can follow the insect to other plants.
One orchid looks like it has a lower jaw. To some extent, it does; it forces insects to crawl over, touch the pollen, and take it elsewhere.
Orchids: There are at least 20,000 species of orchids - an amazing variety.
They have all sorts of tricks.
They must try and attract pollinators to help them through the process.
This orchid is called Darwin's orchid because it was studied by Darwin and he made a wonderful prediction when he saw it. A long nectar tube can be seen hanging from the orchid.
Basically what the insect has to do is - we come to the middle of the flower - it stabs the mouthpiece into the middle part all the way down the nectar tube to get the nectar.
Looking at the flower, Darwin said, "I guess something evolved with it."
Insects, no doubt.
When I mean, it's usually rolled up, but when it's stretched out, it looks like this.
Now imagine that if something so valuable as nectar is costly for plants to produce and attracts many pollinators, then, as in human sexuality, people might begin to deceive each other.
They might say, "I have some nectar. Would you like some?"
This is a plant.
This plant is popular with South African insects, which have evolved long mouthparts to get nectar at the bottom.
This is an imitator.
This plant is imitating the former plant.
There is a fly with a long mouthpiece that doesn't get any nectar from the impostor. Because the impostor doesn't give it any nectar. It thinks it can get it.
So, not only does the fly not get nectar from the fake plant, but if you look very close to the top of the head, you'll see some pollen there that will be spread to other plants if no botanist comes and sticks it to a blue card.
(Laughter) This lie is all over the plant kingdom.
This flower with black spots: They may look like black spots to us, but I tell you, to the male insect of the appropriate species, they look like two very, very sexy females.
(Laughter) When the insect arrives and lands on it, it immerses itself in the pollen, which, of course, it will take to other plants, and if you look at the images of the scanning electron microscope that every home should have, you can see that there are actually some patterns, three-dimensional patterns.
It can even make insects feel comfortable and looks good.
These electron microscope images - this is an orchid disguised as an insect - you can see that for our eyes, different parts of the structure have different colors and different textures, and insects may be able to perceive very, very different textures.
The orchid evolved to mimic the metallic luster seen on some beetles.
You can see this surface under a scanning electron microscope - it's very different from other surfaces we've seen.
Sometimes the whole plant mimics an insect, even if we look like insects.
I mean, I think it looks like some kind of flying animal or beast.
It's a wonderful and magical thing.
That's the cleverness of it. It's called obsidian.
I think it's cunning at times.
To the right kind of bee, this looks like another very aggressive bee. It flies over and hits it with its head many, many times, trying to get rid of it, which, of course, gives it pollen.
Another thing it does is that the plant mimics another orchid rich in insects' favorite food.
But there was nothing.
So it deceives on two levels - it's unbelievable.
(Laughter) What we see is ylang, the part with a strong smell.
Actually, I've smelled it before.
These flowers don't really need to be so showy.
They give off a wonderful aroma that attracts any interested insect.
The flower doesn't smell very good.
This flower actually smells very bad. Again, it's evolved. It looks like carrion.
So flies like it.
Flies fly in and pollinate them.
This is the white star sea potato, also known as the dead horse sea potato.
I don't know what a dead horse smells like, but this flower may smell very similar.
It's just horrible.
The green-headed fly can't help itself.
Fly into it, all the way into it.
To lay eggs on it, thinking it was a good piece of carrion, not realizing that there was no food for the eggs, the eggs would die here, but at the same time the plant would benefit because the hard hair loosened and the flies disappeared and pollinated to another flower - it was wonderful.
This is the potato plant, the European potato, the variegated aroma, which is known as the extended-age grass in this country.
I shot this in Dorset last week.
This guy heats up about 15 degrees above the ambient temperature - incredible.
If you look inside it, behind the ears of meat is something like a dam, and the flies are attracted by the heat - it's a boiling volatile chemical, the worm - and they're trapped under this container.
They drink the sweet nectar and then they all become a little sticky.
At night, they are covered with pollen, sprayed down by them, and then the hard hairs we see on them wither and allow these pollen-covered insects to escape - it's unbelievable.
If you think it's unbelievable, this one is my favorite.
This is green velvet with spring feathers.
Everyone here from Brazil should know about this plant.
This is the most magical thing.
Its stamens are about a foot long.
It has an ability that no other plant I know of has, and when it blooms - this is the middle ear of the meat - for about two days, it produces some degree of metabolic change somewhat similar to that of mammals.
It does not have starch, which is plant food, and it has something very similar to brown fat that burns it at the rate of burning fat and metabolizes it, about the rate of a kitten.
By weight ratio, it's twice the energy output of a hummingbird - absolutely amazing.
It has also done some unusual things.
Not only will it warm up to 155 degrees Fahrenheit, 43 or 44 degrees Celsius for two days, but it will remain constant.
There is a temperature regulation mechanism for keeping the temperature constant.
Why do you do this? I heard you ask.
As you don't know, some beetles like to mate at this temperature.
They go in and they're covered in pollen.
(Laughter) Plants sprinkle them with pollen and let them leave to pollinate.
What a wonderful thing this is.
Now we think most pollinators are insects, but in fact, in the tropics, many birds and butterflies also pollinate.
Many tropical flowers are red because butterflies and birds are similar to us, and we think we can see red very well.
But if you look at the spectrum, birds and us, we see red, green and blue see this spectrum.
Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet light. They can see all kinds of bright and dark ultraviolet light.
There's some color behind it.
"Wouldn't it be nice if we could see those colors," I heard you ask.
Yes, we can see it.
So what do insects see?
Last week I took pictures of these desert lotus, the half-day flower, in Dorset.
As we can see, these are small yellow flowers, which are everywhere.
It looks like this in visible light.
It looks like this if you remove the red.
Most bees cannot perceive red.
Then I put a UV filter in front of my lens for a long exposure at a specific UV frequency and got this picture.
It's like a real, wonderful target heart.
Now we don't know exactly what the bees see. When I call it red, you know what I'm looking at.
We can't know what's going on, whether it's insects or other human brains.
But the contrast looks like this. It stands out from the background.
This is another small flower - located in different ultraviolet frequency ranges, with different filters to match different pollinators.
It probably looks like that.
Lest you think all yellow flowers have this property - no damage to the flower during the shoot; just stick it to the tripod and don't take it off - in ultraviolet light, look at this.
This can serve as a basis for sunscreen, which works by absorbing ultraviolet light.
So perhaps the chemicals are of some use.
Finally, this is a nocturnal fragrance sent to me by Bjorn Rorslett of Norway - a wonderful hidden mode.
I like this way of hiding.
I think it's very poetic. These photos were taken with ultraviolet filters, the main use of which is for astronomers to take pictures of Venus - actually the clouds on Venus.
This is the main use of this filter.
Of course, Venus is the god of love and fertility, which is the language of flowers.
Just as flowers spend so much energy trying to attract pollinators to accept their invitation, they somehow succeed in convincing us that there is a wealth of content in it. We send flowers to each other at birth and death, especially at weddings, and when you think about it, it's the moment genetic material moves from one organism to another.
Thank you very much.

Chongqing, July 26 (reporter Liu Xian) Chongqing Municipal Development and Reform Commission released news on July 26 that the city has so far returned 4,404 fishermen, accounting for 42.54% of all fishermen involved.
Li Daiguo, 53, said in an interview with CNN.com that his grandfather had been fishing in the Longxi River since he was 11 years old. He followed his father to fish, rocked his boat and walked along the Longxi River, up to Liangping in Chongqing and down to live a long life. Every time he left home, he lived for ten days and a half months, relying on fishing to support his family.
However, since 1997, with the gradual influx of the rural population into the town, there have been more and more residents in the town, causing more and more serious environmental pollution.
Paper mills, chemical plants and breeding farms have been built along the Longxi River, which also pollutes the river.
By 2007 and 2008, the Longxi River had become a smelly ditch.
"The scales of the fish caught are black, and when cut open, they are black inside."
Li Daiguo said fishing became more and more difficult after the river was polluted.
The local area began to make great efforts to control the pollution of the Longxi River, including cleaning and floating, river patrol, management and protection of aquatic resources, etc.
Li Daiguo also retired from fishing to production and became a member of the river patrol team to protect aquatic resources.
As of January 1, 2020, the Chongqing Aquatic Biological Reserve and the relevant waters of the main city have been completely banned from fishing.
According to the data of the Chongqing Municipal Development and Reform Commission, so far, Chongqing has accumulated 3,403 fishing vessels and 4,643 fishing vessels that have signed fishing agreements, accounting for 63.3 per cent and 86.3 per cent of the total three-year tasks, respectively.
There are 4,404 retired fishermen, accounting for 42.54% of all fishermen involved.
Of the 4,404 retired fishermen, 4,267 were employed, accounting for 96.89 per cent of the retired fishermen.
Old-age insurance covered 2,691 people, accounting for 61.10 per cent of the retired fishermen.
As a next step, Chongqing will carry out in-depth special remediation actions, accelerate the clean-up and improvement of shoreline utilization projects in the main stream of the Yangtze River, complete a new round of survey of sewage discharges into the river of the Yangtze River and carry out corresponding remediation actions, basically complete the task of "three phosphorus" (referring to phosphate ore, phosphorus chemical industry and phosphorus gypsum banks), clean up and rectify small hydropower, promote special actions for afforestation and greening on both sides of the Yangtze River, strengthen the construction of green mines, consolidate the results of the special control of illegal wharves and illegal sand mining in the main stream of the Yangtze River, and deeply promote the work of banning and returning fishing in the Yangtze River basin.
Israel strengthens the prevention and control of repeated epidemics

Israel strengthens prevention and control of repeated outbreaks
At the beginning of the outbreak of the new crown pneumonia, Israel's prevention and control measures were effective.
However, with the gradual lifting of the ban on prevention and control measures, the number of confirmed cases of new pneumonia in Israel has increased significantly recently, and the Israeli Government has repeatedly taken urgent measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On February 28, the first case of coronavirus pneumonia was confirmed in Israel itself. As a result, Israel quickly took measures to close all entry and exit points, suspend non-essential industries, switch schools to online classes, restrict public transport and non-essential social activities, block cities with serious outbreaks, and jointly maintain prevention and control measures.
This series of measures quickly achieved positive results, and by mid-May, the number of new confirmed cases of pneumonia in Israel in a single day had fallen to single digits.
With the epidemic under control and the complete lifting of all prevention and control measures in Israel, the number of new confirmed cases of crown pneumonia has gradually rebounded since June.
Especially since the beginning of July, the spread of the epidemic has been accelerating.
In recent days, the number of new daily cases in Israel has been more than 1,500 for eight days, and as of July 25, the number of new cases reached 916.
As of July 25, Israel had 59,745 confirmed cases and 448 deaths.
In the face of the rapid rebound of the epidemic, the Israeli Government has repeatedly taken urgent measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On July 6, after the number of confirmed cases exceeded 30,000, the Israeli government closed gyms, swimming pools, bars, nightclubs and other places of public entertainment, and introduced a policy of restricting public transport, stipulating that the maximum number of passengers per bus should not exceed 20.
On the 17th, the Israeli government announced a series of new restrictions, including the implementation of "city closure" on weekends, stipulating that "city closure" should be implemented from 17: 00 every Friday to 5: 00 every Sunday.
During this period, people may go out, but places such as shops, shopping malls, hairdressers, beauty salons, libraries, zoos, museums, exhibition galleries, swimming pools and tourist attractions will be closed, while places of basic services such as supermarkets and pharmacies will remain open.
At the same time, gatherings of more than 10 people are prohibited on all days and hours, gyms, studios and other places will be closed, restaurants and cafes will be banned from eating, and only take-out services will be allowed.
At the same time, the Israeli people have not paid enough attention to the seriousness of the epidemic and have failed to form joint efforts with the government in combating the epidemic.
After repeated outbreaks in Israel, many people took to the streets to protest because the government's prevention and control measures affected their own economic interests.
On July 11, tens of thousands of people demonstrated in Tel Aviv, arguing that the anti-epidemic policy affected the economy.
On the evening of the 21st, thousands more protesters gathered in front of Prime Minister Netanyahu's official residence in Jerusalem to protest against Prime Minister Netanyahu's promulgation of preventive and control measures such as banning restaurants and coffee halls without providing corresponding compensation.
In addition, many people also failed to observe the rules of wearing masks and maintaining a safe social distance of two meters during outdoor activities. In order to avoid being fined by the police for not wearing a mask, many people only wore masks on their chin or hung them on their wrists.
During the repeated epidemics, the school was a major disaster area for the spread of the new crown virus, and according to a recent visit to the kindergarten by journalists, it was found that the teachers and students of the kindergarten did not wear masks as required by the government, nor did they maintain a safe social distance of two meters from each other, laying hidden dangers for a large number of teachers and students to be infected with the virus.
Professor Elie Waxman, a member of the Advisory Panel of Anti-epidemic Experts of the Israeli National Security Council, believed that Israel was moving towards a "dangerous situation", pointing out that the current measures taken by Israel to prevent and control the epidemic were not enough, and that all places of leisure and recreational activities and summer schools should be closed in order to control the further spread of the epidemic.
Waxman said that Israel lacks an overall plan to combat the epidemic, and that all departments of the parliament and government should abandon their respective interests as soon as possible, reach agreement on combating the epidemic and formulate clear steps that include relevant restrictions in different sectors.
TEL AVIV, July 25, Tel Aviv correspondent Wang Chung
Wu Fengfang, a farmer in Guyuan, Ningxia, couldn't overcome his old companion, Dai Tianfu, and the two people drove from their home 20 miles away to the Liang Yun Cultural Compound.
Despite the inconveniences of the past two years, 77-year-old Dai Tianfu is still looking forward to "coming here every other day to have a fun addiction."
This is a humble courtyard in Yuanzhou District of Guyuan City. Unlike the general agricultural courtyard, the courtyard often comes out with a melodious Qin cavity, as well as colorful shadow plays, embroidery works, traditional Qin cavity, eyebrow Hu opera and so on.
The owner of the compound was Liang Yun, a former carpenter.
More than 10 years ago, loving shadow and singing, he began planning the construction of a cultural compound.
With the Liang Yun Cultural Compound, the cultural life of the villagers has become colorful.
Before the reporter entered the Liang Yun Cultural Compound, the tunes of the Qin Dynasty had been passed out.
It is Berry Xiang, a villager from a neighbouring village, who is singing a selection of Qin passages for the villagers.
She has loved Qin Cai since she was a child, and now has a small local reputation. As long as she has free time, she will come to the cultural compound to perform programs for the villagers.
Recently, Berry also played a live webcast.
Paris said: "It's a very happy thing to have a stage to let more people see their performances."
On the stage, the singers one by one, the players one by one tune, although they are amateurs, but the enthusiasm does not diminish.
Like the simple style of the Nongjia Academy, outside the Qin Dynasty, the "grass-roots" art and non-legacy culture in the Liang Yun Cultural Academy came from the front.
The compound also contains more than 300 items of agricultural tools of different ages, traditional and hand-made tile, paper-cut, embroidery, shadow and other physical objects.
Liang Yun led the reporter into the exhibition hall in the courtyard, which showed his collection of old objects, old wine jugs, three strings, spinning wheels and so on.
Why does an ordinary farmer build a cultural compound?
"Shadow acting is my family craft, and I've been learning it since I was 15."
Established in 2012, the Liang Yun Cultural Compound became the first "intangible cultural heritage exhibition hall" in rural Ningxia and a demonstration compound for the protection of intangible cultural heritage in Guyuan City.
In addition to the Liang Yun Cultural Compound, more than 120 cultural compounds and 79 folk performance groups have emerged in the Yuanzhou District of Guyuan City. Among them, there are more than 50 cultural compounds of a certain size, such as the Shenjiahe Cultural Compound, the Wang Yonghong Cultural Compound and the Yang Lang Cultural Compound, covering towns and streets in the Yuanzhou District, with more than 5,000 performers.
These grass-roots artists are active in the fields, enriching the cultural life of the masses and meeting their spiritual needs.
"As life gets better and better, traditional culture can't just be left behind."
"Liu's Impossible War Drama" Returns to "The Chance of Winning" to Watch Liu Yunlong and Li Liqun's "Play" - Xinhua
The 40-episode ultimatum battle drama "Chance of Winning" will land on Beijing TV from July 16.
"Chances of Winning" is based on real historical facts and is based on the dusty Soviet military archives, which appeared for the first time in many years.
Actor Liu Yunlong, known to the audience as "spy drama", broke through his image in the play and challenged a very happy "stuttering agent".
In recent years, the popularity of plays such as "The Pretender," "The Mask" and "The Kite" has proved that spy drama has exuberant vitality.
Unlike previous espionage works, "Chance of Winning" looks at the world and extends the setting of the story to the Far East battlefield of the Soviet Union.
Set against the background of the final stage of the Anti-Japanese War in 1944, it tells the story of Tang Fei (Liu Yunlong), a secret intelligence worker of the Communist Party of China, under the leadership of the Secretary of the Linhe Provincial Committee of the Chinese Underground Party and the Director of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Agency, carrying out the "Mudanura" strategy operation of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Agency.
In many espionage dramas, the hero, as a senior spy, appears as a handsome, high intelligence and mature perfect image.
But in Liu Yunlong's view, such a person is not suitable to be a spy. "A spy should be the kind of person who can't be found in the pile of people. If the appearance is that kind of handsome image, I hope everyone should pay attention to you, can you still lurk? There is a line in" Kite ", 'If you don't catch me, I forget that I am a Kuomintang', and the spy should go elite."
So in "The Chance of Winning," Liu Yun Long ingeniously designed his hero Tang Fei as a "stuttering agent" with a sense of joy.
The other camp in "Chances of Winning" is supported jointly by Fukuhara, a Japanese played by Liang Guanhua, and Fang Shibao, director of the police bureau, played by Li Liqun.
One south, one north and two strong actors added a lot of tricks to the whole drama.
Director Yin Fei used the word "drama" to describe the opposite of Li Liqun and Liu Yunlong in the play. "It is definitely a drama, the two of them have a special tacit understanding, and this kind of tacit understanding on them is very influential to me. A lot of times their plays are 'hanging', for example, we only wrote half a page of paper, and they can play all the time without stopping when I shoot."
The masters do not rob the play, the director does not disturb the play. When the actors are in the role and ensure their own character state, they can not only shape the character from the perspective of the character, but also bring more viewing possibilities to the audience. Yin Fei said that such a play is brilliant enough.
In the play, you can also see many familiar faces in the "Liu Impossible War Drama", the famous and majestic "Mountain City F4" in "Kite", and three in "Chance of Winning".
Hou Yong and Liu Mingyang, who had played Song Xiaoan and Zhao Jane Zhi, played Tang Fei's right arm again.
Director Yin Fei introduced, "There is no evil in these two people, they just drift with the tide in that era, that environment."
Liu Yunlong also took the initiative, "We should have a human face. This human face means that there must be good and bad people around me, and bad people are enemies, but we should also develop them and strengthen our team."
The ending of the two people in the play was also carefully designed by Liu Yunlong, who believed that he would give the audience a satisfactory answer.

Four students drowned in A Rongqi, Inner Mongolia Official: The incident sounded an alarm
China News Network Hulunbuir, July 26 (reporter Li Aiping) On the evening of July 25, the reporter learned from the government of the city of Hulunbuir, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, that four local students drowned.
At 15: 50 on July 24, Ah Rongqi Public Security Bureau 110 received a police report that six local junior middle school students drowned.
After receiving the police, the local civilian police rushed to the scene the first time and rescued two students on the spot. Subsequently, the local emergency bureau, the water conservancy bureau and other units arrived at the scene and participated in the rescue all the way.
According to the report, more than 80 people were deployed at the rescue site, including public security police, forest police, fire control and medical care, three rubber boats were sent to continuously salvage the surrounding waters, and professional rescue teams were hired to arrive at the scene and conduct underwater search through sonar detection.
Reporters learned that local rescue workers found the first student killed at 6: 40 on July 25, the second student killed at 11: 30 on July 25, the third student killed at 12: 40 on July 25, and the last student killed at 13: 34 on July 25. After being rescued, the above four people were identified by the local 120 emergency center as having no vital signs.
Officials said the drowning was a wake-up call for the whole society.
At present, the relevant departments of the local government are collating some drowning prevention knowledge, hoping that the tragedy will not happen again.
Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 25 (Xinhua)) The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury of the HKSAR Government, Xu Zhengyu, said that Hong Kong's financial markets remained active and operated in an orderly manner.
He expressed optimism about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
Speaking at an online seminar jointly organised by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Toronto and the Hong Kong-Canada Chamber of Commerce (Canadian Association) on the 24th (Toronto time), Mr Hui said that Hong Kong was experiencing a difficult situation due to the "law correction wave" and the new pneumonia epidemic.
The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is stable and biased towards the strong party exchange guarantee level.
There are no clear signs of capital outflows from the banking system; on the contrary, more than $11 billion has entered since June.
The total amount of bank deposits has also continued to increase in the past few months. The stock market has a series of public offering fund-raising activities, and market transactions have risen repeatedly.
Hui said that the new pneumonia outbreak has put pressure on the global economy and financial markets, but Hong Kong's basic advantages remain unchanged.
Hong Kong's many advantages, including geography, the rule of law, high-speed communications, the free flow of information and capital, and a simple and low tax system, have made Hong Kong a leading international financial centre.
Mr Hui pointed out that the HKSAR Government had set aside HK $6 billion in the "Epidemic and Anti-epidemic Fund" to create about 30,000 time-bound jobs in the public and private sectors over the next two years, covering people with different skills and qualifications.
To support the development of financial technology, the HKSAR Government has also launched the "Thousand Talents Plan" to subsidize local financial technology companies, start-ups and other enterprises with financial technology-related business, with a view to creating 1,000 new jobs, employing local talents and enriching Hong Kong's financial technology talent pool.
Looking ahead, Xu expressed optimism about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
He encouraged Canadian enterprises to make full use of Hong Kong's advantages and its position as an international financial centre, an international asset and wealth management centre and a global offshore RMB business hub to develop and invest in the Greater Bay Area of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao and the surrounding areas.
Lancet article praises China's anti-epidemic efforts and encourages countries to learn from experience
As a country with a population of 1.4 billion and a scale similar to that of Europe or the United States, China has effectively controlled the new epidemic at this stage, without further widespread transmission, and has largely controlled the epidemic in the country, The Lancet said in its 25th issue.
The article said that in the past decade or so, China has invested heavily in domestic research and public health construction, which has made China much more prepared for the new crown than it was for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
The authors say that at the time of the SARS outbreak in 2002, China was initially ill-prepared, especially as the pathogen could not be identified.
When the new crown virus was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists were soon able to identify the type of virus and shared the genome sequencing data with the international community on January 11, 2020.
By the end of January, doctors from mainland China and Hong Kong had clarified the clinical characteristics of the virus and warned the world of the threat of the new crown virus through research papers published in The Lancet.
China has also always been at the forefront of vaccine research. Under the declaration of a national emergency and through close domestic cooperation, such research has been carried out very quickly and rigorously. In May and July, respectively, the results of the progress made in the early trials of the new crown vaccine developed by China were published in The Lancet.
China's experience has shown that it is very important to invest in the national health and research system and effectively improve laboratory capacity.
This is the basis for a rapid and effective national response to health emergencies and global health security.
Other countries, especially low- and middle-income countries, are well worth learning from.
In addition, China's experience has proved that, on the basis of strong research, strong high-level officials must make correct decisions decisively on the basis of scientific evidence in order for the new epidemic to be effectively controlled.
The article stressed that the government and its leaders must respect science, understand its value and act on it in the best way for society.
At the beginning of the outbreak, China's National Health and Construction Commission sent three groups of infectious disease experts to Wuhan to investigate the risk and spread of the new crown virus, and their suggestions provided the basis for the decision to "seal off" Wuhan on January 23. When the experts put forward the necessity and urgency of building a square cabin hospital, the government quickly made a decision and implemented it quickly. At the same time, the extensive participation of the community and the masses also enabled the epidemic to be controlled quickly and effectively.
Finally, the article emphasizes that in response to the global health emergency, countries need to strengthen global cooperation and joint response.

The dead were either a female occupant of the hit house and two passengers on the small plane.
A two-year-old child in the room sustained only minor injuries and was safely rescued.
The remaining occupants of the house were not injured in the accident, but their emotions have not yet recovered.
The scene footage reported by the German news agency showed that smoke billowed from the house in the accident, and serious damage was seen after firefighters put out the fire.
At present, the cause of the plane crash is unclear.
The Rhine Post, quoting police, reported that there were clues that the plane had disintegrated before hitting a residential building.

The Ministry of Health of Singapore announced on the 26th that as of 12: 00 on the same day, there were 481 new confirmed cases in Singapore, with a total of 50,369 confirmed cases and 27 deaths.
The data showed that five of the new confirmed cases were local community cases, four were imported cases and the rest were foreign workers living in special dormitories.
Singapore's Ministry of Health says 98% of the new confirmed cases are related to known infections.
At present, 173 new crown patients are still being treated in hospitals, most of them are stable or improving, and no one is in the intensive care unit.
In addition, 4,648 people were isolated in community facilities.
Foreign workers account for the vast majority of new infections in Singapore.
According to statistics, there are 200,000 foreign workers living in 43 special dormitories for foreign workers in Singapore, and about 100,000 foreign workers living in other types of dormitories.
The Singapore government is stepping up testing for the last few dormitories dedicated to foreign workers with a high rate of new infection, the Singapore anti-epidemic inter-departmental working group said recently.
After completing the testing of all special dormitories, the vast majority of foreign workers will be able to return to work, but they still have to be tested for new crowns on a regular basis.
Director Dapeng's "Ruyi" is nominated for the Golden Viscount Award
On July 18, the 23rd Shanghai International Film Festival announced the official list of films selected for the Golden Viscount Award.
Director Dapeng's first realistic theme film, "Ruyi", was successfully nominated for the Golden Viscount Award at the current Film Festival, and the film officially released its first poster.
Poster for Photos
The film "Ruyi" is the first realistic theme work of director Dapeng, and it is also his second marriage with the Golden Viscount Award.
The film tells the story of a comedy film director who, on a whim, returned to his hometown in the northeast countryside, hoping to turn his family's New Year into a literary and art film.
The family members gathered for the film finished the final party.
In the film poster released today, a member of the family, "Uncle Wang" Jixiang, sits in the middle of the picture smoking, with the silver-clad northeast black land in the background, and the red lanterns that Chinese must hang for the New Year's Day in the foreground.
The red lantern, which symbolizes celebration and reunion, forms a huge contrast with the lonely Wang Jixiang, which also seems to reveal the complexity and entanglement in the relationship between this large family.
It is reported that in the film, except that the daughter of "Third Uncle" Wang Jixiang is played by actor Liu Lu, the other scenes are completed by the real director's family. The film's experimental audio-visual style breaks the boundary between drama and reality, and brings the audience a brand-new immersive viewing experience.
According to director Dapeng, the creation of "Ruyi" originated from "a providence". During the filming period, a series of sudden changes in the family forced the original shooting plan to be changed. Life without a script was finally recorded as a film, but the tension beyond the design was released.
Director Dapeng how to face this "providence" after all, and how to continue to meet the changes brought about by this providence?
There is no doubt that "Ruyi" is full of experimentation. The almost vegetarian lineup and innovative audio-visual style have turned life in front of the camera into a film. Under the package of real images, the audience will also find the shadow of themselves and their families from the family presented in the film, and with the end of this family gathering in the film, arouse a series of thoughts.
NEWS.GOV.MO: Enquiry Hotline Statistics of the COVID Response Coordination Centre (08H00 on July 25 - 08H00 on July 26)
From 08H00 on July 25 to 08H00 on July 26, 2020, the enquiry hotline of the COVID Response Coordination Centre received 292 calls.
The 291 enquiries on the epidemic were immediately forwarded to the representatives of the relevant departments for follow-up. The situation is as follows:
271 cases by the Health Bureau (involving: enquiries on isolation; enquiries on nucleic acid testing; enquiries on two places; health codes; other).
17 cases of Public Security Police (involving: Enquiries on immigration measures; Enquiries on entry and exit measures for licensed vehicles in Guangdong and Macao; Enquiries on Zhuhai Administrative Hotline; Enquiries on document stay issues).
MGTO 1 case (involving: enquiring about quarantine hotels)
1 case by the Education and Youth Affairs Bureau (involving: Enquiries on the methods of Macao students returning to the United Kingdom to study).
Marine and Water Bureau 1 case (involving: asking whether Hong Kong fishing vessels need to declare to the Marine and Water Bureau and nucleic acid testing related matters when entering Hong Kong).
At the Badong Zhuokang outpost, platoon commander Yu Wang and a soldier stood guard on duty.
In this place where the average annual temperature is more than ten degrees below zero, a row of simple barracks stands at the mountain pass. A national flag is flying in the wind not far from the barracks. The soldiers stand guard in the wind every day, while they have to regularly patrol higher elevations.
The soldiers had to use their hands and feet to climb the steep slope of the rubble.
It was late July, when flowers and grass flourished in low-altitude areas, and in Bawang Chaokang, only the trenches behind the barracks were relatively dense green.
Gao Peng, a soldier who had been stationed at the outpost for six years, pointed to the trench and said it was their back garden. Only in July and August of each year could the grass grow slowly, and soon after, it turned yellow and covered with snow.
Foot patrols can take about nine hours.
In the harsh plateau environment, the soldiers stationed here are accompanied by snowy mountains and glaciers all year round, and they also regularly patrol the higher-altitude passes.
A few days ago, the patrol composed of eight soldiers, led by the instructor Liang Yixin, took the patrol road again.
Each soldier carried a weight of about 30 jin and headed for the target point early in the morning.
On the way, a soldier rebelled and his comrades-in-arms rushed to the rescue.
In addition to patrol tasks, the soldiers at the Badong Chaokang outpost have to conduct tactical and physical training every day.
Time passed by minute by second, rising altitude, lower and lower oxygen content, constant physical overdraft, these factors tested the will of the patrol members.
They clenched their teeth and persisted, crossing several landslides and crossing several dangerous beaches.
At around 16: 00, it was lunch time for the patrol. They took out their own dry food and sat on the ground at an altitude of more than 5,700 meters, accompanied by sleet and snow, to supplement their strength with food.
The soldiers at the Bayonjokang outpost conducted tactical and physical training.
During the break, they will play cards together, and the losers will do push-ups, which can be both recreational and physical.
After a short break in the cold wind, they climbed to the target position of the patrol, took out the national flag on the pass and made a solemn oath.
Behind them are snow-capped mountains, in front of them are dozens of kilometers of no man's land, they are the safest guardians of the country.
Restart of the Beijing Consumption Season
Beijing will restart the activities of the Beijing consumption season in accordance with the principle of "comprehensive restart, key planning, orderly promotion and strict organization".
On July 26, 1.5 million government-owned enterprises consumption vouchers were issued, including 1 million offline catering vouchers and 500,000 smart product vouchers, which consumers can collect at the Jingdong APP.
Liu Meying, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce, said at a media briefing held on the 25th that the consumption season after the restart will further reduce the capital allocation of enterprises on the basis of maintaining the existing preferential subsidy of consumer vouchers and card bags.
Since the beginning of August, the current 1: 1 allocation of capital by the government and enterprises has been adjusted to 2: 1. For example, if consumers receive a card bag to spend in the store, they can enjoy 120 yuan of preferential treatment, including 60 yuan of government subsidy and 60 yuan of interest by enterprises; after the adjustment, 80 yuan of government subsidy and 40 yuan of interest by enterprises.
During the consumption season, the three major operators will subsidize traffic and terminals around 5G consumption, further promoting Beijing's new 5G infrastructure and new 5G consumption.
Mr Chan said Hong Kong's economy has been hit by the renewed outbreak of the epidemic and called on all sectors to share difficult times.
Hong Kong, July 26: The Financial Secretary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, Mr Chan Mau-po, said on July 26 that Hong Kong is facing the impact of a new wave of pneumonia, and business transactions and economic activities that had seen a slight recovery have also been hit.
The HKSAR Government once again called on major small business owners to reduce rent and share the difficult times with retailers, restaurants and small and medium-sized enterprises.
On the same day, Chen Maobo published an article entitled "The rugged road to recovery" on the Internet.
He said that the recent high number of confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia in Hong Kong posed a serious situation, affecting the livelihood of the community and disturbing the economy.
When the epidemic is repeated, the first priority is to strictly prevent imported cases, deal with and break the chain of virus transmission as quickly as possible. When the epidemic is under control, economic activities should be resumed in a timely and corresponding manner.
He pointed out that in the face of the impact of the new wave of the epidemic, business transactions and economic activities, which had seen a slight recovery, had also been hit.
For the business community, in addition to the spirit of contract, social responsibility is equally important, especially for those groups that have received large government subsidies under the Employment Protection Scheme.
He mentioned that Hong Kong's economic situation was still very serious in the second quarter of this year, but the trend of contraction seemed to slow slightly.
On the export side, he believed that Hong Kong's external situation was still serious.
Chan said that Hong Kong's development over the past decades has shown that every crisis hides new opportunities and every difficulty hides the key to future development.
A few years ago, on a winter morning in Johannesburg, South Africa, I was driving to work when I found the city shrouded in haze.
I drive past there almost every day, but this is unusual. I've never seen such a sight before.
Johannesburg is famous for its unique and beautiful skyline, but it was almost invisible that morning.
I soon realized that what I saw was a severe haze caused by air pollution.
The contrast between the beautiful environment I used to know and the hazy skyline now surges in my heart.
I worry that it is likely that the once colorful sunset will be swallowed up by the dark haze.
At that moment, I felt a strong urge to do something, but I didn't know what to do.
All I know is that I can't just stand by.
The biggest challenge is that I don't understand environmental science, air quality management, or atmospheric chemistry.
I'm a computer engineer, and I'm pretty sure I can't solve air pollution problems by coding.
(Laughter) In what capacity will I solve this problem?
I'm just a city kid.
Over the next few years, I have learned an important lesson that we should all keep in mind if we want to achieve a better future.
Even if you are not an expert in a particular field, your professional skills may contain solutions to problems in that area.
Sometimes your unique perspective can inspire unconventional thinking to shape the situation, but you need to be bold to try.
Only then can you know the outcome.
What I knew at the time was that if I wanted to try to change, I had to know enough about pollution first, so I became a student again.
I did some basic research and soon learned that air pollution is the biggest environmental health risk in the world.
According to data from the World Health Organization, in 2012, almost 14% of deaths worldwide were caused by air pollution in and around homes, especially in low- and middle-income countries.
Air pollution causes more deaths each year than malaria and AIDS.
In Africa, premature deaths caused by unsafe sanitation, or deaths caused by child malnutrition, are powerless in the face of air pollution, with huge economic costs: more than $400 billion was spent in 2013, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
In my work, I explore the scientific and technological achievements of artificial intelligence, including the symbiotic relationship between humans and machines, find useful foothold and help us make better decisions.
When I think of the problem of air pollution again, it becomes clear that we need to find a better way to make a better decision. Considering the magnitude of the problem, it is necessary to work together.
So I decided to meet some people who work in this field.
I began talking to officials in Johannesburg and other surrounding cities, I joined the local science community, and I made some phone calls to completely unfamiliar but relevant people.
These experiences in which I began to intervene have helped me to gain a deeper understanding of the issue.
It also helped me avoid the trap that people in my industry sometimes fall into when trying to innovate: quickly adopt a technology before they really understand the problem.
I began to think, what can I do to improve the situation?
I began to ask myself how I could effectively integrate my knowledge and skills in software engineering and artificial intelligence with the professional skills of the people I contacted.
I want to create an online air quality management platform to reveal future pollution trends and make relevant forecasts to judge possible outcomes.
I am confident that my idea can be a realistic solution, but in the face of uncertainty, I cannot guarantee that it will succeed.
All I have is a specific set of engineer skills, the skills I have gained from my work. (Laughter) Of course, my skills are new to people who have been working in the field of air pollution for years.
I've come to realize that sometimes a novel perspective, a new skill set, can lead to something remarkable.
Our willpower and imagination are a beacon for us to overcome obstacles and open a new chapter.
After I had a deeper understanding of the problem of air pollution and found the air pollution data of the past 10 years, as well as the meteorological data of Johannesburg and its environs, I created the Air Quality Resolution Support System with my colleagues in South Africa and China and uploaded it to the clouds.
The software can analyze historical and real-time data to reveal trends in pollution over time and space.
We then used new machine learning techniques to predict future pollution a few days in advance.
This means that residents can make better decisions about their daily itineraries and where to settle with their families.
We can predict adverse pollution events in advance, define serious sources of pollution, and enable the relevant authorities to issue instructions to adjust their business activities.
By supporting scenario planning, urban planners can also make better decisions on how to expand infrastructure work, such as residential resettlement in industrial zones.
We have set up a pilot of the technology, which ran for 120 days and covered the whole of South Africa.
Our expected results were validated. The forecast data we demonstrated showed a close correlation with the data we collected in the field.
Through our management, we introduced the world's leading cutting-edge instruments to predict air quality with unprecedented resolution and accuracy, benefiting the city I drove into on a recent winter morning, when I said to myself, "Something's wrong. I have to find a way to do something."
So the point is: What if I hadn't studied the problem of air pollution in depth?
What if instead of paying attention to the environmental situation in the country, I hope that some place, some other person will take charge of these things?
What I have learned from this is that it is important to focus on the possibility of success and consider the consequences of inaction when fully advancing a cause in which we all believe.
We should not be distracted by opposition and resistance; it should inspire us to go further.
So no matter where you are in the world, the next time you find that some of your natural curiosity is aroused and it's about what you want, you have some crazy or brave ideas, even if it's not your field of expertise, ask yourself: Why not try?
Why not go ahead and solve the problem? Do your best, in your own way?
You may get a surprise.
Thank you all.

The largest earthquake in Taiwan this year occurred in the eastern waters of Taiwan.
TAIPEI, July 26 (China News Service) - An earthquake measuring 6.1 on the Richter scale occurred in the eastern waters of Taiwan at 20: 52 on July 26, with the largest magnitude of 4, felt throughout Taiwan, making it the largest earthquake in Taiwan this year.
Taiwan's meteorological department reported that the epicenter of the earthquake was located 86.5 kilometers southeast of the Yilan County Government, that is, in the eastern waters of Taiwan, with a depth of 53 kilometers.
The China Earthquake Network measured the earthquake as 5.5.
The largest earthquake in all parts of Taiwan was magnitude 4 in Hualien County, magnitude 3 in Yilan County, Taidong County, Nantou County and Yunlin County, and magnitude 1 to 2 in other counties and cities.
Taiwan's meteorological department pointed out that the earthquake is the largest subduction zone earthquake in the whole of Taiwan this year, which belongs to the boundary of the plate. Its epicenter has often occurred in the past and has been relatively active since this year.
In the coming week, it is still not ruled out that there will be aftershocks of magnitude 4 or more.
Many people think that driving is something that only those who can see can do.
Blind people want to drive a car safely alone until now, it is also considered an impossible task.
Hello, my name is Dennis Hong, and we built a car designed for people with visual impairment problems for the freedom and independence of the blind.
Before I talk about this car for the blind, let me briefly talk about another project I've done called the DARPA Urban Challenge.
This is about building a mechanical car that you can drive yourself.
You press the start button without touching anything, and it can reach its destination completely automatically.
At the 2007 Challenge, our team won $500,000 and finished third.
Around that time, the National Association for the Blind, or the Blind Association, challenged the design team about who could design a car that would allow blind people to drive safely and independently.
We thought we were going to try it, because we thought, well, where's this going to go?
We already have an automatic car.
All we have to do is let the blind drive inside, and that's not over, is it?
(Laughter) But we're wrong.
What the Blind Association wants is not a car that can drive blind people around, but a car that blind people can take the initiative to make choices and drive.
So we had to give up everything we had and start from scratch.
To test this crazy idea, we designed a prototype of a small sand truck to test its feasibility.
In the summer of 2009, we invited many blind young people across the country and gave them a chance to use the car for a ride.
It was definitely a cool experience.
But the problem with the car is that it is designed only to allow blind people to drive in a very limited environment, like a closed parking lot - even on a path made of red traffic cones.
So with this success, we decided to take the important next step of building a real car that can drive on real roads.
So how does it work?
Well, this is a relatively complex system, but let me explain it and simplify it.
We have three stages.
We have an induction phase, a computational phase and a non-visual interface.
The driver is clearly invisible, so the system must be able to perceive the surrounding environment and collect data for the driver.
At this point, we use the initial metering element.
It measures acceleration, angular acceleration - like the human ear, the inner ear.
I combined this information with GPS to predict the position of the vehicle.
We also use two cameras to detect the path of the car.
We also use three laser rangefinders.
The laser scans the environment to detect obstacles - vehicles passing from the front and rear, as well as any obstacles that break into the road, any obstacles around the vehicle.
All the massive information is then aggregated into the computer, which does two things.
First, one thing is to process information to understand the surrounding environment - which are driving paths and which are obstacles - and translate that information to the driver.
The system is also very intelligent to calculate the safest driving path.
We can also issue instructions on how to operate the operating procedures of the vehicle.
But the question is: How can we transmit information and instructions to a blind person fast and accurate enough to make sure he can drive?
To this end, we have designed many different non-visual user interface technologies.
The original three-dimensional flat sound system, vibration vests, sound-controlled gears, leg straps, and even shoes that put pressure on the feet.
But today we're talking about three of these non-visual user interface technologies.
The first interface is called the driving handle.
This is a pair of gloves that have vibration elements in the knuckles so that you can transmit instructions on how to drive - direction and amplitude.
Another device is called a velocity shock belt.
This car chair - actually, it's a massage chair.
We take it out and we reorganize the vibration elements in different modes. We let them transmit information about speed, as well as instructions on how to use the throttle and brakes.
Here, you can see how the computer understands the surrounding environment. Because you can't see the vibration, we actually install a red light-emitting diode on the driver, so he can see what's happening.
This is inductive data, which is transmitted from the sensor to the computer.
So these two devices, the driving handle and the speed shock belt, are very effective.
But the problem is that these are command cues.
So it's not really freedom, is it?
The computer tells you how to drive - turn left, turn right, accelerate, brake.
I call this the co-pilot problem.
So we are avoiding command implication devices and focusing more on information devices.
A typical example of such a non-visual information interface is called an empty graph.
Think of this as a display for the blind.
This is a small desktop with many holes in it from which compressed air is removed so that it can be described as a picture.
So even if you are blind and you put your hand on it, you can sense routes and obstacles.
In fact, you can also change the frequency of emissions in the air and possibly the temperature.
This is actually a multi-dimensional user interface.
Here, you can see the left and right cameras and how the computer parses and transmits this information to the empty map.
In this way, we are showing a simulation program in which a blind man is driving with a space map.
This program is very helpful in training blind drivers and quickly testing different theories based on different types of non-visual user interfaces.
That's basically how it works.
But the car is a model car, and it won't be on the road unless it proves to be as safe as today's cars, or safer.
I really believe it will happen.
But are societies, are they receptive to this radical idea?
What shall we do with the insurance?
How will we issue a driver's license?
Behind the technological challenge, there are many different obstacles that we need to address before they become a reality.
Of course, the main aim of this project is to design a car driven by a blind person.
But potentially more important than this is the enormous value of the by-products of the project.
A sensor that can be used to see through darkness, rain and fog.
And with this new kind of interface, we can use these technologies to make them safer vehicles for the visual population.
Or for the blind, daily life on the home installation - educational facilities, office facilities application services.
Imagine that the teacher writes notes on the blackboard in class. Blind students can also use these non-visual interfaces to understand and read what the teacher writes.
This is extremely precious.
What I show you today is just the beginning.
Thank you very much.

Marinichev said the change in value was influenced by the devaluation of the ruble and the epidemic.
"The cost of services is increasing," he said.
Because of the epidemic, people are spending more time on the Internet.
Marinichev did not rule out a serious rise in Internet prices this year, arguing that operators could provide customers with higher speeds and more services to offset people's dissatisfaction with the price increases.
Chinese Doctors Prepare Tribute to Anti-epidemic Heroes
Recently, with the respect of the heroes of Chinese filmmakers in the fight against the epidemic, Yu Dong, chairman of Bona Film Group, and director Liu Weiqiang (pictured left) held discussions with Academician Zhong Nanshan in Guangzhou on the filming and production of the anti-epidemic film "Chinese Doctor".
Boehner Films hopes to pay tribute to all the medical and epidemic prevention workers fighting on the front line of epidemic prevention and control through "Chinese Doctors"!
In 2021, the film will be released nationally as a gift film to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.
At present, Bona Films, under the arrangement and deployment of the Central Propaganda Department and the National Film Bureau, and with the support of the Guangdong Film Bureau and the Hubei Film Bureau, has organized the original crew of the film Captain China to prepare the film Chinese Doctor, which is a film that reflects the unity of the people of the whole country in the fight against the new pneumonia epidemic under the strong leadership of the Central Committee of the Party.
Focusing on the front line of the fight against the epidemic in Wuhan, the film will take the Wuhan medical staff and the provincial and municipal medical teams assisting Hubei Province as the character background. From the perspective of human nature, the film will use a unique narrative and highly influential camera language to show the moving stories of Chinese medical staff on the front line of the fight against the epidemic full of dedication and sacrifice.
It is understood that in the first days after Wuhan was released from lockdown, Boehner overcame many difficulties and sent a team of photographers to go deep into the front line of the epidemic, face-to-face exchanges with hundreds of medical workers to understand and collect data. At present, it has interviewed academician Zhong Nanshan himself, the first person in Guangzhou to help Wuhan, the Guangdong medical team to help Hubei, as well as the white angels at the forefront of the anti-epidemic front, such as Wuhan Yintan Hospital, Wuhan Union Hospital, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University and Wuhan Central Hospital.
At the symposium, Academician Zhong Nanshan also raised expectations and hopes for the filming of the film: "I look forward to it. I hope you will not only visit some experts who have made more appearances, but also interview more medical personnel who have worked hard on the front line. They are the majority."
He said he had seen "Me and My Country" and "Captain China" before and thought it was a good way to tell big-pattern stories from the perspective of ordinary people.
"Now some foreign friends still have some misunderstandings about China."
Speaking about the dissemination of the film, Academician Zhong Nanshan said that at present, some people abroad like to label the virus as politicized. He hoped that the film would impress the audience from the perspective of humanity: "In addition to being shown in China, it would be better for the film to be shown abroad. It should be in a way that audiences at home and abroad can understand and impress the audience with the true humanistic spirit."
Academician Zhong Nanshan also affectionately recalled the film "Man to Middle Age" in the 1980s. "After so many years, I was most impressed by the film" Man to Middle Age "after the reform and opening up, when my doctor friends abroad watched and cried. It would be great if" Chinese Doctor "could play such a role."
Academician Zhong Nanshan said that if Chinese Doctors could resonate with foreign audiences, it would be a great success.
During the discussion and exchange, Academician Zhong Nanshan also shared his opinions and suggestions on the current international epidemic prevention and control. "I believe that people will always be smarter than the virus."
Academician Zhong Nanshan said that although the virus is difficult to predict, mankind has overcome a thousand difficulties and dangers since the primitive society. Today, modern society has developed medical technology and social management measures, and medical personnel and even people all over the world have a basic understanding of the scientific response to the new crown pneumonia epidemic. People will no longer be as passive as before. "Next, we should pay attention to two aspects of work, one is to study how to strengthen cooperation around the world, and the other is to pay attention to soothing people's hearts and minds."

Wen Travel "Red Fruit" Gathers Shaoshan - Xiangtan First Red Expo - Today's Highlights - Hunan Daily Network - Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily New Hunan Client Reporter Jiang Rui Correspondent Xiao Yan
Jiaxing red boat mold, Shaoshan bronze statue of Mao Zedong, Yan'an cloth pile flower crafts, Xiangxi Yongshun bacon... On July 25, the 2020 Hunan Red Tourism and Culture Festival opened in Shaoshan.
As one of the main activities, the first Xiangtan Red Cultural Industry Expo was launched at the Shaoshan All-Region Tourism Advisory and Distribution Center.
The exhibition area is full of red literary and creative products, local products and other special products from the old revolutionary areas, which attract tourists from all over the world to buy.
"The Red Fair is not only a display of the achievements of the national red cultural industry, but also an important platform for exhibitors and enterprises to exchange experiences and explore development paths."
The relevant person-in-charge of the Executive Committee of the first Red Expo in Xiangtan introduced that the theme of the Red Expo was "Promoting Red Culture to Boost the Warmth of Wen Travel". The total area of the exhibition was nearly 3,000 square meters, and an atmosphere-building area, a scenic spot display and exhibition area and an online shopping experience area were set up.
Eight provinces and cities, including Jiaxing in Zhejiang, Zunyi in Guizhou and Yan'an in Shaanxi, as well as 137 enterprises and units in Changsha, Zhuzhou, Yueyang and Chenzhou in our province, were invited to participate in the exhibition, with a total of 768 exhibits, including red cultural relics, handicrafts, food specialties, tourism routes, red training courses and red literary and creative products.
The exhibition area will be open until July 29.
As the host of the Red Fair, Xiangtan Exhibition Area is full of bright spots.
The person in charge of the exhibition area introduced that the Xiangtan exhibition area is divided into two parts: the development of red industry and red cultural industry.
The Red Industrial Exhibition Area displays 31 exhibits from six enterprises, including Hualing Xianggang, Hualing Cable and Power, and the Red Cultural Industry Development Exhibition Area displays nearly 200 products from 27 units, including red series books, red series foods and red series creative products.
In the Yan'an Exhibition Area, many tourists are attracted by the display of cloth and flower handicrafts and paper-cut art.
Ma Dongpo, Director of the Culture and Tourism Bureau of Yan'an, introduced that the exhibition carefully selected the outstanding red literary and creative products of Yan'an in the past two years, of which 16 products were excellent works of 2019 national red literary and creative products.
At the same time, they invited the heirs of the national-level intangible cultural heritage protection projects "Ansei Paper-Cut", "Northern Shaanxi Folk Songs" and the provincial-level non-heritage projects "Yanchuan Cloth Pile Painting", focused on introducing the products with the characteristics of Yanan folklore, and took the opportunity to communicate with other units and enterprises in the exhibition area to promote cross-regional cooperation.
The cumulative number of new confirmed cases in Japan exceeds 30,000.
According to statistics, there were 239 new confirmed cases in Tokyo on the 26th, and more than 200 new cases in a single day for six consecutive days, bringing the cumulative number of cases to 11,214.
In addition, there were 141 new confirmed cases in Osaka Prefecture, 90 in Fukuoka Prefecture and 80 in Aichi Prefecture.
Telecom network fraud crime rose by 70% in the first half of the year
China News Network, July 26: According to the Supreme Inspection website, in the first half of this year, procuratorial organs nationwide prosecuted a total of 58,101 people for fraud crimes, an increase of 35% over the previous year.
In particular, among the crimes impeding epidemic prevention and control, fraud crimes are frequent, and the number of fraud crimes prosecuted by the procuratorial organs accounted for 43.4 per cent of the total number of crimes impeding epidemic prevention and control.
The Supreme People's Procuratorate has carried out targeted guidance. At present, of the 10 batches of typical cases involving epidemic prevention and control issued, a total of 9 involve the crime of fraud.
Judging from the cases handled by the procuratorial organs in the first half of the year, there are a wide range of crimes involving fraud, ranging from national macroeconomic policies to people's food, clothing and housing, including epidemic fraud, "medical care" fraud, "health products" fraud, "enrollment intermediary" fraud, "routine loan" fraud, fraud of defrauding state subsidies, fraud of unfreezing ethnic assets, etc., which are constantly "new", covering areas such as education, medical care, employment, old age, social security, land expropriation and demolition, accurate poverty alleviation, financial and credit, which not only cause economic losses to the victims, but also seriously affect economic and social development.
In particular, some telecommunications network frauds break through the limits of national borders, geography and personnel, and have the characteristics of stakeholders, cross-border, remote and electronic payments, with no specific group of victims and great harm.
For example, some set up special companies, rent high-grade office buildings, set up multiple departments or posts, use legal network platforms to publicize and recruit, train and evaluate recruiters, and adopt enterprise operation mode management, wearing the "cloak of legality", which is more attractive.
It is incumbent upon the procuratorial organs to punish and prevent crimes in accordance with the law and to issue early warning to the public and relevant departments in a timely manner.
In handling judicial cases, the procuratorial organs conscientiously perform their duties, not only maintaining a high-pressure trend against fraud crimes, but also refining various law enforcement measures in a targeted manner, and promoting social governance through the preparation and issuance of procuratorial recommendations.
The procuratorial organs strictly regulate the facts, evidence, procedures and application of the law in the approval of arrest and prosecution of fraud cases, taking the facts as the basis and the law as the criterion, so as to be fair and impartial.
Especially for the crime of telecommunications network fraud, we pay attention to the central role of electronic data in fact determination, and strive to build a chain of evidence between electronic data, verbal evidence and documentary evidence.
For example, in response to a certain epidemic-related fraud case handled by the Yinzhou District Prosecutor's Office of Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, the procuratorial authorities intervened in advance at the first time, and it took only five days from the occurrence of the case to the conclusion of the case, reflecting the attitude and determination to handle it quickly and strictly and to maintain the overall stability of the society.
In the process of reviewing arrest and reviewing prosecution, attention was paid to the prosecution of missing cases, correcting the omission of 733 persons by the public security organs, and correcting the omission of the public security organs to examine and prosecute 1,113 co-offenders.
In the first half of the year, procuratorial organs nationwide issued 298 procuratorial recommendations on fraud crimes, promoting joint efforts to prevent fraud crimes and promoting in-depth governance.
For example, in response to the loopholes in the supervision of telecommunications networks found in the handling of cases by communications enterprises, banks and intermediary organizations, the Guangzhou Public Prosecutor's Office and the Dongguan City Public Prosecutor's Office of Guangdong Province put forward timely procuratorial recommendations, urging the relevant units to strengthen supervision and improve the mechanism so as to help promote the construction of a long-term system.
Fourth, make every effort to do a good job in the recovery of spoils and losses.
Local procuratorial organs have seized important links such as intervening in investigation, guiding the taking of evidence and reviewing prosecution, urging the investigative organs to actively pursue and recover the stolen funds, cooperating with the relevant departments in the work of recovering the stolen money and losses, and striving to minimize the economic losses caused to the people by the crime of fraud.
For example, the Beijing Municipal Public Prosecutor's Office handled a certain set loan case in Lin Mou, which involved 22 sets of properties waiting to be sealed up. Under the circumstances that the properties may be disposed of first by other cases, it was the first to create and issue a "Letter of Suspension of Execution", which was sent to the relevant court in a timely manner, recommending that the previous seizure court suspend the execution of the properties involved, and deal with them uniformly after the facts of the crime were ascertained, so as to make maximum efforts to recover the properties involved and recover the losses of the victims.
The prosecutor reminded everyone that the crime of fraud should be highly vigilant, do not expect "pie in the sky", do not think cheap to be credulous, keep their "purse".
Jinna Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province: Low Apple Tree Widens the Road to Poverty Alleviation
2020-07-26 11: 42: 58 Source: China Economic Network Author: Zhu Yanjing Responsibility Editor: Zhu Yanjing
In the hot heat, the reporter of Economic Daily - China Economic Network walked into Zhonghai Village, Jinna Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province.
In the hot sun, villager Li Yuanzhong was weeding in the base. Although his face was red, his mouth hummed a few little songs from time to time.
Wening County, where the town is located, has a certain popularity in the surrounding area because of its low latitude, high altitude, abundant light and large temperature difference between day and night. However, it has also been unable to sell a good price and form an industrial scale because of its small size and many spots.
Jinna Town used to be a poor town of "Baogu potato for spring and autumn", where the incidence of poverty was as high as 25.8% 10 years ago.
In the crucial period of overcoming poverty and entering a decisive battle, it is urgent to change traditional planting habits, adjust the industrial structure and increase farmers' income.
After many visits, Chen Chao, party secretary of Huna town, and a class of people in the town believed that industrial development could no longer follow the old path.
To this end, the town introduced leading enterprises to grow apples in a modern way.
Hou Jianwen, deputy general manager of Weining Transcending Agriculture Co., Ltd. came to the town of Jinna from Shaanxi in 2015 to investigate the local planting conditions at a glance, and began to plant apple trees there from 2016.
At first, the village mobilized Li Yuanzhong to transfer the land to plant apple trees. Li Yuanzhong's husband and wife had a murmur in their hearts: "After planting apples for so many years, they did not see who planted apples in the village made a fortune."
"All apples planted are dwarfed apples and will not let the apple tree grow too tall."
What Li Yuanzhong did not expect was that a new method was used for apple planting. Irrigation pipes were spread under each apple tree, and water and fertilizer were poured to the roots. When the fruit was harvested in the autumn, the tractor drove directly into the orchard and could pick the fruit while standing.
At present, the Apple base has gradually entered a period of high production, and the market is as expected by Hou Jianwen. Apple does not worry about selling, and is loved by consumers in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other cities.
The growing apple industry has brought new changes to Li Yuanzhong's life. Although he is still farming land, he has a new source of income.
Li Yuanzhong's family has transferred more than 9 acres of land to the Apple base. Every year, in addition to maintaining the bottom of the land transfer fee, there are profit dividends after hanging the fruit. The couple usually work in the base, "one person gets 80 yuan a day and has work to do all year round."
Li Yuanzhong told reporters that last year's profit dividend earned more than 2,800 yuan, plus the land transfer fee and the husband and wife's work income, the family earned more than 80,000 yuan, "food and clothing do not worry, a moderately well-off life has been lived."
"At present, it has begun to show results. The annual output value of an acre of apples exceeds 15,000 yuan, about 10 times that of growing corn."
Chen Chao told reporters that at present, 20,000 mu of apples have been planted in the whole town of Jinna, and there are 6,000 mu in Zhonghai Village alone, covering 4,056 rural households and 17,200 people, including 656 poor households and 2,952 people who have built filing cards, and more than 6 million yuan in wages have been paid in a year, truly realizing that the base is built in front of their homes, and that there is no need to work outside.
Li Yuanzhong, with his bulging purse, also began to realize his "wishes."
This year's Lunar New Year, Li Yuanzhong bought a Land Cruiser and now drives his car to and from work every day. "There are still more than a dozen acres of land at home, such as the next step in the expansion of the Apple base, all of which will be transferred to them, and the income will be more."

Membrane separation technology helps crack the "greenhouse effect"
Membrane separation technology helps crack the "greenhouse effect"
Diagram of Preparation Technology of New Hybrid Matrix Film
This newspaper reporter Shang Rui reported: Recently, the atmospheric environment and bioenergy team of Tianjin University has made significant progress in "carbon dioxide capture by membrane separation method", successfully developed a new hybrid matrix membrane preparation technology, and greatly improved the carbon dioxide capture performance of membrane materials.
The results have been published as a cover article in the international journal Greenhouse Gases: Science and Technology.
The "greenhouse effect" is a major environmental problem perplexing human development, and carbon dioxide emissions are the culprit of the "greenhouse effect".
How to capture and utilize human carbon dioxide efficiently is the focus of scientists' attention.
"Membrane separation method" is a new carbon dioxide capture technology. It separates carbon dioxide gas with the help of membrane materials, which has the characteristics of high efficiency, energy saving and simple operation.
How to make membrane materials "breathe deeply" and improve the efficiency of gas separation is the bottleneck and difficulty of capturing carbon dioxide by membrane separation method.
The scientific research team of Tianjin University has an innovative idea to explore the influence of different solvents on the gas separation performance of films through repeated experiments.
The experimental results show that the carbon nanotubes produced by N-methylpyrrolidone are more evenly distributed and "more breathable" in the membrane material, effectively improving the gas separation efficiency and rate of the membrane material.
The carbon dioxide separation performance of mixed matrix films prepared by this new technology is close to the theoretical separation limit of this kind of membrane materials.
"The new technology provides a new idea for capturing carbon dioxide by membrane separation."
Li Run, a member of the atmospheric environment and bioenergy team of Tianjin University, said: "We hope this technology can provide strong support for the treatment of flue gas by coal-fired power plants and chemical enterprises in the future, and play an important role in controlling greenhouse gas emissions."
Find out what professional grade difference is before you volunteer.

Find out what professional grade is before you volunteer
Every year, there are students or parents who volunteer for the college entrance examination because they do not understand the terms involved in the voluntary application, which affects the voluntary application.
This year, five colleges and universities, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing University of Science and Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing Forestry University and Beijing Chemical University, jointly issued enrollment policies for 2020, eliminating professional grade differences.
What is the meaning of professional grade difference and what is the significance in voluntary filing?
There are three ways to assign professional rules
Experts remind that before filling in the volunteer, it is important to read the "Admission Charter" of the desired school and understand the admission rules of colleges and universities, including the transfer ratio, the rules of professional allocation, etc.
The rules of professional allocation refer to the three ways of professional priority, score priority and professional grade difference for professional admission after the transfer of colleges and universities.
The specific way used by colleges and universities will be made clear in the Admission Charter.
But there are also some colleges and universities whose admission principle is to give priority to the total score, and there is no grade difference between the majors.
That is, the candidates within the admission range will be lined up according to the total score, when the score does not reach the voluntary admission score for the first major, it will see whether the voluntary admission score for the second major has been reached, and so on until the admission to the last professional volunteer, and there is no grade difference between the professional volunteers.
The so-called "professional grade difference" means that, when arranging candidates' majors, institutions determine the admission majors of volunteer candidates for different majors according to one or more score values published in the admission regulations. This score value is "professional grade difference".
This is the score difference between the first professional volunteer and the non-first professional volunteer in the admission of candidates, and the grade difference between the various professional volunteers, such as 3, 2, 1, etc.
Take for example.
Suppose the student Xiaoming applied for the examination of A university and scored 560 points, and his professional volunteers were: computer, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering, e-commerce. The professional admission of A university implemented the method of professional grade difference, which was divided into 2, 1, 1 and 0 points.
In the professional assignment, if Xiaoming's first major volunteer meets the professional admission requirements and the major has a planned balance, then Xiaoming will be admitted to the "computer" major; if the computer is not accepted, his score will be reduced by 2 points, according to the ranking of 558 points with the candidates who volunteer for the "international trade" examination in the first major, to determine whether they meet the professional admission conditions; if the score is still not met, the score will be reduced by 1 point (i.e. 556 points) for the admission of the fourth major, and so on.
Different professional grade difference settings in different universities
With the popularization of parallel volunteering, many colleges and universities have now abolished professional grade differentials, but some colleges and universities have still retained this method this year. According to the Admission Charter published by various schools, more than 20 universities have mainly set up professional grade differentials this year.
For example, Sichuan Agricultural University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Jiangxi Normal University, Chengdu Medical College, Northeast Electric Power University, Jimei University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing University of Technology, Ningxia University, Shandong University of Technology, China Civil Aviation Flight Institute, etc.
In these colleges and universities, the professional grades set by each university are different.
Some colleges and universities have grade differences in each major, such as Ningxia University. Candidates whose files have been submitted to the university are admitted by grade after decreasing one point in the order in which the candidates fill in their professional volunteers.
Some universities have set different professional grades between different majors.
In Jimei University, for example, the total difference between professional volunteers is 4 points, that is, the difference between the first professional volunteer and other professional volunteers is 3 points, there is no difference between other professional volunteers, which is considered as a parallel volunteer, and the difference between other professional volunteers and professional volunteers is 1 point.
When applying for volunteers, candidates and parents must carefully read the admission policy of the reported school to see if there is a professional grade difference and what the form of the grade difference is. While giving full consideration to the score, they should also make a reasonable analysis of the schools and majors to be selected. If the institution clearly adopts the method of score difference in its admission charter, candidates should pay attention to the gradient between the various majors when choosing a major to improve the admission probability.

The first Atlantic hurricane this year made landfall in pandemic-hit Texas
That morning, the National Hurricane Center announced that Hurricane Hanna, which reached 145 kilometers per hour, was expected to bring heavy rainfall to southern Texas and northeastern Mexico until Monday, which in turn would cause rapid flooding.
At present, with the gradual advance to the land, the custom has weakened somewhat, and although there are power outages in some areas, there are no statistical reports of casualties for the time being.
Some local officials in Texas are preparing for a possible tornado along the coast.
President Trump said via Twitter that his office was closely monitoring the developments of Hurricane Hanna and Hurricane Douglas in Hawaii, and called on people to listen to emergency management information from local governments and protect families and property.
At the same time, the new outbreak in Texas is also rapidly worsening, with the number of infections soaring, with more than 390,000 confirmed infections and more than 5,000 deaths.
When the hurricane hits, the government will face the dual challenge of accommodating the homeless and preventing the epidemic from worsening again.

3-year-old Belgian girl dies of new crown virus infection - Xinhua
Belgian health authorities said on the 24th that a 3-year-old girl died of the new crown virus, the country's youngest death from the disease.
In addition to the girl, who had other serious illnesses before contracting the virus, an 18-year-old recently died from the virus, Belgian health ministry spokesman Boudwin Katri said.
Katri said 85% of new cases diagnosed in Belgium last week were under the age of 60.
He warned healthy, younger people not to take it lightly.
"Although deaths from new crown virus infection in young people are rare, no one is immune now."
Last week, Belgium saw an 89% increase in new confirmed cases over the previous week, with an average of 2.9 deaths per day from the virus, up from an average of 1.7 per day the previous week.
During the peak of the epidemic in Europe, the proportion of new crown virus infections in the Belgian population was "among the highest" in Europe.
Belgium has a population of more than 11 million.
According to the latest data, a total of 64,847 people have been infected with the new crown virus in Belgium.
Katri warned earlier this week that action must be taken before the snowball gets bigger and bigger, eventually causing an "avalanche".
In order to curb the rebound of the epidemic, Belgian Prime Minister Sophie Wilmes announced on the 23rd that the rules on people wearing masks in public places will be stricter, and the implementation of the plan to further lift the restrictive measures in August will be suspended.

Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 25: The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, Edward Yau, said on July 25 that all APEC member economies should act in concert to fight the epidemic and promote economic recovery, and should avoid establishing unnecessary trade barriers in accordance with the rights and obligations set out in the World Trade Organization.
Qiu Tenghua made the above statement when he participated in the video conference of trade ministers on combating the new pneumonia epidemic held by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) on the 25th.
At the meeting, participating ministers exchanged views on the substantive measures that APEC could take to deal with the impact of the new pneumonia epidemic and to promote economic recovery in the region.
Qiu Tenghua said that the public health and economic crisis triggered by the epidemic had brought unprecedented and far-reaching effects on society and the economy.
"We are in a double battle. We must defeat the epidemic before we can save the economy.
We should have a clear goal. The virus is our common enemy. Only cooperation can win, and vice versa will only fail.
Qiu said a series of trade restrictions caused by the new pneumonia outbreak would not help to control the epidemic.
Trade was a key solution to the current problem and should not be seen as the problem.
He condemned all discriminatory and divisive policy measures and urged all economies to keep their borders open, maintain the smooth functioning of supply chains and avoid establishing trade barriers or adopting irrational trade policies at this critical juncture.

People Pack Around US Consulate in Chengdu Police Stop People "Looking Too Happy"
In response to the US closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, China announced the closure of the US Consulate General in Chengdu on Friday.
On Saturday, the insignia of the US consulate was removed, and on Sunday, a dark glass car left the consulate amid boos from passers-by.
On Sunday, many people in Chengdu gathered in front of the US consulate to take pictures, and those who had not come also came to see it driven by curiosity about current events.
The reporter of Agence France-Presse Chengdu Station also went to the vicinity of the US Consulate in Chengdu to observe some time, and sent back news that there was a steady stream of people, and many parents came to walk with their children to watch the Consulate, take pictures of the building, or take selfies.
The consulate was surrounded by guards, and the police occasionally "corrected" people's behavior, and they did not seem to allow any outrageous behavior: a woman was stopped just as she was about to sing a red song, and a guard confiscated a banner.
But residents of a nearby residential building succeeded in pulling up a giant Chinese flag on their balcony and shouting pro-China slogans.
The US Consulate in Chengdu opened in 1985 and covers all US consular affairs in southwest China, especially the Tibet Autonomous Region.
The AFP Chengdu station reporter said that the Chinese government's response to the United States was relatively restrained: many Chinese people online asked the government to close the US Consulate in Hong Kong, but the official only said that "the closure of the US Consulate in Chengdu is a necessary and legitimate response to the unreasonable behavior of the United States."
At present, in addition to Chengdu, the United States has consulates in Guangdong, Shanghai, Shenyang, Wuhan and Hong Kong.
Large-scale Financial Media Action "Going to the Village Live to Watch Poverty Alleviation" - Today's Highlights - Hunan Daily Network - Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily and New Hunan Client News on July 25 (this reporter) On July 25, the large-scale media integration campaign "Go to the Village Live to Watch Poverty Alleviation", hosted by the Financial Program Center of the Central Radio and Television General Station, started from Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province. Two caravans carrying the 5G new media mobile cloud broadcasting system were seen by the live guests and slowly drove out of the scene.
General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that "2020 is a landmark year. We will build a moderately well-off society in an all-round way and achieve the first century goal. 2020 will also be the year of decisive victory in the decisive battle against poverty."
The large-scale financial media campaign "Go to the Village Live to Watch Poverty Alleviation" is an important measure of the Financial Program Center of the Central Radio and Television Station to do a good job in the publicity of poverty eradication in line with this important theme.
The operation will go into poverty alleviation villages in more than 20 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government throughout the country, dig fresh stories of poverty eradication, directly attack the great changes in the appearance of villages and villages, and show how villagers can break through the predicament of survival and development and move towards the road to wealth.
The operation will last for more than three months.
Starting from Xuzhou, the soldiers took the Southwest Line through Anhui, Hubei, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, Chongqing, Yunnan and Tibet, and the Northwest Line through Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi and Hebei, covering more than 10,000 kilometers.
In the form of reporting, "Go to the Village Live to Watch Poverty Alleviation" boldly integrates.
The economic development of the villages visited by the caravan will be broadcast through CCTV Financial and Economic Channel, CCTV Economic Voice, China Communications Radio and CCTV Financial New Media.
Among them, the live television broadcast will mainly be completed on the noon news program "World Finance" of CCTV Finance and Economics Channel (premiere time: Monday to Sunday 12: 00-13: 00), and the golden news program "Economic Information Network" of CCTV Finance and Economics Channel will set up a column on poverty eradication (premiere time: Monday to Sunday 20: 30-21: 30).
At the same time, the caravan will carry out a one-hour live broadcast to each village in the CCTV financial client. By downloading CCTV financial APP, viewers can watch the live broadcast and participate in the lottery.
In the application of technology and studio design, "Go to the Village Live to Watch Poverty Alleviation" has the courage to break through and pioneered the "outfield new media caravan".
The car is equipped with a 5G new media mobile cloud broadcasting system, which uses 5G + 4K / 8K + AI technology to realize the organic combination of online and offline, large and small screens and television broadcasting.
Equipped with a three-signal broadcast area, the broadcast area is converted from a container, which is 12 meters long, 2.55 meters wide and 3.98 meters high. The box body adopts a hydraulic automatic expansion structure and can be turned up to a maximum of 120 degrees.
The studio area can also be expanded automatically, and the external expansion platform, with an area of more than 50 square meters, can meet the scene requirements of most programs.
At present, the Dongchuan District of Kunming City is already hot in summer, and what is hotter than the weather is the poverty alleviation workshop next to the relocation site.
"Now, as soon as you get out of the house, you enter the factory door and make money and take care of the family, thanks to the free vocational skills training of the trade union organization," said Lu Ling, an employee of the Kunming Esford Electronic Technology Company.
Walking into the poverty alleviation workshop of electronic component processing in the copper capital of Dongchuan District, a busy picture of heat came into view.
In her 40s, Lu Ling is a single mother who takes care of her elderly parents.
In her most difficult time, the Dongchuan District Federation of Trade Unions helped to come up with ideas and ways to "send money in the snow" after being busy before running.
Since 2018, Lu Ling has benefited from assistance policies such as housing, schooling, social security and employment, as well as assistance grants from trade unions at all levels.
This year, her children have successfully graduated and been employed, and she herself has a job and income after attending skills training, and was out of trouble at the end of April.
It is reported that the special skills training project of the Dongchuan District General Organization to help fight poverty is part of the skills training work of the Yunnan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions.
Taking into account the characteristics of the difficult workers in the poverty alleviation relocation and resettlement sites in the area, the district will conduct an in-depth investigation to understand the training needs and determine the types of training, and plans to train a total of 450 electricians, welders and noodle artists in the near future.
Recently, Li Yi, an employee of the Menglian County Branch of the Agricultural Bank of Yunnan, wrote a sincere thank-you letter to the County General Trade Union.
In her letter, she expressed her sincere gratitude to the union for the grant she received from August 2013 to January 2017 to help her complete her studies.
In 2004, Li Yi's father died in a car accident, and her mother was included in the file of workers in difficulty. Since then, she has been enjoying the care of the policy of building a file card.
With the help of the local trade union, Li Yi successfully completed his studies.
Since 2016, 3,809 households have been lifted out of poverty through institutional guarantees and precise assistance.
The successful relief of the Lu Ling family and Li Yi is a microcosm of the work of Yunnan trade unions to promote the relief and relief of workers in difficulty.
According to Duan Kaiyuan, a staff member of the Legal and Human Rights Work Department of the Yunnan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the province has always strengthened the dynamic management of the files of workers in difficulty, promoted the normalization of the work of filing, and for workers in difficulty who meet the conditions for filing, they are promptly integrated into the assistance system.
During the epidemic period, it was difficult for migrant workers to go out to work. In order to help ease the living pressure of workers in difficulty at the national level, Yunnan Province arranged more than 13 million yuan in warm relief funds, and implemented special warm relief activities for more than 6,000 families at the national level and more than 1,000 families at the provincial level, in accordance with the standards of 2,000 yuan per family of workers in difficulty at the national level and 1,500 yuan per family of workers in difficulty at the provincial level.
At the same time, the General Administration of the Province has connected with various Internet recruitment platforms, such as the Department of Human and Social Affairs and the Intellectual Recruitment Union, to push recruitment information to workers in difficulty, and to provide employment counselling, employment guidance and other services.
