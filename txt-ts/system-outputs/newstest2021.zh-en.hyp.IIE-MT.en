Xinhua Time Review: Turn outstanding returning migrant workers into a new force for rural revitalization-Xinhuanet
Talents are the key to rural revitalization.
Where can I find talent?
The outstanding group of returning migrant workers is an indispensable new force.
Xinhua News Agency sends Shang Haichun
Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 26. Title: Turn outstanding returning migrant workers into a new force for rural revitalization
The 34-year-old Zhang Xiong family is in Goyuan Village, Meishan City, Sichuan. In 2010, he quit his job in Beijing with a monthly salary of tens of thousands and returned to start a business.
After several years of hard work, the annual income of the grape-growing family farm he manages now exceeds one million yuan, becoming a well-known leader in getting rich, and he has also been selected to join the village's "two committees" team.
In recent years, inspired by a series of policies to support agriculture and benefit agriculture, such as national poverty alleviation and rural revitalization, more and more outstanding migrant workers like Zhang Xiong have chosen to return home to start their own businesses, activating a pool of spring water in the countryside.
Sichuan, a province with a large population in western China and a large labor export province, has been guided by the situation to implement the "Outstanding Migrant Workers Return Training Project." In 2019 alone, more than 8,000 village party branch secretaries were produced from among the outstanding migrant workers, 61,000 village reserve forces were nurtured, and more than 20,000 party members were developed, providing a strong guarantee for winning the fight against poverty and implementing the rural revitalization strategy.
Well-off is not well-off, the key depends on the villagers.
Since the reform and opening up, a large number of young and middle-aged laborers in rural China have gone out to work to increase their income, and some have set up their own enterprises through hard work.
However, objectively, it has also led to the emergence of "hollowing" in rural areas to varying degrees, especially the weakening of rural grassroots organizations. The village party branch secretaries and party members all show the characteristics of "one old and one low", that is, aging, low education, and the village party organization leader team is not strong, and the problem of non-compliance is prominent.
If rural talents and other factors have been flowing one-way to the city, and the countryside has been in a state of "blood loss" and "anemia" for a long time, revitalization is an empty word.
To attract back those migrant workers who are capable, conscious, and aspiring to serve their hometown, guide them to return home to start a business and become rich leaders, select and train them as party members and rural cadres, and enrich the grassroots cadre team. This is the solution to the problem of rural party members and grassroots party organizations.
Outstanding migrant workers can be brought back, and they must be allowed to stay and do well.
In recent years, Sichuan has begun to pay close attention to the party building of migrant workers. On the basis of strict selection criteria, it has established institutional mechanisms such as directional referral, service guarantee, training, promotion, selection and use of outstanding migrant workers, so that they can improve their abilities, have security at work, have hope in life, really take root in the countryside, and have a sense of accomplishment in starting a business.
This year is the closing year of the decisive battle against poverty. To do a good job of linking poverty alleviation with rural revitalization, talent is the key factor.
Party committees and governments at all levels should attach great importance to the group of outstanding returning migrant workers, and through comprehensive measures, build them into a team and force that can be retained, can fight, and cannot be taken away, so as to provide strong organizational guarantee and talent support for rural poverty alleviation and development and revitalization.
Due to the epidemic, this year's college graduates are a very special one. On the evening of July 11, the Bilibili Summer Graduation Song will bring a special live online performance for the graduates. Musicians such as Lao Wolf, Pu Shu, Li Yuchun, and Mao Yi will send songs and blessings to the recent graduates.
Well-known up host SealWu Wu Yifan also brought a "Wild Grass", which is a rap song based on Lu Xun's prose poetry collection of the same name, which is extremely popular among young people.
Due to the epidemic, many graduates failed to appreciate the ritual sense of picking ears and awarding degree certificates at the scene, so they transferred the sense of ritual to the line.
Data shows that the popularity of this 2.5-hour song meeting peaked at more than 35 million.
"Follow your heart and seize the opportunity, regardless of the consequences, sometimes there will be unexpected gains."
Although it is a graduation song party, many songs also moved non-recent graduates.
"The whole scene really wants to cry, everyone's youth is full of beauty and regret, but it is worth remembering, and we must go on bravely."
Beijing's natural ecology continues to improve, attracting more than 500 species of wild animals and cities to "settle "-Chinanews.com

The capital's natural ecology continues to improve to attract wildlife cities to "settle"
There are more than 500 species of wild animals in Beijing
News from our newspaper (Reporter Wang Bin) The reporter from the Beijing Youth Daily learned from the Municipal Landscaping Bureau that with the continuous improvement of the capital's natural ecological environment in recent years, the types and numbers of wild animals have also continued to increase.
At present, the number of terrestrial spine wild animals that inhabit Beijing has increased to more than 500 species, including national first-class protected animals such as brown horse chicken and black stork, as well as national second-level protected animals such as gazelle, big swan, gray crane, mandarin duck.
Whether it is planted into the urban forests in the second ring, or the small wetlands embedded in the buildings, it not only brings the wild interest of nature to the citizens of the capital, but also attracts wild animals to "settle" in the city.
In midsummer, the Songshan National Nature Reserve, located in the Yanshan Mountains in the northwest of Yanqing District, is full of vitality.
A raccoon was playing leisurely by the mountain stream, and two dog badgers were fighting each other.
Looking back, a wild boar can't help but scratch his body and is rubbing hard against the bark. Hu Qiaoli, director of the Songshan National Nature Reserve Administration, introduced that as of the end of 2019, in this green sea with a total area of more than 6,200 hectares, there are 178 species of wild animals, including the national first-class protected animal golden eagle and the national second-class protected animal spoon chicken and antelope. Nearly one-third of the city's wild animal species can be found here.
"In Songshan, wild animals are the real 'owners', and our staff can only be regarded as' bodyguards' at best."
Hu Qiaoli said that in order to understand the situation of wild animals and plants in the reserve on the ground, there are more than 30 professional rangers every day, patrolling along 16 carefully formulated protection routes, and there will be a "big circle" every month, spending a whole day almost traveling through the entire reserve.
"During the inspection, it is not only necessary to check and record biodiversity, but also to inspect and install artificial bird nests, rescue injured wild animals, install field infrared cameras, etc."
Songshan National Nature Reserve has now installed more than 200 infrared cameras to record the living conditions of wild animals in the forest.
Hu Qiaoli introduced that with the continuous enrichment of biodiversity in the reserve in recent years, more and more wild animals have appeared in the lens, leopard cats, raccoons and pig badgers have become "resident guests", and the "appearance rate" of the national second-level protected animal antelope is also getting higher and higher.
Zhang Zhiming, Director of the Wildlife and Wetland Protection Division of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Landscaping, introduced that the number of terrestrial spine wild animals in Beijing has increased from 461 species in 1994 to more than 500 now. The types and numbers of wild animals in Beijing have continued to increase in recent years.
The presence of wild animals in cities has become more common, which is closely related to the continuous upgrading of greening in the capital city in recent years.
In particular, the new round of one million mu afforestation and greening construction, which began in 2018, proposes to reshape the urban ecological environment, improve the ecological function of woodland green space, and highlight the concept of "near nature."
The planning strives to achieve interconnection and interaction with the surrounding green spaces to facilitate wild animals to "visit relatives and friends", and the trees planted are also honey and food plants that animals love.
I am committed to assisting computers to communicate with the world around us.
There are many ways to do this, and I like to focus on assisting computers to talk about what they see and understand.
In view of this scenario, a modern computer vision algorithm can tell you that there is a woman and a dog.
It can tell you that the woman is smiling.
It can even tell you that this dog is very cute.
I deal with this problem and think about how human beings understand and coexist with the world.
Those thoughts, memories, and stories in such a scene may arouse human attention.
The interconnection of all related situations.
Maybe you have seen such a dog before, or you have spent time running on such a beach, and further evoke the memories and thoughts of past vacations. When you went to the beach before, you spent time running around with other dogs.
One of my guiding principles is to help computers understand what kind of experience this is, so as to understand the commonalities of what we believe and feel, then we have the ability to start continuously developing computer technology in a way that complements our experience.
So, digging deep into this point, I started working on helping computers produce human-like stories from image sequences a few years ago.
So, one day, when I was working with a computer, I asked it about its views on the trip to Australia.
It looked at the picture and saw a koala.
It doesn't know what a koala is, but the computer says it thinks a koala looks like a very interesting creature.
Then I shared a series of images about the house burning with the computer.
The computer looked at the picture and it said, "This is an amazing landscape! This is spectacular!"
It makes my spine cold.
The computer saw a terrible, life-changing and life-destroying event and thought it was a positive thing.
I realized that the computer recognizes the contrast between red and yellow, and thinks this is something worthy of positive evaluation.
Part of the reason is because most of what I enter into the computer is positive images.
That's because people tend to share positive images when they talk about their experiences.
When was the last time you saw a self-photograph at a funeral?
I realized that in the process of improving artificial intelligence, tasks belong to tasks, and data sets belong to data sets, creating huge gaps, defects, and blind spots in the understanding of computers.
While doing this, I am coding for various prejudices.
Prejudice reflects a limited view and originates from a data set-which reflects the same human beings, such as stereotypes and stereotypes.
I think back to the development of that technology, which brought me to where I was that day-the first color image was calibrated for the skin color of a white woman, which means that color photography is biased against black faces.
And the same deviation, that blind spot continued to be brought into the 90s.
The same blind spot still exists even today in how to recognize the faces of different characters in the application of facial recognition technology.
In today's research, I think of the most advanced technology, and all tend to limit our ideas to one data set and one problem.
In doing so, we are creating more blind spots and prejudices that will be further amplified when using artificial intelligence.
At that time I realized that we must reflect on how we invent and create technology today will be viewed in five to ten years.
In the interaction between humans and the environment, humans use time to correct problems, so evolution is slow.
In contrast, artificial intelligence is developing at an incredible speed.
This means that it is really important, and we have to think about this carefully now - reflect on our blind spots, and prejudices, and consider how these prejudices affect the technology we create now, and discuss today's technology and what it means for the future.
CEOs and scientists have weighed their ideas about the future development of artificial intelligence.
Stephen Hawking warned: "Artificial intelligence will destroy mankind."
Elon Musk warned that this is an existential risk and one of the biggest risks we face as a civilized society.
Bill Gates pointed out: "I don't understand why people are not more worried about artificial intelligence."
But these views-are only part of the story.
That mathematics, models, these basic components of artificial intelligence, we can all obtain and use.
We have source code tools open to the public to learn machines and make our own contributions at the same time.
In addition, we can also share our experience.
We can share in terms of technology and its relationship with us, and how to make us happy.
We can discuss what we love.
We can communicate with the foreseeable future, which may be more beneficial in terms of technology, or more problems may arise over time.
If we all focus on opening up the discussion on artificial intelligence and looking to the future, this will help create a regular dialogue and awareness about what artificial intelligence is? What can it be? And all the things we need to do to achieve the results that are best for us.
We have seen and understood this in the technology used today.
We use smartphones, digital assistants and automatic vacuum cleaners.
Are they evil?
Maybe sometimes.
Are they beneficial?
Yes, they are, too.
They are not exactly the same.
There you have seen the light of the future.
The future will continue to start with what we build and create now.
We started the domino effect, which opened the evolutionary channel of artificial intelligence
In our time, it has shaped tomorrow's artificial intelligence.
Let us immerse ourselves in the technology of enhancing reality to revive the world of the past,
When people have difficulty communicating, technology helps them share each other's experiences.
Technology based on online visual media can be used in automatic driving of cars.
Technology produces language based on the understanding of images, which can evolve into technology to assist visually impaired people and help them better own the visual world.
We have also seen how technology can cause some problems.
We have technology today to analyze the physical characteristics of our birth, such as the color of our skin or the expression on our face, to determine whether we are criminals or terrorists.
We have the technology to process data, process data about gender or race to determine whether we can get a loan.
Everything we see now is just a snapshot of the evolution of artificial intelligence.
Because where we are now is a moment in the evolution.
This means that what we do now will affect the future development of things and extend to the future world.
If we want artificial intelligence to help humans evolve, we need to determine strategies and goals, and immediately open that path.
What I want to see is the development direction of culture and environment suitable for human beings.
Technology can help us cure patients with neurological diseases or other disabilities, make them the same as everyone, and make life equally challenging.
The operation of technology will not take into account your characteristics or skin color.
What I care about today is the technology of tomorrow and ten years later,
Artificial intelligence can appear in many different ways.
But in this case, it is not a driverless car without any destination.
This is a car that we can drive and control at the same time.
We choose when to accelerate and when to decelerate.
We choose whether we need to turn.
We choose what the future artificial intelligence will be.
There will be a vast arena. Allow artificial intelligence to be everything.
It will become a lot of different things.
Now it is up to us to figure out what needs to be implemented to ensure that the results of artificial intelligence are better for all humans.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Black land "planted" out of agricultural modernization-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 26, title: Black land "planted" out of agricultural modernization
In the midsummer, two spraying planes passed by the 10,000 mu high-yield demonstration field in the second operation station of the fifth management area of Friendship Farm, forming two white lines, and the big words "the first field in the world" planted with black rice seedlings in the green field stand out.
Kong Lingqiang, director of this operation station, said that this kind of aircraft can spray more than 6,000 acres of cultivated land a day, and the efficiency is about 8 times that of drones and hundreds of times that of humans.
This farm is located in Youyi County, Heilongjiang Province, my country's first grain-producing province. From the sound of rice cutting in the past to the sound of "rumbling" motors today, traditional Chinese farming and farms have been transformed on this black soil belt.
In addition to airplanes, satellites are also used in the modern agricultural production of Friendship Farm.
Kong Lingqiang introduced that on the one hand, they use satellite remote sensing technology to achieve precise fertilization, reduce agricultural input, and reduce pollution; on the other hand, satellite navigation technology can improve the level of standardized agricultural machinery field operations.
During this year's rice production process, the farm expanded the operating area of satellite navigation unmanned rice transplanting technology from 3,000 mu last year to 30,000 mu.
This technology makes the planting of seedlings more uniform, maximizes the use of sunlight and arable land resources, and saves 16 yuan in labor costs per mu.
The farm tried new technologies such as informatization and intelligence in agricultural production, forming the largest agricultural machinery group in my country from the ground to the sky.
According to statistics, the total number of farm machinery held at present is 49,000 units (pieces), and the comprehensive mechanization rate in the field has reached 99.8%.
Agricultural machinery operations achieve 100% GPS satellite navigation, 100% precision seeding in dry fields, and 100% operation in dry fields.
"Green agriculture, smart agriculture, and digital agriculture are the direction of agricultural modernization."
Liu Hualien, director of Friendship Farm, said.
The key to agricultural modernization lies in scientific and technological progress.
Heilongjiang Agricultural Reclamation, represented by farms, has played a demonstration and leading role in modern large-scale agriculture "aircraft carrier" in recent years, and has initially established a modern agricultural industry system led by large-scale planting, standardized production, and industrial management.
On the outskirts of Youyi County, there is an Agricultural Machinery Expo Park covering an area of 350,000 square meters.
Here is a concentrated exhibition of more than 140 agricultural machinery and equipment introduced and used by Heilongjiang Agricultural Reclamation over the years.
These agricultural machinery and farms bear witness to the development of China's agricultural modernization.
Xie Xiaojia for everyone-the transfer of the masses in Jiangkouhe, Hefei, Anhui Province-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, July 26, title: Shi Xiaojia for everyone-Jiang Kouhe Lianhe, Hefei, Anhui
Xinhua News Agency reporters Chen Shangying, Wang Liwu, Liu Xia Village
At 4 o'clock in the afternoon on July 25, Fu Kunbao, dressed in muddy rubber shoes, went from the former house to the back room, and his wife Zhou Yan came back and forth busy packing things.
"When I received a call from the village cadre to transfer, I was still weeding in the field."
Fu Kunbao said that he has transferred more than 60 acres of land and planted rice, and is now growing well. "I took medicine yesterday, and I haven't packed my tools yet."
Fu Kunbao pointed to the pesticide sprayer placed in the corner. "No one wants his home to be flooded, let's leave a small home for everyone."
In order to cope with the continued high water level pressure and possible heavy rainfall in Chaohu Lake, Hefei City, Anhui Province, is preparing to open the Jiangkouhe Lianhe flood distribution and water storage station where Fu Kunbao's family is located on the 26th.
Jiangkouhe Lianwei is located in Feixi County, next to the Chaohu dike.
There are thousands of villagers involved in Yan Dian Township and Sanhe Town in the polder who need to be transferred.
As of 16: 00 on the 25th, the water level of Chaohu Lake, China's fifth largest freshwater lake, remained at a high level of 13.2 meters, 0.7 meters above the guaranteed water level.
Fu Kunbao's kitchen is clean and tidy. There is a pot of pumpkin head vegetables on the table, and there are eggs and some brine in the refrigerator.
"I didn't expect to move. The water in Jiangkouhe looks good at the moment."
Zhou Yan said that the home is a bungalow, and some large objects have not been decided where to put them for the time being.
"Pack up valuable items first, and large items such as refrigerators and televisions can be placed in the homes of high-lying neighbors or relatives for the time being."
Village cadre Wang Liwen gave Fu Kunbao an idea.
Wang Lixiang is responsible for the transfer and resettlement of 13 villagers, and notifies each household to confirm everyone's resettlement plan.
The nearest resettlement site to Fu Kunbao's family is Su Primary School in Yan Dian Township, about 2 kilometers away.
In addition to the large items, Fu Kunbao and his wife have a headache with more than 1,000 jin of grain and some newly bought furniture in the family.
"The food is going to be dragged to a relative's house, and the furniture can't be moved."
As soon as the couple discussed, they put a stool under the newly bought bed and raised the bed by about half a meter.
At 6 o'clock in the afternoon, Fu Kunbao began to use a tricycle to transport things to relatives' homes. Zhou Yan continued to clean up at home.
At 11 o'clock in the evening, the couple looked back and forth at home, pulled on the switch, and were ready to go to the resettlement site.
"I hope the water will retire early."
Fu Kunbao said.
At 9: 30 am on July 26, the reporter saw at the scene of Jiangkouhe Lianwei that the local area has made preparations for flood distribution.
Zhang Jian Colin's small house team is a very muscular teenager-Xinhuanet
The sports youth hot-blooded competition show "Sports Boys" officially landed on Hunan Satellite TV on July 11.
Sports leader Zhang Jike and sports assistant Lin Xiaojia cross-border on the same stage, Lindane and Fu Yuanhui commented on their own styles, and the hard core of the "giant" -like power pull device made the show "burning" more powerful.
In the first episode, 11 sports teenagers appeared on the power track, and their appearance dazzled the audience on the scene. At the same time, the "strong conflict" "strong confrontation" and "strong heart" on the arena also attracted attention.
Among them, the "strong conflict" comes from Super A sports student Qiao Wenyi, who openly challenged Xu Zhibin, who is known as the "Flower Beautiful Man" on the same track before the race, choked that Xu Zhibin's appearance conditions should be sung and danced, and even released the harsh words "Don't cry your makeup when you lose."
Some remarks made the teenagers and sports leaders on the field take a breath.
The "strong confrontation" is more like a fight between gods. Sun Jianqi, known as the "Great Devil King", meets the equally powerful Zhang Xindong and staged a strong confrontation.
Their identities were also unexpected. Sun Jianqi is an actor who loves fitness, and Zhang Xindong is a retired special forces player and three-time Warrior Medal winner.
At the beginning of the game, the two teenagers tried their best to quickly pull out the small pole, and the lasting confrontation on the big pole made the audience sweat for them.
Under the tense situation, Zhang Jike, as one of the sports leaders of "Sports Boys", also watched the battle seriously.
In the comments section, he was also very careful, patiently encouraged the teenager who lost the game, and helped every mistake in the process of restarting the game.
Sports assistant Lin Xiaojia is a fancy assists, and she makes no secret of her appreciation for the teenagers who are online.
When I learned about the daily training of sports teenagers who are overloaded, I admire them even more.
Lindane and Fu Yuanhui, who are also sports leaders, have their own styles, one is a calm and relaxed "prophet" and the other is a "flood girl" who uses a smile to dispel the tension.
In addition, Jike Junyi and Liu Ye, as sports assistants, have also created a lot of hilarious topics around sports teenagers.
Church fire in Nantes, France: Diocese volunteers admit to arson and silence-Chinanews.com
China News Service, July 26. According to foreign media reports, on July 18, the treasures of religious and historical buildings in Nantes, France, and the famous Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul, were severely damaged in a fire, and the large pipe organ was completely destroyed.
On the 26th local time, the Nantes prosecutor announced that a diocese volunteer who was responsible for defense work in the cathedral had been charged with "arson and destruction."
He has admitted that he set the fire in the church.
According to the report, local prosecutor Senas said that the 39-year-old parish volunteer from Rwanda admitted that he had set fire to three places in the cathedral at night.
The person's lawyer said that the arsonists now regret doing such a thing.
This person entered France through the route of asylum a few years ago, was sheltered in the parish where the fire happened, and was taken in in the church.
The prosecutor pointed out that recently, he tried to renew his visa and is talking to the police station about this.
But the church said it still cannot believe that this believer, who is usually very kind and smiling, but doesn't talk much, will destroy the church he loves so much.
On the day of the fire on July 18, the volunteer had already been questioned and investigated by the police because of illogical problems in the narrative, but he was later released.
The picture shows firefighters rescuing at the scene.
On the evening of the 25th, as professional engineers from the laboratory of the Paris Central Police Department obtained new evidence, this person was summoned again.
This time, the man admitted his arson.
According to reports, if the charge of deliberate arson and destruction is convicted, the suspect may face 10 years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros.
According to reports, the fire caused serious damage to the Cathedral of St. Pierre and St. Paul. The pipe organ in the church was completely burned, and the stained glass window behind the pipe organ was also severely damaged.
Brunet, the chief architect of the French historic preservation building, believes that it is conservatively estimated that the restoration of the Nantes Cathedral will take at least three years.
Comprehensive news: U.S. unilateralism undermines relations between the two countries. International public opinion supports China's countermeasures against the United States-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26, comprehensive Xinhua News Agency foreign reporters reported: On the morning of July 24, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs notified the U.S. Embassy in China that China had decided to revoke the establishment and operation license of the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu, and put forward specific requirements for the Consulate General to cease all business and activities.
International public opinion believes that the unilateral measures taken by the United States have caused serious problems in Sino-US relations. China has responded to the unreasonable provocation of the United States, and it is legitimate and necessary to take countermeasures.
Andrés Borks, director of the China Studies Center of the Institute of International Studies of the University of Chile, said that the unilateral measures of the United States have destroyed the bridge of understanding between the peoples of China and the United States and caused a crisis in the relationship between the two major powers.
China's notification to the United States to close its Consulate General in Chengdu is a countermeasure to the unilateral measures of the United States and conforms to diplomatic practice.
Patricio Giusto, a professor at the Catholic University of Argentina and director of the Arab-Chinese Research Center, believes that the above-mentioned Chinese decision is a legitimate and necessary countermeasure to the previous provocation of the United States and is not aimed at ordinary Americans.
The United States tried to use pressure on China to cover up its ineffective response to the new crown epidemic and divert the attention of the American people.
Bambang Suryono, chairman of the Asian Innovation Research Center, an Indonesian think tank, said that the provocative diplomatic stance adopted by the United States has caused serious problems in Sino-US relations, and the bilateral relations are facing severe challenges.
China's notification to the United States to close its Consulate General in Chengdu is a normal countermeasure and conforms to diplomatic practice. It not only reflects China's principled position of resolutely safeguarding its own interests, but also reflects the rationality and efficiency of China's diplomacy.
Francis Semwenza, a current affairs commentator in Tanzania, said that China's above decision is a legitimate and necessary response to the provocation of the United States.
If Sino-US relations are to return to normal, the United States should take the initiative to improve relations with China and stop interfering in China's internal affairs.
The United States should focus on how to achieve a win-win situation with China economically and politically, and how to benefit the people of the two countries and the entire international community.
Ali Yousef, executive director of the Arab-Chinese Friendship Association Federation based in Sudan, said that the countermeasures that China was forced to take were a legitimate and necessary response to the unreasonable actions of the United States, in accordance with international law and the basic norms of international relations, and in accordance with diplomatic practice.
The previous request by the United States to close the Chinese Consulate General in Houston seriously violated international law and the basic norms of international relations.
It is hoped that the United States will rescind the previous relevant decisions and create necessary conditions for the return of bilateral relations to normal.
Singapore's "United Morning Post" published an editorial saying that the greater strategic intention of the United States is to contain China and prevent China from continuing to rise.
In the face of the tight pace of the United States, although China is very reluctant to see Sino-US relations continue to deteriorate, it has to take countermeasures.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 26 (Reporter Mao Xin) The reporter learned from the Guangdong Maritime Police Bureau that recently, the bureau, together with the Guangzhou Customs and Public Security Department, knocked out a super-large refined oil smuggling gang, and preliminarily verified that the gang has smuggled about 120,000 tons of refined oil since 2019, with a case value of about 800 million yuan, and tax evasion of about 240 million yuan.
The Guangdong Maritime Police Bureau and the customs anti-smuggling department have gradually clarified the division of labor and organizational structure of the gang.
On July 8, the Maritime Police, Customs, and Public Security Departments carried out a unified network collection operation in Guangzhou, Foshan and other places, as well as the Pearl River Estuary, and seized 4 suspected smuggled ships on the spot. A total of 4,700 tons of refined oil were seized in the involved ships and oil depots, and a batch of fund accounts were frozen.
It is understood that this joint operation dispatched a total of 8 ships and 2 helicopters, divided into multiple action groups to coordinate operations, and carried out a full-chain attack on sea smuggling, illegal operations on land, etc., and all 35 major criminal suspects were involved.
The case is currently under further investigation.
The relevant person in charge of the Guangdong Maritime Police Bureau said that it will continue to maintain a high-pressure situation in the future, crack down on various illegal and criminal activities of smuggling at sea, and maintain good order in the waters under its jurisdiction.
Hurricane "Hannah" landed in Texas or caused river surges and flash floods-Chinanews.com
China News Service, July 26, comprehensive foreign media reported that at 5: 00 pm local time on the 25th, Hurricane "Hannah" landed in Texas, United States, which will bring strong winds and heavy rains to Texas, soaring rivers, and may also cause life-threatening flash floods.
The National Hurricane Center said that Hurricane Hannah is expected to carry heavy rains across parts of southern and northeastern Texas, and the rain may cause some streams to surge and life-threatening flash floods.
According to the report, the worst affected by Hurricane "Hannah" is the area south of Corpus Christi to the mouth of the Rio Grande River, and the Rio Grande Valley may experience widespread flash floods.
Texas Governor Abbott said on the 25th: "Any hurricane is a huge challenge."
Thirty-two counties in the state entered a disaster emergency due to the hurricane.
Corpus Christi, a city with a population of more than 320,000, has closed libraries and museums, and residents are waiting.
Abbott also said that as Texas is being hit hard by the new crown epidemic, the hurricane cannot be allowed to bring more casualties to Texas.
According to reports, precipitation in southern Texas is expected to reach 6 to 12 inches on the night of the 26th, and 3 to 5 inches of rainfall will also occur in northern Texas and coastal areas of Louisiana.
Due to global warming and other factors, the formation of "Hannah" predates the previous Atlantic hurricane season.
In general, the first hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean usually does not form until mid-August.
Poland will withdraw from the European Treaty on the Prevention of Violence against Women
The Polish Ministry of Justice said Saturday that Poland will take steps next week to withdraw from the European Treaty on the Prevention of Violence against Women.
The cabinet of the Polish right-wing government said that the treaty requires schools to teach students about gender issues, trampling on the rights of students' parents.
Polish Minister of Justice Giobro held a press conference and said that his Ministry of Justice will submit a request to the Ministry of Labor and Family to start withdrawing from the treaty on Monday.
That treaty is also known as the Istanbul Convention.
Jiaobo said, "The treaty contains some elements of ideological nature that we think are harmful."
Poland's ruling Law and Justice Party and its ruling coalition partners have a close alliance with the Roman Catholic Church and advocate a conservative social agenda.
Polish President Duda made hostility to gay rights one of the main issues during his successful re-election campaign this month.
On Friday, thousands of Poles, most of them women, held protests against withdrawal from the convention in Warsaw and other cities.
Lempat, one of the organizers of the protest, said during a protest march in Warsaw that "the purpose of withdrawing from the treaty is to legalize domestic violence."
Some protesters held up banners that read, "Law and Justice Party is a hell for women."
The Law and Justice Party has long complained about the Istanbul Convention.
The previous centrist government in Poland ratified the convention in 2015.
The Law and Justice Party government stated that the treaty does not respect religion and requires that liberal social policies be taught in schools.
But as of now, the party has not decided to withdraw from the convention.

Brazilian President's new crown virus test results turn cloudy-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Brasilia, July 25 (Reporter Zhou Xingzhu) Brazilian President Bolsonaro announced on his personal social media account on the 25th that his latest test for the new crown virus was negative.
In addition to publishing the latest test results, Bolsonaro also posted photos of himself holding a hydroxychloroquine kit on social media.
Bolsonaro has always insisted that this drug can effectively treat the new crown virus infection, and has repeatedly shown that he is taking this drug through social media live broadcasts.
According to Brazilian media reports, Bolsonaro drove a motorcycle after announcing the results of the virus test on the same day, and traveled to many places in the capital Brasilia, where he also met with a Congressman.
Prior to this, Bolsonaro had been working in isolation in the presidential residence.
Bolsonaro announced in a joint live broadcast of several local media on the 7th of this month that he himself tested positive for the new crown virus on the 6th, and conducted two more tests on the 14th and 21st, all of which were positive.
Jiangxi opens a "green passageway" for young people on the front line of flood fighting to join the army-Xinhua Net
Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, July 26 (Guo Dongming, Xiong Liang) The Recruitment Office of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government recently made it clear that individuals or their children who have excelled in this flood relief and disaster relief mission meet the conditions for recruitment, and those who are qualified in both medical examinations and political examinations will be given priority.
"After the young conscripts are registered, we will jointly check with the communities where the young conscripts live, the Street Armed Forces Department and the Fuyang District Recruitment Office to give priority to the soldiers."
Wang Hui, deputy minister of the People's Armed Forces Department of Nanyang District, Jiujiang City, said that affected by the floods, they began on the 25th and concentrated on 3 days to organize medical examinations for young applicants.
Zhou Jingfan, a young recruit from Xunyang District, Jiujiang City, is a 22-year-old college graduate. His mother is a community worker and his father is a veteran of a certain department of the Air Force. Zhou Jingfan's parents have been on duty on the front line of flood prevention and flood fighting for more than a dozen days.
"These days, I see in the news that the people's children and soldiers are desperate to defend their hometown on the front line of flood fighting. I also want to be like them."
Zhou Jingfan said that he had a dream of joining the army since he was a child, and his determination to join the military camp was strengthened through this flood fight.
Jiujiang City also regards flood fighting and rescue as a "living teaching material" for conscription propaganda. They use the community as a unit to call on young conscripts to voluntarily participate in tasks such as patrolling dikes and on-duty duty. They now understand the nature and purpose of the people's army and strengthen their confidence to join the army and report to the country.
Locke Jiuyu, political commissar of the People's Armed Forces Department of Xunyang District, Jiujiang City, said that by giving priority to the recruitment of soldiers, he hopes to motivate more young conscripts and create a good social atmosphere in which it is glorious to participate in the task and join the army.
According to the Vietnam News Agency, Grivori believes that Vietnam has made great contributions to the development of ASEAN in the past 25 years.
Vietnam is not only a responsible member of ASEAN, but also the locomotive of ASEAN.
Grivori said that Russia and even the Asia-Europe Economic Union believe that Vietnam has contributed to the enhancement of ASEAN's status and the promotion of its image abroad.
He stressed that "ASEAN should therefore thank Vietnam."
Grivori said that analysts approved of Vietnam's peace initiative.
Vietnam is willing to share its experience with ASEAN countries and propose constructive peace measures on the problems facing the Asia-Pacific region, including the East China Sea issue.
Regarding the cooperation between Vietnam and Russia under the ASEAN framework, Grivori believes that Vietnam provides support for the cooperative relationship between Russia and ASEAN and helps Russia gain benefits under this cooperation framework.
The Asia-Europe Economic Union, including Russia, can enter the ASEAN market after signing a free trade agreement with Vietnam.
Greivoli proposes to maximize the free trade area between the Asia-Europe Economic Union and ASEAN countries, thereby creating a platform for economy, security and stability.
Grivori also believes that Russia, Vietnam and ASEAN are on the right track and will achieve their goals.
From now until the end of 2020, Beijiang Province will have the necessary conditions, especially in terms of infrastructure, human resources and land, in order to proactively welcome the inflow of foreign capital, especially multinational groups that have value chains and transfer advanced technology.
In addition, Beijiang Province will complete the submission of the Prime Minister's decision to invest in infrastructure construction and operation projects in the Vietnam-Korea Industrial Zone and approve the addition of the two industrial-urban-service areas in the province, Anshan-Beilong and Anlu, to the overall plan for the development of Vietnam's industrial zone up to 2020.
At the same time, Beijiang Province is working hard to accelerate the progress of various projects, especially the infrastructure construction and operation projects in the industrial park clusters of Hefu, Gwangzhou, Shuangxi-Neihuang, etc., to form a land fund for attracting investment.
In 2020, the Beijiang Provincial Bureau of Industry and Trade will provide suggestions and suggestions on the planning of industrial zones and industrial clusters for inclusion in the provincial planning.
Beijiang Province has decided to combine the development of industrial park clusters with ensuring national defense security, protecting the ecological environment, and ensuring food security, thereby promoting balanced industrial development; it has comprehensive infrastructure such as electricity, water supply, transportation and telecommunications, and is integrated with urban construction, trade services, workers "housing and other social infrastructure such as health care, education, etc.

In the industrial park cluster, the province calls for small and medium-sized investment projects in the production and use of local labor, especially in the fields of agricultural products and food processing.
In the future, Beijiang Province will focus on accelerating investment in the infrastructure of the logistics and logistics center of Beijiang City, and develop simultaneously with the industrial park cluster to optimize the circulation of goods and currency and help reduce production costs, increase the value of goods, optimize the supply chain, and develop multimodal transportation, thereby creating attractiveness for investors to invest in the province.
The upgraded Russian Armed Helicopter Card-52m was first produced at the end of the year-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 25. According to the plan of the Russian Ministry of Defense, the upgraded version of the Russian armed helicopter (hereinafter referred to as Wuzhi) Ka-52, the Ka-52m, will be transformed and shipped for the first time in December this year. This model will be greatly improved in reconnaissance, communication, and weapon performance.
According to a recent report by the Russian "Yediot", the Wuzhika-52m is called the "Super Alligator." Its development contract was signed by the Russian military and military industrial units in April last year. At present, the first two of the upgraded version of Wuzhi are undergoing renovation and replacement at the Far East Helicopter Manufacturing Plant of the Russian "Progress" Aerospace Group. Its national-level testing and improvement work will be completed by October 2022.
According to Russian experts who understand the above-mentioned upgrading work, the "predecessor" of the "Super Alligator" -Wuzhika-52 was officially installed in November 2011. The model exposed some weaknesses in use. This renovation and upgrade is precisely to "make up for shortcomings."
According to the report, compared with the Ka-52, the Ka-52m will partially adopt new protective materials that will not increase weight. Its pilot cockpit will be reinforced and equipped with new equipment to resist missile attacks, thereby increasing the probability of survival on the battlefield; a more powerful generator will be assembled to power more complex airborne electronic equipment; the photoelectric system will be upgraded to detect and identify more distant battlefield targets; the new light multi-purpose missile equipped with major attack armored combat vehicles and reinforced concrete fortifications has a range of 20 kilometers, which is about double the range of similar missiles used by Russia's active military forces; its defense weapons and communication equipment will be used as much as possible with the Mi-28NM armed helicopters that can attack air targets, making related maintenance simple and economical.
In addition, the Ka-52m will have more advanced electronic guidance systems, weapon targeting systems, and navigation equipment.
Russian experts also said that it is worth noting that the Ka-52m will be equipped with communication equipment to communicate with drones, so as to obtain real-time information transmitted by nearby drones in the air, such as displaying images taken by drones on the cockpit screen of the helicopter.
According to the plan, the pilots of the Ka-52m can directly control the drones that cooperate with them, thereby improving the pilot's grasp of the battlefield situation and the guidance of long-range missiles.
According to Russian media reports, Russian Deputy Defense Minister Krivoruchko stated in December last year that the Russian Ministry of Defense plans to purchase more than 110 Wuzhika-52Ms by 2027.
The new law stipulates that the Campania metropolitan area must wear masks in indoor public places from now on, and violators can be fined up to 1,000 euros.
On June 1, local time, the Colosseum in Rome, the capital of Italy, reopened.
According to reports, according to the latest epidemic prevention decree issued by the regional government, people in Campania must wear masks in all public transportation, as well as indoor public places such as shops, bars, supermarkets, and exhibition halls.
Violation of this rule is punishable by a fine of up to 1,000 euros.
The decree also stipulates that all passengers from non-Schengen countries entering the Campania region must be quarantined.
The regional government will authorize health agencies to coordinate arrangements for specific hotels to isolate positive asymptomatic patients.
The decree came into effect on July 25.
In less than an hour, three customers who entered the supermarket have accepted the fine.
Hebei has replenished 1.75 billion cubic meters of ecological water from rivers and lakes since this year-Chinanews.com
Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, July 26 (Reporter Wang Kun) The reporter learned from the Hebei Provincial Department of Water Resources that since the beginning of this year, Hebei Province has coordinated the use of diversion water and local reservoir water, and has successively implemented ecological water replenishment to 28 rivers and Baiyangdian, including the Hutuo River, Tang River, and Dongma River, and completed a total of 1.75 billion cubic meters of ecological water replenishment for rivers and lakes.
Hebei Province firmly grasped the favorable opportunity of increasing the flow of water in the middle line of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project, and used the diversion of river water to implement ecological water replenishment to rivers such as the Tang River, the Shahe River and the Zhulong River.
At the same time, nine large and medium-sized reservoirs such as Xidayang and Dongwushi and Baiyangdian have been used to implement ecological water replenishment to rivers such as Xiyang River and Qinglong River, resulting in a cumulative surface area of more than 90 square kilometers.
In order to do a good job in ecological water replenishment, the Hebei Provincial Department of Water Resources actively organizes the investigation of hidden dangers in water replenishment rivers, rectification and reinforcement, and river cleaning, refines practical measures, and strengthens inspection and protection.
Through supervision and inspection and centralized unannounced visits, various problems were resolved in a timely manner to ensure the safe and orderly replenishment of the river.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Hebei Provincial Department of Water Resources, the orderly implementation of river and lake ecological water replenishment has effectively restored the river and lake water ecological environment of Hebei Province, promoted the replenishment and conservation of coastal groundwater, greatly improved the living environment and economic development environment along the route, and is of great significance for the realization of the river and lake management and protection goals of "clear water, green shores, smooth rivers, and beautiful scenery."
You should all know the facts I want to tell.
I think this intuition that inequality can cause social division and corruption existed before the French Revolution.
The difference is that we can now find evidence. We can understand the impact of inequality by comparing societies with different levels of equality.
I will show you some data and explain why those data are indeed related.
But first, let's see how bitter our lives are.
(Laughter) I want to start my speech with a contradiction.
This graph shows the relationship between our average life expectancy and gross national income-the latter measures the average wealth of the country.
You can look at the countries on the right, like Norway and the United States, which are twice as rich as the countries on the left such as Israel, Greece, and Portugal.
But this did not affect the average life expectancy of their citizens.
There is no sign of correlation.
But if we go to understand the inside of society, we can find that there is a big difference in health status within their entire society.
What this picture shows is still the average life expectancy.
These are small towns in England and Wales-the poorest on the right and the richest on the left.
There is a big difference between the poor and others.
Even those who are just below the top have poorer health than those at the top.
So income means a lot in our society, but the comparison between different societies is meaningless.
The explanation of that contradiction is that in our society, we look at relative income or social status, identity-that is, the mutual relationship between us and the size of the gap between people.
Once you have that idea, you should immediately think: What will happen if the gap widens? What if the gap is narrowed? What will happen to widening or reducing the income gap?
This is what I'm going to tell you right away.
I didn't use any hypothetical data.
My data comes from the United Nations-like the World Bank's data-about the income gap between these rich, developed market democracies.
The method we use is simple and easy to understand, and you can download it, is to compare the income gap between the top 20% and the bottom 20% of each country.
You can see that the countries on the left are all relatively equal-Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden-their top 20% are about 3.5 to 4 times richer than the bottom 20%.
But on the other side of inequality - the United Kingdom, Portugal, the United States, Singapore - the income gap is twice as large.
In this way of comparison, the level of inequality in our country (the United Kingdom) is twice that of other equally successful democratic markets.
Next I will show how this affects our society.
We collected data on the problems caused by differences within society, and such problems are more common at the bottom of society.
Internationally comparable data include average life expectancy, children's math and language performance, infant mortality, suicide rate, prison population ratio, teenage pregnancy rate, degree of mutual trust, obesity, mental illness-these diseases all meet the standard diagnostic classification including drug addiction and alcohol addiction-and social mobility rates.
We put all of this into one coefficient.
They are all weighted equally.
The score of a country is the average of these factors.
As you can see, these scores are related to the inequality comparison I just showed, and I will show these data repeatedly.
The more unequal the country, the worse it performs on various social issues.
The correlation is very strong.
But if you look at the same health and social issues compared with the index of per capita national income and gross national income, then you will find nothing and there is no correlation anymore.
We are a little worried that people may think that we are picking specific issues to cater to our theories and then artificially creating evidence. So we also published a paper on the UNICEF Child Welfare Index in the British Medical Journal.
It contains 40 different parts, summaries from others.
It includes whether children can talk to their parents, whether there are books in the home, what is the immunization rate, and whether there is bullying in the school.
Everything is included.
This is the relationship between the index and the same degree of inequality.
In a more unequal society, the worse the performance of children.
The relationship is remarkable.
But again, if you look at the relationship between child welfare and per capita national income, you will get nothing. There is no sign of correlation.
All the data I have shown you so far reveal the same thing.
The average welfare of our society no longer depends on national income and economic growth.
They are very important in poorer countries, but not in rich developed countries.
And the differences between us and our position vis-à-vis others now seem very important.
Below, I will show you some parts of our index.
This is the mutual trust index.
Refers to the proportion of people who agree that most people are credible.
This is data from the "World Values Survey."
As you can see, on the more unequal side, about 15% of people feel that they can trust others.
But in a more equal society, this proportion has risen to 60% or 65%.
If you look at the participation in community activities or the assessment of social capital, there are very similar associations and inequality are closely related.
I want to say that we repeated this work twice.
The first time we targeted these rich developed countries, we later changed the test subjects and repeated this test for 50 states in the United States - investigating the same question: Whether those states that are more unequal are doing worse on all these assessments?
This is the relationship between mutual trust and inequality reached by the federal government in a general social survey.
Very similar scattered points are distributed in a similar range of trust levels.
The same thing continues.
Basically, we found that almost all the factors related to mutual trust reflected in the international survey are also reflected in the 50 states we surveyed separately.
This is no coincidence.
This picture is a mental illness.
The World Health Organization collects data through random sampling and using the same diagnostic interview method so that we can compare the rates of mental illness in each society.
This is the ratio of the population with any kind of mental illness in the previous year.
It ranges from 8% to more than 24% - which shows that the proportion of mental illness in the whole society is three times that of other societies.
Similarly, these are closely related to inequality.
This picture is the crime rate.
The red dots represent the states in the United States, and the blue triangle represents the provinces in Canada.
But look at the difference in their numbers.
The murder rate ranges from 15 to 150 per million.
This is the ratio of prison inmates.
This is a gap of 10 times, and the exponential function will magnify this gap.
But the range of changes in the prison population is from 40 to 400.
Crime is not the main reason for this relationship.
In some places, crime can explain part of the reason.
But there are more severe trials, or harsher trials.
The more unequal society is, the more inclined it is to retain the death penalty.
This picture shows the drop-out status of children in high school.
Again, the gap is wide.
If we discuss the selection of social talents, we will find that the harm of this gap is very serious.
This picture shows the social mobility rate.
In fact, it is calculated based on the turnover rate of income.
Basically, what it asks is: Does rich dad have rich children, poor dad have poor children, or is there no relationship between the two?
On the more unequal side, dad's income is more important-for example, the United Kingdom and the United States.
In northern Europe, dad's income is not so important.
There is more social class mobility there.
As we often say - I know there are many American listeners here - if Americans want to realize their "American Dream", they should go to Denmark.
(Laughter) (Applause) What I have shown is marked here in italics.
I can also show some other questions.
Those problems are more common at the bottom of the social gradient.
But there are endless problems with social gradients, and these problems are worse in unequal countries - not just a little bit worse, but everything is twice as bad as 10 times.
Think about the cost, the cost of labor.
I want to go back to this picture that was shown earlier. We combined everything to illustrate two points.
First, through chart after chart, we find that those countries that perform poorly, no matter what, seem to be more unequal countries, but those that perform well seem to be Northern Europe and Japan.
So what we see is the relationship between general social disorder and inequality.
Not just one or two things went wrong, but almost everything.
Another very important point I want to point out on this picture is that if you look at the bottom, Switzerland and Japan, they show that they are very different countries in all respects.
The status of women and their adherence to small families are at two extremes in rich and developed countries.
But another very important difference is how they achieve greater equality.
Sweden has a big difference in income, but it uses taxes, state benefits, generous relief, etc., to narrow the gap.
Japan is quite different.
First, the pre-tax wage gap in Japan is relatively small.
It has lower taxes.
Its benefits are also relatively small.
In the study of the states in the United States, we found a sharp contrast.
Some states performed well through redistribution, while others performed well because of the small pre-tax income gap.
So we come to the conclusion that how to achieve greater equality is not important, what is important is that such equality can be achieved.
I am not talking about complete equality. What I am talking about does exist in rich developed market democracies.
Another unexpected thing about this picture is that it is not just the poor who will be affected by inequality.
The words of John Donne (British poet) seem to make sense: "No one is an island."
Through a series of studies, we can compare the behavior of people from every social class in different countries with more or less equal degrees.
This is just one example.
This picture is the infant mortality rate.
According to the British General Socio-Economic Classification records, some Swedes have very kindly classified many infant deaths.
This is an anachronistic classification based on the father's position, so single mothers form their own set of data.
But we look at the so-called "lower classes of society", which is manual work without technology.
In the middle is manual work that requires technology, and then advanced non-manual work, up to professional work-doctors, lawyers, managers of large companies.
It can be seen here that Sweden is doing better than the United Kingdom and is doing better in every social class.
The biggest difference appears at the bottom of society.
But even at the top, living in a more equal society has some advantages.
We showed 5 different sets of data, including American and international education results and health status.
It seems that on the whole - a more equal society shows the most obvious differences at the bottom of society, but it will also have some advantages at the top of society.
I should explain what is going on.
I think I am showing and discussing the impact of inequality on social psychology.
More attention is paid to the sense of superiority and inferiority, valued and looked down upon, respected and devalued.
Of course, those feelings generated by the competition of status and status have promoted the advancement of social consumerism.
But it also leads to the uncertainty of status.
What we worry more about is how others judge and view us, whether we look attractive, smart, or something like that.
Social value evaluation enhances the fear of these social value evaluations.
Interestingly, some similar work in the field of social psychology is also under way: Some people consulted 208 different studies; in the study, volunteers were invited to a psychological testing center and then tested their stress Holmon and their reactions when performing stress tasks.
In this observation, scientists are interested in which kind of stress can best increase the level of cortisol, the most important stress in the body, Holmon.
The result is precisely those tasks that include the threat of social evaluation - tasks that threaten self-esteem and social status - in which others can negatively evaluate your performance.
These stresses have very special effects on stress physiology.
At present, we have accepted the criticism.
Of course, some people don't like this, and some people find this very unexpected.
However, I should still tell you that when people criticize us for picking data, we have never done so.
We have an unconditional rule that if our data source contains data from the observed country, then we will include it in the analysis.
Our data source determines whether the data is valid, not us.
Otherwise, deviations will occur.
What about other countries?
Among the academic peer-reviewed journals, there are 200 studies on the relationship between health and income and equality.
This is not limited to these countries here, there is a very simple proof hidden.
The same method of measuring inequality in the same country, one problem after another.
Why don't we control other factors?
I have shown you that per capita national income has not had any impact.
Of course, others have applied more complex methods in the literature to exclude factors such as poverty and education in the experiment.
What about the causal relationship?
Correlation alone does not prove a causal link.
We spent a considerable amount of time.
Indeed, people have a good understanding of the causal link between our results.
The biggest change in our understanding of the drivers of long-term health in rich and developed countries is how important long-term stress from society is on immunity and the cardiovascular system
Or, for example, the reason why violence is becoming more and more common in more unequal countries is because people are very sensitive to being looked down upon.
I want to say that in order to solve this problem, we should solve a series of post-tax and pre-tax problems.
We should limit income and curb the top bonus income culture.
I think we must do everything we can to make our leaders accountable to their employees.
The last thing I want to summarize is that we can improve our real quality of life by reducing our income gap.
In this way, we will find that we have suddenly solved the social and mental health problems of the whole society, which is really great.
Thank you.

(Deutsche Welle Chinese website) In the past two weeks, the number of new crown confirmed cases in Spain has rebounded significantly, with thousands of new cases occurring in many days.
The British government temporarily decided on the evening of Saturday (July 25) to remove Spain from the safe travel list from 0: 00 local time on the 26th, and people entering the United Kingdom from Spain must be quarantined for 14 days.
British tourists who were on holiday in Spain expressed surprise, worry, and even anger when they heard about this decision, because the news was sudden and caught off guard.
According to reports, British Transport Secretary Grant Shapps is also currently on vacation in Spain.
Before the UK issued the quarantine measures, Norway has also announced that people returning to Norway from Spain will be quarantined for 10 days.
France and Belgium advise their residents to abandon plans for vacations in Barcelona and surrounding areas ahead.
The beaches in these areas are overcrowded, and people cannot maintain social distance from each other. At one time, the police needed to take measures to reduce the number of beach tourists.
Tourism is an important pillar industry in Spain
Spain: It's safe here
In response to the decision made by the United Kingdom, the Spanish Foreign Ministry said on Sunday that the epidemic in the country is under control.
Spanish Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya emphasized to the media: "Spain is safe, not only for Spaniards, but also for tourists."
The Spanish government will try to persuade the British government to exclude the Balearic Islands and Canary Islands from the isolation measures.
The reason is that the infection rate of these two tourist resorts is much lower than that of the British mainland.
In order to prevent the spread of the epidemic, the Catalonia region of Spain has also restarted the "foot ban."
Tourism is an important pillar industry in Spain, and Spain is one of the most popular resorts for British tourists.
This British decision is expected to greatly affect Spain's tourism industry.

Zhongfu First Day: Beijing takes a break from the high temperature and heat to open the rainfall pattern-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 (Reporter Ni Yuanjin) July 26 is the first day of this year's "Zhong Fu."
The heavy wind, showers and convective weather in the early morning of the 26th dispersed the heat and heat that had been shrouded in Beijing for several days, and a new round of rain and weather will last for several days.
The Beijing Meteorological Station announced at 11 o'clock on the 26th that there were scattered showers (accompanied by weak thunder and lightning) in Beijing on the 26th, and the daily maximum temperature was only 27 ℃; there was light to moderate rain at night (accompanied by weak thunder and lightning), and the minimum temperature at night was 23 ℃.
From the 24th to the 25th, the city of Beijing was in the high temperature blue warning. The daily maximum temperature in most areas was around 37 ℃, and the local high temperature exceeded 40 ℃.
Futian is the hottest, humid, and sultry day of the year. There are "three volts" in a year, and the hottest is in the middle volt. It is at this time that the Chinese people say "bitter summer."
When entering the cave, every family fills the barn, and there is a folk saying of "one-volt dumpling and two-volt noodles."
According to the current forecast, there will be more rainy weather in Beijing in the next three days.
The meteorological department advised the public to minimize travel in mountainous areas and guard against geological disasters.
It is understood that this year's "Zhong Fu" has 20 days, starting on July 26 and ending on August 14.
After entering "Zhong Fu", people will feel weak and loss of appetite.
On the diet, you can choose mung beans, coix, and other foods that have the effect of clearing heat and relieving heat, strengthening the spleen and appetizing, as well as bitter foods such as bitter vegetables and bitter gourd, which can help increase appetite and dispel heat.
The engine may be extinguished. FAA urgently ordered the investigation of 2,000 Boeing airliners-Xinhuanet
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an emergency airworthiness directive on the 24th, requiring emergency inspections of about 2,000 Boeing 737NG and 737 Classic airliners registered in the United States. The reason is that the corrosion of the air check valve of the above-mentioned airliner may cause the engine to park in the air.
The FAA said that it has so far received 4 reports of 737NG and 737Classic passenger aircraft engine parking in the air, so it has made an emergency inspection request. The inspection object is the passenger plane that has been parked for 7 days or more continuously and the passenger plane that has flown less than 11 times so far after being relaunched.
The FAA warned that if the level 5 check valves of all two engines of the airliner are corroded, they may become stuck in the open position, causing the airliner to completely lose power and unable to restart the engine.
This aviation regulatory agency ordered that once the check valve is found to be corroded, the airline operator must replace this key component before the passenger plane is put into service again.
Boeing responded later that day that the outbreak of the new crown epidemic has reduced travel demand, and many passenger planes have been sealed or used less, and "check valves are more likely to be corroded."
Boeing also said that it has advised air operators to inspect the passenger aircraft involved in the directive, and if problems are found, Boeing will provide assistance in repairing and replacing check valves.
The Associated Press reported that airliners owned by major U.S. air operators usually fly many times in a day, but after the outbreak of the new crown epidemic, a large number of airliners were grounded; as passenger travel demand has slowly increased recently, some airliners have returned to operation.
The FAA did not release the details of the four air parking reports.
Alaska Airlines disclosed one of the incidents later on the 24th.
The airline operator said in a statement that one of its airliners was en route from Seattle, Washington, to Austin, Texas, on July 15, when an engine suddenly turned off, and the airliner finally made an emergency landing at Austin Airport.
Alaska Airlines said that it had replaced the engine of the airliner and had inspected the engines of six airliners in accordance with FAA instructions.
American Airlines, United Airlines, and Southwest Airlines said separately on the 24th that their airliners did not have engine outages associated with air check valves.
Four airliners under American Airlines will be inspected, and 28 passenger aircraft under United Airlines will be inspected.
Delta Air Lines said it would inspect its 20 passenger aircraft, but did not say whether there had been engine outages.
Many media reported that the FAA's emergency airworthiness directive is another impact on Boeing.
Indonesian Lion Airlines and Ethiopian Airlines each crashed a Boeing 737MAX airliner in October 2018 and March 2019 respectively, killing a total of 346 people.
This series of airliners was subsequently grounded worldwide. Production ceased in January this year, and production resumed in May.
FAA Director Steve Dickson admitted in June that the FAA "made a mistake" in its supervision of Boeing with regard to the 737MAX airliner.
"Ding Dong is online! Good teacher" will be launched next week. Xue Zhaofeng leads the "Knowledge Initiator-Xinhuanet
There is also a new variety show online.
The interactive knowledge sharing program "Ding Dong Online! Good Teacher" will be broadcast on Hunan Satellite TV from July 20.
It is understood that the program will create a brand-new all-age youth classroom, and a group of handsome and talented teachers will be on the scene to challenge interesting knowledge output.
Different from the serious impression of teacher groups in the public mind in the past, "Ding Dong Online! Good Teacher" gathers a group of intellectual representatives with both face and talent.
They are not only young knowledge role models from various disciplines, but also a group of all-round "paragraph players" who can shake their burdens and are good at teaching and fun.
In the program, this group of outstanding young knowledge role models, as "knowledge sharing officers", will challenge the interesting knowledge classroom.
They need to show the most interesting aspect of their discipline through an attitude of knowledge output to impress the audience present.
The "Question Group" composed of audiences of all ages will raise ever-changing questions on the spot, making the teaching of the "knowledge sharing officer" more difficult, and adding a little stimulating atmosphere to the program.

Chief Secretary for Administration of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government: The situation is severe and fully fight the epidemic-Chinanews.com
Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 26. Zhang Jianzong, Chief Secretary for Administration of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, said on the 26th that the situation of the new crown pneumonia epidemic in Hong Kong continues to be severe. If the epidemic turns worse, the SAR government will resolutely take stricter control measures to further restrict the operation of business premises and reduce the space for citizens to go out.
However, at this stage, the SAR government has no intention of introducing a "stay at home order" or a "foot ban order" to restrict citizens from going out.
Zhang Jianzong published a blog entitled "The situation is severe and full efforts to fight the epidemic" on the same day.
He said that this wave of epidemic is the most severe in six months, and the next two weeks will be very critical. We must try our best to prevent the virus from spreading further in the community.
In addition to the necessary measures taken by the SAR government, citizen self-discipline and cooperation are also very important.
He urged citizens to stay at home as much as possible, reduce social contacts and eat out.
Citizens should cooperate with the compulsory measures of wearing masks to protect themselves and others, and pay attention to personal and environmental hygiene and frequent hand washing. They should also suspend non-essential gatherings or dinners of relatives and friends and reduce them to markets.
He said that the central government has always been very concerned about the changes in the epidemic in Hong Kong and supported the SAR government's epidemic prevention and anti-epidemic work, and has actively responded to the latest request of the Chief Executive to provide assistance in increasing testing capabilities and retrofitting the Asia World Expo for work similar to "square cabin hospitals."
Zhang Jianzong said that the free virus testing provided by the SAR government for specific high-risk groups, namely residential care homes for the elderly, disabled homes and nursing home employees, restaurant employees, taxi drivers and property management employees, has been fully launched, involving as many as 400,000 people.
He is very concerned about the infection cases in residential care homes for the elderly. The SAR government has arranged specific temporary quarantine centers for residents of residential care homes for the elderly.
He said that the SAR government is building a quarantine facility near the Penny's Bay Quarantine Center in Lantau, New Territories, and is expected to provide 700 additional isolation rooms by the end of September.
The Chief Executive also announced on the 19th that the SAR government will build 2,000 more isolation rooms at the Penny's Bay Quarantine Center and strive to be completed by the end of this year.
Together with the 800 quarantine centers already in use, the Penny's Bay Quarantine Center is expected to provide a total of 3,500 isolation rooms by the end of the year.
There are currently four active quarantine centers in Hong Kong, providing a total of about 2,600 quarantine rooms.
In addition, the SAR government reopened the Lei Yue Mun Park Resort on Hong Kong Island on the 24th as a community isolation facility for patients under the age of 50 who have the ability to take care of themselves.
The "nutrient agent" of the history of the party and the history of New China-Chinanews.com

Recently, General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized during a visit to the Siping Battle Memorial Hall: "It is necessary for 1.4 billion people and more than 90 million party members, especially leading cadres at all levels, to study the history of the Communist Party of China and the history of New China well."
Conscientiously studying the history of the party and the history of New China is a compulsory course for party members and cadres not to forget their original intentions and keep their mission in mind. They must draw rich nourishment from them, cultivate the feelings of the family and the country, and follow the long march of the new era.
A magnificent history of the party and the history of New China records the hard work and glorious history of the Communist Party of China since its birth, and shows the faith and loyalty that the Communists have forged with their lives and blood, and the original intention and mission that they will always adhere to.
History is the best textbook. For party members and cadres, party history and the history of New China are the most brilliant chapters in this textbook.
Every party member and cadre must constantly strengthen the historical thinking of taking history as a mirror and moving towards the future, based on the new journey and new mission, take over the "baton" of the times, and walk the long march of the present generation.
Cast the soul with history and stick to the original mission in the study of party history and the history of New China.
Turning over the history of the party and the history of New China, it is full of the unchanging original mission and firm faith of the Chinese Communists, which demonstrates the simple feelings of the Communists to be with the people forever.
To understand important events, important meetings, and important figures in the history of the party and New China at close range is not only an intuitive soul shock, a baptism of thought, but also a deep understanding of the connotation of the original belief and the weight of the mission.
For party members and cadres, if they want to continuously consolidate their original mission and maintain their advanced qualities, they must find the origin of our departure and the fulcrum of our original intention from the history of the party and the history of New China, maintain a clear understanding and a firm stand, and excite the power to work hard for the country and the people to ensure that the red rivers and mountains laid down by the revolutionary ancestors with their blood and lives are passed on from generation to generation.
It is wise to study history and pass on the lofty spirit in the study of party history and the history of New China.
Since the founding of the Communist Party of China, it has successively shaped a series of great spirits such as the Red Boat Spirit, the Jinggangshan Spirit, the Long March Spirit, the Yan'an Spirit, the Anti-Japanese War Spirit, the Xibaipo Spirit, the "Two Bombs and One Star" Spirit, and the Space Spirit.
These great spirits precipitated by history have provided our party with a strong spiritual incentive to overcome various risks and challenges on the way forward, and are precious spiritual assets that cannot be defeated, washed away, or taken away.
The process of studying party history and Chinese history is a process of revisiting these spirits and shaping one's own spirit. We must consciously take the lofty spirit of the revolutionary ancestors as the mirror, adhere to the spiritual home of the Communists, build a solid spiritual foundation for advancing the great cause and realizing the great dream, and inherit and carry forward these spirits, radiating a new era of light.
Read history for self-examination, and constantly save righteousness and dispel evil in the study of party history and the history of New China.
For party members and cadres, there has never been any history that can bring more profound warning, enlightenment and reference than the history of the party and the history of New China.
In the history of the party and the history of New China, we can not only see the great deeds of the older generation of revolutionaries who were determined to devote themselves to their beliefs and persevere in their struggle to achieve the set goals, but also see the profound lessons of certain figures who have been shaken by their ideals and beliefs and walked to the opposite of the revolution, enlightening and warning us with firm determination and will to never stagnate, never slack, always maintain a strong and tenacious fighting spirit, and constantly purify the party spirit and practice self-discipline.
If you want to truly become a firm believer and loyal practitioner of the lofty ideals of communism, you need to brush away the "dust" of thought and strictly prevent "dirt" from getting into the body. Party history and the history of New China should become the basis for every party member and cadre to examine himself and warn himself.
Learn about history and be motivated to take on the important tasks of the times in the study of party history and the history of New China.
General Secretary Xi Jinping once pointed out: "Studying party history and national history is a compulsory course to adhere to and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics and push forward the various undertakings of the party and the country."
Look back at history and ask the original heart, in order to continue glory and move towards the future.
Every party member and cadre should take the study of party history and the history of New China as a lifelong pursuit, constantly set the course of life in the study, courageously assume the historical mission, dare to take responsibility, and take the initiative in their respective jobs.
Adhere to the advanced deeds of the older generation of revolutionaries as a reference and guide, constantly polish the political qualities of the Communists, maintain the attitude of striving for the future, striving for success, and the spirit of struggle that is more difficult and more difficult, and write a brilliant stroke of your own in the vast journey of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
"Plug up Jiangnan" to pursue the poetic "Yellow River Dream "-Chinanews.com
(China Poverty Reduction Story) "Put Jiangnan" Pursuit of Poetic "Yellow River Dream"
China News Agency, Yinchuan, July 26 (Yang Di) "Jiuqu Yellow River Wanli Sands, waves and winds ripple from the horizon."
The Yellow River, which has aroused the feelings of countless literati, has given birth to the beautiful and rich Ningxia Plain. Today, Ningxia, which has the reputation of "stuffing Jiangnan", is adhering to the concept of "ecological priority, green development" and pursuing the poetic "Yellow River Dream."
The "Bebo Dream" of the River Qingshui Show
"The Yellow River in the world is rich in Ningxia." The Yellow River flows through Ningxia for 397 kilometers. It is the "mother river" for raising one side.
However, with the rapid advancement of industrialization and urbanization, the development and utilization of rivers and lakes are unbalanced with management and protection, and chaos such as over-standard sewage discharge, lake reclamation, and encroachment on waters have emerged, resulting in black and smelly water bodies, excessive water quality, dirty environment, and ecological degradation.
Now, Ningxia is promoting the restoration of diverse water ecology and working hard to return the Yellow River.
Water control must start from the source.
In Yinchuan, Ningxia, the local government adopted the method of "standard improvement + pollution control + strict management", all sewage in industrial parks were treated centrally, all urban sewage treatment plants achieved level A standard discharge, and the black and smelly water bodies in urban built-up areas were basically eliminated, and the third batch of Chinese black and smelly water demonstration cities was successfully declared.
In addition, Ningxia fully implemented the river and lake length system in 2017, and now it has achieved full coverage of the five-level river and lake chief responsibility system in districts, cities, counties and villages, and the river and lake long patrol has become the norm.
The 64-year-old Gu Jincheng lives in a village by the Yellow River. He witnessed the changes in the Yellow River: "The previous water has a bad smell, and after rectification, the smell is gone."
Gu Jincheng said that the ecological environment is good and his life is more comfortable. Now he often goes for a walk by the Yellow River with his family to feel the blue water and blue sky.
The "Wetland Dream" of Shagull Xiang Collection
Birds, green trees, stacks, clear water... the beautiful scenery of "Sand Gull Xiang Collection" written by Fan Zhongyun has become a reality in the Yellow River Wetland Park in Yinchuan, Ningxia.
The Yellow River flows through Ningxia, forming a variety of wetlands such as river wetlands, lake wetlands, and swamp wetlands along the way, which play an important role in promoting the rational use of water resources and water ecological balance, and have also become an important international bird migration channel.
Since 2009, relevant departments in Ningxia have invested a total of about 3.45 billion yuan in wetland protection projects. At present, Yinchuan Wetland covers an area of 192,000 hectares, with a wetland protection rate of 78.5%, there are nearly 200 natural lakes and marsh wetlands, and there are 5 national wetland parks, 1 national urban wetland park, 6 autonomous region-level wetland parks, and 8 municipal parks.
Lu Jinhu, deputy director of the Yinchuan Wetland Protection Center, told reporters that wetland protection has increased biodiversity, which is particularly evident in birds. "The gull is an endangered bird. There are only more than 20,000 in the world, of which Yinchuan Wetland is home to more than 2,000."
At the same time, Ningxia established a 500-meter red line for the wetland protection area on both sides of the Yinchuan section of the Yellow River in accordance with the law, stipulating that except for public welfare projects, no unit or individual may carry out development, construction and business activities within the protected area.
Zhao Shaoyong, deputy director of Yinchuan Water Resources Service Center, introduced that through the treatment of the source of pollution, the comprehensive improvement of river and lake ecology, and the construction of terminal wetlands, the water quality of the nine main yellow drains in Ningxia has now reached 100% of the first class standards. "Now the water is also clear, the fish are swimming, and the flowers are blooming."
The "Drinking Water Dream" of inclusive people's livelihood
Yinchuan City in Ningxia once had the title of "embarrassed": The only city along the Yellow River that "guarded the Yellow River for lack of water and drink."
Since 2010, Yinchuan City has been facing a persistent shortage of water during the peak summer period. The "pain of water shortage" in the past ten years has become a painful summer experience for many high-floor residents. However, under the current situation that major water sources are at the limit of over-mining and a large area of groundwater over-mining funnel area has been formed under the urban underground, water-borne water shortage has become a problem besetting Yinchuan City.
Thanks to the improvement of the water quality of the Yellow River, drinking purified Yellow River water has become a good way to solve the drinking water problems of local residents.
Ding Ming, deputy director of the Yinchuan Water Affairs Bureau, introduced that in order to improve the production and water demand of urban and rural residents in Yinchuan, Ningxia duly launched the urban and rural western water supply project in Yinchuan Metropolitan Area, and replaced the original underground water source with high-quality Yellow River water.
"On December 29, 2019, the water supply project officially opened water to the three districts of Yinchuan City. In 2020, residents of Minning Town and Helan County also drank Yellow River water."
Ding Ming said that the Yinchuan Water Conservancy Department will comprehensively consider the transformation of the integration of regional rural drinking water and urban water supply. "In the next step, we will integrate all the scattered rural water supply points into the western water supply project, and it is expected that the integrated urban and rural water supply in the Yinchuan region will be basically achieved by the end of this year."
Compacting responsibilities and departments to strengthen flood control and disaster relief work-Chinanews.com
Consolidate the responsibilities of various departments to strengthen flood prevention and disaster relief work
CCTV News (News Network): News from the Ministry of Water Resources, at 12 o'clock today (July 25), the river section below Wangjiaba in the main stream of the Huaihe River exceeded the warning water level by 0.64 to 3.31 meters, and the river section below the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the two lakes exceeded the warning water level by 0.05 to 2.02 meters.
Taihu Lake has lasted for 28 days since it exceeded the warning water level on June 28.
At 12 o'clock today, the average water level of Taihu Lake was 4.67 meters, 0.02 meters above the guaranteed water level.
Today, the National Defense Council discussed and judged, and decided to continue to maintain the Yangtze River and Huaihe River flood control level II response, requiring all localities to consolidate their responsibilities and further implement various flood control and disaster relief work.
Today, the National Defense Office and the Ministry of Emergency Management urgently dispatched professional flood drainage vehicles from Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian to help Jiangxi solve local urban waterlogging problems caused by heavy rainfall.
For the first time, the United States launched a countervailing investigation against China with the "undervaluation of the RMB exchange rate"
In response to the recent announcement by the US Department of Commerce, it has decided to launch an anti-dumping countervailing investigation on tie-belt (strap) products originating in China, and to initiate an investigation on the "RMB exchange rate undervaluation" project.
The Ministry of Commerce of China pointed out that this is the first time that the United States has filed an investigation into the so-called "RMB exchange rate undervaluation" project in an anti-subsidy case. China firmly opposes this.
The Ministry of Commerce of China issued a press release on this issue on the evening of the 23rd, stating that China implements a managed floating exchange rate system based on market supply and demand and adjusted by reference to a basket of currencies, and that the market plays a decisive role in the formation of the exchange rate.
The press release emphasized that on the whole, the RMB exchange rate is at a reasonable equilibrium level and has not been undervalued.
Since 2005, the RMB has appreciated against the US dollar by more than 17%.
According to data released by the Bank for International Settlements, from the beginning of 2005 to May 2020, the nominal effective exchange rate of the renminbi appreciated by 38%, and the real effective exchange rate appreciated by 49%. It is the strongest currency in the G20 economy and one of the most appreciated currencies in the world.
The Ministry of Commerce pointed out that the exchange rate issue is beyond the competence of members to conduct countervailing investigations in accordance with the rules of the World Trade Organization.
The United States amended its regulations in February this year to conduct countervailing investigations on the exchange rates of other countries. It has been suspected of violating WTO rules and has been opposed by many quarters.
The press release stated that even in accordance with U.S. regulations, the applicant's complaint contained a large number of errors and did not have the necessary anti-subsidy elements such as financial support, benefit granting, and specificity.
China urges the US to abide by existing international rules and stop conducting countervailing investigations on the so-called "undervaluation of the RMB exchange rate."
Affected by the further increase in tension in Sino-US relations, the offshore and onshore RMB exchange rates against the US dollar fell sharply on the 22nd, and both fell below the US $1 to RMB 7.0 mark.
Whether the US Department of Commerce's move is intended to force up the yuan is worthy of attention.
The spot exchange rate of RMB against the US dollar rose above the 7.0 mark on the 23rd to close at 6.9961.
The middle price of the RMB against the US dollar, which is subject to official regulation, was lowered by 17 basis points on the 24th, to 6.9938.

Venezuelan Foreign Minister accuses the United States of fabricating lies to launch unprovoked attacks on China-Xinhuanet
Aryasa said that the US government has recently put constant pressure on China in terms of politics, diplomacy, economy and public opinion, which is an unfounded attack on a sovereign country.
Ariasa reposted the tweet posted by Chinese Ambassador to Venezuela Li Baorong on his personal account earlier in the day and made the above comments.
Li Baorong said in a tweet that China strongly condemns the US for forcibly entering the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, which is a serious violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and the Sino-US Consular Treaty, and China will make a legitimate and necessary response to this.
Venezuelan Vice President Rodriguez, Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Long and other government officials, public figures and mainstream media reporters also reposted Li Baorong's tweets, condemning the actions of the United States as a serious violation of international law.
The 26th was the day before Philippine President Duterte delivered his fifth State of the Union address (SONA) during his term of office. On that day, the Philippines confirmed more than 80,000 cases of new coronary pneumonia, of which the number of confirmed cases by the staff of the Presidential Information Department (PCOO) and its immediate agencies increased to 25.
To this end, PCOO has specially prepared a working group that has not contacted the confirmed staff to cooperate with President Duterte's press release of SONA.
PCOO Minister Martin Andanal said in an interview with DZBB Radio on the 26th that two plans have been prepared for President Duterte to publish SONA.
According to plan A, Duterte will publish SONA at the Philippine Congress (Batasang Pambansa) building in Quezon City on the afternoon of the 27th.
Because of the epidemic, only 50 seats were arranged for some government cabinet members and legislators at the scene, and a special video conference room was set up for other cabinet members, local government officials, etc.
All participants passed a rapid test on the same day before entering the Capitol building.
Once one of the participants tested positive, plan B was initiated, that is, President Duterte announced SONA at the Presidential Palace in Malacañang, and fewer seats were arranged at the scene.
In accordance with established practice, SONA will broadcast live to the Philippines in real time.
As of the time of writing, the Philippine Presidential Palace has not confirmed whether Duterte's family will attend SONA.
Andanal said that President Duterte's SONA will focus on how the government will lead the Philippines to respond to the new crown pneumonia epidemic and restore socio-economic life; it will also mention his commitments when he took office, namely, anti-government corruption, combating illegal drugs, and poverty reduction.
Duterte will also explain other plans of the current administration, including creating more jobs, revitalizing the economy, promoting education, and helping overseas Filipino workers who are suffering from the epidemic.
Yinchuan: Classification policy to support kindergartens to stabilize the teaching team-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, July 26 (Reporter Ai Fumei) Affected by the epidemic, the kindergarten in Yinchuan City, Ningxia, has not yet been restored. In particular, the pressure on private kindergarten funds has increased, which will have a certain impact on the stability and future sustainable development of kindergarten teachers.
In response to this, Yinchuan City has adopted a number of measures such as pre-allocation of subsidy funds for inclusive private kindergartens, job stabilization subsidies for non-inclusive private kindergartens, and rent relief for private kindergartens to support these kindergartens in stabilizing the teaching team.

For non-inclusive private kindergartens that also provide teaching staff with a basic living expenses of not less than 1,660 yuan per month, Yinchuan City will arrange a 6-month subsidy fund as a job stabilization subsidy fund for kindergarten teachers in accordance with the standard of 500 yuan per student per year.
At the same time, for private kindergartens that rent state-owned assets for business use, Yinchuan City will reduce and reduce the housing rent for 3 months during the epidemic prevention and control period, and encourage developers and other types of rental entities to assume social responsibility, reduce and exempt kindergarten rents for more than 3 months, the relevant taxes and fees will be reduced and exempted in accordance with the policy.
The Yangtze River Flood No. 3 of 2020 formed the Ministry of Water Resources to refine the practical response measures-Chinanews.com
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 (Reporter Hu Lu) On the 26th, the No. 3 flood of the Yangtze River in 2020 formed.
Minister of Water Resources E Jingping requested during the meeting on the 26th that the Three Gorges Reservoir be carefully dispatched, the water from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and Dongting Lake should be considered in an integrated manner, the wrong peak scheduling should be implemented, and sufficient storage capacity should be left to prepare for possible major floods, and to ensure the flood control safety of the middle and lower reaches of the main stream and important embankments of Dongting Lake.
According to forecasts, in the next 3 days, there will be heavy to heavy rains in parts of eastern Southwest, southern Jianghuai, northern Jiangnan, southern eastern Hubei, and central Guangxi. Among them, there will be heavy rains in parts of northern Hunan, southwestern Jiangsu, etc.; there will be moderate to heavy rains in western central China, among which there will be heavy rains in parts of central Hebei.
The Ministry of Water Resources predicts that due to its impact, the inflow of the Three Gorges Reservoir in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River may reach about 60,000 cubic meters per second around the 28th, and the water level of the Lianhuatang River and Dongting Lake in the middle reaches of the main stream will rise again and exceed about 0.20 meters; the water level of the main stream of the Huaihe River will generally recede, and the water level of Hongze Lake will continue to rise slowly; the Haihe Daqing River system, Yongding River and other rivers will experience a process of rising water.
E Jingping proposed that the Huaihe River Basin should further increase flood discharge, reduce the water level of Hongze Lake as soon as possible, and prepare to face possible major floods.
It is necessary to fully do a good job in the response to heavy rains and floods in the Surabaya system.
He said that the Taihu Lake Basin must continue to increase flood drainage, reduce the water level of Taihu Lake and the surrounding river network as soon as possible, and reduce the risk of high water levels and typhoons in Taihu Lake.
In addition, he emphasized that floods in northern areas such as Inner Mongolia and Hebei have sharply risen and fallen, and the warning time is short, which can easily cause mountain torrents and mudslides, making defense difficult; there are many small and medium-sized reservoirs and silt dams, and there are hidden dangers.
58 APPs that violate user rights and interests were exposed, involving more than a dozen listed companies-Chinanews.com
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology reported that in accordance with laws and regulations such as the Cybersecurity Law, the Telecommunications Regulations, and the Provisions on the Protection of Personal Information of Telecommunications and Internet Users, it has recently organized third-party testing agencies to inspect mobile phone applications and urge companies with problems to make rectifications.
The problems of these 58 APPs include private collection of personal information, collection of personal information beyond the scope, frequent application for permissions, excessive request for permissions, difficulty in account cancellation, private sharing to third parties, and denial of permissions.
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology requires that 58 APPs should complete the rectification and implementation work by July 30. If the rectification is not completed within the time limit, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology will organize and carry out relevant disposal work in accordance with laws and regulations.
A reporter from Sino-Singapore Jingwei found that behind the 58 APPs notified, more than a dozen US, Hong Kong, and A-share listed companies were involved.
For example, "Fangduoduo" is a product of Fangduoduo, a US-listed company. There are five problems: Private collection of personal information, collection of personal information beyond the scope, private sharing to third parties, forcing users to use targeted push functions, and frequent application for permissions.
Public information shows that Fangduo landed on Nasdaq in November 2019 and is "the first domestic industrial Internet SaaS (software service) model real estate intermediary company", providing online solutions for many intermediary merchants.
In response to the problem of "Where to Go" APP account cancellation difficulties pointed out in the report, according to the Beijing News, Qunar responded that in order to prevent black property from using frequent registrations and deregistrations to gain benefits, where to go has been registered on the basis of autonomous cancellation. The interval between registration and cancellation is one month.
Considering the convenience of cancellation and the security of the account, it has been changed to cancellation with immediate effect, and is currently awaiting review.
A cyber security expert who did not want to be named told the Sino-Singapore Jingwei client that APP notifications of such violations of user rights and interests have been published by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology this year.
Among them, the three problems of private collection of personal information, excessive request for permissions, and difficulty in account cancellation have been repeatedly "managed."
It can also be found from the notification that the current APP violation of privacy has attracted more and more attention.
On July 24, the same day that 58 APPs infringing on user rights and interests were notified, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said that it had issued a notice a few days ago to deploy and carry out a special rectification action to promote APP infringement on user rights and interests.

U.S. Congressman and civil rights fighter John Lewis (John Lewis) was remembered as a fighter "fighting for the weakest" at a memorial service held for him on Saturday (July 25).
Lewis' public memorial service has been held in Alabama since Saturday.
There were two memorial services on the first day.
At a public memorial service at Troy University in Alabama on Saturday, Lewis' five brothers and sisters and a nephew talked about him as a loving, unafraid, family-oriented man.
Lewis' youngest brother, Henry "Grant" Lewis, said at the meeting: "He devoted his life to helping others."
Samuel Lewis said that his mother had warned John "not to cause trouble, not to cause trouble."
He added that John did not heed his mother's warning. He said: "We all know that John always gets into trouble and always gets into trouble, but that's because he insists on the right thing, and that's good trouble."
Lewis' brothers and sisters reminded the people at the memorial service that John's most famous argument is to create "good trouble", that is, as long as it is for the sake of justice, he will not shy away from provoking trouble.
John once applied to Troy University in Troy, Alabama, where he was born, but Troy University, which was an all-white school at the time, rejected his application for admission.
John Lewis, who preached the gospel to chickens on his farm as a child, eventually received a degree in religion and philosophy from Fisk University.
Many years later, Troy University awarded Lewis an honorary doctorate.
Congressman Doug Jones from Alabama said that the current protesters are "protesting peacefully and non-violently", just like Lewis did in the civil rights movement.
Jones said: "Even if President Trump knocked over a boat and described all the protesters as thugs, he was wrong.
The protesters are patriots, and they want the United States to move towards a more equal country. "
A six-day series of events to commemorate Lewis will culminate this week at a funeral in Georgia.
Lewis' coffin was parked at a public memorial service at Troy University on Saturday, and people came to pay tribute to the pioneer of the civil rights movement.
Later on Saturday, a private ceremony paid tribute to him in a small church in Selma, Alabama, followed by a public memorial service.
On Sunday, Lewis' body will pass through the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma.
In 1965, he and the demonstrators who demanded the right to vote for blacks were severely beaten by the Alabama police in front of this bridge, and the police also released tear gas on the demonstrators.
Lewis was almost killed at the time.
This day will later be called "Bloody Sunday."
Lewis' body will be transported to Montgomery, the capital of Alabama.
Mayor Steven Reed encouraged people to line up on the sidewalk to complete this final journey with Lewis.
At the same time, officials require the public to wear masks and maintain social distance when participating in activities.
Alabama Governor Kay Ivey ordered that the flag be lowered at half mast on Saturday and Sunday to commemorate Lewis.
During the nearly week-long commemoration, Lewis's body will be placed in the Alabama State Capitol in Montgomery, the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta, and the U.S. Capitol in Washington for people to express their condolences.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced last week that people can come to the U.S. Capitol on Monday and Tuesday to pay tribute to Lewis.
Due to the coronavirus epidemic, a public event to mourn Lewis will be held outdoors.
Shenzhen publicly solicited comments on the introduction of health regulations-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Shenzhen, July 26 (Reporters Mao Siqian and Bai Yu) Encourage residents to do physical examinations frequently and detect problems early; prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors; establish a health review system for online games; employers must be equipped with full-time and part-time health management personnel... The "Shenzhen Special Economic Zone Health Regulations (Draft for Comments)" was officially released a few days ago, and Shenzhen residents will have their own "health law."
In order to encourage residents to do physical examinations frequently and detect problems early, the above-mentioned draft for comments proposes that the health department should formulate a basic catalogue of health check-up items based on factors such as different ages and occupations.
The cost of health check-ups that fall within the scope of the basic catalogue of health check-up items shall be paid by the social medical insurance coordinating fund according to the standard of once per person per year.
The draft for comments makes it clear that employers should rationally allocate human resources, arrange staff working hours, and implement a rotation system for employees with heavy mental and physical workloads to avoid excessive loss of human functions or physical and mental health damage to employees "health, and strictly implement the system of paid leave for employees.
In addition, employers must be equipped with full-time and part-time health management personnel, and regularly organize and carry out employee health examinations.
In terms of the physical and mental health of minors, the draft for comments proposes that the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors is prohibited, and at the same time the sale location of alcoholic beverages is restricted. For violations of the regulations, the market supervision and management department will order corrections and impose a fine of 30,000 yuan.
In addition to "prohibition", minors should also "exercise more."
According to the requirements of the draft for comments, the school should arrange more than one hour of student sports activities every day.
For online games, the departments of public security, culture, radio, television, tourism, sports, network supervision, health and health should improve the health supervision system of Internet service business premises, establish a health review system for online games, and create a good communication space and communication culture for promoting the healthy growth of teenagers.
In addition, the draft for comments also proposes that influenza patients must wear masks when entering and leaving public places, and medical and health institutions will fine 20,000 yuan for leaking patients' privacy without consent.
It is worth noting that in addition to the physical and mental health of residents, the draft for comments also requires that all departments in Shenzhen should assess the impact of public policy implementation on the health of the population before formulating plans and normative documents involving urban spatial planning and construction, industrial park planning and construction, resource development and utilization and ecological environment protection, and biomedical industry development, as well as approving major construction projects and implementing major public service projects.
If it has not been assessed or will have a more serious adverse impact on urban public health or residents' health, it shall not be formulated or approved for implementation.

Recently, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed during an inspection in Jilin Province that it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the party, promote the extension of party organizations to the most basic level, improve the work system of grassroots party organizations, and provide a strong guarantee for the governance of urban and rural communities.
Adhering to the leadership of party building and implementing party leadership in all fields and links of grassroots governance is a fundamental requirement for the direction of doing a good job of grassroots governance.
To improve the level of grassroots governance, we must adhere to the leadership of party building, promote the transformation of the party's political advantages, organizational advantages, and mass work advantages into governance advantages by strengthening political leadership, building battle fortresses, and gathering red forces, and transmit the party's power and propositions to the "nerve endings" "last kilometer."
Pay attention to calcium supplementation and soul building, and strengthen political leadership.
To strengthen the political leadership of grassroots governance, it is necessary to implement the "Calcium Supplementation and Soul" project.
It is necessary to study deeply and thoroughly understand Xi Jinping's thoughts on socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era as the primary task, take "not forgetting the original intention and keeping in mind the mission" as the eternal topic of party building and the lifelong topic of party members and cadres, strengthen the understanding of the principles of reading the original texts, and continue to promote the party's innovative theories through special training, batch training, seminars and exchanges, holding large lecture halls, etc., and promote party members and cadres to further enhance the "four consciousnesses", strengthen the "four self-confidence", and achieve the "two maintenance" to better perform their duties and responsibilities.
Through the combination of online and offline learning methods, broaden learning and education channels, and guide grassroots party organizations and party members and cadres to truly integrate learning and education into daily life and focus on the regular.
Pay attention to practice and exercise, in the process of resolving key and difficult issues in the field of grassroots governance, solve the annoying and disturbing issues that the masses care about, and exercise party spirit and ability.
Grasp the improvement of norms and build a battle fortress.
Grassroots party organizations are not only an important part of the grassroots governance system, but also an important carrier for the manifestation of governance capabilities.
To promote the standardization of grassroots party organizations, we must start with the work regulations of party branches, focus on the weakening and virtual leadership of party organizations, and strengthen the foundation, make up for shortcomings, and promote development by establishing a linkage mechanism between the top and bottom, innovating branch setting forms, normalizing and rectifying weak and lax, establishing and improving decision-making and discussion mechanisms, and serving the masses mechanisms.
In rural areas, strengthen the standardization of village-level party organizations, standardize organizational forms, learning activities, and management mechanisms against the standardization construction standards of party branches, and effectively promote the detailed implementation of systems such as "three meetings and one lesson" and thematic party day activities.
In cities, pay attention to street communities, explore innovative branch setting forms, focus on weak areas, "blocking points", and "pain points", and actively build urban party building alliances to achieve effective coverage of party work.
At the same time, establish and improve the grassroots governance system and mechanism, improve the decision-making and discussion mechanism of discussing important issues, jointly handling important issues, discussing urgent issues, solving difficult issues, and leading grassroots party organizations, improve the mechanism for party members and cadres to contact and serve the masses, gather the hearts of the people in the service of the people, enhance the sense of gain, happiness, honor, and pride of party members and the masses, and make grassroots governance more warm.
Play a pioneering role and gather red forces.
Grassroots party members and cadres are the cornerstone of grassroots governance.
Improving grassroots governance capabilities focuses on improving the governance capabilities of grassroots party members and cadres, focusing on the demonstration and leading role of "red cells" in grassroots governance, and rallying red forces at the forefront of contacting and serving the masses.
It is necessary to take the improvement of governance capabilities as a compulsory course for grassroots party members and cadres, continuously strengthen ideological quenching, professional training, and practical exercise, carry forward the spirit of responsibility in their own positions and in urgent, difficult and dangerous tasks, and strengthen the foundation and contribute to the modernization of the national governance system and governance capabilities.
It is necessary to extensively carry out "community whistleblowing and party member reporting" activities, and participate in community construction, management and service through participating in thematic party day activities, contacting people in difficulty, determining service projects, claiming micro-wishes, and making reasonable suggestions, so that party members can play a role in community governance.
It is necessary to give full play to the role of unemployed party members in rural areas, and guide the majority of grassroots party members to actively participate in poverty alleviation, ecological construction, petition and maintenance of stability, and banning straw burning through the establishment of unemployed party members' vanguard posts and the formation of unemployed party members' task forces to better integrate red forces and serve the people.
The foundation is solid and the building is strong.
The grassroots party organization is the foundation of the ruling building.
Only by insisting on strengthening the relationship between the party and the masses and increasing the well-being of the people as the focus, and taking party building as the fundamental way to promote the innovation and development of grassroots governance, can we build a solid foundation, so that grassroots party organizations can be pulled out and held up, and grassroots party members and cadres can catch up and rush up, and promote grassroots governance to be "soul", orderly, powerful, and effective.

Cocoa Xili Tibetan antelope enters the return season-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 25 (Reporter Wang Jinjin) The reporter learned from the Wudaoliang Protection Station of the Coxili Management Office of Jiangyuan Park, Director of Sanjiangyuan National Park, that monitoring showed that the Tibetan antelopes that had previously migrated to the Zhuonai Lake area in the hinterland of Coxili to give birth are gradually ending their birth and beginning to return to their original habitat with their cubs.
Surveillance footage near the Wudaoliang Protection Station shows that on July 25, about 40 female Tibetan antelopes led 3 Tibetan antelope cubs through 3002 kilometers of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway and the five-way Liangbei Bridge of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway. The Tibetan antelope has begun to migrate back.
Experts analyze that in recent years, the number of Tibetan antelope cubs in the returning herd accounted for one-quarter to one-fifth of the total number of Tibetan antelope flocks.
Lien Xinming, deputy researcher at the Northwest Plateau Biology Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: "At the beginning of the return migration, the Tibetan antelope faces a higher risk of predation, so the number of cubs in the flock will be relatively small, and there may even be no cubs."
According to statistics from the Cocoa Xili Management Office of Jiangyuan Park, Director of Sanjiangyuan National Park Management, the number of Tibetan antelopes returning has been increasing year by year. The number of Tibetan antelopes returning in 2019 was 4,860, an increase of 338 over 2018.
Liang Xinming said: "It is expected that the return migration of Tibetan antelopes this year will end in early September, and the number of returning Tibetan antelopes is still expected to continue to increase."
The Tibetan antelope is a national first-class protected animal.
At the end of May every year, Tibetan antelopes from Sanjiangyuan in Qinghai, Qiangtang in Tibet, and Aljinshan in Xinjiang all travel to Zhuonai Lake in the hinterland of Cocosiri to give birth to lambs.
Wu Xiaomin, an expert on the protection of Tibetan antelopes in my country and a researcher at the Shaanxi Institute of Zoology (Northwest Endangered Animals Research Institute), said: "The return of Tibetan antelopes is the process of female Tibetan antelopes returning to their habitat after giving birth. At first, the returning groups that left the breeding ground were relatively large, but then the Tibetan antelopes will return to their respective habitats according to different geographical populations and along different paths."
In order to ensure the safe relocation of Tibetan antelope sheep, the reporter learned that the Cocoa Xili Management Office of Jiangyuan Park, Director of Sanjiangyuan National Park Management, has arranged staff to continuously carry out video monitoring and jurisdictional patrols in the main relocation area.
If a Tibetan antelope flock is found trying to cross the highway, the mountain patrol team will carry out temporary traffic control at the first time to allow the flock to pass safely through the wildlife passage to ensure that it is as little human interference as possible on the way back.
So, how to relieve heat in daily life?
Experts suggest that when you go out in summer, try to avoid high-temperature periods, and it is best not to walk or work in the hot sun around noon, because the sun is the strongest during this period and the likelihood of heatstroke is higher.
If you must go out during this period, you must do a good job of protection, such as playing a parasol, wearing a sun hat, and wearing sunglasses. If possible, it is best to apply sunscreen to prevent sunburns.
Choose light-colored, breathable cotton, linen, and silk as much as possible, and wear less chemical fiber clothing, so as not to lose heat in time when you sweat a lot, causing heatstroke.
In hot and sultry weather, you must prepare enough water to drink, drink it in time, and don't wait to drink water until you are thirsty, because once you feel thirsty, your body is already short of water, control it at 150 ml to 200 ml at a time, drink warm water, and don't drink ice water.
According to the temperature, the average person drinks 1.5 to 2 liters of water a day, and the high-temperature operators drink 3 to 5 liters of water a day.
When you sweat a lot, you can appropriately supplement some salt water to make up for the salt lost by the human body due to sweating.
In addition, the human body is prone to lack of potassium in summer, which makes people feel tired and tired. Potassium-containing tea is an excellent summer drink.
In summer, eat more fruits and vegetables with high water content, such as lettuce, cucumber, tomatoes, etc.; fresh fruits, such as peaches, apricots, watermelons, melons, etc., with a moisture content of 80% to 90%, can be used to replenish water; dairy products can both replenish water and meet the body's nutritional needs.
In addition, people who work in high-temperature environments should appropriately supplement drinks containing potassium, magnesium and other elements.
In summer, the days and nights are short, the temperature is high, the body's metabolism is strong, the consumption is also large, and it is easy to feel tired.
Adequate sleep can relax the brain and body systems, which is not only conducive to work and study, but also a measure to prevent heatstroke.
Experts say that the best bedtime is from 22: 00 to 23: 00, and the best time to get up is from 5: 30 to 6: 30.
Be careful not to lie under the air-conditioning vents and electric fans during sleep, so as not to get air-conditioning diseases and hot colds.
Experts suggest that people who are engaged in outdoor activities or high-temperature work can carry ten drops of water, human Dan, patchouli Zhengqi water or patchouli Zhengqi pills with them, or place them in the nearest workplace and use them at any time to prevent heatstroke.
I hope you can take some time to consider the very simple fact that, so far, most of our understanding of the universe comes from light.
We stand on the earth and look up at the night sky. We can see the stars in the sky with the naked eye.
The strong sunlight is so dazzling,
We can see the light reflected from the moon,
Since Galileo aimed his humble astronomical telescope at the celestial bodies in the universe, the universe as we know it today is presented to us through light.
With the help of modern astronomical telescopes, we have been able to collect dazzling and silent images of the universe-a series of images that can be traced back to the Big Bang.
However, the universe is not a mime, because the universe is not really silent.
I want to tell everyone that the universe has its own soundtrack, and the universe itself is constantly playing. Because space can vibrate like a drum.
So when something important happens, it can send out a series of sounds to the universe.
Now, we hope to be able to add sound to this magnificent visual work about the universe.
Although we have never heard a sound from outer space, we should be able to turn up the volume in the next few years and listen to what is going on there.
Aiming at the ambitious goal of capturing the sound of the universe, we focus our attention on black holes and the prospects they show, because black holes can hit space-time and make a very special sound like a drumstick hitting a drum. I am also very happy to show you some of the sounds we predicted.
One day in the future we may be able to see a shadow and a black hole can leave a shadow on a very bright background, but it has not been observed yet.
Although black holes cannot be seen, they can be heard, because they hit space-time like drums.
The idea that the universe can make a drum-like sound comes from Albert Einstein, but in fact many of our ideas come from him.
Einstein realized that if the universe is empty, if the universe is empty, it will look like this picture, except for the auxiliary lines painted on it.
But if we fall freely in the universe, even without these auxiliary lines, our trajectory will draw these lines, because we will find that we move along a straight line, passing through the universe along a straight line that does not bend.
Einstein also realized - this is really the most critical part (matter also means "matter") - if you put energy and matter in the universe, the universe will bend. A free-falling object will be deflected along a curved path in space when passing a celestial body like the sun.
This is Einstein's great general theory of relativity.
Even the path of light will be bent.
When the bend is large enough, it will revolve around the orbit of the sun, just like the earth revolves around the sun, and the moon revolves around the earth.
This is the natural curve in the universe.
But Einstein did not realize that if you compress the sun into a ball with a diameter of 6 kilometers - that is, you compress a substance equivalent to one million times the mass of the earth into a ball with a diameter of 6 kilometers, you will create a black hole, and the density of this object is so large that if the light is too close to it, it will not escape - leaving a huge black shadow in the universe.
But Einstein always believed that black holes are just a mathematical singularity.
He doesn't believe that black holes really exist.
He believes that nature will prevent the formation of black holes to protect us.
It was decades later that people began to use the term "black hole" and realized that black holes are real celestial bodies - in fact, they are the death states of some extremely massive stars after catastrophic collapse at the end of their lives.
Our sun will not collapse to form a black hole.
Its quality is actually not large enough.
But if we do some thought experiments - Einstein likes to do this very much - we can imagine crushing the sun and compressing it within a range of six kilometers, and then placing a small earth in an orbit around it, such as in an orbit 30 kilometers away from the black hole sun.
The earth will shine by itself, because now the sun is gone, and we have no other light source-so, our little earth has to shine by itself.
You will find that you can even put the earth in an orbit 30 kilometers away from the black hole and make it orbit happily.
This black hole is actually only about the size of Manhattan.
Before it destroys the earth, it may swell to Hudson Street.
But basically this is what we are discussing.
We are talking about an object compressed to half the size of Manhattan.
So we moved this earth to a place close to the black hole - 30 kilometers - we noticed that it orbits the black hole in a perfect orbit.
There are some rumors that black holes will devour everything in the universe, but in fact you have to be very close to actually fall in.
But what is impressive is that from our perspective, we can always see the earth.
It cannot hide behind a black hole.
Part of the light emitted from the earth falls into the black hole, but part of it is bent by the black hole and seen by us.
So you can't hide anything behind a black hole.
If this is the story of Battlestar Galactica and you are fighting the Cylons, don't hide behind the black hole.
They can see you.
Our sun will not collapse into a black hole; its mass is not large enough, but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
If one of them is devouring the Milky Way, it will look like this.
We will see the shadow of a black hole cast on hundreds of billions of stars in the Milky Way and dust belts illuminated by stars.
If we fall into this black hole, we will see the light being refracted around the black hole, and even when we begin to enter this shadow, we will not feel that some huge changes are happening quietly.
If we try to start the rocket and leave there, the result will not be very good, because we cannot escape, not even light.
Although the black hole is dark from the outside, it is not the case from the inside, because the light of all galaxies can fall into the black hole with us.
And even so, due to the time expansion effect of the theory of relativity, our clock seems to be slowing down compared to the time of the Milky Way, which looks as if the outer galaxies are accelerating, just before we were destroyed by the black hole.
It's like experiencing the feeling of dying. You see the light at the end of the tunnel, but this is a complete death experience.
(Laughter) You can't tell anyone that you saw the light at the end of the tunnel.
So far, we have never seen the shadow left by such a black hole, but black holes can be heard, even if they cannot be seen.
Imagine, in a real astronomical scene - imagine two black holes that have existed together for a long time.
Maybe they were stars before and then collapsed into two black holes-each with a mass of 10 times that of the sun.
Now we compress them to within 60 kilometers.
They can rotate hundreds of times per second.
At the end of life, they approach each other at the speed of light.
Thousands of kilometers can be traversed in a fraction of a second. In this process, they will not only bend the space, but also cause spatial vibration in the wake behind them, a real space-time wave.
The black hole squeezes and stretches the space when it collides with the universe.
These vibrations travel through space at the speed of light.
This computer simulation was done by Goddard's Relativity Group of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
It took nearly 30 years to solve this problem.
This is one of many groups.
It shows two black holes rotating around each other. These are imaginary curves.
As you can see - it may be a little fuzzy - you can see that the red waves are emitted, these are gravitational waves.
They are the sounds of the real universe, and these sounds will travel outward from these black holes at the speed of light as the black holes merge with each other, until the two black holes merge into a quietly rotating black hole.
If you stand close enough, your ears will resonate with the squeezing and stretching of these spaces.
You can really hear these sounds with your own ears.
Of course, you will helplessly find that your head is also squeezed and stretched, so you may not be able to understand what is going on.
But I am willing to play the sound of our prediction for you.
This is the research result of my team-a relatively simple calculation model.
Imagine a black hole with a smaller mass falling into a black hole with a larger mass.
The sound you hear comes from the collision of a small-mass black hole with space as it approaches a large-mass black hole.
If they are far away, the sound will be very small.
But gradually the sound became like a drumstick beating the space, making the space vibrate like a drum.
We can predict what this sound will become.
We know that in the process of falling, the small-mass black hole will get faster and faster, and the sound will be louder.
Eventually, we will hear that the small black hole has completely fallen into the big black hole.
I never thought this sound was so loud-it was actually amplified here.
When I listened to it at home, I felt that the sound was a bit weak.
It sounds like, Ding, Ding, Ding.
This is another sound simulated by our research team.
I will not show you images here, because black holes will not leave any useful traces, and real space will not show you those virtual curves.
But if you hear this sound when you are on vacation in the universe, I suggest you run quickly.
(Laughs) It's best to stay away from this sound.
These two black holes are moving.
The two black holes are approaching each other.
In this case, they are all shaking violently.
Then, they will merge.
That sharp sound is a sign of black hole fusion-a sharp sound will be emitted at the end of the fusion.
This is our prediction of what we will see.
Fortunately, we are very safe in Long Beach, California.
There is no doubt that two black holes have merged together somewhere in the universe.
It is also indisputable that the space around us can also feel these vibrations that traverse a million light years, or from a million years ago, which travel at the speed of light and eventually meet us.
But these sounds are so small that we can't hear them at all.
Some experiments in the world require a lot of effort to build - among them is an experiment called LIGO - which will be able to detect spatial vibrations that are less than one nucleus at a distance of every four kilometers.
This is a very bold attempt, and its sensitivity will not be surpassed in the next few years-it will be used to detect spatial vibration.
Another research project on the universe is expected to be launched in the next ten years. This project is called LISA.
LISA will be able to see supermassive black holes-black holes that are millions or even billions of times the mass of the sun.
From the image returned from the Hubble Telescope, we see these two galaxies.
It looks like they are still hugging each other.
There may be a super black hole with a huge mass in their centers.
But they are not standing still, in fact they are merging.
These two black holes will collide, and their fusion will take billions of years.
So collecting the sounds they make has exceeded the limit of our human perception.
But LISA can see the final stage of two supermassive black holes that began to merge long ago, that is, 15 minutes before they merge.
This kind of detection is not limited to black holes, it can also be used to detect any large disturbances in the universe, the largest of which is the "Big Bang."
When this word was created, some people mocked and said, "Oh, who would believe in the Big Bang?"
This animated short film produced by my friend at Proton Studios shows the scene of watching the Big Bang from the outside.
In fact, we would never want to be like this; we want to be inside the universe, because there is no such thing as being outside the universe.
So, imagine you are in the big bang.
The universe is everywhere, everything in the world surrounds you, and the space is swaying disorderly.
14 billion years have passed, and this voice still haunts us.
The galaxy gradually formed, and batches of stars formed in the galaxy. On a certain planet, there is at least one such planet, suitable for life.
Here, we frantically set up experiments, do calculations, and write computer codes.
Imagine, a billion years ago, two black holes collided.
This sound has been traveling through time and space all the time.
We didn't even show up here.
It is getting closer and closer-40,000 years ago, we were still painting on the stone walls of the cave.
If the sound we want to get is from the Big Bang, it will sound like this.
Strictly speaking, it is noise.
This is a kind of white noise, a chaotic ringtone.
But it is everywhere around us, as long as it is not offset by some other process in the universe.
If we can detect these sounds, it will be like music to our ears, because this quiet echo comes from the moment we were created, from the universe we look up at.
So in the next few years, we will be able to increase the volume of these soundtracks a little bit, so that the universe is presented to us in the form of audio.
However, if we can detect those earliest moments, it will also take us one step further from understanding the Big Bang and enable us to ask some of the most difficult and at the same time the most ethereal questions.
If we play the history of the universe backwards, we can know that there has been a big bang in the past, and we can even hear its noisy sound, but is our big bang the only big bang in the universe?
I mean, we can't help asking, has there been a similar big bang before that?
Will it happen again in the future?
I want to say that if the significance of this question is raised to the level that TED advocates to cause people to rethink, at least in this last minute, we can ask some questions, those that we may never answer.
But we can't help asking: Will our universe be just an episode in a larger history?
Or, can we just be a branch of the multiverse - each branch has experienced its own big bang - maybe some of them have buzzing black holes, maybe some do not - maybe some exist conscious life, maybe some do not exist - they do not belong to our past, nor do they exist in our future, but are connected to us in some way?
Therefore, we cannot help but wonder, if there is a multiverse, is there life in other branches of this multiverse?
This is life in our multiverse.
Are there other beings in the multiverse, are they also guessing about our existence and thinking about their own origin?
If so, I can imagine them doing calculations, writing computer codes, building experimental instruments, trying to detect the faint sounds from their origins, and wondering who else is there.
Thank you. Thank you all.
(Applause)
Graduate art exhibition moves into shopping mall public welfare exhibition-Xinhuanet
In the "Cloud Graduation" season of colleges and universities, a rare offline graduate art exhibition opened warmly last weekend.
However, it is neither in the art gallery nor on the campus, but in the public space of Chaoyang Dayue City, which is open to the public for free and will last until August 23.
The reporter learned that this 2020 graduate art exhibition collected 50 works / groups of 57 young artists from the Central Academy of Fine Arts, China Media University and Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts. The exhibition space extends from the 2nd floor to the 6th floor, and makes full use of the light box in the building for the display of graphic works to maximize the artistic atmosphere of the graduation season.
Under the epidemic, the significance of this exhibition is particularly special.
Ge Ping, head of beauty Chen in Dayue City, Chaoyang, admitted: "We chose to bring the graduation exhibition towards the 'cloud' back to offline space again, and we also hope that more people will see young people's exploration of themselves and understanding of the world, and magnify the healing power of art for society and the mind."
She revealed that the works participating in this exhibition were collected from graduates of several major art colleges and universities, and selected from them suitable for commercial space display. The forms of works range from traditional easel paintings and sculptures to new media devices, interactive animation, and VR panorama. The volume and richness are the highest in previous years.
Among them, Li Yunxiao expressed his feelings in the epidemic through a combination of mechanical and manual creative language in "The First Battle of 2020"; Liu Jiaying discussed the themes of "cryptocurrency", "credit creation", and "transaction" through the work "Sound Money" created by Taifang blockchain; Zhang Jiaxi's "Cat Forest" and Qiu Daqiang's "Boxian" show animals that are often accompanied by humans, from which you can see the young artist's understanding of the relationship between humans and animals; and Zhu Zhongyu's work "Winter of Faith-Gift" is a reminder to young people who are growing up, "When one day you succeed in your career, don't forget your original heart, remember that simplicity and sincerity."
Among the few graduates who personally show, there is Li Jingyin from the Sculpture Department of Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts.
"I came to Beijing on July 7. I was actually a little worried about the epidemic. I also did a nucleic acid test three days in advance. I brought alcoholic cotton and test reports to the exhibition."
His work "Yesterday Like a Mystery" has a complex structure and must be done by himself.
At the same time, he also undertakes the task of helping his classmates repair damaged works.
"The exhibition lasted until 4: 30 in the morning, and then it was repaired. The time was very tight. I forgot to take a picture with the work, and I was a little sorry."
He hopes that when the epidemic is more stable, he and his classmates will come to Beijing to see his work exhibition.

The development of new drugs by the University of Australia is expected to be used to treat blood vessel blockages caused by the new crown-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Sydney, July 26 (Reporter Chen Yu) Researchers at Monash University in Australia are developing a new drug that helps prevent heart disease and stroke, and hope that this drug can be used to treat vascular blockages caused by the new crown virus.
Researchers have found that an enzyme in platelets accelerates platelet clotting before a heart attack or stroke.
As a result, they developed a drug that can temporarily inhibit platelet clotting, thereby avoiding clogging of blood vessels and preventing heart disease and stroke.
The researchers say that this drug will only inhibit the clotting effect of platelets when there are signs of heart disease or stroke.
Since studies have shown that similar vascular blockage is one of the main causes of death in severely ill patients with the new crown, researchers hope that this drug can be used in the treatment of such severe patients in the future.
At present, the drug has achieved good results in animal model experiments, and researchers are preparing for the next stage of human clinical trials.
The research results have been published in the American journal "Science and Transformation Medicine" a few days ago.
He became the first spectator to enter after the CBA League rematch allowed the audience to watch the game live.
On the same day, in the second stage of the 2019-2020 Chinese Men's Basketball Professional League (CBA) rematch (Laoshan Division) held in Qingdao, Shandong Province, medical staff, teachers, and people from the public security front passed through the official ticket purchase platform, completed the relevant procedures, including nucleic acid testing, and entered the field to watch the match of the Shanghai Jiuyi Team against the Shandong XiWang Team.
During the game, spectators must wear masks all the way, take seats in pairs, and strictly maintain a one-meter interval.

China News Service, Hami, Xinjiang, July 26, title: Xinjiang deeply ploughs "sunflower fields" to use clean energy
More than 6,000 pentagonal sunglasses, each 48 square meters, are neatly arranged in a circle, such as a silver "sunflower field", which rotates with the sun and reflects sunlight to a heat absorption tower more than 200 meters high in the center to generate electricity.
The reporter saw this scene on the 25th at the Hami molten salt tower photothermal power plant of the China Electric Power Project in Yimu Lake Town, Iwu County, Hami City, Xinjiang.
"The so-called molten salt tower photothermal power generation is to centrally reflect sunlight through the mirror to the heat absorption tower to form heat energy, and then convert heat energy into electricity through traditional power generation technology."
Zhang Yong, deputy general manager of China Electric Power Hami Solar Thermal Power Generation Co., Ltd. introduced that its design principle is similar to that of solar cookers used in rural areas in northwest China, which must gather sunlight.
Construction of the power farm began in October 2017. It was connected to the grid at the end of last year, covering an area of 6,600 acres, and a total of 14,500 sunglasses are planned to be installed.
"Compared with traditional solar power generation technology, its biggest advantage is that it can store the accumulated heat energy and generate electricity at night."
Zhang Yong said that the 13-hour heat storage system configured by the project can enable the generator set to maintain continuous and stable operation without being affected by light changes; it can also quickly participate in the peak adjustment of the power grid according to the needs of power grid load peaks and valleys.
After the project is fully completed, it can achieve an annual power generation of 198 million degrees, save more than 60,000 tons of standard coal per year, reduce more than 60 tons of sulphur dioxide, more than 60 tons of nitrogen oxides, about 20 tons of soot, and more than 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide, providing a steady stream of clean energy for the local area.
In addition, there is another silver "sunflower field" in Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park in Hami City.
The Hami Fuguang Solar Photovoltaic Power Station covers an area of more than 2,300 acres, and the 714 power generation equipment that have been built also follow the sun's rotation, always maintaining a 90-degree right angle between the sunlight and the concentrated panel.
"We adopt double-axis tracking concentrated light power generation technology. Through unified integrated control, all power generation equipment will adjust the angle according to the sun's height to maintain power generation efficiency."
Duan Mengqi, director of the power station, said that under good weather conditions, the power generation technology can increase the efficiency of traditional photovoltaic power generation by about 20%.
In the first half of this year, the power station has generated more than 7 million kilowatts of electricity, supplementing the local demand for electricity.
Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park is currently a photovoltaic industry demonstration park with the largest monomer scale and the most complete type of photovoltaic modules in Xinjiang, with a total of 38 photovoltaic power generation projects and a total installed capacity of 820,000 kilowatts.
The power generation completed in the first half of this year exceeded 110 million degrees, an increase of 6% over the same period in 2019.
Hami is one of the areas with the best solar energy resources in China.
The average annual total solar radiation is more than 6,200 megajoules per square meter, and the annual sunshine hours are about 3,200 hours.
In recent years, the city has vigorously developed the photovoltaic industry and planted "sunflower fields."
A solar power generation scale of more than 2.5 million kilowatts has been built, and the city's photovoltaic power generation in the first half of this year exceeded 1.4 billion kilowatts, an increase of about 14% year-on-year.
Currently, there are more than 330 grid-connected photovoltaic power stations in Xinjiang, with an installed capacity of more than 10 million kilowatts.
It is estimated that photovoltaic power generation will reach 15 billion kWh this year, which can replace more than 6 million tons of standard coal.
Police reported that the search and rescue work for the details of "female college students traveling to Qinghai lost contact" is still continuing-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 26 (Reporter Wang Jinjin Zhou Zhe) Recently, "a female college student lost contact after traveling to Golmud, Qinghai" attracted the attention of netizens.
The Public Security Bureau of Golmud City, Haixi Mongolian Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, reported on the 26th that Huang Moumou, a student from a certain university in Nanjing, is still out of contact, and the police in many places are going deep along the route where Huang Moumou lost contact and are actively looking for work.
On July 10, 2020, the Public Security Detachment of the Public Security Bureau of Golmud City, Haixi Prefecture, received a notice from a superior that Huang Moumou, a student from a certain university in Nanjing, took the Z164 train from Nanjing to Golmud on July 5, and on July 9, the mobile phone was turned off and lost contact in the southwest area of Qingshui River, Sonan Dage Protection Station, Qumalai County, Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, and asked for assistance in finding it.
According to the investigation by the Public Security Bureau of Golmud City, Huang Moumou entered the territory of Qinghai Province at 19: 54 on July 6 and arrived in Golmud City at 4: 00 on the 7th.
At 8: 00 on the same day, the missing person Huang Moumou took a taxi from the Yellow River Hotel in Golmud City to G109 National Road, and arrived at the Kekexili Sonan Dajie Protection Station at 12 o'clock. The taxi driver returned alone. Huang Moumou arrived at the Qingshui River area near the Sonan Dajie Protection Station at 15: 00 on the 7th and shut down in the area until 18: 00 on the 9th.
During further investigation, the police found that Huang Moumou had passed through the Najiigou checkpoint at 17: 07 on July 13.
The Neijigou checkpoint is a checkpoint set up by Nagqu City, Tibet Autonomous Region at Nanshankou, Golmud City. Since the checkpoint does not have video surveillance, it is impossible to determine the information of the person and the vehicle on which he is travelling. The police can only drive along the way to search, and if Huang Moumou is found at various checkpoints along the way in Tibet, contact the Public Security Bureau of Golmud City immediately.
According to the latest situation, at 1: 00 am on July 26, the Golmud City Public Security Bureau organized rescue forces to carry rescue equipment and went to the Qinghai-Tibet Highway Non-freezing Spring Protection Station and Sonan Dage Protection Station to search, and actively contacted the Sichuan police, the Tibetan police, and the Nanjing police to work together. The search and rescue work is still continuing.
The local police hope that the majority of netizens and all sectors of society will provide relevant clues to the Golmud police and Nanjing Jiangning police in time to find the missing person Huang Moumou as soon as possible.
At the same time, relevant experts suggest that tourists should be standardized, rational and civilized during outdoor activities, always pay attention to roadside warning signs, and do not venture into no-man's land. In case of emergencies, they should call the police in time.
The US media uncovered the truth about the US unprovoked request for China to close the Consulate General in Houston-Chinanews.com

The US media revealed the truth about the US unprovoked request for China to close the Consulate General in Houston
On the 24th, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the U.S. Embassy in China that China had decided to revoke the permission for the establishment and operation of the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu, and put forward specific requirements for the Consulate General to cease all business and activities as a countermeasure to the sudden request of the United States on the 21st that China close the Consulate General in Houston.
This behavior of the U.S. government has aroused many concerns, and its political motives have been questioned by foreign media and scholars.
Why is China required to close the Consulate General?
Several foreign media said that it is not clear why the United States chose the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, but as to the purpose of this move, the foreign media bluntly said: For the general election.
CNN reported on the 23rd that the U.S. request that China close the Consulate General in Houston has aroused public doubts about its political motives.
The article stated that the US government's disastrous response to the new crown epidemic has caused President Trump's pre-election poll support rate to be relatively low.
White House officials privately said that the tough strategy adopted against China is to save Trump's approval rating, and also to shift the responsibility for the failure of the White House's response to the epidemic.
The article believes that the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is a "politically driven and very cautious" target chosen by the United States, and the U.S. government chose it "to create a tough attitude while avoiding the risk of major conflict."
The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) also believes that when the US election season approaches and the US economy is severely hit by the epidemic, Trump believes that "playing the 'China card' has a political advantage."
The current situation is "a spiraling, tit-for-tat struggle", which is promoted to a certain extent by the US government from the perspective of domestic considerations, and will only worsen the tension between China and the United States.
CBS reported that Trump's re-election prospects are under pressure due to the outbreak of the epidemic, and he has repeatedly accused China of the epidemic.
Almost every day, the United States has new actions against Trump's absurd argument that "China exploits the United States."
"The Consulate General of Houston is very important in establishing contacts between the two countries."
The Associated Press commented that the U.S. request for China to close its Consulate General in Houston has exacerbated tensions between the world's two largest economies.
If the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is closed, in addition to the diplomatic impact, Chinese citizens in the southern United States will face difficulties in obtaining consular services, as will American citizens seeking visas and other services.
A business group in Houston expressed regret over the US request that China close the Consulate General in Houston, saying that the Consulate General has played an important role in establishing trade, investment and cultural ties between the two countries.
The Associated Press believes that this reflects the importance of China's economy.
The website of the US "Foreign Policy" magazine believes that this move by the United States "is part of a series of provocative measures that will only worsen US-China relations."
Reuters quoted Jonathan Pollack, an expert on East Asia issues at the Brookings Institution, a US think tank, as saying that since the establishment of comprehensive diplomatic relations between the United States and China in 1979, he could not think of any move comparable to this action by the United States against the Chinese Consulate General in Houston.
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported that this move by the United States is unprecedented in the more than 40 years of diplomatic relations between China and the United States.
Analysts believe that this move may cause lasting damage.
The Chinese Consulate General in Houston was established in 1979 and was the first Chinese consulate in the United States.
At present, China has one embassy and five consulates general in the United States.

Putin first inspected the ship parade in the waters of the Kronstadt naval base in the Baltic Sea.
After that, he took a speedboat to the waters of the Neva River in the center of St. Petersburg and went ashore to watch the military parade held on the Neva River.
Putin said in a speech at the military parade that the modern technical level of Russian naval equipment has continued to improve in recent years, and the Russian navy will receive a total of about 40 new ships equipped with unique hypersonic strike systems in 2020.
In addition, Russian Navy Commander-in-Chief Yevmenov said in an interview with the Russian Defense Ministry newspaper "Red Star" that Russia's plan to build ships has been effectively implemented, and the number of new ships that the Russian Navy plans to receive in 2020 is relatively large in recent years.
In 1696, Tsar Peter the Great set out to form a maritime fleet, creating the history of the Russian navy.
The last Sunday of July every year is the Russian Navy Day.
In response to the new changes in the epidemic prevention and control work, since July 17, trade unions at all levels in Xinjiang have responded to the call of the Autonomous Region Federation of Trade Unions and actively participated in the epidemic prevention and control work.
Tianshan North and South Trade Union cadres, employees, and model workers walked into street communities and residents to carry out activities such as delivering vegetables and medicines, disinfecting and sterilizing, and publicizing epidemic prevention knowledge to serve the workers and the masses, and use practical actions to demonstrate the "hard core power" of the trade union.
Recently, the consolation team of the Tianshan District Federation of Trade Unions in Urumqi City sent a batch of urgently needed epidemic prevention and control living materials to the staff at 12 isolation points.
After the outbreak, Tianshan District invested more than 1.05 million yuan in the first time, which was urgently allocated to 23 directly affiliated grassroots trade unions.
After receiving the company's notice on the prevention and control of the epidemic, Zhao Xiangguo, deputy secretary of the Party Committee of China Construction Xinjiang Construction Industry and Trade Union, took the initiative to choose to stay on duty in the unit to escort the employees.
He sends cooking utensils, food and daily necessities for the employees who live in the unit dormitory and newly recruited employees, and organizes personnel to send them daily necessities every two days.

Spokesperson for the Embassy in the United Kingdom: The Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security-Chinanews.com
China News Service, July 26. According to the website of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom, on the 25th, the spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom answered questions about erroneous statements about cyber attacks.
The spokesman emphasized that the Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security and has always resolutely opposed and combated any form of cyber attacks and cyber crimes.
A reporter asked: According to the media, hacker organizations related to China have interfered with the network system of a British company, launched attacks on British and American technology companies that have patent data, and invaded the government networks of EU countries.
The spokesman said that the Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security and has always resolutely opposed and combated any form of cyber attacks and cyber crimes.
Cyberspace is virtual, difficult to trace, and diverse actors. When investigating and characterizing cyber incidents, sufficient evidence should be produced, and no unwarranted guesses should be made.
The spokesman said that a series of incidents such as the "Prism Gate" in the past proved that the United States has been conducting the world's largest cyber theft operation.
Maintaining peace and stability in cyberspace is in the common interest of all countries.
The spokesman pointed out that China's achievements in scientific and technological innovation were not stolen or stolen, but obtained through self-reliance and hard work.
In 2019, China submitted about 59,000 patent applications through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), with an annual growth rate of 10.6%, making it the country with the largest number of international patent applications.
China has become a country of innovation and intellectual property rights.
Data from the Urumqi Central Branch of the People's Bank of China show that in the first half of the year, new loans to agriculture-related and small and micro enterprises in Xinjiang exceeded the full-year increase in 2019.
In the first half of this year, the Urumqi Central Branch of the People's Bank of China used a variety of monetary policy tools to guide the banking industry to continuously increase loan investment, providing sufficient funds for epidemic prevention and control and the resumption of work and production.
Most districts of Urumqi free nucleic acid testing have basically completed secondary testing in high-risk areas-Chinanews.com
China News Service, Urumqi, July 26 (Reporter Sun Tingwen Zhao Yamin) Zhang Wei, director of the Urumqi Health Commission, said in a briefing on the latest epidemic and nucleic acid testing in Urumqi City on the 26th that at present, most districts of Urumqi City's free nucleic acid testing work have been basically completed.
The expert group of the State Council and experts from the autonomous region and Urumqi City are making further assessments of the development of the epidemic based on the results of nucleic acid testing and epidemiological investigations.
The Press Office of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region held a press conference on the 26th to report on the epidemic situation and prevention and control in Xinjiang.
According to him, from 0: 00 to 24: 00 on July 25, there were 22 new confirmed cases of new coronary pneumonia in Urumqi City (of which 5 were confirmed cases of asymptomatic infection), and 38 new cases of asymptomatic infection.
As of 24: 00 on July 25, there are 135 confirmed cases and 147 asymptomatic infections in Urumqi City.
The new asymptomatic infections on the 25th were also basically detected through the city's free nucleic acid testing and active screening.
Zhang Wei, director of the Urumqi Health Commission, said on the 26th that most districts in Urumqi City have basically completed the free nucleic acid testing work.
He also said that from the experience of other parts of the country, there are many factors that affect the results of nucleic acid testing, such as the sensitivity of the test reagent, the time of infection and detoxification of the tested person, the cooperation of the tested person when the specimen is taken (poor compatibility may cause the specimen not to be taken in place), and the testing environment, the operation proficiency of the inspectors, etc.
For various reasons, false negative results can also occur in nucleic acid testing.
The so-called false negative means that the tested person is indeed an infected person, but the nucleic acid test result is negative.
In addition, for people who have had close contact with confirmed and suspected cases, two nucleic acid tests are usually required to exclude them.
For people who have been to high-risk areas in the epidemic, if there are fever and respiratory symptoms, a negative nucleic acid test may have a false negative, so two nucleic acid tests are also needed to exclude it.

White House epidemic expert Fauci: Cautious optimism about the development of a vaccine in early 2021
Fauci made the above remarks at an online video conference hosted by the International Leadership Foundation on the 25th.
He reminded that it is not yet clear how the new crown epidemic will develop in autumn and winter, nor what the ultimate impact of the epidemic will be. "And the only way to end this is for each of us to choose to be part of the solution."

Although the epidemic situation varies from place to place, and local response plans are needed, diversified anti-epidemic strategies do not mean that there is no close connection between regions.
The epidemic in one area will eventually affect other regions.
"This is not the time for complacency", Fauci said. "Our work is not complete, we must step up our efforts, and we must also be vigilant against the uncertainty of the future."

Representatives of the United States-China Trade Talks meet in August
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post quoted an anonymous person familiar with the matter as reporting that Liu He, head of China's trade negotiation team and vice premier of the State Council, and Lai Haizhe, co-leader of the US team and trade representative, are expected to hold formal talks in August to assess the implementation of the first phase of the Sino-US trade agreement.
The report said that although China has substantially increased its purchases of US agricultural products in the past few months, due to factors such as the new crown virus epidemic, China's purchases are still some distance from the amounts promised in the trade agreement.
Analysts say that the recent closure of each other's consulates by the United States and China, together with other disputes, may undermine any progress in trade between the two sides.
The first phase of the Sino-US trade agreement came into effect one month after it was signed on January 15. The agreement stipulates that the high-level trade framework group of the two sides should hold talks every six months.
People familiar with the matter revealed that this meeting will be "an important turning point", allowing the two parties to assess the progress of the agreement.
However, this person also said that if the tense relationship between the United States and China leads to a low willingness to talk at this time, the two sides may agree that the May 8 conference call between Lai Haizhe and Liu He has met the terms of the semi-annual talks in the trade agreement.
Since the beginning of this year, Sino-US relations have deteriorated rapidly. Disputes between the two sides include a series of issues such as the origin of the new crown virus, trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the South China Sea and ideology.
Although US President Trump boasted about his achievements in the first phase of the agreement at the beginning of the year, his attitude has changed recently.
He said at a White House press conference on the 23rd that although China has recently purchased a record number of U.S. corn in a single day and has also bought a lot of soybeans, "but this trade agreement is no longer as meaningful to me as it was when it was reached."
An anonymous Beijing government consultant also believes that due to poor US-China relations, a new round of trade negotiations is unlikely to take place, and that "trade issues have lost weight in Sino-US relations."
However, he revealed that Chinese economic and trade related units still met on the 23rd to discuss a series of issues, including how to increase imports from the United States. "We have tried our best to buy, so any additional purchases will be difficult."
Peng Jining, vice chairman of the US-China Trade National Committee, said that maintaining the momentum of the first phase of the agreement is "more important than ever" and pointed out that China has made progress in further opening up its financial markets to US companies this year.
An analyst at Plenum, an independent research company, said: "It is better to talk than not to talk, although it may only be regarded as routine."
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 (Reporter Wei Yukun) The reporter learned from the Ministry of Emergency Management on the 26th that the National Defense Office and the Ministry of Emergency Management, together with the State Food and Material Reserve Bureau, have once again urgently transferred 1.35 million woven bags, 1.2 million square meters of woven fabrics, 130,000 square meters of geotextiles and other six categories of central reserve flood control materials to Anhui to support flood fighting and rescue work.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Emergency Management Department, at present, the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Huaihe River basin maintain high water level fluctuations, and the "Yangtze River 2020 No. 3 Flood" formed in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River on the 26th, increasing the risk in some areas.
The meteorological department predicts that there will be heavy rainfall in Chongqing, Guizhou, and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in the next three days, and the flood control situation is still severe and complex.
According to reports, since the flood season, the Ministry of Emergency Management has deployed a national comprehensive fire rescue team to pre-position professional rescue forces in key flood control areas, and has participated in a total of 10,364 flood fighting and rescue operations, dispatched more than 130,000 fighters, 17,778 fire trucks, and 11,887 boats, rescued 37,777 people in distress, and evacuated more than 107,000 trapped people.
Hao Yusheng, Chief Representative of Nasdaq China: Now is the best time node for Chinese companies to go to the United States for IPOs-Economic Watch-Professional Financial News Website
Economic Observer Network reporter Zhang Bin Because of the Ruixing Coffee counterfeiting incident, the US market has imposed stricter supervision on Chinese concept stocks, coupled with the long-term pressure on valuations, and Chinese concept stocks listed in the United States are under pressure. Netease, JD.com and other Chinese concept stocks have recently begun their journey back to Hong Kong for listing.
Recently, shell, ideal car and other companies have been eager to go public in the United States.
Under the epidemic and the Chinese concept stock crisis, is now the best time for Chinese companies to go public in the United States?
"As far as the recent IPO cases and the next companies to be listed in the United States are concerned, the IPO to the United States has not been affected in essence, but the market is very good now, and even this point in time is the best time node for Chinese companies to go to the United States for IPOs in the past 10 years."
Hao Yusheng, chief representative of the China region of the Nasdaq Stock Exchange, said at the "2020 Listed Company Leaders Summit China Equity Branch" hosted by Snowball.
In April this year, the US Securities Regulatory Commission (SEC) and the Public Company Accounting Regulatory Board (PCAOB) issued the "Statement on the Important Role of Audit Quality and Supervision in Obtaining Audit and Other International Information-A Discussion on the Current Challenges of Information Acquisition for US Listed Companies with a large number of operations in China."
The statement stated that although international cooperation and coordination have increased significantly in recent years, the U.S. regulatory authorities still have problems with access to information, and the SEC and PCAOB still face legal and practical challenges; corresponding to this document, the PCAOB website provides a detailed list of listed companies that have encountered audit obstacles and their audit institutions, and a large number of Chinese concept stock companies are listed.
In addition, in May this year, the U.S. Senate passed the "Foreign Companies Accountability Act", which introduced additional information disclosure requirements for foreign companies to list in the United States.
In Hao Yusheng's view, the Chinese stock crisis has not affected the appetite of investors.
"When this news first came out, it caused everyone's panic, and everyone was asking if they could go public in the United States in the future, but later we found that these problems are not a problem on the investor's side. Investors may ask these questions during the recent IPO roadshow in the United States, and even become standardized questions, but this has not been regarded by investors as an important factor in investing in a Chinese company.
It is suggested that everyone treat the current situation with a normal heart as much as possible.
Of course, this time may look like the worst situation in the past two years, but as far as investors' appetite is concerned, it has not been affected in any way.
So from now until the end of this year or before the US election, the upsurge of IPOs to the United States will continue. "
On May 9 this year, Jinshan Yun officially listed on Nasdaq in the United States, becoming the first Chinese company to go to the United States for an IPO after the epidemic.
"The listing of Jinshan Yun gives a lot of confidence to the Chinese companies that are preparing for IPOs later."
Hao Yusheng said.
The report on Chinese stocks in the first half of 2020 released by Snowball shows that in the first half of this year, a total of 20 Chinese companies went to the US for IPOs, an increase of 17.6% over the same period last year; in terms of total initial fund-raising, 20 companies raised a total of 2.725 billion, up more than 52.4% from the same period last year. In terms of industry distribution, the number of IPOs in the healthcare industry in the first half of this year was outstanding, an increase of 100% over the same period last year.
According to Hao Yusheng, the quality of Chinese companies that went to the United States for IPOs in the first half of this year is relatively high, and high-quality companies with strong fundamentals and growth will be more favored by investors.
In the short, medium and long term, Hao Yusheng continues to be optimistic about Ming China's IPO in the United States.
"In the short term, the wave of IPOs to the United States continues; in the medium term, Chinese companies have more choices, A shares, Hong Kong stocks, and US stocks. Everyone will take the US general election and Sino-US relations as factors for market selection and time selection; in the long run, everything will return to normal, and market fluctuations are cycles, both political and economic, and will eventually return to the normal stage, and the stock market has always been fluctuating."
Hao Yusheng also said, "There are more uncertain factors this year, but for high-quality companies, no matter whether the market is good or bad, as long as they are solid and have growth that investors can see, other factors are relatively minor. Investors need to invest in outstanding Chinese companies."

Commentator of the People's Daily: Concentrate on doing your own affairs and building new advantages for future development-On learning and implementing General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the Entrepreneur Symposium-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 25, People's Daily, July 26, commentator's article: Concentrate on doing your own affairs and building new advantages for future development
At present, the global epidemic and the world economic situation are still severe and complex, and the challenges facing my country's development are unprecedented.
Maintaining strategic determination, enhancing confidence in victory, and concentrating our efforts on our own affairs are the keys to our response to various risks and challenges.
At the recent entrepreneur symposium, General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized that in the current external environment of rising protectionism, downturn in the world economy, and shrinking global markets, we must concentrate our efforts on our own affairs, give full play to the advantages of the domestic super-large-scale market, and gradually form a new development pattern that takes the domestic big cycle as the main body and the domestic and international double cycles promote each other, improve the modernization level of the industrial chain supply chain, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation, accelerate key core technologies, and create new advantages for future development.
Those who observe the situation are wise, and those who control the situation win.
In the external environment of the in-depth development of economic globalization, the "two ends" of markets and resources have played an important role in the rapid development of my country.
Now, the world under the impact of the epidemic is undergoing profound changes, facing more unstable and uncertain factors, and economic globalization is encountering headwinds and turning waves.
To be prepared for a longer period of time to respond to changes in the external environment, and to promote my country's economy to ride the wind and waves and achieve stability and long-term development, an extremely important aspect is to take the expansion and satisfaction of domestic demand as the strategic basis for development, give full play to its own advantages, and add impetus to my country's economic development through the prosperity of the domestic economy and the smooth flow of the domestic cycle, and drive the recovery of the world economy.
We must deeply realize that building a complete domestic demand system is related to my country's long-term development and long-term stability.
The Party Central Committee reviewed the situation and clearly proposed to resolutely implement the strategy of expanding domestic demand. This is the need to respond to the impact of the epidemic, to maintain the long-term sustainable and healthy development of my country's economy, and to meet the needs of the people's growing good life.
The advantage of a large economy is that it is internally recyclable.
My country has the world's most complete and largest industrial system, strong production capacity, and complete supporting capabilities. It has more than 100 million market players and more than 170 million people with higher education or various professional skills. There is also a super-large domestic demand market formed by 1.4 billion people, including more than 400 million middle-income groups. It is in the stage of rapid development of new industrialization, informatization, urbanization, and agricultural modernization, with huge investment demand potential.
Public ownership is the main body, multiple ownership economies develop together, distribution according to work is the main body, and multiple distribution methods coexist. The socialist market economy system and other socialist basic economic systems can not only stimulate the vitality of various market entities, liberate and develop social productive forces, but also promote the organic unity of efficiency and fairness, and continuously achieve common prosperity.
We must firmly grasp the strategic basis of expanding domestic demand, make production, distribution, and circulation more dependent on the domestic market to achieve a virtuous circle, clarify the strategic direction of supply-side structural reforms, and promote the dynamic balance of aggregate supply and aggregate demand at a higher level.
It is necessary to accelerate the construction of a complete domestic demand system, vigorously promote technological innovation and other innovations, accelerate the promotion of strategic emerging industries such as digital economy, intelligent manufacturing, life and health, and new materials, form more new growth points and growth poles, and gradually form a new development pattern with the domestic big cycle as the main body and the domestic and international double cycles promoting each other.
Openness brings progress, and closure inevitably lags behind.
General Secretary Xi Jinping has repeatedly emphasized that the door to China's opening will not be closed, but will only open wider and wider.
With the domestic big cycle as the main body, it is by no means closing the door to operate, but by harnessing the potential of domestic demand, making the domestic market and the international market better connected, and making better use of the two international and domestic markets and two resources to achieve stronger and more sustainable development.
At the same time, there is no contradiction between expanding domestic demand and expanding openness. The smoother the domestic cycle, the more conducive to building a new pattern of openness, and the more conducive to forming new advantages in participating in international cooperation and competition.
Although protectionism is on the rise internationally, we must stand on the right side of history, persist in deepening reforms, expanding opening up, strengthening open cooperation in the field of science and technology, promoting the construction of an open world economy, and promoting the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.
The Chinese nation has experienced many tribulations in history, but it has never been crushed, but it has become more and more courageous, growing and rising from tribulations.
On the way forward, there is the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the remarkable advantages of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, strong mobilization capabilities and strong comprehensive strength, and the unity and struggle of the entire party, the army, and the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country. We will certainly be able to overcome all difficulties and obstacles, maintain the good momentum of our country's economic and social development, build a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way, and successfully start a new journey of building a modern socialist country in an all-round way!
Yu'ebao's earnings go down "post-90s" instead of "retaliatory" saving money?
With the decline in Yu'ebao's earnings, the "post-90s" not only did not flee the balance treasure, but began to "retaliate" to save money?
The "Yu'ebao Post-90s Savings Report" (2020 edition) recently released by the China New Economic Research Institute and Alipay shows that in the first half of the year, "post-90s" prefer to save money: The amount of money saved per capita increased by nearly 40% compared with 2019.
Interestingly, the "post-90s" tend to start with a small sum of "small money", and 60% of the average amount of money saved is below 20 yuan...
Saving money with the balance treasure has also become the habit of saving money after the "90s."
Data shows that of the 700 million Yu'e Bao users, 134 million are "post-90s."
There are 174 million "post-90s" in China, that is to say, about 3 out of 4 "post-90s" in the country are using the balance to save money.
At present, the 7-day annualized rate of return of money funds such as Yu'ebao has fallen to about 1.5% from a level above 2% at the beginning of the year.
Even so, it did not affect the pace of "post-90s" saving money.
In the context of the improvement of Yu'e Bao's "money saving effect", many young people who are used to using Yu'e Bao have also been directly transformed into "basic people."
Alipay data shows that as of July 13, the number of new "base people" on Alipay has more than doubled year-on-year in the past month, and more and more young people have achieved "advanced" financial management on Alipay.
Some analysts believe that the flow of funds from the balance treasure into the stock market is also an important reason for the clear decline in the share of money funds in June.
The report also shows that "post-90s" girls tend to save more, on average 20% more than boys save; 60% of users who hold funds on the Alipay platform are men, and women tend to choose more robust financial management methods than men.
After saving money, what are the plans for the "post-90s"?
Alipay data shows that "post-90s" have the habit of saving money for their goals, and the most users take travel as the goal of saving money.
Affected by the epidemic, many "post-90s" saved money to prepare for travel after the epidemic; the resumption of cinema operations also provides a new way to shift from saving money to consumption.

A total of 13 people from the Information Department of the Philippine Presidential Palace tested positive-Chinanews.com
(Fight against new crown pneumonia) A total of 13 people from the Philippine Presidential Office Information Department tested positive
China News Service, Manila, July 26 (Reporter Guan Xiangdong) The Information Department of the Presidential Office of the Philippines (PCOO) issued a notice on the 25th that the Minister of the Department, Martin Andanal, was tested negative for new coronary pneumonia on the 24th.
As of the afternoon of the same day, a total of 13 PCOO staff had tested positive, and three positive people had died and two were still receiving treatment.
Due to contact with an infected staff member of PCOO, Andanal and 49 PCOO staff were tested for new crown pneumonia on the 24th.
The report released on the 25th showed that 10 of the staff tested positive.
PCOO Deputy Minister for Administrative and Legal Affairs Marvin Gatpayat said that the site is located in the new administrative office building of the Presidential Palace and was originally scheduled to resume operations on the same day that President Duterte delivered his fifth State of the Union address on the 27th.
On the same day, Martin Andanal assured the public that PCOO would continue to perform its duties to the Filipino people, ensure that important information is provided to the public in a timely manner, and strengthen contact tracing and testing to avoid further spread of the new crown pneumonia virus among PCOO staff. He prayed for the rapid recovery of the staff who tested positive.
The Philippine Ministry of Health announced that on the same day, 2019 new cases were confirmed in the country, with a total of 78,412 cases, of which 50,763 were still suffering from the disease, nearly 90% were mild, 9% were asymptomatic, and less than 1% were severe and critical cases.
France increases military investment in space-Xinhuanet
French Defense Minister Florence Parley said on the 24th that France will add hundreds of millions of euros to its space defense budget and develop space military forces to prevent "unfriendly actions" that other countries may make in outer space.
Parley told the Provence newspaper on the same day that between 2019 and 2025, the French space military project expenditure budget will increase from the previously proposed 3.6 billion euros (approximately 4.2 billion US dollars) to 4.3 billion euros (5 billion US dollars).
According to the French Military Planning Act 2019-2025, approved by the French Parliament in 2018, France is expected to update its existing observation satellites and communication satellites in the future, launch three electromagnetic listening satellites, and improve the modernization level of space surveillance radars.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced in July last year that a space military command and an "aviation and space force" will be established within the French Air Force.
Parley said that she will officially announce the establishment of this space force when she visits a military school in Salon, Provence, later.
Parley said that this space force is affiliated with the Air Force and will have a strength of 500 by 2025.
She said: "People used to think that space served the common interests of science, and this idea is gone forever. Now space is a place where countries compete for global hegemony."
Parley reiterated Macron's previous statement, saying that France has no intention of provoking an arms race.
"We are by no means engaged in an arms race. But it is my duty to fully recognize the threats we may face."
Parley recalled the surveillance of a military satellite shared by France and Italy in 2017.
She said that what was "peeping" was a Russian satellite.
The Russian side denies this statement.
Parley said that France "soon" will have small patrol satellites capable of detecting and locking "the black hands behind those unfriendly actions."
French media believe that the reason why France seeks to establish a space force is due to US President Donald Trump's request in February last year that the US Department of Defense draft a bill to establish a space force.
Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act in December last year, approving the establishment of the sixth largest service in the United States, the Space Force.
Some experts worry that these US measures have accelerated the pace of US space militarization and may trigger a new round of space arms race.

The report said that the shared accommodation market has picked up since March-Chinanews.com
News from our newspaper (Reporter Yang Zhaokui) The "China Shared Accommodation Development Report 2020" (hereinafter referred to as the "Report") recently released by the Sharing Economy Research Center of the National Information Center shows that due to the impact of the epidemic, the transaction value of my country's shared accommodation market fell by 72.1% year-on-year in the first 5 months of 2020.
However, the shared accommodation market has rebounded since March, and the market transaction volume, order volume and number of receptions have gradually recovered.
The "Report" shows that the transaction volume of the shared accommodation market has dropped sharply. On the one hand, due to the sharp decline in travel accommodation demand under the epidemic prevention and control, the number of orders has fallen sharply. The total number of orders in the first five months has dropped by 65% year-on-year, and the number of receptions has dropped by 63% year-on-year. On the other hand, the weakness of demand has also led to a relatively significant decline in overnight prices, with the average overnight price in the first five months falling by 16% year-on-year.
However, in March, April, and May, the market turnover increased by 78%, 199%, and 35% respectively; the number of orders increased by 141%, 152%, and 50% respectively; and the number of receptions increased by 81%, 112%, and 28% respectively.
The "Report" points out that the development of the shared accommodation industry has been promising for a long time, but there are still many uncertainties in the near future.
In this regard, Yu Fengxia, deputy director of the Sharing Economy Research Center of the National Information Center, told the Workers "Daily reporter that the development of shared accommodation requires stronger policy support. On the one hand, it is necessary to do a good job of implementing the policies already in place in the early stage, further strengthen policy coherence, and focus on creating a better business environment; on the other hand, it is also necessary to further increase policy guidance and support from many aspects such as stimulating consumer demand, enriching the supply of tourism and accommodation services, innovating service methods, and strengthening cooperation between the government and platform enterprises.

China News Service, Xiamen, July 26 (Yang Fushan Zhang Shushan Xu Jingyi) China's famous vascular surgery center-Shanghai Changhai Hospital Vascular Surgery, Naval Military Medical University, signed a contract with the Department of Vascular Surgery of Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University on the 25th to establish a collaboration center to promote exchanges and cooperation between the two sides in the field of vascular surgery, especially in the field of acute and severe aortic diseases.
Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University said that after the vascular surgery of the two hospitals formally formed a collaborative unit, they will carry out remote consultations, make real-time online consultations with Changhai Hospital to formulate treatment plans, select talents for further training, and jointly carry out surgical technology exchanges, teaching and room searches every week; for complex cases, Changhai experts can be invited to the hospital to perform operations according to the needs of the patients, so that patients in southwestern Fujian can enjoy the top domestic medical resources without leaving the province.
The two hospitals will also work together to carry out surgical innovation and scientific research, aortic disease popularization and early screening, etc.
The aortic special seminar hosted by Beijing Health Promotion Association and hosted by Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University was held in Xiamen on the same day.
The above-mentioned two well-known hospitals in Shanghai and Xiamen held a signing ceremony for the Vascular Surgery Collaboration Center at the same time at the meeting, announcing the formation of a collaborative unit to jointly improve the treatment level of vascular surgery-related diseases in southwestern Fujian.
Shanghai Changhai Hospital Vascular Surgery is the only vascular surgery institute in the army and the only vascular system disease clinical medicine center in Shanghai. It is also the first national key discipline of vascular surgery. It led the establishment of the Chinese Physicians Association Endovascular Angiology Professional Committee, which is a well-established top team in the industry.
Professor Huang Xiaojin, Director of Vascular Surgery, Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University, was interviewed by the media.
The Vascular Surgery Department of Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University is the first vascular surgery set up by an independent discipline in Fujian Province. It has long been committed to the diagnosis and treatment of aortic and peripheral vascular diseases. In 2018, it was approved to build a provincial key clinical specialty.
In the treatment of aortic diseases, in addition to the treatment of dissecting aneurysms and aortic aneurysms, there is extensive experience in emergency ruptured aortic aneurysms.
"The vascular surgery of Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University is very outstanding in this region in terms of the history of development, the breadth, difficulty, and complexity of the operation, so this time we set up a collaboration center. In addition to the aorta, it can also carry out in-depth cooperation in medicine, teaching, and scientific research in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases such as lower extremity arteries and carotid arteries."
Professor Feng Rui, deputy director of vascular surgery at Shanghai Changhai Hospital, said.
Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University and Shanghai Changhai Hospital signed a contract to establish a "Li Zhaoshen Famous Medical Studio" in the Department of Gastroenterology in 2018.
Professor Huang Xiaojin, director of vascular surgery of the hospital, said in an interview with a reporter from Chinanews.com that the vascular surgery of the hospital has also been in communication with Changhai Hospital for a long time. This time, the two hospitals formally formed a collaborative unit, bringing cooperation and exchanges between the two sides to a new level.
He said that the hospital will regularly invite Shanghai experts to Xiamen to carry out surgical technology exchanges, teaching room searches, difficult case discussions, etc., and further carry out remote consultations. Currently, it plans to conduct remote consultations once a week; in addition, the department will also send personnel for further training and exchanges to strengthen the training and development of disciplinary talent teams.
The reporter learned at the meeting that vascular disease is the largest cause of death in China, and the aorta, as the main artery of various organs of the human body, flows from the heart to the whole body and plays an important role.
The occurrence of aortic diseases is often accompanied by high risk, high mortality, and high difficulty in treatment. The thickest section of the aorta is up to 4 cm in diameter. Once a hemangioma is formed, rupture occurs, or the vascular intima ruptures to produce dissection, it will cause massive bleeding, which is very dangerous.
In recent years, as people's lifestyles have changed and the pace of life has accelerated, China has become the world's largest country with hypertension, and aortic diseases have also increased. Today, with the development of surgical techniques and industrial materials, the treatment of aortic diseases continues to develop in the direction of minimally invasive, rapid and efficient.
Doctors can properly "divert" blood flow by piercing the thigh and placing a stent in the aorta, so as to avoid the impact on the aneurysm or ruptured dissection, and achieve a good therapeutic effect. Some operations even require local anesthesia.
This academic seminar invited more than a dozen domestic experts to discuss the new progress in the treatment of aortic diseases, and carried out cutting-edge technical training and difficult case discussions in the form of conference salons.
The reporter learned at the meeting that with the development of surgical technology and industrial materials, the current treatment of aortic diseases continues to develop in the direction of minimally invasive, rapid and efficient.

Launched on July 24, Aiqi Yi "Journey" also embarked on the journey of webcasting-Xinhuanet
Directed by Chen Desen and produced by Zheng Baorui, the action adventure movie "Journey", starring Liu Xianhua, He Rundong, Lin Chenhan, Jiang Luxia and others, will be launched on July 24.
This is also the second major production film to choose webcasting after "Mom."
"Journey" is adapted from an online game of the same name. It tells the story of Qingyuan Village boy Dong Yilong and Chu Soul, a warrior of the Chu Family Army, who set out on a journey to participate in the selection of Marshal Ma of the Southern Zhao State Army. On the way, they met King Kong's little sister, and the three joined together to complete their own mission.
This year is the 15th anniversary of the game "Journey" IP, and the launch of the movie of the same name is undoubtedly a tribute to the classic game.
At the same time as the release was announced, the movie "Journey" released the "National War" version of the set poster and the "Live" pilot trailer.
The excellent painting quality presents a grand national war picture of the journey world, portraying the profound brotherhood of the two protagonists, Dong Yilong and Chu Soul.
"The Journey" chooses the overhead era to build the background of the story.
In the fictional Central Plains mainland, among the ten countries, the Southern Zhao Kingdom and the Northern Yan Kingdom live next to each other.
In order to defend against the increasingly powerful Beiyan, Nanzhao held a martial arts conference to select generals.
The news reached the remote Qingyuan Village. Villager Dong Yilong wanted to become the flag bearer of the family and represented the Qingyuan Village family in the race. The villagers questioned his qualifications. After some efforts, Yilong finally embarked on a journey with the warrior Chu Soul.
The total investment in the film is nearly 300 million yuan, and the proportion of special effects shots in the film is as high as 80%.
It is conceivable that special effects have become one of the biggest highlights of "Journey."
The post-special effects production team is also quite promising, led by MORE VFX, the special effects team that created "Wandering Earth", which uses imaginative visual art and top technology to restore the "journey" world.
Some of the classic game scenes, Phoenix City, Qingyuan Village, and Beast King Valley will also appear in the movie, and game players should have a wave of nostalgia at that time.
In addition to the special effects team, behind-the-scenes production is also a bunch of accomplished figures in the industry.
Director Chen Desen has directed "October Siege" and "Purple Rain Storm", and producer Zheng Baorui has filmed "Kill the Wolf 2", "The Monkey King of the Journey to the West", and so on. The action scenes are the responsibility of Dong Wei, the best action director of the Golden Horse Award and the Golden Horse Award, and art director McGuoqiang is also the winner of the two-time Academy Awards for Best Beauty.

China Railway Chengdu Bureau Group
China News Service, Chongqing, July 26 (Reporter Han Lu) The reporter learned from China Railway Chengdu Bureau Group Co., Ltd. on the 26th that the Zhengwan High-speed Railway Small Three Gorges Tunnel, with a total length of about 18.9 kilometers, was fully connected on the same day.
It is understood that the Small Three Gorges Tunnel is not only the longest high-speed rail tunnel in the Three Gorges Reservoir area, but also the longest single-hole double-track high-speed rail tunnel with a design speed of 350 kilometers per hour in the project currently under construction in China.
The Zhengwan high-speed railway is located in the three provinces and cities of Henan, Hubei, and Chongqing. It is connected to the Beijing-Guangzhou and Xulan high-speed trains in the north of Zhengzhou, and the Chongqing-Chongqing high-speed railway in the south of Wanzhou. It is an important part of my country's "eight vertical and eight horizontal" high-speed railway network along the river channel and the Huonan passageway.
The Zhengwan High-speed Railway Small Three Gorges Tunnel was completed on the 26th.
The picture shows passing through the scene.
The Zhengwan high-speed railway starts in Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, and runs southwest through Pingdingshan City, Nanyang City, Xiangyang City, Hubei Province, to Wanzhou District, Chongqing City. The new line is about 818 kilometers long, with a design speed of 350 kilometers per hour, and about 184 kilometers in Chongqing.
Among them, the Zhengzhou-Xiangyang section has been opened for operation in advance on December 1, 2019, and the Chongqing section is stepping up construction.
The Small Three Gorges Tunnel, which is fully connected on the 26th, is a full-line control project of the Zhengwan High-speed Railway. The project is located at the junction of Fengjie County and Wushan County in Chongqing City, with a total length of about 18.9 kilometers and a maximum buried depth of 890 meters.
Construction of the tunnel began in February 2017, and the entire line was completed on July 26, 2020.
According to Wang Guojun, head of Zhengwan High-speed Railway Tunnel Design, China Railway Second Academy Engineering Group Co., Ltd., the survey and design party, the location of the Small Three Gorges Tunnel is very complex and faces risks such as karst, mud inrush, and large deformation of soft rock. It is a Class I high-risk tunnel, and the tunnel design and construction is extremely difficult.
"During the construction of the project, we used geological survey methods, geophysical methods, and advanced drilling methods to make advanced geological forecasts, and adopted special design plans for more than 30 caves of various types. For example, we designed and built a 24-meter-long bridge that spans large caves with a longitudinal length of more than 10 meters and a depth of more than 55 meters in the tunnel to avoid tunnel settlement", Wang Guojun said.
According to the China Railway Tunnel Bureau of the construction party, during the construction of the tunnel, a combination of dredging and blocking was adopted. Through the construction of horizontal tunnels, grouting and water blocking, the strengthening of tunnel structure support and the construction of sewage treatment stations, it not only ensured the orderly progress of the project, but also avoided the damage of construction drainage to the water body of the Small Three Gorges Scenic Area. At the same time, it successfully overcame construction difficulties such as the 7-kilometer-long soft rock large deformation and other bad geology, and the daily maximum water inrush of 157,000 cubic meters.
After the Zhengwan high-speed railway is completed and opened to traffic, it will become a new convenient and fast passenger passage from southwestern China to the Central Plains, North China, and Northeast China. It is of great significance to improve the capacity and quality of the northeast railway passage in southwestern China, improve the regional road network layout, accelerate the development of tourism resources and urbanization along the route, promote coordinated regional development, and promote the implementation of the western development strategy.
Experts say that the collection of immigration data through the U.S. Census for the allocation of seats in the House of Representatives is unconstitutional
Some civil rights organizations and several U.S. cities and counties filed a lawsuit against the U.S. federal government, claiming that the Trump Presidential Palace's attempt to exclude undocumented immigrants from the U.S. Census is unworkable and unconstitutional.
The U.S. Census will determine the allocation of seats in the House of Representatives of the United States Congress.
Sarah Brannon, an executive lawyer of the American Civil Liberties Union, told VOA, "It won't work."
She went on to say that Trump's request to determine the citizenship of the people surveyed in the census is difficult to achieve, and "not very reliable."
Another civil liberties organization, Common Cause, filed a lawsuit Thursday to challenge Trump's executive order.
Some cities in New Jersey and Georgia joined the lawsuit.
Arlington County, Virginia, also joined the lawsuit Friday.
Garvey, chairman of the Arlington County Management Board, said, "The U.S. Constitution requires an accurate count of our population every 10 years. We must accurately count everyone living in Arlington County, and we must not let this illegal attempt to scare away people and reduce the number of our immigrant communities succeed."
Other organizations and individuals praised President Trump's executive order.
Alabama Attorney General Marshall said that the executive order was a "victory" for the state.
He said that "the distribution of seats in the House of Representatives and electoral college seats in each state must be based on the number of residents living in each state, and the number of residents legally residing."
The US Supreme Court last year prevented the Trump administration from including citizenship issues in the 2020 census form.
President Trump signed an executive order earlier this week instructing Secretary of Commerce Ross, who oversees the U.S. Census Bureau, to submit data on the undocumented population obtained from the census so that the administration can exclude these undocumented populations from the census figures of the states, and use this to determine whether each state will increase, reduce, or maintain seats in the House of Representatives.
The United States redistributes seats in the House of Representatives every 10 years according to demographic changes.
Heavy rains fell in 33 districts and counties in Chongqing. Local launch of flood control level emergency response-Chinanews.com
Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, July 26 (Reporters Ke Gaoyang and Li Song) The reporter learned from the Chongqing Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters that Chongqing has ushered in a new round of heavy rainfall from July 25, with heavy rains in 33 districts and counties, and 4 small and medium-sized rivers have over-warning water level floods, and the local area has launched a flood control level emergency response.
According to the monitoring of the Chongqing Hydrological Monitoring Station, from 8: 00 on the 25th to 8: 00 on the 26th, most parts of Chongqing ushered in heavy rains, and 33 districts and counties including Jiangjin, Qijiang, and Wulong experienced heavy rains, including 16 districts and counties including Wanzhou, Yunyang, and Nanchuan.
The maximum daily rainfall occurred in Longshan Village, Jinshan Town, Nanchuan, at 197.5 mm.
Affected by heavy rainfall, 4 small and medium-sized rivers in Jiangjin District, Donzi Creek, Fuling District, Yingyang River, Kaizhou District, and Tuantan River, Yunyang County, experienced over-warning water level floods, and the water level is still rising.
The heavy rainfall also caused a landslide in LiuJing Village, Land Township, Wulong District, which interrupted road traffic in the village, and the landslide slipped into a tributary of the Wujiang River along the Cang River, blocking the river to form a barrier lake. The local area has urgently organized the transfer of downstream people.
In response to this heavy rain, the Chongqing Flood Control and Drought Relief Command issued the first-level early warning information for river floods at 13: 00 on the 26th, and initiated the second-level emergency response for flood control, requiring relevant districts, counties and units to strengthen inspections and guard, mobilize emergency rescue teams and materials in a timely manner, and evacuate and transfer people in threatened areas.
Respond to the situation and promote the construction of industrial projects-View headlines-Hunan Daily News-Huaxing Online
In Hunan in the midsummer, the heat wave is surging.
And the enthusiasm released by the on-site observation meeting to promote the construction of industrial projects in the province has overshadowed the heat of the three-volt day, and the distinct orientation of "comparing industry with strength and talking about heroes with projects" inspired Sanxiang and four rivers.
The development of Hunan always depends on building projects and training industries.
In the face of the extremely unusual first half of the year, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the whole province insisted on a game of chess, went all out to fight the two tough battles of epidemic prevention and flood control, and regarded industrial projects as the "first move" to implement the "six stability" and "six guarantees."
From a year-on-year drop in GDP of 1.9% in the first quarter to a year-on-year growth of 1.3% in the first half of the year, the difficulty of the period and the magnitude of the effort are self-evident.
On this precious report card, the construction of industrial projects is the key support for Hunan to accelerate economic recovery, development and stability.
The situation is smooth and irreversible.
The construction of industrial projects must be put into the overall situation, not only good at accumulating, accumulating, and seeking momentum, but also good at recognizing changes, seeking changes, and adapting.
In the current complex and severe background of the international situation, in addition to the hard work of attracting investment, it is necessary to calm down to study the new characteristics of the current new situation, grasp the rules, be more scientific and precise, and better integrate into the new development pattern that takes the domestic big cycle as the main body and the domestic and international double cycles promote each other.
Pay more attention to improving the basic capabilities of the industry.
In the first half of the year, not only did a large number of heavyweight investment projects in emerging industries break ground and sow hopes in our province, but also enterprises in traditional industries have accelerated their deployment in digital, intelligent, and green industrial transformation.
The Yiyang Aoshikang Third Science Park project transforms the existing production line, and the high-end printed circuit board intelligent production line takes the lead; the new plant area of Hunan China Tobacco Changde Cigarette Factory is committed to the process of intelligent transformation and construction of a modern factory. It is also a vivid portrayal of "old trees sprouting new buds..." around the country's major strategy and "two æs one weight", focus on consolidating and upgrading advantageous industries, actively cultivating and developing emerging industries, and comprehensively increasing technological innovation and localization substitution, so as to continuously consolidate the basic conditions and save momentum for transformation.
Pay more attention to cultivating and developing new economy, new business forms and new models.
The sudden new crown epidemic has brought about the popularity of the "cloud economy", stimulated the potential of the digital economy, and provided new opportunities for industrial transformation: In the first half of the year, the province's computer and office equipment manufacturing, electronic and communication equipment manufacturing industries grew by 12.6%, the online retail sales of wholesale and retail enterprises above the quota increased by 32.2% year-on-year, and the online meal fee income of catering companies increased by 35.6% year-on-year.
It is the general trend to cultivate new opportunities in the crisis, open a new situation in the changing situation, actively promote digital industrialization and industrial digitization, and guide the integrated development of the digital economy and the real economy.
Pay more attention to optimizing and stabilizing the industrial chain supply chain.
Engineering machinery is the main force in Hunan's industry, but two-thirds of the supporting enterprises are outside the province, and there is still room and potential in the supporting chain.
Strengthening industrial chain thinking and grasping projects requires not only the continuous accumulation of leading enterprises and the realization of technological breakthroughs in key links of the industrial chain; it also requires the painstaking cultivation of various regions to stimulate the "chain" lock reaction with a strong chain to supplement the chain, promote the coordinated layout of relevant supporting industries, and accelerate the construction of an independent, controllable, safe and reliable industrial chain supply chain.
To overcome difficulties and support enterprises, Hunan is still a hot land and paradise with a good business environment and emerging market opportunities.
All parts of the province have frequently recruited, new and practical measures, thinking that the "burden reduction" of corporate relief has led to the "acceleration" of high-quality development; Shaoyang implements "shareholder-style" services, and does not shirk responsibilities for enterprises, does not discount policies, and does not solve problems overnight... In the process of recovering the losses caused by the epidemic, various "do everything possible" to pinpoint shortcomings and pain points, and turn crises into opportunities.
Focusing on studying, cultivating, and developing industries, and earnestly optimizing the business environment, will surely win the favor of more investors.
The wind and waves are still ahead, but the state of riding the wind and waves has become the norm for the province to grasp the construction of industrial projects and promote high-quality development.
At this critical period, we must learn and implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's series of important instructions, respond effectively to external uncertainties with the certainty of our own work, persevere in promoting the construction of industrial projects, share enthusiasm and sweat, and ensure the successful conclusion of the "13th Five-Year Plan" and the building of a well-off society in an all-round way.

Cultivate new business forms and open up new spaces for employment-Chinanews.com
New employment methods continue to emerge, opening up new spaces for employment, and a number of innovative service policies have been introduced successively, helping new employment forms to thrive.
The latest data from the National Bureau of Statistics show that the unemployment rate in the national urban survey in June was 5.7%, a decrease of 0.2 percentage points from May.
This is also the two consecutive declines in the unemployment rate surveyed in cities and towns across the country since April. Behind the monthly decline in unemployment rate data are the new employment opportunities that continue to emerge in new business formats.
Now the salary of more than 5,000 a month, coupled with the freshness of embracing information technology, makes Guo Mei more and more motivated.
In the innovation incubation base of Shanxi Transformation and Comprehensive Reform Demonstration Zone, there are more than 2,300 data annotators.
Not only data annotators, but since this year, the country has also defined 25 occupations such as nucleic acid testers and online learning service providers as new occupations, developed vocational skills standards, and launched skills training programs to support the development of practitioners.
In response to new employment methods and new entrepreneurial paths, the country is also innovating employment services.
Recently, 13 departments including the National Development and Reform Commission jointly issued the "Opinions on Supporting the Healthy Development of New Business Forms and New Models, Activating the Consumer Market and Promoting Employment Expansion" to provide workers with diverse employment opportunities.
Multiple departments will jointly cultivate new individuals in the market and further reduce the cost of online entrepreneurship and employment for self-employed operators; make new business operators more secure, and policies such as rights protection and social security for flexible employment will be introduced one after another.

The overall stability of employment and prices shows that the economy has a "temperature" - Chinanews.com

The overall stability of employment and prices shows that the economy has a "temperature"
Economic Daily, China Economic Net Reporter Lin Yancan
In the first half of this year, in the face of the impact of the new crown pneumonia epidemic, my country coordinated efforts to promote epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development. The epidemic prevention and control situation has continued to improve, the economy has steadily recovered, the performance of employment and prices that are closely related to the people's livelihood has been generally stable, and the Chinese economy has handed over a report card of economic performance with temperature.
In the first two months of this year, the surveyed unemployment rate has increased.
Especially in February, the production and operation activities of many enterprises were basically in a state of shutdown. The demand for employment by enterprises decreased, recruitment was delayed or cancelled, and the surveyed unemployment rate in cities and towns increased.
With the gradual improvement of the epidemic prevention and control situation, the production and life order of the whole society has been continuously restored.
The Party Central Committee adheres to the general tone of seeking progress while maintaining stability, further strengthens the macro-policy countermeasure, comprehensively strengthens the employment priority policy, and actively promotes the work of assisting enterprises to stabilize jobs and expand employment.
My country has stepped up its policies to stabilize jobs, hit the "reduction, exemption, delay, return and compensation" policy combination, phased reduction and exemption of three social insurance unit contributions, allowing deferred payment of social insurance premiums, expanding the unemployment insurance for small, medium and micro enterprises to stabilize the return of jobs, and benefiting from the training policy with workers, and giving enterprises absorption subsidies and trainee subsidies to absorb the employment of key groups.
With the implementation of various employment stabilization policies, the demand for employment by enterprises has steadily rebounded, the employment situation has gradually improved, and the surveyed unemployment rate in urban areas has gradually decreased. In June, the surveyed unemployment rate was 5.7%.
Zhang Yi, director of the Population and Employment Statistics Department of the National Bureau of Statistics, said that in the second quarter, various employment policies continued to be effective, and the labor force who withdrew due to the impact of the epidemic in the previous period returned one after another. The urban labor participation rate in June increased by about 10 percentage points compared with February, close to the same period last year.
Data show that the total urban employment in June increased by more than 19% compared with February, and most industries reached the pre-epidemic level; the average weekly working hours of corporate employees reached 46.8 hours, an increase of 6.6 hours from February and a slight increase of 0.1 hours from January.
Prices are also related to thousands of households.
In January this year, the CPI rose by 5.4% year-on-year, setting a new high for many years.
Entering February, although the year-on-year increase of CPI fell slightly, it was still in the "5 range."
The year-on-year increase in CPI is at a high level, due to factors driving consumer demand before the Spring Festival, as well as factors such as the wrong month of the Spring Festival and a low year-on-year base.
However, the impact of the new crown pneumonia epidemic on prices is particularly obvious.
Affected by the prevention and control of the epidemic, in January and February there were delays in logistics, untimely supply of materials, and increased transportation costs of materials across the country. In addition, some citizens hoarded and rushed to buy, and the prices of some daily necessities increased significantly.
In response to the disturbance caused by the epidemic prevention and control to the price situation, relevant departments have included important living materials in the scope of emergency transportation guarantee to ensure smooth transportation of materials.
Under the action of a series of policy measures, the market supply of vegetables and fruits has been strongly guaranteed.
In response to the rapid rise in pork prices at the beginning of this year, after the central government promulgated the policy of ensuring supply and stabilizing prices, various regions and departments quickly implemented it. The supply of pork reserves has improved significantly, the production capacity of live pigs has been restored in an orderly manner, and the order of production and distribution has gradually become normal.
Since March, pork prices have continued to decline. In May, the year-on-year increase in food prices fell to 10.6%. In June, affected by factors such as the slowdown in the release of live pigs, the decrease in imports, and the rebound in group consumption demand, pork prices rose slightly.
The seasonal variation of fresh vegetable prices is obvious, with an average increase of 3.4% in the first half of the year.
Affected by the high comparison base in the same period last year, the price of fresh fruits continued to decline year-on-year, with an average drop of 13.3% in the first half of the year.
The basic lives of the masses are effectively guaranteed, and the overall economic and social situation remains stable and orderly.
With the gradual recovery of transportation and logistics, various regions have increased their efforts to ensure supply, and the market supply and demand situation has improved.
Starting in March, the CPI ring fell for four consecutive months. The year-on-year increase also fell from 4.3% in March to 2.5% in June, and the overall price level returned to stability.
In the second half of the year, China's prices will continue to remain at a moderate level, and the overall inflationary pressure is not large, but it is still necessary to promote the restoration of production and living order under the premise of normalizing epidemic prevention and control.
Effectively respond to natural disasters such as floods and droughts in major agricultural production areas such as grain, fruits and vegetables, strengthen market supervision, and resolutely crack down on behaviors that disrupt market order such as hoarding and price hikes.

The British "Times" and "Sunday Times" serialized a new book titled "å¯" Find Freedom, which depicts the royal life of Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle.
But Reuters reported that Harry and Meghan have disassociated themselves from the book, saying that they did not accept the author's interview, nor did they provide any content.

As an artist, contact is very important to me.
Through my works of art, I try to clarify that human beings are not separated from nature but that everything is connected to each other.
I went to Antarctica for the first time about 10 years ago, and I saw an iceberg for the first time.
I am in awe.
My heart thumped quickly and my head was dizzy, trying to understand what this was in front of me.
The iceberg next to me surfaced almost 200 feet. I can only feel very strange that this is one snowflake covering another snowflake, formed year after year.
Icebergs are formed when they break away from a glacier or break away from an ice shelf.
Each iceberg has its own unique personality.
They interact with their surrounding environment and their situation in a distinct way.
Some icebergs refuse to compromise and persevere to the end, while others cannot bear to collapse under a surge of intense passion.
When you see icebergs, it's easy to think that they are all isolated, they are independent, separate and integrated, more like what we humans sometimes think of ourselves.
But the reality is much more than this.
As the iceberg melted, I breathed its ancient smell.
As the iceberg melts, it releases mineral-rich fresh water, which nourishes everything.
I set out to photograph these icebergs as if I was taking portraits of my ancestors, and learned that at these individual moments icebergs existed in that way but never existed like that again.
When they melt, this is by no means death; nor is it an end, but a continuation of the road to life.
Some of the icebergs I have photographed are very young-thousands of years old.
Some ice is more than 100,000 years old.
The last picture I want to show you is an iceberg I took on Kekertsuatsiak in Greenland.
This is a very rare opportunity for everyone to actually witness an iceberg rolling.
So this is as shown in the figure.
On the left you can see a small boat.
This is a boat about 15 feet.
I want you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and its deformation on the water surface.
Here you see it start to roll, the boat moves to the other side, and a man is standing there.
This is an average size Greenland iceberg.
It surfaced about 120 feet high or 40 meters high.
This video was shot in real time.
(Music) Like this iceberg, they show everyone different aspects of their personality.
Thank you.
(Applause)

China News Service, Qinghai, Hainan, July 26, title: "Huahai direct broadcast room" on the banks of Qinghai Lake: "Sweet" takes goods to help farmers increase income
Author Hu Guilong Pan Yujie
"The banks of Qinghai Lake in midsummer are full of golden flowers and thousands of bees flying. There is a high altitude, a large temperature difference between day and night, and little air pollution. Strong light breeds the most tenacious and generous bees, creating the characteristics of high activity, high protein, high nutritional value, low sugar and low fat of Qinghai royal jelly."
On the 26th, Zhang Jianxun, deputy director of the Industry and Information Administration of Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, said.
On the same day, the live delivery of bee products was held on the banks of Qinghai Lake. The China Bee Products Association and representatives of entrepreneurs and beekeepers gathered to promote Qinghai's characteristic bee products. A total of nearly 10,000 bottles of Qinghai Plateau royal jelly were sold online and offline, with a total of nearly 3.8 million yuan.
The picture shows beekeepers showing bee products on the spot.
It is reported that this live delivery event has facilitated the exchange and cooperation of "enterprise + beekeeper + grower" with the help of Beijing Houdeli Bee Industry Chain Network, Express Hand, Taobao and other well-known domestic bee product retail enterprises, live broadcasts, and e-commerce platforms, and continues to issue "Qinghai Plateau Spring Pulp Consumption Coupons" to consumers through online and offline channels. It is estimated that the company will make a total profit of nearly 5.28 million yuan throughout the year.
In this regard, Wu Na, president of Beijing Houdeli Bee Industry Co., Ltd. believes that it is "very worthwhile": "This move can expand the visibility of Qinghai Bee products, attract more consumers to understand and like non-natural bee products, and drive bee farmers to increase their income."
At present, the company has signed production cooperation strategic agreements with Qinghai Yunmei Bee Industry Co., Ltd. and Qinghai Huabao Bee Industry Co., Ltd. to jointly promote the rapid development of the local bee industry in Qinghai.
The picture shows the sea of rape flowers by the Qinghai Lake.
This spring, due to the need to set up road access barriers for epidemic prevention and control, the way for beekeepers to "chase flowers for honey" was blocked. Many bees died due to missing the flowering period and lack of food, and the income of beekeepers was severely affected.
"At the end of the year, beekeepers travel long distances from Yunnan and Sichuan all the way north to the northwest to follow the flowering period. They eat, sleep, and live without a fixed place, which is very hard.
As companies, we have a responsibility to help them. "
Wu Na said.
"Small bees are 'environmental scouts', and bees cannot survive in heavily polluted areas." Zhao Xiaochuan, executive vice president of the China Bee Products Association, introduced that bee pollination is an important link in the ecological chain and plays an irreplaceable role in protecting plant diversity and improving the ecological environment.
At the same time, bee pollination can increase crop yield and improve quality, especially in areas with wide planting and poor management conditions, the significance of pollination is greater.
Research data show that pollination can increase rapeseed production by 15% to 30%.
The picture shows Zhao Xiaochuan (right), executive vice president of the China Bee Products Association, promoting Qinghai bee products.
"The economic, ecological and social benefits created by bee pollination are far greater than the value of bee products themselves. The bee industry has great potential in human health, crop production, vegetation reproduction, and ecological protection, and people have always known little about this."
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
Today, the number of beekeepers is getting smaller and smaller. In addition to the beekeepers who have been traveling all year round, there are still many poor households with limited mobility who choose to use beehives to join the cooperative.
"The state has financial support, and we contact technical staff to help guide them. Beekeepers lack understanding and judgment of the market environment. To open a market, they also need the help and coordination of the government, enterprises, and industry associations."
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
"I hope you will pay more attention to and help beekeeping groups in the future", Wu Na said. "Our bee products are also screened and controlled in strict accordance with national standards to ensure quality and protect consumer rights and interests while helping beekeepers."
Affected by continuous rainfall, since July 22, the soil at the rear edge of the Zhongbao landslide in the Zhongtai Group, Liujing Village, Land Township, Wulong District, Chongqing, has cracked, causing a large area of slippage and deformation, completely blocking the Cang River, forming a barrier with a water level of 13 meters in front of the dam and an estimated storage capacity of about 550,000 cubic meters.
In order to ensure the safety of navigation, the Chongqing Maritime Department decided to implement temporary traffic control on the waters from Shipan to Guanyintan on the Yangtze River boundary.
According to the monitoring of the Chongqing Meteorological and Hydrological Department, since the 25th, moderate to heavy rains have been prevalent in the central, western and northeastern parts of Chongqing, with heavy rains in some areas and local heavy rains.
Fujiang Xiaoheba Station will have the highest water level on the evening of the 26th, and the highest water level is close to the warning water level.
In order to ensure the safety of navigation, the Chongqing Maritime Department decided to implement temporary traffic control on the waters from Shipan to Guanyintan on the Yangtze River boundary.
After the Chongqing Municipal Defense Office and meteorological, water conservancy, hydrology and other departments and units urgently discussed and judged, the Chongqing Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters decided to release the first-level early warning information for river floods and initiate the second-level emergency response for flood control.
The Chongqing Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters requires that Chongqing Jiangbei, Shapingba, Tongnan, Wulong and other districts and counties as well as relevant member units of the Chongqing Defense Bureau should pay close attention to the rain and water situation, especially the changes in the Yangtze River, Jialing River, and Wujiang River, analyze and judge in advance, issue early warnings, strengthen inspection duties, resolutely evacuate and transfer people in threatened areas, mobilize emergency rescue teams and materials in a timely manner, quickly and efficiently deal with disasters (risks), and avoid mass deaths and mass injuries.
Zheng Shixin, Minister Counselor of the Vietnamese Embassy in Laos, representatives of the Lao Vietnamese Buddhist Association, the Lao Vietnamese Federation, the Vientiane Provincial Government, and the Lao Veterans Association attended the memorial ceremony.
The memorial ceremony for the heroes was held in a solemn and solemn atmosphere, and representatives successively offered incense to the heroes to remember their great achievements and the special solidarity between Vietnam and Vietnam.
Minister Counsellor Zheng Shixin said in his speech that this is an opportunity for the old Vietnamese and Lao people to jointly remember the revolutionary heroes of the two countries and express gratitude to the heroes who sacrificed for the independence and freedom of the two countries. At the same time, it is also a good opportunity for the people of the two countries to look back at the two countries working side by side to fight against common enemies, strive for national independence, national reunification, jointly build national development, and consolidate relations between the two countries.
On January 23, 1946, 74 years ago, 28 soldiers of the Lao-Vietnam Combat Alliance died heroically while attacking the Phonehe stronghold.
The victory of this attack has become a historic victory for the two countries in the early stage of the revolutionary struggle for national liberation.
Ms. Zheng Shixin emphasized that the people of the two countries will always remember the heroes who sacrificed for the cause of the national liberation struggle of the two countries. At the same time, she emphasized that the young areas of the two countries will continue to carry forward the heroic and strong traditions of their predecessors and make due contributions to the continued flowering of Vietnam-Vietnam relations and the prosperity and development of the two countries.

Liu Yunlong, the old face of the spy drama, plays a stuttering actor-Xinhuanet
Produced by Liu Yunlong and directed by Yin Fei, and starring Liu Yunlong, Su Qing, Liang Guanhua, Li Liqun and others, the large-scale spy war drama "Winning" landed on Guangdong Satellite TV's "Dynamic Theater" at 7: 30 pm on July 16.
The play tells the story of Tang Fei (played by Liu Yunlong), an underground member of the Communist Party of China lurking in the Japanese-puppet police station, who teamed up with Soviet agents to assassinate the leader of the Japanese agent and smash the Japanese conspiracy.
"Winning Chance" is adapted from historical facts, and the material is taken from the dusty Soviet military archives for many years.
During the defense of Moscow, the Soviet Red Army's Far East elite advanced westward to help. At this time, the "Northern Movement" of the Japanese Guandong Army thought it was an opportunity and intended to send troops.
In order to relieve the danger of the enemy, the CCP and CPSU intelligence personnel jointly implemented the "Mudan Ula" plan.
According to this historical background, the well-known screenwriter Deng Yuan has been polished several times, making the plot twists and turns.
Liu Yunlong is both the producer and the leading actor in "Winning Chance" this time.
In the play, his role of Tang Fei is the chief of the Criminal Section of the Linhe Police Department. He is a stuttering policeman with a sense of joy and even a little ruffian. His real identity is an underground member of the Communist Party of China.
The heroine Cai Meng, who performed the opposite play, is the chief of the Linhe Security Bureau, and is appreciated by the Japanese boss Fukuhara. There is a subtle relationship with Tang Fei that is both enemy and friend, and ambiguous.
Su Qing has tried many different types of characters in recent years, from Lu Ruowen in "Those Years We Are Young" to Er Qing in "Yanxi Strategy", which left a deep impression on the audience and his acting skills were recognized.
This time Su Qing and Liu Yunlong are partners for the first time. The setting of stammering the sheriff with charming policewomen is quite interesting and innovative.
In addition to the two protagonists, there are many powerful actors such as Liang Guanhua, Li Liqun, Qian Bo, Lei Han, and Shen Junyi in "Winning Chance", and the old drama Bone Drama is also one of the highlights of the play.
It is understood that the production of "Winning Chance" is also very sophisticated, and the crew spans nearly 2,000 kilometers across Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Liaoning provinces.
In order to restore the bizarre city style of the Northeast Japanese occupation period, the crew's art and art team worked day and night to carefully polish every detail of the scene construction and props, making the scene in the play exquisite and full of historical texture.

The movie "Jedi Attack" takes Thailand as the main plot and takes "Thai boxing" as the starting point for the dream of the down-and-out boxing champion Venus. The whole story is based on the adaptation of traditional Chinese cultural values. Whether it is Venus's determination to fight fake punches for the master in the early stage, or his later efforts to regain his dignity with the support of friends and lovers, it shows the men's pursuit and great love for family and dreams in traditional Chinese culture.

In addition, the long-flowing love between Venus and Jingjing is also very touching. Jingjing's silent support for Venus and Venus' firm commitment to Jingjing have made the audience see the "Tiehan tenderness" on Venus, which has also added a lot of human touch to this down-and-out boxer.
Joint action by the four departments!

Green space opens a new round of mixed reform of Shanghai state-owned assets to transfer 17.5% of shares-Economic Watch-Professional Finance News website
Economic Observation Network reporter Rao Xianjun On July 26, Greenfield Holdings (600606.SH) issued the "suggestive notice that state-owned shareholders intend to transfer part of the company's shares and resume trading through public solicitation of transferees."
The content of the announcement shows that in order to further deepen the reform of state-owned assets and state-owned enterprises, optimize the structural adjustment of state-owned assets, and improve the equity structure of Greenland, Shanghai Real Estate (Group) Co., Ltd. (Hereinafter referred to as "Shanghai Real Estate") and Shanghai Urban Investment (Group) Co., Ltd. (Hereinafter referred to as "Shanghai Urban Investment") intend to transfer some of the shares held by the company through public solicitation of transferees. The proportion of shares to be transferred shall not exceed 17.5% of the total equity of Greenland.
The price of the shares to be transferred this time shall not be lower than the higher of the following two: The arithmetic average of the daily weighted average price for the 30 trading days before the indicative announcement date (July 27, 2020); and the company's audited net asset value per share in the most recent fiscal year.
At present, the new strategic investor in Greenland is still inconclusive. According to the announcement, it is estimated that the new strategic investor will need to pay about 14 billion yuan to win the 17.5% equity transferred in this mixed reform of Greenland.
It is worth noting that after the completion of this share transfer, it is expected that Greenland will still have no controlling shareholders and actual controllers, but the control structure may undergo major changes.
Since its establishment, Greenfield Holdings has carried out many institutional and mechanism reforms: From 1992 to 1997, it operated in accordance with market-oriented rules under a purely state-owned system; from 1997 to 2013, it established and continuously improved the shareholding system of state-owned holding and employee shareholding; from 2013 to 2015, it introduced strategic investors to form a mixed ownership system of cross-shareholding and mutual integration of state-owned and non-public capital; since 2015, it has been listed as a whole and has become a public company.
The current mixed reform plan of Greenland is similar to Gree. In December 2019, Hillhouse Capital led Zhuhai Mingjun to take over 15% of Gree Electric (000651.SZ) with 41.662 billion yuan. Gree Group retired as a minority shareholder. After completing the mixed reform, Gree Electric implemented modern corporate management methods such as an executive incentive plan and no actual control structure.
Shanghai Real Estate and Shanghai Urban Investment are both state-owned enterprise groups wholly owned by the Shanghai SASAC. Zhang Yuliang, chairman and president of Greenfield Holdings, said that Greenland's move is an important measure taken by Shanghai to promote the comprehensive reform of state-owned state-owned enterprises and accelerate the new phase of state-owned state-owned enterprise reform in accordance with the requirements of the Party Central Committee. It fully demonstrates the new ideas of reform adapted to local conditions and tailored to local conditions. By introducing new outstanding strategic shareholders to listed companies, it supports enterprises to further improve the degree of marketization, enhance the freedom of operation and management, and accelerate the full release of reform vitality.
Inter-provincial travel resumes the first inter-provincial car travel train in the country-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, July 25 (Reporter Li Ping) At 12: 20 on July 25, more than 200 Shanghai tourists who took the D771 train successfully arrived in Lanxi City, Zhejiang Province. This is also the first inter-provincial train tour in the country since the Ministry of Culture and Tourism resumed inter-provincial (district, city) team tours on July 14.
Lanxi City, located in the central and western part of Zhejiang, has beautiful scenery. There are many scenic spots such as Zhuge Bagua Village, Underground Changhe, Zhiyan Ancient Village, etc. During the two-day and one-night itinerary, more than 200 Shanghai tourists will appreciate these attractions one by one.
Li Li, deputy general manager of Shanghai Railway International Tourism (Group) Co., Ltd., said that according to the latest policy, the company pays close attention to the needs of inter-provincial travel, communicates with Lanxi City as soon as possible, and carefully launches the "Shanghai to Lanxi" and "Summer Honor Tour" products. The product was sold out in less than a week after its launch.
Aunt Sun from Shanghai said that because of the epidemic, she has not gone out this year.
"I have been bored at home for a long time. As soon as I saw a group tour, I immediately shared the news with my friends to sign up. I have never been to Lanxi before and I look forward to this trip very much", said Aunt Sun.
It is understood that in September last year, Lanxi City and Shanghai Railway International Tourism (Group) Co., Ltd. signed a strategic cooperation agreement for the "High-speed Rail Tour Lanxi" project, which plans to open 12 high-speed rail tourism trains from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai and Anhui to Lanxi in one year.

Us White House consultant "anti-bite" states resume work prematurely-Chinanews.com
Us White House consultants "anti-bite" states resume work too early
On July 23, local time, the number of confirmed cases of new coronary pneumonia in the United States exceeded 4 million, accounting for 30% of global cases.
Over the past few months, US President Trump has repeatedly asked all states across the country to resume work and school. It was only recently that he changed his attitude and took the initiative to wear masks in public, and his advisers "bite back" saying that some state governments resumed work too early.
On the 22nd, White House presidential adviser Killian Conway said at a press conference that some state governments did not comply with resumption standards and restarted places such as bars prematurely.
Conway also mentioned that the previous statement that the president has "absolute power" to decide on the resumption of work in the states is a false rumor.
"The president is a federalist, and he believes that all states have autonomy."
She defended Trump.
However, the "rumor" in Conway's mouth was personally spoken by Trump at the White House epidemic briefing on April 13.
This self-defeating operation was ridiculed by netizens as "rewriting history."
Killian Conway wants to rewrite history. She is a liar.
Trump called Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer a dictator because she followed medical guidelines and insisted on stopping work.
Trump wants to promote the resumption of work so that he can hold a rally.
This is not the first time Kylian Conway has caused controversy.
On April 15, Conway blurted out in an interview with Fox News: "This is COVID-19, not COVID-1, friends!"
She seemed to understand "19" as a version number, which was wildly ridiculed by netizens: Read the newspaper without common sense!
Recently, we have seen the impact of cyber attacks on the business world.
Data leaks from companies such as JPMorgan Chase, Yahoo, Home Depot, and Target have caused hundreds of millions of dollars, or even billions of dollars, in losses.
With a few more such attacks, the entire world economy will collapse.
The public sphere is not immune.
From 2012 to 2014, there were very serious data leaks in the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.
Security clearance and fingerprint information were stolen, affecting 22 million employees.
You may have also heard that some government-sponsored hackers try to use stolen data to influence the results of general elections in some countries.
The two most recent incidents were the theft of large-scale data from the German Bundestag and the theft of e-mails from the Democratic National Committee of the United States.
Cyber threats have affected our democratic process.
And there is a growing trend.
The more developed computer technology is, the more fragile the means we use to protect data.
Especially a new computer technology, called quantum computer, which uses microscopic particles in nature to greatly increase the computing power of computers.
Its computing power is so powerful that it can crack many of the encryption systems we use today.
So are we hopeless?
Should we start packing up electronic survival equipment to welcome the coming data doomsday?
I think it's not there yet.
Quantum computers still exist only in the laboratory, and it will take several years before they are actually used.
More importantly, there have been many major breakthroughs in the encryption field.
For me, this is a very exciting era in the history of secure communications.
About 15 years ago, I learned that we have unlocked new skills that can create quantum effects that do not exist in nature. I am very excited.
The idea of using the basic laws of physics to advance the development of encryption technology excites me.
Today, some selected companies and laboratories, including mine, have advanced this technology to the stage of practical application.
That's right.
We intend to use quantum to fight quantum.
How to achieve it?
First, let's take a quick look at the world of encryption.
You need a briefcase. You have some important documents to give to your good friend, James Bond, and lock it up to ensure safety.
Because these materials are top secret, we want to use a super-advanced briefcase.
It is equipped with a special password lock, once locked, the content of the file will be converted into random numbers.
So you just put the file in and lock it, and at this time the file has been converted to a random number, and you give this briefcase to James.
When the briefcase has not been delivered, you call and tell him the password.
Once he got the briefcase, entered the password, and the file was deciphered, it was perfect, and you successfully passed an encrypted message to James Bond.
(Laughter) A fun example, but it illustrates the 3 key points of encryption.
Password-we call it an encryption key.
You can think of it as a password.
The phone call that told James the code.
We call it secret key transfer.
This ensures that we can safely deliver the secret key to the designated location.
And the lock used to encrypt and decrypt files.
We call it an encryption algorithm.
Through the secret key, it converts the contents of the file into random numbers.
A good algorithm can do this, and it is difficult to crack the password without the secret key.
The importance of the algorithm is that if someone gets a briefcase and opens it, without the secret key, and without knowing the encryption algorithm, the content in the document cannot be read.
All you get is some random numbers.
Most security systems rely on a secure key transfer method to deliver the secret key to the right place.
However, the rapidly growing computing power endangers many of the secret key delivery methods we currently use.
To give an example, we now use a very wide range of systems-RSA.
When it was invented in 1977, it took about 4 trillion years to crack a 426-bit RSA secret key.
In 1994, only 17 years later, the code was cracked.
As computer performance gets stronger and stronger, the passwords we need are getting longer and longer.
Now we often use 2048 or 4096-bit passwords.
As you can see, the battle between the encryptor and the decryptor is going on, and both want to defeat each other.
In the next 10 to 15 years, the arrival of quantum computers will crack complex mathematical algorithms more quickly. These algorithms are the basis of the encryption system we use today.
In fact, quantum computers will turn our security castle into a one-touch house of cards.
We must try to protect our castle.
In recent years, many research institutions have emerged to study how to use quantum effects to enhance encryption.
People have made some exciting breakthroughs.
Remember the 3 key points of encryption? High-quality secret keys, secure secret key transfer, and strong algorithms.
However, advances in science and engineering have jeopardized two of the key points.
The first to bear the brunt is the secret key.
Random numbers are the basis of the secret key.
But today, they are no longer truly random.
The secret key we generate is generated by software based on the frequency of random numbers, which we call pseudo-random numbers.
There will always be some numbers generated by programs or mathematical methods, and perhaps not so obvious rules in them.
The lower the randomness of these numbers, or, in terminology, the lower the moisture content, the easier they are to predict.
Recently, some casinos have been attacked, and the method of attack is very creative.
They aimed at the slot machine and filmed for a period of time, and then analyzed it.
Cyber criminals use reverse engineering to create a pseudo-random number generator behind the turntable.
In this way, they have a good chance of predicting the rotation of the turntable and making a lot of money.
The secret key is also insecure.
Having a real random number generator is important for generating secure passwords.
For several years, researchers have been trying to create a real random number generator.
But most designs are either not random enough, fast enough, or difficult to reuse.
But the quantum world is truly random.
It is very important to take advantage of this true randomness.
A device capable of measuring quantum effects can generate a continuous stream of random numbers very quickly.
The casino crime just mentioned is no longer possible.
Several universities and companies from all over the world are focusing on making real random number generators.
In my company, our quantum random number generator was born from an optical table 2 meters long and 1 meter wide.
Then we reduced it to the size of a box.
Today, it can be installed on a PCI card and plugged into an ordinary computer.
This is the fastest, truly random number generator in the world.
It can generate 1 billion random numbers per second by measuring quantum effects.
Today it has been widely used all over the world to improve the security of cloud service providers, banks and government agencies.
(Applause) But even with a real random number generator, we still face the second major cyber security threat: The secure transmission of secret keys.
The current secret key transmission technology cannot fight against quantum computers.
The quantum solution to this problem is called quantum key distribution, or QKD for short, which uses a fundamental counterintuitive feature of quantum mechanics.
Observing the behavior of microscopic particles will change this particle.
Let me give an example to illustrate.
Let's think about it again, and give the password to James Bond.
But this time, we don't call him. We use the quantum effect to carry this code with a laser beam and pass it to James through an ordinary optical fiber.
We assume that Dr. Nou wants to get this password.
Fortunately, Dr. Nou will leave an electronic fingerprint in the process of trying to intercept this quantum key, which James and you can detect.
In this way, the intercepted key will be invalidated.
The remaining secret key can provide strong protection for the data.
Because this security mechanism is based on the basic principles of physics, no quantum computer, or any supercomputer in the future, can crack it.
My team and I are working with many top universities and defense departments to improve this exciting technology and develop the next generation of security products.
The Internet of Things heralds the advent of a highly interconnected era, and it is estimated that 25-30 billion devices will be connected to the Internet by 2020.
If our society is to function properly in the world of the Internet of Things, then trust in these interconnected device systems is crucial.
We believe that quantum technology will be very important for building this kind of trust. It will ensure that we fully enjoy these magical innovations and enjoy these innovations that can enrich our lives.
Thank you all.

The 3-year-old child's college playground was smashed, is it reasonable to sue the school after compensation?
2020-07-2605: 01: 11 Source: Legal Daily Author: Wang Sishuo Responsible Editor: Wang Sishuo
The playground was smashed, and the child was compensated before suing the school.
□ our correspondent Zhao Yifan
When 3-year-old Xiaowen was playing on the playground of a certain university, he was accidentally hit in the head by Chen of the softball team while pitching.
After Chen paid compensation, Xiaowen's father, Mr. Wen, as Xiaowen's legal representative, sued the school to the court, demanding that the school where the playground was located apologize and pay a total of 20,000 yuan for medical expenses and moral damages.
Recently, after hearing the case, the Haidian District People's Court of Beijing held that the school had set up a protective net on the playground at the time of the incident, and had fulfilled its proper safety guarantee obligations, and Chen had paid compensation, based on which the judgment rejected the plaintiff's claim.
Mr. Wen claimed that during the summer vacation of 2019, he took Xiaowen to play on the school playground, when the softball team was training on the playground.
In order to avoid the risks posed by this, Xiaowen, Mr. Wen and many other children and parents are active in the safe area designated by the softball team.
But then the softball team member Chen dropped his hand while pitching, causing the softball to fly over the guard net into the above-mentioned safe area and hit Xiaowen in the back of the head.
Mr. Wen immediately took Xiaowen to the hospital for treatment and was diagnosed with head trauma.
Mr. Wen believes that the facilities of the school stadium do not comply with relevant safety regulations, and the team and related facilities have not been effectively managed.
The school's negligence led to the above-mentioned incident, which caused Xiaowen to suffer great physical and mental pain, and also brought greater pain to his family. The school should bear legal responsibility for this.
In response, the school argued that the school had set up a protective net on the playground, and posted management regulations and training notices, informing them that entering the playground must maintain a safe distance from the training site and reminding them of their own safety. The plaintiff could not prove that the school "failed to meet its safety guarantee obligations" and therefore did not agree to compensation.
After the trial, the court held that the site of the incident was a site open to the public free of charge by the university involved. Although the school has a safety guarantee obligation for the management of the playground, this safety guarantee obligation only needs to meet the general duty of care.
At the time of the incident, the school set up a protective net on the playground, and it has fulfilled its proper safety guarantee obligations, and Chen also compensated Xiaowen for more than 2,000 yuan for various losses such as medical expenses and transportation costs in accordance with the previously reached compensation agreement. The two parties agreed to settle this dispute at one time.
Afterwards, Xiaowen's parents again claimed compensation from the school. There was no basis in the law, and the court ruled that all the plaintiff's claims were rejected.
After the verdict was pronounced, neither party appealed, and the judgment is now in effect.
According to Article 37 of my country's Tort Liability Law, schools, as managers of public places, have the obligation to ensure safety; in the case of damage caused by the actions of a third party, the third party bears tort liability, and the manager of a public place who fails to fulfill the obligation of safety guarantee should bear corresponding supplementary responsibilities.
The judge stated that as the administrator of a public place, he is most likely to understand the actual situation of the entire place and foresee possible dangers and damages, so that he is most likely to take necessary measures to prevent the occurrence of losses or reduce the extent of damage, and the cost of avoiding and mitigating damage is the lowest, so the law stipulates that it shall bear the corresponding guarantee obligations for engaging in social activities.
In this case, for unspecified people entering the playground, which is open to the public free of charge, the school's safety guarantee obligations should be compatible with the social activities it engages in. Specifically, it should take basic safety measures and have an obligation to inform about hidden dangers.
In judicial practice, it is not appropriate to impose excessive safety guarantee obligations on managers of public places.
If the school has set up a protective net and fulfilled its obligation to inform, it can be determined that the school is not at fault and should not bear legal liability.
In addition, for third-party infringement, even if the manager of a public place such as a school fails to fulfill his safety guarantee obligations, his liability is as a supplement to compensation for damages. According to the newly promulgated Civil Code, after the administrator assumes supplementary responsibilities, he can also recover from a third party.
Therefore, in such accidents, the victim should not expand the scope of the claim after he has received compensation from the direct infringer.
Today I want to show you the way we make things in the future.
I believe that soon our buildings and machines will be able to assemble themselves, replicate themselves, and repair themselves.
So I want to show you what I think is the current state of the manufacturing industry, and then compare it with some natural systems.
So in the current manufacturing industry, we have skyscrapers-in two and a half years, 500,000 to millions of parts, very complex, using new technologies in steel, concrete and glass.
We have exciting machines that can take us into space-2.5 million parts in five years.
But on the other hand, if we look at the natural system, we have two million types of proteins that can be folded in ten thousand nanoseconds, and we can replicate DNA with three billion base pairs in about an hour.
This is the complexity of our natural systems, but they are very efficient, more efficient than anything we build, and more complex than anything we can build.
They are more energy efficient.
They rarely make mistakes.
They can repair themselves and maintain a long life.
There is a super interesting thing about natural systems.
If we can convert it into our built environment, then the way we build things will have great potential.
I think the key is self-assembly.
If we want to use self-assembly in our own physical environment, I think there are four key factors.
The first is that we want to decode all the complexity of what we want to build-that is, our buildings and machines.
We need to decode them into simple sequences-basically the DNA of our building operations.
Then we need a programmable part that can accept this sequence and be used for folding or reshaping.
We need some energy to activate so that these parts of us can be folded in accordance with the program.
We need some types of error correction redundancy to ensure that what we successfully build is what we want.
So, I want to show you some of the projects that my colleagues and I are working on to realize this self-assembled future.
The first two projects are MacroBot and DeciBot.
These projects are large-scale reconfigurable robots-8 feet, 12 feet long protein.
They are embedded in electromechanical equipment, sensors.
You need to decode the way you want to fold into, decode into a series of angles - minus 120 degrees, minus 120 degrees, 0 degrees, 0 degrees, 120 degrees, minus 120 degrees, - things like this; a series of angles, or turns, can be transmitted by wire.
Each unit gets its own message-for example, minus 120. It rotates, checks whether the rotation is in place, and then passes the sequence to its neighbor.
There are many outstanding scientists, engineers, and designers working on this project.
I think this project really reveals: Is this really scalable?
I mean, it cost thousands of dollars and many people to make this eight-foot robot.
Can we really expand it? Can we really embed robots in every part?
The next question is to look at passivity, or passively try to make reorganization programmable.
But it goes one step further, it tries to make actual calculations.
Basically embedded in the basic construction module of most calculations, the digital logic gate, directly into each part.
This is different from the gate.
There is a tetrahedron on each gate to be used for calculation, and there are two input tetrahedrons.
One of them is input from the user, just like you are building a brick.
The other is the input of a brick placed before coming.
Then it will give the output of three-dimensional space.
This means that users pile up bricks the way they want.
It calculates based on what you have done before and your instructions.
Now it starts to move in three-dimensional space-up or down.
Looking at the left, the input of [1,1] is equal to 0 output, which means downward.
On the right, the input of [0,0] is 1 output, which means upward.
So what this really means is that our structure now contains the blueprint we want to build.
So the information about what you want to build is all embedded in it.
This means that we have some form of self-replication.
In this case, I call it self-directed replication, because your structure contains precise blueprints.
If you encounter an error, you can replace a part.
All local information is embedded in it, telling you how to fix it.
So you have something to climb, you can read it and output one by one.
It is directly embedded; there is no external instruction input.
The last project I want to show is called the eccentric chain, which may be the most exciting example of the passive self-assembly system we see now.
Its reconfigurability and programmability make it a completely passive system.
Basically, you have a series of elements.
Every element is exactly the same, and they are eccentric.
Each chain, or each element, wants to turn right or turn left.
If you want to assemble a chain, you need to program it.
Tell each unit whether to turn left or right.
When you shake this chain, it folds up and programs any structure that you encode for it-so in this case, a spiral, in the case of fire, two connected cubes.
Basically you can program in three-dimensional space-or one-dimensional, two-dimensional-this chain is completely passive.
What kind of future does this herald for us?
I think this tells us about this possibility of self-assembly, self-replication, and self-repair in our body structure, our buildings, and machines.
There is new programmability in these parts.
From this you can get new possibilities for calculation.
We will have room to calculate.
Imagine our buildings, bridges, machines, all bricks can be actually calculated.
What an amazing parallel computing and distributed computing power and new design possibilities.
This is an exciting potential.
I think these projects I show you are just a small step towards the future, if we realize these new technologies for a new self-assembled world.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Under the normalization of epidemic prevention and control, people's enthusiasm for sports and fitness is high.
With the gradual liberalization of inter-provincial tourism business, the tourism market is also about to usher in a recovery.
Fujian Province resumed its inter-provincial tourism business from July 21. On the first weekend after opening, Xiamen, a popular tourist destination, ushered in the peak of passenger flow.
As a popular tourist destination city, there are many tourists who arrive in Xiamen on weekends.
Xiamen Railway Station expects that the summer transportation will send 3.7 million passengers, and the airport passenger flow is dominated by students, tourists, and visiting relatives.
The tourism market has gradually picked up. In July, Xiamen Airport operated an average of 440 flights a day, and domestic flights have recovered to 80% of the pre-epidemic level.
The airline encrypted the air express lines from Xiamen to Shanghai, Beijing, Kunming, Xi'an and other major cities to seize the recovered tourism market.
At present, many travel agencies in Xiamen have successively launched a batch of summer domestic inter-provincial tour products, and the team itinerary is mainly based on outdoor attractions.
In response to the summer passenger peak in railway stations and airports, relevant units have deployed additional manpower in areas where people tend to gather, such as check-in counters and security channels. Fujian has also optimized and upgraded the "Eight Fujian Health Code", which has achieved health data sharing and mutual recognition with 31 provinces, and promoted the orderly recovery of the tourism market.
Can Andy Lau Qingyun "tear down" new sparks-Xinhuanet
"Bomb Disposal Expert 2" recently announced that it will be released on December 24, becoming the first fixed movie for the New Year.
The second part is still directed by Qiu Litao, produced and starred by Andy Lau, and launched with a brand-new story.
It is reported that the addition of the "nuclear bomb" element in the second part also makes the challenge faced by the bomb disposal experts more difficult. The few startling shots in the forecast have made people hang on the line. The mushroom cloud of the big bang, the airport engulfed by the fire, the scene is quite shocking.
Three years ago, "Bomb Disposal Expert", produced by the original team, won the 51 box office champion of that year, and won 7 nominations at the Hong Kong Film Awards. Qiu Litao × Andy Lau also became the audience's gold medal partner.
This time, "Bomb Disposal Expert 2" also makes people look forward to whether this pair of ace combinations can spark new sparks.
"Bomb Disposal Expert 2" tells a whole new story: Pan Zhengfeng (Andy Lau), a former bomb disposal expert, fainted at the scene of the bombing and was listed as a suspect by the police.
In order to find the truth, he had to ask his friend Dong Zhuowen (Liu Qingyun), who is also a bomb disposal expert, for help.
The female inspector eager to solve the case, Pang Ling (Ni Ni), who is also Pan's ex-girlfriend, was also involved.
He is still a bomb disposal expert, but he can feel the complexity of Andy Lau's new role from the trailer: He broke a leg, put on a prosthetic limb, and was chased by Liu Qingyun, who is also a bomb disposal expert, while being directed by his ex-girlfriend Ni Ni.
What kind of relationship is the three, what exactly did Andy Lau do at the Xiangdao Hotel, what kind of cases he was involved in, what twists and turns he has experienced in his career as a bomb disposal expert, and various mysteries make people curious.
It is understood that the highlight of the film is the field viewing of Hong Kong's world landmark buildings, coupled with the top special effects production team, to bring a shocking and realistic visual impact.

In order to avoid the spread of the new crown virus, only local residents and special guests can enter Kronstadt during this year's naval parade.
The last Sunday of July every year is Russian Navy Day.
Yang Honggnian, founder of the Beijing Philharmonic Chorus, died at the age of 86-Chinanews.com
Beijing News (Reporter Liu Zhen) On July 26, the Beijing Philharmonic Chorus issued an obituary. The founder of the Beijing Philharmonic Chorus, a well-known Chinese conductor and music educator, and Yang Honggnian, a lifelong academic member of the Central Conservatory of Music and professor of the Command Department, died in Beijing at 13: 55 on July 26, 2020 at the age of 86.
The picture comes from the official website of the Beijing Philharmonic Chorus.
Yang HongNian was born in 1934, a native of Nanjing, Jiangsu, and has loved music since childhood.
In 1951, he was the conductor of the chorus of Nanjing People's Radio Station. In the autumn of 1951, he was admitted to the Music Department of Shanghai East China Normal University. He studied and directed from Professor Yang Jiaren and German conductor Hitzman, and former Soviet expert Arzamanov learned musical styles and polyphonic tunes.
Taught in the Music Department of Beijing Art Normal College in 1958, and transferred to the Composition Department and Command Department of the Central Conservatory of Music in 1973.
Yang Honggnian founded the Beijing Philharmonic Chorus in 1983.
For more than 30 years, he has led this choir to sing all over the world with the tenet of "love and dedication", and has won dozens of awards in important competitions at home and abroad.
He has directed the performances of more than 30 groups such as the Central Orchestra Chorus, the Central National Song and Dance Troupe, the Oriental Song and Dance Troupe, and the Shanghai Chorus, and held many symphony concerts and chorus concerts.
Books include "Orchestra Training", "Chorus Training", "Two Songs Writing", "Children's Songs" (upper and lower volumes) and essays "On Chorus Phonetic Issues", "On the Sound Hierarchy Layout of Orchestral Music", as well as translations of "Chorus Accessories Law" and "Debussy's Harmony Language."
Do you know how many flowering plants there are?
There are 250,000 species-at least as many as we know-250,000 flowering plants.
And flowers are a nuisance.
It is really difficult to breed plants.
It requires a lot of experience and many resources.
Why is it so troubled?
Of course, the answer is, like many other things in the world, gender.
I know what you think when you look at these pictures.
The reason why sexual reproduction is so important - plants have many other ways to reproduce.
It can be cut; it can reproduce with the same plant; it can be pollinated with the same plant.
But they do need to spread their genes to mix with other genes so that they can be ecological.
This is how evolution works.
Now the way plants transmit this information is through pollen.
Some of you may have seen these pictures before.
As I said, every family should have a scanning electron microscope that can see these.
There are as many different types of pollen as there are flowering plants.
This is actually quite useful for forensic medicine and so on.
Most of the pollen that causes us to get pollen fever comes from plants that use the wind to spread pollen. This is a very inefficient process, which is why pollen always runs into our noses.
Because most of them have been discarded, it is hoped that the germ cells contained in the pollen, the male germ cells, will happen to fall on another flower.
All grasses, which means all grains, and most trees rely on the wind to spread pollen.
But most species actually use insects to complete this process. To some extent, this is smarter, because it doesn't require too much pollen.
Insects and other species can carry pollen and transfer pollen directly to where it is needed.
Obviously, we have noticed the relationship between insects and plants.
This is a symbiotic relationship. Whether it is a bird or a bee, they can get rewards, usually nectar.
Sometimes this symbiotic relationship can lead to wonderful adaptive changes-the red skirt moth is a beautiful adaptive change.
Plants are also harvested, and Tian'e spread the pollen elsewhere.
Plants have evolved, creating landing tracks everywhere, and bees may get lost in them.
There are some markings on many plants that look like other insects.
These are the pollen sacs of lilies, very ingenious, so when an unwitting insect falls on it, the pollen sac turns over and hits the insect's back with a lot of pollen, so that it can follow insects to other plants.
There is an orchid that looks like it has a jaw. To some extent, it does; it forces insects to crawl over, get pollen, and take pollen elsewhere.
Orchid: There are at least 20,000 species of orchids-a variety of amazing.
They have all kinds of tricks.
They must try and attract pollinators to help them complete this process.
This orchid is called Darwin's orchid because it was studied by Darwin and gave a wonderful prediction when he saw this orchid. You can see that there is a long nectar tube hanging from the orchid.
Basically what the insect has to do is - we come to the middle of the flower - it pierces the mouthparts into the middle part all the way down to know the nectar tube to get the nectar.
Darwin said, look at this flower, "I guess some things have evolved with it."
There is no doubt that it is insects.
When I mean, it is usually rolled up, but when it is straightened, it looks like this.
Now imagine that if such a valuable thing as nectar is expensive for plants to produce and can attract many pollinators, then, as in human sexuality, people may start to deceive each other.
They might say, "I have some nectar. Would you like to get some?"
This is a plant.
This plant is loved by insects in South Africa. They have evolved long mouthparts to get the nectar at the bottom.
This is an imitator.
This plant is imitating the previous plant.
There is a fly with a long mouthpart that does not get any nectar from the counterfeit. Because the counterfeit did not give it any nectar. It thought it could get it.
Therefore, not only did the flies not get the nectar from the fake plant, but also - if you look very closely at the top of the head, you will see some pollen there. These pollen will be spread to other plants, if no botanist comes to stick it to a blue card.
(Laughter) This kind of lie is all over the plant kingdom.
This flower with black spots: They may look like black spots to us, but I tell you that for male insects of the appropriate species, this looks like two very, very sexy females.
(Laughter) When the insect arrives and lands on it, immerse itself in pollen. Of course, these pollen will be taken by it to other plants. If you look at the scanning electron microscope image that every family should have, you can see that there are actually some patterns there, three-dimensional patterns.
It can even make insects feel comfortable and look good.
These electron microscope images - this is an orchid disguised as an insect - you can see that for our eyes, different parts of the structure have different colors and different textures, and insects may be able to perceive very, very different textures.
This orchid has evolved to mimic the metallic glossy surface seen on some beetles.
You can see this surface under a scanning electron microscope-this is very different from other surfaces we have seen.
Sometimes the whole plant will imitate an insect, even if we look like an insect.
I mean, I think this looks like some kind of flying animal or beast.
It is a wonderful and magical thing.
This is its cleverness. It is called obsidian.
I think it is sometimes cunning.
For a suitable kind of bee, this looks like another very aggressive bee. It will fly over and hit it with its head many, many times, trying to drive it away. Of course, this will make it stained with pollen.
Another thing it does is that this plant imitates another orchid that is rich in food that insects love.
But in fact there is nothing.
So it deceives on two levels-it's incredible.
(Laughter) What we see is Yilan, the part with a strong fragrance.
I actually smelled it before.
These flowers actually don't have to be so gorgeous.
They emit a wonderful fragrance to attract any interested insects.
This flower doesn't smell very good.
This flower actually smells very unpleasant to mention again, this is an evolution, it looks like carrion.
So flies like it.
Flies fly in and pollinate them.
This is the White Star Alocasia, also known as the Dead Horse Alocasia.
I don't know what the dead horse smells like, but this flower may smell very similar.
It's really terrible.
The green-headed fly cannot help it.
Fly into it, fly into it all the way.
Lay eggs on it, thinking that this is a very good piece of carrion. I didn't realize that there was no food for eggs here, and these eggs would die here, but at the same time this plant would benefit, because the bristles loosened the flies and disappeared, and pollinated to another flower-it was amazing.
This is the Alocasia plant, Alocasia, variegated Aroma, which is known as elongated grass in this country.
I shot this in Dorset last week.
This guy heats up about 15 degrees higher than the ambient temperature-incredible.
If you look inside it, behind the ears of meat is something a bit like a dam, and flies are attracted by heat-this is a boiling volatile chemical, small insects-they are trapped under this container.
They drank the sweet nectar and then all became a little slimy.
At night they were covered with pollen, sprayed down from them, and then the hard hairs we saw above became withered, allowing these pollen-covered bugs to escape - it was incredible.
If you think this is incredible, this one is my favorite.
This is spring feathers and green velvet.
Everyone here from Brazil should know about this plant.
This is the most amazing thing.
Its stamens are about a foot long.
It has an ability that no other plant has as far as I know. When it blooms - this is the meat spike in the middle - for about two days, it produces a certain degree of metabolic changes that are somewhat similar to mammals.
It doesn't have starch. This is plant food. It has something very similar to brown fat. It burns it at the rate of burning fat and metabolizes it, about at the speed of a kitten.
In terms of weight ratio, it is twice the energy output of a hummingbird-absolutely amazing.
It also did something unusual.
Not only will it warm up to 155 degrees Fahrenheit, 43 or 44 degrees Celsius for two days, but it will also maintain a constant temperature.
There is a temperature adjustment mechanism to maintain a constant temperature.
Why do you do this? I heard you ask.
You don't know yet, some beetles like to mate at this temperature.
They got in, covered with pollen.
(Laughter) Plants sprinkle pollen all over them and let them leave to pollinate.
What a wonderful thing this is.
Now we think that most pollinators are insects, but in fact in tropical areas, many birds and butterflies also pollinate.
Many tropical flowers are red, which is because butterflies and birds are similar to us. We think that red can be seen very well.
But if you look at the spectrum, birds and us, we see red, green and blue to see this spectrum.
Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet rays, and they can see all kinds of bright and dark ultraviolet rays.
There is still some color behind this.
"Wouldn't it be good if we could see those colors", I heard you ask.
Yes, we can see it.
So what do insects see?
Last week I took pictures of these desert lotus, half-day flowers, in Dorset.
As we can see, these are little yellow flowers, and these little yellow flowers are everywhere.
It looks like this under visible light.
It looks like this if you remove the red color.
Most bees cannot perceive red.
Then I put an ultraviolet filter in front of my lens and exposed it for a long time at a specific frequency of ultraviolet light, and I got this picture.
This is like a real and wonderful target.
Now we don't know what exactly the bees see. When I call it red, you know what I'm looking at.
We cannot know what happened in it, whether it was insects or other human brains.
But the contrast looks like this. Stand out from the background.
This is another kind of floret-located in different ultraviolet frequency ranges, with different filters to match different pollinators.
It looks like this.
In order to avoid you thinking that all yellow flowers have this attribute - they did not damage the flower during the shooting; just stick it on the tripod and did not take it off - under ultraviolet light, look at this.
This can be used as the basis for sunscreens, because sunscreens work by absorbing ultraviolet light.
So maybe the chemicals in it are useful.
Finally, this is an evening fragrance that was sent to me by Bjorn Rorslett of Norway-a wonderful hidden mode.
I like this way of hiding.
I think this is very poetic. These photos were taken with an ultraviolet filter, and the main purpose of this filter is for astronomers to take pictures of Venus - actually the clouds on Venus.
This is the main purpose of this filter.
Of course, Venus is the god of love and fertility. This is the story of flowers.
Just as flowers have spent so much energy trying to attract pollinators to accept their invitations, somehow they have succeeded in convincing us that it contains rich connotations. We send flowers to each other at birth and death, especially at weddings. When you think of it, it is at this moment that genetic material migrates from one organism to another.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
China News Service, Chongqing, July 26 (Reporter Liu Xian) The Chongqing Development and Reform Commission announced on the 26th that the city has so far retired 4,404 fishermen, accounting for 42.54% of all fishermen involved.
In an interview with a reporter from Chinanews.com, the 53-year-old Li Daiguo said that his grandfathers were fishing in the Longxi River. Since the age of 11, he has been fishing with his father, shaking his boat, moving along the Longxi River, up to Liangping, Chongqing, and down to longevity. Every time he leaves home, he is ten and a half months, relying on fishing to maintain his family life.
However, since 1997, as the rural population has gradually poured into the town, there are more and more residents in Gaoanchang Town, causing more and more serious environmental pollution.
Paper mills, chemical plants, and breeding farms have been built along the Longxi River, which also pollute the river.
By 2007 and 2008, the Longxi River has become a smelly ditch.
"The scales of the fish caught are black, and the inside is also black after being cut open."
Li Daiguo said that fishing is becoming more and more difficult after the river is polluted.
The local area began to make great efforts to control the pollution of the Longxi River, including clearing the river, patrolling the river, and managing and protecting aquatic resources.
Li Daiguo also retired from fishermen and converted to production, and became a member of the river patrol team to manage and protect aquatic resources.
From January 1, 2020, Chongqing Aquatic Life Reserve and related waters in the main urban area have implemented a comprehensive ban on fishing.
According to data from the Chongqing Development and Reform Commission, as of now, Chongqing has retired 3,403 fishing vessels and 4643 fishing vessels that have signed retreat agreements, accounting for 63.3% and 86.3% of the total three-year mission, respectively.
4,404 fishermen have been retired, accounting for 42.54% of all fishermen involved.
Of the 4404 people who have been retired, 4267 have been employed, accounting for 96.89% of the fishermen who have retired.
Pension insurance coverage covers 2,691 people, accounting for 61.10% of fishermen who retire.
In the next step, Chongqing will carry out in-depth special rectification actions, accelerate the clean-up and rectification of the Yangtze River's main stream shoreline utilization projects, complete a new round of Yangtze River drainage and drainage surveys and carry out corresponding rectification actions, basically complete the "Three Phosphorus" (referring to phosphate mines, phosphorous chemicals and phosphorous gypsum reservoirs) rectification tasks, small hydropower clean-up and rectification work, promote special actions for afforestation and greening on both sides of the Yangtze River, strengthen the construction of green mines, consolidate the achievements of the special rectification of illegal docks and illegal sand mining on the main stream of the Yangtze River, and further promote the ban on fishing and retreat in the Yangtze River basin.
Israel strengthens the prevention and control of repeated epidemics-Chinanews.com

Israel strengthens prevention and control of repeated epidemics
In the early stage of the outbreak of the new crown pneumonia epidemic, Israel's prevention and control measures were effective.
However, with the gradual lifting of the ban on prevention and control measures, the number of confirmed cases of new coronary pneumonia in Israel has recently increased significantly, and the Israeli government has repeatedly taken urgent measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On February 28, the first case of new coronary pneumonia was confirmed in Israel, so that it quickly closed all entry and exit ports, suspended non-essential industries, schools changed to online teaching, restricted public transportation and non-essential social activities, blocked cities with severe epidemics, and the military and police jointly maintained prevention and control measures.
This series of measures quickly achieved positive results. By mid-May, the number of new confirmed cases of new coronary pneumonia in Israel fell back to single digits.
As the epidemic is brought under control, Israel's various prevention and control measures have been fully unblocked. Since June, the number of newly diagnosed new coronary pneumonia has gradually rebounded.
Especially after entering July, the spread of the epidemic has continued to accelerate.
In recent days, there have been more than 1,500 new cases in Israel every day for 8 days, and as of the time of writing on July 25, there were 916 new cases on that day.
As of July 25, Israel has 59,745 confirmed cases and 448 deaths.
Facing the rapid rebound of the epidemic, the Israeli government has repeatedly taken urgent measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On July 6, after the number of confirmed cases exceeded 30,000, the Israeli government closed public entertainment venues such as gyms, swimming pools, bars, and nightclubs, and introduced a policy of restricting public transportation, stipulating that the number of passengers per bus should not exceed 20.
On the 17th, the Israeli government announced a series of new restrictive measures, including the implementation of "closure of the city" on weekends, etc., stipulating that the "closure of the city" will be implemented from 17: 00 every Friday to 5: 00 every Sunday.
During this period, people can go out, but shops, shopping centers, barber shops, beauty salons, libraries, zoos, museums, exhibition halls, swimming pools and tourist attractions will be closed, while supermarkets, pharmacies and other basic service places will remain open.
At the same time, on all dates and time periods, gatherings of more than 10 people are prohibited, gyms, studios and other places will be closed, restaurants and cafes are forbidden to eat, and only takeaway services are allowed.
At the same time, the Israeli people did not pay enough attention to the severity of the epidemic and failed to form a joint force with the government in fighting the epidemic.
After the recurrence of the Israeli epidemic, many people took to the streets to protest and march because the government's prevention and control measures affected their own economic interests.
On July 11, tens of thousands of people held a demonstration in Tel Aviv, believing that the anti-epidemic policy affects the economy.
On the evening of the 21st, thousands of protesters gathered in front of Prime Minister Netanyahu's residence in Jerusalem to protest against Prime Minister Netanyahu's promulgation of prevention and control measures such as banning restaurants and cafes without corresponding compensation.
In addition, many people also fail to observe regulations such as wearing masks and maintaining a safe social distance of two meters during outdoor activities. In order to avoid being fined by the police for not wearing masks, many people only wear masks on their chins or on their wrists.
During the recurrence of the epidemic, the school was the hardest hit area for the spread of the new crown virus. According to a reporter's recent visit to this kindergarten, it was found that the teachers and students in the kindergarten did not wear masks as required by the government, nor did they maintain a safe social distance of two meters from each other, laying down hidden dangers for a large number of teachers and students to be infected with the virus.
Professor Eli Waxman, a member of the Israeli National Security Council's expert advisory panel to combat the epidemic, believes that Israel is moving towards a "dangerous situation", pointing out that the epidemic prevention and control measures currently taken by Israel are not enough, and all leisure and entertainment venues and summer schools should be closed to control the further spread of the epidemic.
Waxman said that Israel lacks an overall plan to fight the epidemic, and the parliament and government departments should abandon their respective interests as soon as possible, reach an agreement on the fight against the epidemic, and formulate clear steps that include relevant restrictive measures in different departments.
Our Tel Aviv, July 25, our reporter in Tel Aviv, Wang Jiong
Wu Fengfang, a farmer in Guyuan, Ningxia, couldn't resist his old companion, Dai Tianfu, and the two men drove from their home 20 miles away to Liangyun Cultural Compound.
Despite the inconvenience of his legs and feet in the past two years, 77-year-old Dai Tianfu still hopes to "come here every other way and get addicted to the play."
This is an inconspicuous courtyard in Yuanzhou District, Guyuan City. Unlike ordinary farmyards, there are often melodious Qin operas in the courtyard, as well as colorful shadow plays, embroidery works, traditional Qin operas, eyebrow operas, etc.
The owner of the compound is called Liang Yun, who used to be a carpenter.
More than 10 years ago, he, who loves shadow and singing, began planning to build a cultural compound.
With Liangyun Cultural Compound, the cultural life of the villagers has become rich and colorful.
The reporter has not yet entered the Liangyun Cultural Compound, and the tunes of Qin Opera have been spread out.
It is Bai Lixiang, a villager from a neighboring village, who is singing the Qin cavity selection for the villagers.
She has loved Qin cavity since she was a child, and now she is well-known in the local area. As long as she has free time, she will come to the cultural compound to perform programs for the villagers.
Recently, Bai Lixiang has also played live webcasting.
Bai Lixiang said: "Having a stage for more people to see their performances is a very happy thing."
On the stage, the singer takes a look and the player plays one tune at a time. Although he is an amateur, his enthusiasm is undiminished.
Just like the simple style of the farmyard, outside the Qin cavity, the "grassroots" art and non-heritage culture in the Liangyun Cultural Compound came face to face.
The compound also houses more than 300 agricultural utensils of different ages, traditional and hand-made tiles, paper-cuts, embroidery, shadow and other physical objects.
Liang Yun led the reporter into the exhibition hall in the courtyard, which displayed his collection of old objects, old wine kettles, three strings, spinning wheels, etc.
Why does an ordinary farmer build a cultural compound?
"Shadow theatre is my family craft. I have been learning this craft since I was 15 years old."
Liangyun Cultural Compound was established in 2012, becoming the first rural "intangible cultural heritage exhibition hall" in Ningxia, and it is also a demonstration compound for the protection of intangible cultural heritage in Guyuan City.
In addition to Liangyun Cultural Compound, more than 120 cultural compounds and 79 folk performance groups have emerged in Yuanzhou District, Guyuan City. Among them, there are more than 50 cultural compounds of a certain scale, such as Shenjiahe Cultural Compound, Wang Yonghong Cultural Compound, Yang Lang Cultural Compound, etc., covering various towns and streets in Yuanzhou District, with more than 5,000 participants.
These grassroots artists are active in the field, enriching the cultural life of the masses and meeting their spiritual needs.
"As life gets better and better, traditional culture cannot be left behind like this."
"Liu's Spy War Drama" Returns "Winning Chance" to watch Liu Yunlong Li Liqun's opponent "Drama" - Xinhuanet
The 40-episode spy war drama "Winning" will land on Beijing Satellite TV from July 16.
"Winning Chance" is adapted from real historical facts and is based on the Soviet military archives that have been sealed for many years and first introduced.
Actor Liu Yunlong, who is familiar to the audience with the "spy war drama", broke through the image in the play and challenged a "stuttering agent" with a sense of joy.
In recent years, the popularity of dramas such as "The Pretender", "Mask", and "Kite" has proved that spy war-type dramas have a strong vitality.
Unlike previous spy war works, "Winning" looks at the world and extends the background of the story to the Soviet Far East battlefield.
It is set against the background of the final phase of the Anti-Japanese War in 1944, and tells the story of Tang Fei (played by Liu Yunlong), a secret intelligence worker of the Communist Party of China, who, under the leadership of the secretary of the Linhe Provincial Committee of the Chinese Underground Party and the director of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Agency, carried out the "Mudan Ula" strategic operation of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Agency.
In many spy war dramas, the male protagonist, as a senior spy, appears as a perfect image of handsome, high IQ, and mature.
But in Liu Yunlong's view, such a person is not suitable to be a spy. "A spy should be the kind of person you can't find in a pile of people. If you show up, you are a very handsome image. I wish everyone would pay attention to you, can you still lurk? There is a line in" Kite, "'You don't come to catch me, I forget that I am a Kuomintang', and spies are going to be elitist."
So in "Winning Chance", Liu Yunlong ingeniously designed his protagonist Tang Fei as a "stuttering agent" with a sense of joy.
The other camp in "Winning Chance" is supported by the Japanese Fukuhara played by Liang Guanhua and Fang Shibao, the director of the Police Department played by Li Liqun.
The two powerful actors, one south and one north, add a lot of highlights to the whole drama.
Director Yin Fei used the term "drag drama" to describe the confrontation between Li Liqun and Liu Yunlong in the play. "It is definitely a drag show. The two of them have a special understanding, and this kind of understanding on them is very impactful to me. Many times their plays are 'live'. For example, we only wrote the length of half a page of paper, and if I didn't stop during filming, they could go on."
The masters do not rob each other, and the director does not disturb the play. When the actors are in the role and ensure their own character status, they can not only shape the character from the perspective of the character, but also bring more viewing possibilities to the audience. Yin Fei said that such a play is enough.
In the play, you can also see many familiar faces in the "Liu's spy war drama." The famous and majestic "Mountain City F4" in "Kite" also gathered three people in "Winning Chance."
Hou Yu and Liu Mingyang, who played Song Xiaoan and Zhao Jianzhi, once again played Tang Fei's right arm.
Director Yin Fei said, "There is no inferiority in these two people. They just drifted with the tide in that era and in that environment."
Liu Yunlong also offered, "We must have a human touch. This human touch means that the people around me must have good and bad, and bad people are enemies, but we must also develop them, and our team must also grow."
The ending of these two people in the play was also carefully designed by Liu Yunlong, and he believes that he will give the audience a satisfactory answer.

4 students drowned in Arong Banner, Inner Mongolia Official: The incident sounded the alarm-Chinanews.com
China News Service, Hulunbuir, July 26 (Reporter Li Aiping) On the evening of the 25th, the reporter learned from the government of Arong Banner, Hulunbuir City, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region that four local students died from drowning.
At 15: 50 on July 24, the Arong Banner Public Security Bureau 110 received a report that six junior high school students were drowning in the local area.
After receiving the police, the local police rushed to the scene as soon as possible and rescued two students on the spot. Then the local emergency bureau, water conservancy bureau and other units rushed to the scene one after another to participate in the rescue.
According to reports, the rescue site dispatched more than 80 people including public security police, forest police, firefighting, medical care, etc., dispatched 3 rubber boats to continuously salvage the surrounding waters, and hired professional rescue teams to arrive at the scene and conduct underwater searches through sonar detection.
The reporter learned that the local rescuers found the first student killed at 6: 40 on July 25, the second student killed at 11: 30 on the 25th, the third student killed at 12: 40 on the 25th, and the last student killed at 13: 34 on the 25th. After the above 4 people were salvaged, they were identified by the local 120 emergency center as having no vital signs.
Officials said that the drowning incident sounded a wake-up call to the whole society.
At present, the relevant departments of the local government are collating some knowledge on drowning prevention, hoping that the tragedy will not happen again.
Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 25. Xu Zhengyu, Director of the Financial Affairs and Treasury Bureau of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, said that Hong Kong's financial market remains active and orderly.
He expressed optimism about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
Xu Zhengyu said at an online seminar co-organized by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Toronto and the Hong Kong-Canada Chamber of Commerce (Canada Association) on the 24th (Toronto time) that Hong Kong is experiencing a difficult situation due to the "regulation disturbance" and the new crown pneumonia epidemic.
The exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar is stable and favors the exchange guarantee level of the strong party.
The banking system has no obvious signs of capital outflows. On the contrary, more than US $11 billion in funds have flowed in since June.
The total amount of bank deposits has also continued to increase in the past few months. There has been a series of public offering fund-raising activities in the stock market, and market transactions have repeatedly risen.
Xu Zhengyu said that the new crown pneumonia epidemic has put pressure on the global economy and financial markets, but Hong Kong's basic advantages remain unchanged.
Hong Kong has many advantages, including geography, the rule of law, high-speed communications, free flow of information and capital, and a simple and low tax system, making Hong Kong a leading international financial center.
Xu Zhengyu pointed out that the SAR government has set aside 6 billion Hong Kong dollars in the "epidemic prevention and anti-epidemic fund" to create about 30,000 time-bound jobs in the public and private sectors in the next two years, covering people with different skills and academic qualifications.
To support the development of financial technology, the SAR government has also launched the "Thousand People Plan" to subsidize local financial technology companies, start-ups and other companies with financial technology-related businesses to create 1,000 new jobs, hire local talents and enrich Hong Kong's financial technology talent pool.
Looking to the future, Xu Zhengyu expressed optimism about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
He encouraged Canadian companies to make good use of Hong Kong's advantages and its status as an international financial center, an international asset and wealth management center, and a global offshore renminbi business hub to develop and invest in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and surrounding areas.
"The Lancet" praised China's anti-epidemic efforts to encourage countries to learn from experience-Chinanews.com
The Lancet magazine published an article on the 25th that China, as a country with a population of 1.4 billion and a size similar to that of Europe or the United States, has effectively controlled the new crown epidemic at this stage, and there has been no large-scale spread, which has largely controlled the domestic epidemic.
The article stated that in the past ten years, China has made a lot of investment in domestic research and public health construction, which makes China's preparation for the new crown much better than that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that year.
The author said that when the SARS outbreak broke out in 2002, China was initially ill-prepared, especially the pathogen could not be identified.
When the new crown virus was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists were soon able to identify the type of virus and shared genome sequencing data with the international community on January 11, 2020.
By the end of January, doctors from mainland China and Hong Kong clarified the clinical characteristics of the virus and warned the world about the threat of the new crown virus through research papers published in The Lancet.
China has also been at the forefront of vaccine research. When the country declared a state of emergency, through close domestic cooperation, such research was carried out very quickly and strictly. In May and July, respectively, the results of the early trials of the new crown vaccine developed in China were announced in "The Lancet."
China's experience shows that it is very important to invest in national health and research systems to effectively improve laboratory capabilities.
This is the basis for the country to respond quickly and effectively to health emergencies and global health security.
Other countries, especially low-income and middle-income countries, are very worthy of reference and learning.
In addition, China's experience has proved that on the basis of strong research, there must be a strong high-level decisive reliance on scientific evidence to make correct decisions, so that the new crown epidemic can be effectively controlled.
The article emphasizes that the government and its leaders must respect science, understand the value of science, and take action on it in the most beneficial way for society.
At the beginning of the outbreak, the National Health and Construction Commission of China dispatched three groups of infectious disease experts to Wuhan to investigate the risk and spread of the new crown virus. Their suggestions provided the basis for the decision to "close the city" in Wuhan on January 23; when some experts proposed the necessity and urgency of building a square cabin hospital, the government quickly made a decision and implemented it quickly; at the same time, the extensive participation of the community and the masses also made the epidemic quickly and effectively controlled.
The article finally emphasizes that in response to global health emergencies, countries need to strengthen global cooperation and jointly respond.

According to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Commission for Discipline Inspection and Monitoring: A few days ago, with the approval of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Committee, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Commission for Discipline Inspection conducted a case review and investigation of the serious violations of discipline and law committed by the former inspector of the Wuhai Municipal Commission.
After investigation, Binghai, as a leading cadre of a party member, lost his ideals and beliefs, and for his own self-interest, he blatantly violated the principle of party spirit and opposed inspection and rectification; he was indifferent to organizational concepts, arranged transfer work for others in violation of regulations, and accepted property from others in the selection and appointment of cadres; he was economically greedy, ran a business in violation of regulations to obtain huge benefits, engaged in power and money transactions, and used power for personal gain; and his life was corrupt, causing adverse effects.
Buckingham seriously violated political discipline, organizational discipline, integrity discipline, and life discipline, constituted a violation of the law and was suspected of bribery crimes and corruption crimes, and did not converge or give up after the 18th National Congress of the Party. The nature is bad and the circumstances are serious, and should be seriously dealt with.
In accordance with the Regulations on Disciplinary Punishment of the Communist Party of China, the Supervision Law of the People's Republic of China and other relevant regulations, after consideration at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Commission for Discipline Inspection and reported to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Committee for approval, it was decided to grant Buckingham expulsion from the party and adjust the treatment he enjoys in accordance with the regulations; collect his illegal income from discipline violations; transfer his suspected crime to the procuratorial organ for review and prosecution in accordance with the law, and transfer the property involved with the case.
On the afternoon of the 25th local time, a small plane crashed into the top floor of a multi-storey residential building in Wesel County, North Wales, Germany. Three people were killed in the accident.
The Duisburg prosecutor, the Wesel County Police Department, and the Wesel City Fire Department jointly issued a statement that evening, stating that at around 14: 40 that day, a two-seater small plane crashed into a house in the penthouse on the top floor of a multi-storey residential building on Camp Street, Wesel County, killing three people.
It took off from Mar City, Ruhr District, North Wales, on the same day, took off again after stopping at the airport in Wesel County, and then crashed into a residential building.
The identity of the deceased may be a female resident in the hit house and two passengers on a small plane.
A two-year-old child in the room was only slightly injured and was rescued safely.
The rest of the residents in the room were not injured in the accident, but their emotions have not yet recovered.
The scene screen reported by the German news agency showed that the house affected by the accident once emitted thick smoke, and the firefighters extinguished the fire and saw that the house was seriously damaged.
At present, the cause of the plane crash is not clear.
The Rhine Post quoted the police as reporting that there were clues that the plane had disintegrated before it hit a residential building.
The police said that multiple parts of the crashed plane were found near the scene of the accident.
The German criminal police is working with the Duisburg prosecutor and the German Federal Aviation Accident Investigation Agency to investigate the cause of the accident.
The reporter learned from the Chinese Consulate General in Düsseldorf that day that the museum contacted the local police and fire department. According to the judgment at the scene, there were no Chinese citizens among the casualties.
The Ministry of Health of Singapore announced on the 26th that as of 12 o'clock that day, there were 481 new confirmed cases of new crowns in Singapore, with a total of 50,369 confirmed cases; a total of 27 deaths.
Data show that among the newly confirmed cases, 5 are local community cases, 4 are imported cases, and the rest are foreign workers living in special dormitories.
The Ministry of Health of Singapore said that 98% of new confirmed cases are related to known infections.
At present, 173 new crown patients are still receiving treatment in the hospital, most of them are stable or improving, and no one is in the intensive care unit.
In addition, 4648 people were quarantined in community facilities.
Foreign workers account for the vast majority of people infected with the new crown in Singapore.
According to statistics, there are 200,000 foreign workers living in 43 special dormitories for foreign workers in Singapore, and about 100,000 foreign workers live in other types of dormitories.
The Singapore Anti-epidemic Interdepartmental Working Group recently stated that the Singapore government is stepping up testing for the last few special dormitories for foreign workers with high new crown infection rates.
After completing the testing of all dedicated dormitories, the vast majority of foreign workers will be able to resume work, but they will still have to undergo regular new crown testing.
Director Dapeng's "Good luck" was shortlisted for the Golden Goblet Award-Xinhuanet
On July 18, the 23rd Shanghai International Film Festival announced the official list of films selected for the Golden Goblet Award.
Director Dapeng's first realistic film, "Good luck", was successfully shortlisted for the Golden Goblet Award of this Film Festival, and the film officially released its first poster.
Poster Pictures for Pictures
The film "Good luck" is Dapeng's first realistic work, and it is also his second bond with the Golden Goblet Award.
The film tells a story: A comedy director came back to his hometown in the northeastern countryside on a whim, hoping to make a literary and artistic film for the family during the New Year, but he encountered a series of accidents.
The family members gathered for making the movie completed the final party.
In the movie poster released today, a member of the family, "Three Uncle" Wang Jixiang, is sitting in the middle of the screen smoking a cigarette. The background is the black land of Northeast China with silver clothing, and the foreground is the red lantern that the Chinese must hang during the New Year.
The red lanterns, which symbolize joy and reunion, form a huge contrast with the lonely Wang Jixiang, which seems to reveal the complexity and entanglement in this big family relationship.
It is reported that in the film, except for the daughter of "Three Uncle" Wang Jixiang, who is played by actor Liu Lu, the rest of the roles are completed by the real director's family. The experimental audio-visual style of the film breaks the boundary between drama and reality, and brings the audience a brand-new immersive viewing experience.
According to director Dapeng, the creation of "auspicious Ruyi" originated from "a providence." A series of sudden changes in the family during filming made the original filming plan have to be changed accordingly, and the life without a script was eventually recorded as a movie, but released tension beyond design.
How exactly does director Dapeng face this "providence", and how should he continue to welcome the changes brought about by this providence?
There is no doubt that "good luck" is full of experimentation. The almost all-round lineup and innovative audio-visual style turn the life in front of the camera into a movie. Under the package of real images, the audience will also find the shadow of themselves and their families in the family presented in the film, and evoke a series of thoughts with the end of this family gathering in the film.
NEWS.GOV.MO: New Coronavirus Infection Response Coordination Center Enquiry Hotline Statistics (July 25, 08H00-July 26, 08H00)
From 08H00 on July 25 to 08H00 on July 26, 2020, the enquiry hotline of the New Coronavirus Infection Response Coordination Center received 292 phone enquiries.
291 enquiries about the epidemic have been immediately transferred to representatives of relevant departments for follow-up, as follows:
271 cases from the Health Bureau (involving: Inquiring about isolation; inquiring about nucleic acid testing; inquiring about two cards; health codes; other.)
17 cases from the Public Security Police (involving: Inquiring about immigration measures; inquiring about immigration measures for licensed vehicles from Guangdong and Macao; inquiring about the Zhuhai government hotline; inquiring about document stay issues.)
1 case from the Tourism Bureau (involving: Inquiring about the problem of isolated hotels.)
1 case from the Education and Youth Affairs Bureau (involving: Inquiring about the method of Macao students returning to study in the United Kingdom.)
1 case from the Maritime and Water Affairs Bureau (involving: Asking whether Hong Kong fishing vessels entering Hong Kong need to report to the Maritime and Water Affairs Bureau and nucleic acid testing-related matters.)
At the Bayong Zhuokang sentry point, platoon commander Yu Wang and a soldier stood guard on duty.
In this place where the annual average temperature is more than ten degrees below zero, a row of simple barracks stands on the mountain pass. Not far from the barracks, a national flag is fluttering in the wind. The soldiers are on duty in the wind every day, and they need to regularly patrol higher-altitude locations.
The soldiers climbed the steep slope of the pile of rocks, requiring both hands and feet.
It was late July, when flowers and plants were flourishing in low-altitude areas, and in Bayong Zhuokang, only the ravine behind the barracks had relatively dense green.
Gao Peng, a soldier who has been stationed at the outpost for six years, pointed to the mountain ditch and said that this is their back garden. Only in July and August of each year can the grass grow slowly. After a while, it all turns yellow and is covered with snow.
Foot patrols can take about 9 hours.
Under the harsh plateau environment, the soldiers stationed here are accompanied by snow-capped mountains and glaciers all year round, and they also regularly patrol the higher mountain passes.
A few days ago, a patrol team composed of 8 fighters, led by instructor Liang Yixin, once again embarked on the patrol road.
Each soldier carries a weight of about 30 kilos and marches towards the target point early in the morning.
On the way, a soldier rebelled, and his comrades gave emergency help.
In addition to patrolling missions, the soldiers at the Bayong Zhuokang sentry point have to conduct tactical and physical training every day.
Time passed by, the altitude continued to rise, the oxygen content became lower and lower, and the physical strength continued to be overdrawn. These factors tested the will of the patrol members.
They clenched their teeth and insisted, stepping over several landslide points one after another, and crossing several emergency and dangerous beaches.
At about 16 o'clock, it was lunch time for the patrol members. They took out their own dry food and sat down on the spot at an altitude of more than 5,700 meters, accompanied by rain and snow, and supplemented their physical strength with food.
The soldiers at the Bayong Zhuokang sentry point conducted tactical and physical training.
During the break, they will play cards together, and the loser will do push-ups, both for entertainment and physical exercise.
After a short rest in the cold wind, they climbed to the target point of the patrol, took out the national flag on the mountain pass, and solemnly swore.
Behind them is the snow-capped mountains, and in front of them is a no-man's land for dozens of kilometers. They are the safest guardians of the country.
Beijing consumption season restarts-Xinhua
Beijing restarted the activities of the Beijing consumption season in accordance with the principles of "comprehensive restart, key planning, orderly promotion, and tight organization."
On July 26, 1.5 million government and enterprise consumption vouchers were issued, including 1 million offline catering and shopping vouchers and 500,000 smart product vouchers. Consumers can receive them at JD.com APP.
Liu Meying, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce, introduced at the media briefing held on the 25th that the consumption season after the restart will further reduce corporate capital allocation on the basis of maintaining the existing preferential subsidies for consumer voucher card packages.
Starting in early August, the current 1: 1 allocation of capital from the government and enterprises will be adjusted to 2: 1. For example, consumers can enjoy a discount of 120 yuan after receiving a card package to the store for consumption, of which the government subsidizes 60 yuan and the enterprise makes a profit of 60 yuan; after the adjustment, the government subsidizes 80 yuan and the enterprise makes a profit of 40 yuan.
During the consumption season, the three major operators will subsidize traffic and terminals around 5G consumption, further promoting Beijing's 5G new infrastructure and 5G new consumption.
Chen Maobo pointed out that Hong Kong's economy has been hit by another outbreak of the epidemic, calling on all sectors to share difficult times-Chinanews.com
China News Agency, Hong Kong, July 26. Chen Maobo, Financial Secretary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, said on the 26th that Hong Kong is facing the impact of a new wave of new coronary pneumonia epidemic, and business contacts and economic activities that had seen signs of recovery have also been hit.
The SAR government once again calls on owners of all sizes to reduce rents and spend the difficult time with retail merchants, restaurants and small and medium-sized enterprises.
Chen Maobo published an article entitled "The rugged road to recovery" online on the same day.
He said that the recent high number of confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia in Hong Kong and the severe situation have affected the people's livelihood and troubled the economy.
When the epidemic is repeated, the first priority is to strictly prevent input cases, and to deal with and interrupt the virus transmission chain as quickly as possible; when the epidemic is controlled, economic activities should be resumed accordingly in due course.
He pointed out that in the face of the impact of the new wave of the epidemic, business contacts and economic activities that had seen signs of recovery have also been hit.
For the business community, in addition to the spirit of the contract, social responsibility is equally important, especially those groups that have received large government subsidies in the "Employment Guarantee Program."
He mentioned that Hong Kong's economic situation in the second quarter of this year is still very severe, but the contraction seems to have slowed slightly.
In terms of exports, he believes that the external situation of Hong Kong is still severe.
Chen Maobo said that the development history of Hong Kong over the past few decades shows that every crisis hides new opportunities, and every difficulty hides the key to future development.
One winter morning a few years ago, in Johannesburg, South Africa, I drove to work and found the city shrouded in smog.
I drive by there almost every day, but this time it is very unusual. I have never seen such a sight before.
Johannesburg is famous for its distinctive and beautiful skyline, but it was almost invisible that morning.
Soon I realized that what I saw was the severe smog caused by air pollution.
The contrast between the beautiful environment I used to know and the smog-shrouded skyline at the moment is constantly surging in my heart.
I am worried that it is very possible that the once colorful sunset will be swallowed by the dark haze.
At that moment, I felt a strong urge to do something, but I didn't know what to do.
All I know is that I can't just stand by and watch.
The biggest challenge is that I don't understand environmental science. Air quality management, or atmospheric chemistry.
I am a computer engineer, and I am very sure that I cannot solve the problem of air pollution by coding.
(Laughter) In what capacity will I solve this problem?
I am just a small citizen of the city.
In the next few years, I learned a very important lesson. If we want to achieve a better future, we should all bear this lesson in mind.
Even if you are not an expert in a particular field, your professional skills may contain solutions to problems in that field.
Sometimes, the unique perspective you hold can inspire unconventional thinking to shape the situation, but you need to be bold to try.
Only in this way can you know the result.
What I knew at the time was that if I wanted to try to change, I had to know enough about pollution first, so I became a student again.
I did some basic research and soon learned that air pollution is the biggest environmental health risk in the world.
Data from the World Health Organization show that in 2012, almost 14% of deaths worldwide were caused by air pollution in and around the home, especially in low- and middle-income countries.
The annual death rate caused by air pollution is higher than that of malaria and AIDS.
In Africa, premature deaths caused by unsafe sanitary conditions, or deaths caused by children's malnutrition, are pale in the face of air pollution. At the same time, it also brings huge economic costs: According to statistics from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, related expenditures exceeded US $400 billion in 2013.
In my work, I explore the cutting-edge achievements of artificial intelligence, including the symbiotic relationship between humans and machines, to find a useful foothold and help us make better decisions.
When I think about air pollution again, it becomes clear how to deal with the problem of air pollution. We need to find better ways to make better decisions. Considering that the problem is huge, collaborative cooperation is very necessary.
So I decided to meet some people who work in this field.
I started talking to officials in Johannesburg and other surrounding cities. I also joined the local scientific community. I also made some phone calls to completely unfamiliar but related people.
These experiences that I set out to intervene helped me understand this issue more deeply.
It also helped me avoid the trap that people in my field sometimes fall into when they try to innovate: Quickly adopt a technology before they really grasp the problem.
I started to think, what can I do to improve this situation?
I began to ask myself how to effectively integrate my knowledge and skills in software engineering and artificial intelligence, as well as the professional skills of the people I contact.
I want to create an online air quality management platform to reveal future pollution trends and make relevant predictions to judge the possible results.
I am sure that my idea can become a realistic solution, but I also face uncertainty, and I cannot guarantee that it will succeed.
All I have is a specific set of engineer skills, the skills I have gained from my work. (Laughter) Of course, for people who have been working in the field of air pollution for many years, my skills are brand new.
I gradually realized that sometimes a novel perspective, a new combination of skills, can give rise to some remarkable things.
Our willpower and imagination are an indicator light that instructs us to overcome obstacles and open a new chapter.
I have a more in-depth understanding of the problem of air pollution, and I have found air pollution data in the past ten years, as well as meteorological data in and around Johannesburg. After that, I created an air quality resolution support system with my colleagues in South Africa and China, and uploaded it to the cloud.
This software can analyze historical and real-time data to reveal trends in pollution over time and space.
We then used new machine learning technology to predict future pollution a few days in advance.
This means that residents can make better decisions about their daily itinerary and where to settle with their families.
We can predict adverse pollution events in advance and define severe pollution sources, so that relevant authorities can issue instructions to adjust their business activities.
Through auxiliary scenario planning, urban planners can also make better decisions on how to expand infrastructure work, such as residential resettlement in industrial areas.
We have established a pilot pilot of this technology, which has been running for 120 days, covering the whole of South Africa.
Our expected results have been verified. The predicted data we showed and the data we collected in the field showed a close correlation.
Through our management, we have introduced the world's leading cutting-edge instruments to predict atmospheric quality, the resolution and accuracy of which are unprecedented, so that the city I drove into on the recent winter morning can benefit. At that time, I said to myself, "Something is wrong. I have to find a way to do something."
So, the point is: What if I didn't investigate the problem of air pollution in depth?
What if I don't pay attention to the environmental situation of the country, but hope that some places and some other people will take care of these things?
What I learned from this is that when fully advancing a cause that we all believe in, it is very important to pay attention to the possibility of success and consider the consequences of inaction.
We should not be distracted by opposition and resistance, it should inspire us to go further.
So no matter where you are in the world, the next time you find that some kind of natural curiosity is aroused, and it is also about what you care about, you have some crazy or brave ideas, even if this is not your area of expertise, ask yourself: Why not try?
Why not go forward to solve the problem? Do your best, in your own way?
You may get unexpected joy.
Thank you all.
(Applause)
The largest earthquake in Taiwan this year occurred in the eastern waters of Taiwan-Chinanews.com
China News Service, Taipei, July 26. An earthquake measuring 6.1 on the Richter scale occurred at 20: 52 on the 26th in the eastern waters of Taiwan, with a maximum magnitude of 4. The earthquake was felt throughout Taiwan, making it the largest earthquake in Taiwan this year.
According to Taiwanese media reports such as the Central News Agency, China Electronic News, ETtoday News Cloud, the Taiwan Meteorological Department reported that the epicenter of the earthquake was 86.5 kilometers southeast of Yilan County Government, that is, the waters of eastern Taiwan, with a focal depth of 53 kilometers.
China Earthquake Network determined that the earthquake was 5.5.
The maximum magnitude across Taiwan is: Hualien County Level 4, Yilan County, Taidong County, Nantou County, Yunlin County Level 3, and other counties and cities measured a magnitude of 1 to 2.
Taiwan's meteorological department pointed out that this earthquake is the largest in Taiwan this year and is a submerged zone earthquake at the junction of plates. Its epicenter has often had earthquakes in the past, and it has also been relatively active this year.
In the next week, it is still not ruled out that there are aftershocks of magnitude 4 or higher.
Many people think that driving is something that only those who can see can do.
Blind people want to drive a car safely alone until now, which is also considered an impossible task.
Hello everyone, my name is Dennis Hong, and we have built a car designed for people with visual impairments for the freedom and independence of the blind.
Before I talk about this car for the blind, let me briefly say that another project I have done is called the U.S. Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Urban Challenge.
This is about making a mechanical car that can drive by itself.
You press the start button, and no longer touch anything, it can also reach its destination completely automatically.
In the 2007 Challenge, our team won US $500,000 and won the third place in the game.
Around that time, the National Association for the Blind, or the Blind Association, challenged the design team about who could design a car that would allow blind people to drive independently and safely.
We think we should try it, because we think, hey, where is this going to be difficult.
We already have an automatic car.
As long as we let the blind drive inside, it won't be over, right?
(Laughter) But we were wrong.
What the Blind Association wants is not a car that can carry blind people around, but a car that blind people can actively make choices and drive.
So we had to give up everything we had before and start from scratch.
In order to test this crazy idea, we designed a prototype of a small sand truck to test its feasibility.
In the summer of 2009, we invited many blind young people across the country and gave them a chance to use this car for a ride.
This is definitely a cool experience.
But the problem with this car is that its design can only allow blind people to drive in a very limited environment, like a closed parking lot-even on a path made of red traffic cones.
So with this success, we decided to take an important next step to build a real car that can drive on a real road.
So how does it work?
Well, this is a relatively complex system, but let me explain it and simplify it.
We have three stages.
We have an induction phase, a calculation phase, and a non-visual interface.
The driver is obviously invisible, so the system must be able to perceive the surrounding environment and collect data for the driver.
At this point, we use the initial metering element.
It measures acceleration, angular acceleration-just like the human ear, the inner ear.
I combined this information with the global positioning system to predict the location of the vehicle.
We also use two cameras to detect the path of the car.
We also use three laser rangefinders.
The laser scans the environment to detect obstacles-the vehicles passing from the front and rear also have any obstacles that break into the road, any obstacles around the vehicle.
All the huge amounts of information are then aggregated into the computer, and the computer will do two things.
First, one thing is to process information to understand the surrounding environment - which are driving paths and which are obstacles - and transform this information to the driver.
This system is also very intelligent and can calculate the safest driving path.
We can also issue instructions on how to operate the vehicle's operating procedures.
But the question is: How can we transmit information and instructions quickly and accurately enough to the blind to ensure that he can drive?
To this end, we have designed many different non-visual user interface technologies.
The original three-dimensional flat sound system, vibration vests, voice-controlled gears, leg straps, and even shoes that put pressure on the feet.
But today we are talking about three of these non-visual user interface technologies.
The first interface is called the driving handle.
This is a pair of gloves. It has a vibration element at the knuckles so that you can transmit instructions on how to drive - direction and amplitude.
Another device is called the velocity shock belt.
This car chair-in fact, this is a massage chair.
We took it apart, and we reorganized the vibration elements of different modes. We let them transmit speed information, and we also have instructions on how to use the accelerator and brake.
Here, you can see how the computer understands the surrounding environment. Because you can't see the vibration, we actually installed a red light-emitting diode on the driver, so he can see what is happening.
This is the sensed data, which is transmitted from the sensor to the computer.
So these two devices, the driving handle and the speed shock belt, are very effective.
But the problem is that these are instruction hinting devices.
So this is not freedom in the true sense, right?
The computer tells you how to drive-turn left, turn right, accelerate, brake.
I call this the co-pilot problem.
So we are avoiding instruction hinting devices and focusing more on information devices.
A typical example of this non-visual information interface is called an empty graph.
Think of this as a monitor for the blind.
This is a small desktop with many holes on it, compressed air is excluded from it, so it can be described as a picture.
So even if you are blind and you put your hand on it, you can sense the course of action and obstacles.
In fact, you can also change the frequency and possibly the temperature released in the air.
This is actually a multi-dimensional user interface.
Here, you can see the cameras on the left and right and how the computer parses and transmits this information to the empty picture.
In this way, we are showing a simulation program, and a blind person is driving with an empty map.
This program is very helpful for training blind drivers and quickly testing different theories based on different types of non-visual user interfaces.
This is basically how it works.
But this car is a model car, and it will not go on the road unless it is proved to be as safe to drive as today's car, or safer.
I really believe that this will happen.
But is society, can they accept this radical idea?
How will we deal with insurance?
How will we issue a driver's license?
Behind the technical challenges, there are many different obstacles that we need to solve before it really becomes a reality.
Of course, the main purpose of this project is to design a car driven by the blind.
But potentially more important than this is the huge value contained in the by-products of this project.
A sensor that can be used to see through darkness, rain and fog.
As well as this new type of interface, we can use these technologies to make them provide safer vehicles for visible people.
Or for the blind, the household devices in daily life-educational facilities, office facilities and application services.
Imagine that in class, the teacher writes notes on the blackboard. Blind students can also use these non-visual interfaces to understand and read what the teacher writes.
This is extremely precious.
Today, what I show you is just the beginning.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Marinichev said that the change in value is affected by the devaluation of the ruble and the epidemic.
He said, "The cost of services is increasing.
Due to the epidemic, people are beginning to spend more time on the Internet. "
Marinichev does not rule out that annual Internet prices will rise significantly, believing that operators can provide customers with higher speeds and more services to offset people's dissatisfaction with price increases.
"Chinese Doctor" plans to pay tribute to the anti-epidemic hero-Xinhuanet
Recently, with the respect of Chinese filmmakers' heroes in the fight against the epidemic, Yu Dong, chairman of Bona Pictures Group, and Liu Weiqiang, director (picture left), held talks and exchanges with academician Zhong Nanshan in Guangzhou on the filming and production of the anti-epidemic film "Chinese Doctor."
Bona Pictures hopes to pay tribute to all medical and epidemic prevention workers who are fighting on the front line of epidemic prevention and control through "Chinese Doctor"!
In 2021, the film will be released nationwide as a tribute film celebrating the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.
At present, Bona Pictures is organizing the original crew of the film "Captain of China" to make the film "Chinese Doctor" under the arrangements and deployment of the Central Propaganda Department and the National Film Bureau, with the support of the Guangdong Film Bureau and the Hubei Film Bureau. This is a film that reflects the unity of the people of the country to fight the new crown pneumonia epidemic under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee.
The film focuses on the front line of Wuhan's anti-epidemic, and will take Wuhan medical staff and provincial and municipal aid medical teams as the background of the characters. From the perspective of human nature, using unique narratives and highly impactful lens language, the panorama shows the touching story of Chinese medical staff full of dedication and sacrifice on the anti-epidemic front line.
It is understood that at the first time on the day when Wuhan was unblocked, Bona Company overcame many difficulties and dispatched a shooting team to go deep into the front line of the epidemic, face-to-face exchanges with hundreds of medical workers to understand and collect information. At present, it has interviewed academician Zhong Nanshan himself, the first person from Guangzhou to aid Wuhan, the Guangdong aid to Hubei medical team, and the white-clothed angels at the forefront of the anti-epidemic front such as Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan Union Hospital, Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan Central Hospital, etc., have photographed a large number of precious first-hand video materials.
Academician Zhong Nanshan also raised expectations and hopes for the filming of the film at this symposium: "I am looking forward to it, and I hope that you will not only visit some experts who have made more public appearances, but also interview more medical staff who are working hard on the front line, they are the majority."
He said that he had seen "I and My Motherland" and "Chinese Captain" before and thought that the way to tell the big pattern story from the perspective of ordinary people is very good.
"Now some foreign friends still have some misunderstandings about China."
When talking about the dissemination of the film, academician Zhong Nanshan said that at present some people in foreign countries like to label the virus as politicized, and he hopes that the film can impress the audience from the perspective of human nature: "In addition to being shown in China, it is best to show it abroad. It is necessary to impress the audience with a true humanistic spirit in a way that both domestic and foreign audiences can understand."
Academician Zhong Nanshan also fondly recalled the film "Man to Middle Age" from the 1980s. "After so many years, what impressed me most about the film after the reform and opening up was" Man to Middle Age. "At that time, my doctors and friends abroad were crying. If" Chinese Doctor "could play such a role, it would be great."
Academician Zhong Nanshan said that if "Chinese Doctor" can resonate with foreign audiences, it will be very successful.
During the discussion and exchange, academician Zhong Nanshan also shared his opinions and suggestions on the current international epidemic prevention and control. "I believe that people are always smarter than viruses."
Academician Zhong Nanshan said that although the virus is difficult to predict, since the primitive society, mankind has weathered thousands of difficulties and dangers. Today, modern society has developed medical technology and social management measures, coupled with medical staff and even ordinary people all over the world have a basic understanding of the scientific response to the new crown pneumonia epidemic. People will no longer be as passive as before. "Next, we must pay attention to two aspects of work, one is to study how the world can strengthen cooperation, and the other is to pay attention to the comfort of people's hearts."

There are more than 30,000 confirmed cases of the new crown in Japan-Xinhuanet
According to statistics, there were 239 new confirmed cases in Tokyo on the 26th, and more than 200 new cases were added in a single day for 6 consecutive days, reaching a total of 11214 cases.
In addition, there were 141 new confirmed cases in Osaka Prefecture, 90 new cases in Fukuoka Prefecture, and 80 new cases in Aichi Prefecture.
Telecommunications network fraud crimes rose by 70% in the first half of the year. Summary characteristics-Chinanews.com
China News Service, July 26. According to the Supreme Inspection website, in the first half of this year, procuratorial organs across the country prosecuted a total of 58,101 fraud crimes, an increase of 35% year-on-year.
Especially among crimes that hinder the prevention and control of the epidemic, fraud crimes are frequent, and the number of prosecutors prosecuting fraud crimes accounts for 43.4% of all crimes that hinder the prevention and control of the epidemic.
The Supreme People's Procuratorate has carried out targeted guidance. Among the ten batches of typical cases involving epidemic prevention and control that have been released so far, there are a total of 9 cases involving fraud.
Judging from the handling of cases by procuratorial organs in the first half of the year, there are many names involved in fraud crimes, ranging from national macro policies to people's clothing, food and housing, including epidemic-related fraud, "medical care" fraud, "health care product" fraud, "admission agency" fraud, "routine loan" fraud, fraudulent state subsidy fraud, national asset unfreezing fraud, etc., continue to "innovate", covering education, medical care, employment, pension, social security, land acquisition and demolition, precision poverty alleviation, financial credit and other fields, which not only cause economic losses to victims, but also seriously affect economic and social development.
In particular, some telecommunications network frauds break through the restrictions of national boundaries, regions and people, and have the characteristics of stakeholder, cross-border, remote, and e-payment. There are many non-specific victim groups and great harm.
For example, some set up special companies, rent high-end office buildings, set up multiple departments or posts, use legal online platforms to publicize and recruit, train and evaluate recruiters, and adopt corporate operation mode management, wearing a "legal cloak", which is more confusing.
Punishing and preventing crimes in accordance with the law, and promptly issuing early warnings to the public and relevant departments are the unshirkable responsibilities of procuratorial organs.
In judicial cases, procuratorial organs conscientiously perform their duties, not only insisting on maintaining a high-pressure situation against fraud crimes, but also refining various law enforcement measures in a targeted manner, and promoting social governance through the issuance of procuratorial recommendations.
The procuratorial organs strictly control the facts, evidence, procedures and application of the law in approving and prosecuting fraud cases, and take the facts as the basis and the law as the criterion, so as not to be in vain.
Especially for telecommunications network fraud crimes, pay attention to the core role of electronic data in fact determination, and strive to build an evidence chain of mutual confirmation between electronic data, verbal evidence, and documentary evidence.
For example, in response to an epidemic-related fraud case handled by the Yinzhou District Procuratorate of Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, the procuratorial organs intervened as soon as possible. From the occurrence of the case to the completion of the case, it took only 5 days, reflecting the attitude and determination to handle the case quickly and strictly and maintain the stability of the overall social situation.
In the process of reviewing arrests and reviewing prosecutions, we focused on the prosecution of missed offenders in cases, corrected the omission of 733 people by public security organs, and corrected the omission of public security organs to review and prosecute 1113 co-offenders.
In the first half of the year, procuratorial organs across the country issued 298 procuratorial recommendations for fraud crimes, promoting joint efforts to prevent fraud crimes and promoting in-depth governance.
For example, in response to the loopholes in the supervision of telecommunications companies, banks, intermediary organizations, etc., found in the handling of the case, the Guangzhou Procuratorate of Guangdong Province and the Dongguan Procuratorate promptly put forward procuratorial recommendations, urging relevant units to strengthen supervision, improve mechanisms, and promote the construction of long-term systems.
The fourth is to make every effort to recover stolen goods and recover damages.
Local procuratorial organs seize important links such as intervening in investigations to guide evidence collection, review and prosecution, urge investigative agencies to actively recover stolen money, cooperate with relevant departments to recover stolen goods, and strive to minimize the economic losses caused by fraud crimes to the people.
For example, in the case of Lin Moumou Road Loan handled by the Beijing Municipal Procuratorate, the case involved 22 properties waiting to be seized. In cases where the property may be disposed of in advance by other cases, the "Letter of Suspension of Execution" was first issued and delivered to the relevant court in a timely manner. It is recommended that the previously sealed court suspend the execution of the property involved in the case, and dispose of it uniformly after the facts of the crime are ascertained, so as to make the best efforts to recover the property involved and recover the losses of the victims.
The prosecutor reminded everyone to be very vigilant against fraud crimes, don't expect "pie in the sky", and don't be credulous when you think it's cheap, and guard your own "money bag."
Yina Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province: Shorter apple trees widen the road out of poverty-Chinanews.com
2020-07-2611: 42: 58 Source: China Economic Net Author: Zhu Yanjing Responsible Editor: Zhu Yanjing
In the heat and heat, a reporter from Economic Daily-China Economic Net walked into Zhonghai Village, Yina Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province.
In the hot sun, villager Li Yuanzhong was weeding in the base. Although his face was red, he hummed a few small songs from time to time.
Weining County, where Yina Town is located, because of low latitude, high altitude, sufficient light, and large temperature difference between day and night, produces apples with high sugar content and good taste. It has a certain reputation in the surrounding area, but also because of its small size and many spots, it has not been able to sell a good price and has not been able to form an industrial scale.
Yina Town used to be a poverty-stricken township that "covered the valley with potato for spring and autumn", and the local poverty incidence rate was as high as 25.8% 10 years ago.
As the fight against poverty enters a critical period of decisive victory, it is urgent to change traditional planting habits, adjust the industrial structure, and increase farmers' income.
After many visits, Chen Chao, secretary of the Party Committee of Yina Town, and a group of people in the town believed that industrial development could not go the same way.
To this end, Yina Town introduced leading enterprises and planted apples in a modern way.
Hou Jianwen, deputy general manager of Weining Beyond Agriculture Co., Ltd. came to Yina Town from Shaanxi in 2015 to investigate, saw the local planting conditions at a glance, and began to plant apple trees there in 2016.
At first, the village mobilized Li Yuanzhong to transfer the land to plant apple trees, and Li Yuanzhong and his wife murmured in their hearts: "After planting apples for so many years, I didn't see who in the village planted apples and made a fortune."
"All the apples planted are dwarfed apples, which will not make the apple trees grow too tall."
What Li Yuanzhong did not expect was that this time the apple planting adopted a new method. The irrigation pipe was laid under each apple tree, and the water and fertilizer were poured to the roots of the tree. When the fruit was harvested in autumn, the tractor drove directly into the orchard and stood to pick the fruit.
At present, the apple base has gradually entered a productive period, and the market is as expected by Hou Jianwen. Apples are not worried about selling and are loved by consumers in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou.
The growing apple industry has brought new changes to Li Yuanzhong's life. Although he is still planting land, he has a new source of income.
Li Yuanzhong's family has more than 9 acres of land transferred to the apple base. In addition to the guaranteed land transfer fee, there are profit dividends after hanging the fruit. The couple usually work in the base. "One person can get 80 yuan a day, and there is work all year round."
Li Yuanzhong told reporters that last year's profit dividend earned more than 2,800 yuan, together with the land transfer fee and the couple's labor income, the family earned more than 80,000 yuan. "There is no worry about food and clothing, and a well-off life has been lived."
"At present, it has begun to bear fruit. The annual output value of 1 mu of apples exceeds 15,000 yuan, about 10 times that of corn."
Chen Chao told reporters that the whole town of Yina has currently planted 20,000 acres of apples, and there are 6,000 acres in Zhonghai Village alone, covering 4,056 households and 17,200 people, including 656 poor households and 2,952 people. The salary paid in a year is more than 6 million yuan, which truly realizes that the base is built in front of the home, and there is no need to go out for work.
Li Yuanzhong, whose waist is gradually bulging, has also begun to realize his "wish."
During the Lunar New Year this year, Li Yuanzhong bought a Land Cruiser and now drives his car to and from work every day. "There are more than a dozen acres of land in the family, so the next step is to expand the size of Apple's base and transfer it all to them, and the income will be more."

Membrane separation technology helps crack the "greenhouse effect "-Chinanews.com
Membrane separation technology helps crack the "greenhouse effect"
Schematic diagram of new hybrid matrix membrane preparation technology
Our reporter Shang Rui reported: Recently, the Tianjin University Atmospheric Environment and Bioenergy Team has made significant progress on the "membrane separation method to capture carbon dioxide" and has successfully developed a new hybrid matrix membrane preparation technology, which greatly improves the carbon dioxide capture performance of membrane materials.
The relevant results have been published as the cover article of the international journal "Greenhouse Gas: Science and Technology."
The "greenhouse effect" is a major environmental problem that plagues human development, and carbon dioxide emissions are the culprit responsible for the "greenhouse effect."
How to efficiently capture and use carbon dioxide emitted by humans is the focus of attention of scientists.
"Membrane separation method" is an emerging carbon dioxide capture technology. It separates carbon dioxide gas with the help of membrane materials, and has the characteristics of high efficiency, energy saving and simple operation.
How to let the membrane material "breathe deeply" and improve the efficiency of gas separation is the bottleneck difficulty in capturing carbon dioxide by membrane separation method.
The scientific research team of Tianjin University innovated ideas and explored the influence of different solvents on membrane gas separation performance through repeated experiments.
The experimental results show that with N-methylpyrrolidone as the preparation solvent, the carbon nanotubes in the produced membrane material are more evenly distributed and "more breathable", which effectively improves the gas separation efficiency and rate of the membrane material.
The carbon dioxide separation performance of the mixed matrix membrane prepared with this new technology is close to the current theoretical separation upper limit of such membrane materials.
"New technology provides new ideas for membrane separation to capture carbon dioxide."
Li Run, a member of the atmospheric environment and bioenergy team of Tianjin University, said: "We hope that this technology can provide strong support for coal-fired power plants and chemical companies to process flue gas in the future, and play a major role in controlling greenhouse gas emissions."
Before volunteering, understand what is a professional level difference-Chinanews.com
2020-07-2702: 22: 36 Source: Chongqing Morning News Author: Yu Xiao Responsible Editor: Yu Xiao
Understand what is a professional grade difference before volunteering.
Every year when you report for the college entrance examination, there are students or parents who do not understand the terms involved in the voluntary filing, which affects the voluntary filing.
This year, five colleges and universities including Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing University of Science and Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing Forestry University, and Beijing University of Chemical Technology jointly issued the 2020 admissions policy, eliminating the professional level difference.
What is the meaning of professional level difference, and what is the significance in voluntary filing?
There are three ways of professional distribution rules
Experts remind that before filling in a volunteer, you must read the "Admissions Regulations" of your favorite school and understand the admission rules of colleges and universities, including the transfer ratio, professional distribution rules, etc.
Professional distribution rules mean that after colleges and universities are transferred, there are three main methods for professional admission: Major priority, score priority, and professional grade difference.
The specific method used by colleges and universities will be specified in the "Admissions Regulations."
However, there are also some colleges and universities whose admission principle is that the total score is first, and there is no grade difference between majors.
That is to say, candidates in the admission range will be queued according to the total score. When the score does not reach the first professional volunteer admission score, it will be determined whether the second professional volunteer admission score line has been reached, and so on until the admission to the last professional volunteer, there is no grade difference between the professional volunteers.
The so-called "professional level difference" means that when colleges and universities arrange candidates' majors, they determine the admission majors of volunteer candidates from different majors according to one or several points announced in the admission charter. This score is the "professional level difference."
That is, the difference between the scores of colleges and universities when admitting candidates for the first professional volunteer and non-first professional volunteer, and the grade difference between the professional volunteers, such as 3 points, 2 points, 1 point, etc.
For example.
Suppose that student Xiaoming applied for college A and scored 560 points. His professional volunteers are: Computer, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering, e-commerce. The professional admission of college A adopts the method of professional grade difference, which is divided into 2 points, 1 point, 1 point, and 0 points.
When making professional assignments, if Xiaoming's first professional volunteer meets the professional admission requirements and the major has a planned balance, then Xiaoming is admitted to the "computer" major; if the computer is not admitted, his score will be subtracted by 2 points, and the score of 558 points will be sorted with the candidates of the first professional volunteer to apply for "international trade" to determine whether they meet the professional admission requirements; if it is still not met, the score is subtracted by 1 point (that is, 557 points) for the admission of the third professional volunteer "automation"; if it is still not satisfied, the score will be subtracted by 1 point (that is, 556 points) for admission to the fourth major. If the follow-up major still fails to meet his professional volunteers, there will be no further points reduction, and so on.
Different universities have different professional level difference settings
With the popularization of parallel volunteering, many colleges and universities have now eliminated the professional level difference, but some colleges and universities still retain this method this year. According to the "Admissions Regulations" announced by each school, more than 20 universities have set up professional level differences this year.
For example, Sichuan Agricultural University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University of Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Jiangxi Normal University, Chengdu Medical School, Northeast Electric Power University, Jiemei University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing University of Technology, Ningxia University, Shandong University of Technology, China Civil Aviation Flight Academy, etc.
In these colleges and universities, the professional level difference set by each university is different.
Some colleges and universities have a grade difference in each major, such as Ningxia University. Candidates whose files have been admitted to the school are admitted according to the order in which candidates fill in their professional volunteers.
And some universities have set up different professional level differences between different majors.
For example, Jiemei University, the total score of the professional volunteer level difference is 4 points, that is, the difference between the first professional volunteer and other professional volunteers is 3 points. There is no grade difference between other professional volunteers, which is regarded as parallel volunteers, and the professional level difference between other professional volunteers and transfer professional volunteers is 1 point.
When filling in the application, candidates and parents must carefully read the admission policy of the reported school to see if there is a professional level difference, and what is the form of the level difference. While fully considering the scores, they must also reasonably analyze the school and major to be selected. If the college explicitly adopts the grade difference method for admission in the admission charter, candidates should pay attention to the gradient between the majors when choosing a major to improve the chances of admission.

The first Atlantic hurricane this year made landfall in Texas, which was hit hard by the epidemic
The National Hurricane Center announced that morning that Hurricane Hannah reached a speed of 145 kilometers per hour and is expected to cause heavy rainfall in southern Texas and northeastern Mexico until next Monday, which in turn will cause rapid flooding.
At present, with the gradual advance to land, the custom has been weakened. Despite power outages in some areas, there is no casualty statistics report for the time being.
Some local officials in Texas are preparing to deal with tornadoes that are likely to occur along the coast.
President Trump said through Twitter that the office is closely monitoring the dynamics of Hurricane Hannah and Hawaiian Hurricane Douglas, and called on the public to listen to the emergency management information of the local government to protect families and property.
At the same time, the new crown epidemic in Texas is also rapidly worsening, and the number of infections continues to soar, with a total of more than 390,000 confirmed infections and more than 5,000 deaths.
When this hurricane strikes, the government will face the double problem of sheltering the homeless while preventing the epidemic from worsening again.

3-year-old girl in Belgium died of new crown virus infection-Xinhuanet
The Belgian health department said on the 24th that a 3-year-old girl died of a new crown virus infection and was the youngest person in the country to die of new crown disease.
Belgian health department spokesman Budwin Kateri said that the girl already had other serious diseases before contracting the new crown virus; in addition to this girl, an 18-year-old recently died of the new crown virus infection.
Katri said that 85% of newly diagnosed new crowns in Belgium last week were under 60 years old.
He reminded people who are healthy and younger not to take it lightly.
"Although it is rare for young people to die from new crown virus infection, no one is now immune."
Last week, the number of new confirmed cases of new crowns in Belgium increased by 89% over the previous week, and an average of 2.9 people died of the new crown virus infection every day, up from the daily average of 1.7 people in the previous week.
During the peak of the epidemic in Europe, the proportion of people infected with the new crown virus in the Belgian population was "among the best" in Europe.
Belgium has a population of more than 11 million.
The latest data shows that a total of 64,847 people in Belgium have been infected with the new crown virus.
Carter warned earlier this week that people must take action before the snowballs get bigger and bigger and eventually cause an "avalanche."
In order to curb the rebound of the epidemic, Belgian Prime Minister Sophie Vermes announced on the 23rd that the relevant regulations for people to wear masks in public places will be stricter, and the plan to further lift restrictive measures in August will also be suspended.

Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 25. Qiu Tenghua, Director of the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, said on the 25th that all APEC member economies should act together to fight the epidemic and promote economic recovery, and should avoid establishing unnecessary trade barriers in accordance with the rights and obligations stipulated by the World Trade Organization.
Qiu Tenghua made the above remarks when participating in a video conference of trade ministers to fight the new crown pneumonia epidemic convened by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) on the 25th.
At this meeting, the participating ministers exchanged views on the substantive plans that APEC can take to respond to the impact of the new crown pneumonia epidemic and promote economic recovery in the region.
Qiu Tenghua said that the public health and economic crisis triggered by the epidemic has had an unprecedented and far-reaching impact on society and the economy.
"We are in a double battle, and we must defeat the epidemic before we can save the economy.
We must have a clear goal, the virus is our common enemy, and cooperation can win, and vice versa will only fail. "
Qiu Tenghua said that the series of trade restrictions caused by the new crown pneumonia epidemic will not help control the epidemic.
Trade is the key solution to the current problem and should not be regarded as the problem.
He condemned all discriminatory and divisive policy measures, and urged all economies to keep their borders open at this critical moment, maintain the smooth operation of the supply chain, and avoid establishing trade barriers or adopting irrational trade policies.

Chengdu people gathered to watch the US consulate police prevent people from "looking too happy"
In response to the closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston by the United States, China announced on Friday that it would close the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu.
On Saturday, the badge of the U.S. Consulate was removed, and on Sunday, a dark glass car drove away from the consulate amid boos from passers-by.
On Sunday, many Chengdu people gathered in front of the US Consulate to take photos, and those who had not been there were also driven by curiosity about current events.
The AFP reporter from Chengdu Station also went to observe near the US Consulate in Chengdu and reported that there was a steady stream of curious people, and many parents took their children to take a walk to watch the consulate, take pictures of the building, or take their own photos.
The consulate was surrounded by guards, and the police "corrected" people's behavior from time to time. They seemed to not allow any unusual behavior: A woman was stopped as soon as she was about to sing a red song, and another guard confiscated a banner.
But residents of a nearby residential building successfully raised a giant Chinese flag on their balcony and shouted slogans in support of China.
The Chengdu American Consulate opened in 1985, covering all consular-related affairs of the United States in southwestern China, especially the Tibet Autonomous Region.
A reporter from the Agence France-Presse Chengdu station said that the Chinese government's response to the United States was relatively restrained: Many Chinese asked the government to close the US Consulate in Hong Kong online, but officials only said that "closing the US Consulate in Chengdu is a necessary and legal response to the unreasonable behavior of the United States."
At present, in addition to Chengdu, the United States has consulates in Guangdong, Shanghai, Shenyang, Wuhan, and Hong Kong in China.
Large-scale financial media action "Walking the Village Live to Watch Poverty Alleviation" Start-Today's Highlights-Hunan Daily News Network-Huaxing Online
Hunan Daily, New Hunan Client, July 25 (Reporter from this newspaper) On July 25, the large-scale financial media operation "Walking the Village Live to Watch Poverty Alleviation" hosted by the Financial Program Center of China Central Radio and Television set out from Xuzhou, Jiangsu. Two caravans carrying a 5G new media mobile cloud production and broadcasting system were seen by guests at the scene and drove slowly out of the scene.
General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that "2020 is a landmark year. We will build a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way and achieve the first centenary goal. 2020 is also a year of decisive victory in the fight against poverty."
The large-scale financial media operation "Walking the Village Live to Watch Poverty Alleviation" is an important measure taken by the Finance Program Center of China Central Radio and Television to cooperate with this major theme and do a good job in poverty alleviation.
This action will go into poverty alleviation villages in more than 20 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities across the country, dig out living poverty alleviation stories, directly attack the dramatic changes in the appearance of the village, and show how villagers can break through the dilemma of survival and development and move towards the road to wealth.
This operation will last more than 3 months.
The reporter set out from Xuzhou and took two routes, all the way to the southwest line, passing through Anhui, Hubei, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, Chongqing, Yunnan, Tibet and other places; the other way to the northwest line, passing through Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Hebei and other places, the journey exceeds 10,000 kilometers.
In terms of reporting format, "Walking the Village Live to Watch Poverty Alleviation" is a bold fusion.
The economic development of the villages visited by the caravan will be broadcast through CCTV Finance Channel, CCTV Economic Voice, China Communications Broadcasting, and CCTV Financial New Media.
Among them, the live TV broadcast will be completed mainly on the noon news program "World Finance" of CCTV Finance Channel (first broadcast time: Monday to Sunday 12: 00-13: 00), and the golden news section "Economic Information Network" of CCTV Finance Channel will open a column for poverty alleviation reports (first broadcast time: Monday to Sunday 20: 30-21: 30).
At the same time, the caravan will conduct a 1-hour live broadcast on the CCTV Finance client for each village it visits. By downloading CCTV Finance APP, the audience can watch the live broadcast and participate in the raffle.
In terms of technology application and studio design, "Walking the Village Live to Watch Poverty Alleviation" has the courage to make a breakthrough and pioneered the "Outfield New Media Caravan."
The car is equipped with a 5G new media mobile cloud production and broadcasting system, and uses 5G + 4K / 8K + AI technology to achieve an organic combination of online and offline, large and small screens, and television broadcasting.
Equipped with a Sanxun broadcast area, the broadcast area is converted from a container, with a length of 12 meters, a width of 2.55 meters, and a height of 3.98 meters. The box adopts a hydraulic automatic expansion structure, which can be turned up to 120 degrees.
The broadcast area can also be expanded automatically, with an external expansion platform, with an area of more than 50 square meters, which can meet the scene requirements of most programs.
At present, Dongchuan District of Kunming City is already hot in summer, and what is hotter than the weather is the poverty alleviation workshop next to the relocation site.
Lu Ling, an employee of Kunming Aisford Electronics Technology Co., said, "Now, as soon as you leave your home, you enter the factory door to make money and care for your family. Thanks to the free vocational skills training organized by the trade union."
Walking into the electronic component processing and poverty alleviation workshop in Tongdu Street, Dongchuan District, a busy picture came into view.
Lu Ling, in her 40s, is a single mother who takes care of her children alone and also takes care of her elderly parents.
In her most difficult time, the Dongchuan District Federation of Trade Unions helped to come up with ideas to find a way to "send charcoal in the snow" after running.
Since 2018, Lu Ling has enjoyed housing, schooling, social security, employment and other assistance policies and assistance payments issued by trade unions at all levels.
This year, her child has successfully graduated and taken up employment. She herself has a job and income after participating in skills training, and she got out of poverty at the end of April.
It is reported that the special skills training project of the Dongchuan District General Organization to help combat poverty is part of the skills training work of the Yunnan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions.
The district always combines the characteristics of the employees in difficulties in the relocation and resettlement sites for poverty alleviation in the area, conducts in-depth investigations to understand the training needs, and determines the types of training. In the near future, it plans to train a total of 450 electricians, welders, pastry chefs, etc.
Recently, Li Yi, an employee of the Yunnan Menglian County Branch of the Agricultural Bank, wrote a sincere thank-you letter to the County Federation of Trade Unions.
In the letter, she sincerely thanked the union for the golden autumn grant she received from August 2013 to January 2017 to help her complete her studies.
In 2004, Li Yi's father died in a car accident, and his mother was included in the file of employees in difficulties. Since then, she has been enjoying the care of the file establishment policy.
With the help of the local trade union, Li Yi successfully completed her studies.
Since 2016, 3,809 households have been lifted out of poverty through institutional guarantees and precise assistance.
The successful relief of Lu Ling's family and Li Yi is a microcosm of the work of Yunnan Trade Union to promote the relief of needy employees.
According to Duan Kaiyuan, a staff member of the Legal and Rights Protection Work Department of the Yunnan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the provincial general manager strengthened the dynamic management of the files of employees in difficulties, promoted the normalization of file-building work, and promptly incorporated into the assistance system for employees in difficulties who meet the requirements for file-building; broadened the application channels for employees in difficulties, and used WeChat to open an online file-building service platform for employees with difficulties, so as to facilitate employees in difficulties to file in a timely manner.
During the epidemic, it was difficult to go out to work. In order to help employees in difficulties alleviate the pressure of life, Yunnan Province has arranged a total of more than 13 million yuan to send warm funds. According to the national level of 2,000 yuan per household for employees in difficulties and the provincial level of 1,500 yuan per household for employees in difficulties, more than 6,000 national-level and more than 1,000 provincial-level employees in difficulties have implemented special warm condolences activities.
At the same time, the provincial general manager docked with various Internet recruitment platforms such as the Human Resources Department and Zhilian Recruitment to push recruitment information to employees in difficulties, and provide employment consulting, employment guidance and other services.
