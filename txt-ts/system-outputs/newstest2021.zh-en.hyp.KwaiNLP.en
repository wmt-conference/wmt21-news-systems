Xinhua Time Review: Turn outstanding returning migrant workers into a new force for rural revitalization - Xinhuanet
Talent is the key to rural revitalization.
Where to find talents?
The outstanding group of returning migrant workers is an indispensable force.
Xinhua News Agency, Shang haichun
Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 26 Title:  Building excellent migrant workers returning to their hometown into a new force for rural revitalization
The 34-year-old Zhang Xiong lives in Guoyuan Village, Meishan City, Sichuan. In 2010, he quit his job in Beijing with a monthly salary of tens of thousands and returned his hometown to start a business.
After several years of hard work, the annual income of the grape-growing family farm he manages now exceeds one million yuan, and he has become a well-known leader in getting rich. He has also been selected to join the village's "two committees" team.
In recent years, inspired by a series of policies to support agriculture and benefit agriculture, such as national poverty alleviation and rural revitalization, more and more outstanding migrant workers like Zhang Xiong have chosen to return home to start their own businesses, activating a pool of spring water in the countryside.
Sichuan, a province with a large population in western China and a large labor export province, has implemented the "Outstanding Migrant Workers Return Training Project" according to the situation. In 2019 alone, more than 8,000 village party branch secretaries were produced from among the outstanding migrant workers, 61,000 village reserve forces were cultivated, and more than 20,000 party members were developed, providing a strong guarantee for winning the battle against poverty and implementing the rural revitalization strategy.
Whether we are well-off or not depends on our fellow villagers.
Since the reform and opening up, a large number of young and middle-aged laborers in rural areas have gone out to work to increase their income, and some have set up their own enterprises through hard work.
However, objectively, it has also led to the emergence of "hollowing" in rural areas to varying degrees, especially the weakening of rural grassroots organizations. The village party branch secretaries and party members all show the characteristics of "one old and one low", that is, aging, low education, and the village party organization leader team is not strong, and the problem of non-compliance is prominent.
If rural talents and other factors have been flowing one-way to the city, and the countryside has been in a state of "blood loss" and "anemia" for a long time, revitalization is empty talk.
To attract back those migrant workers who are capable, conscious, and aspiring to serve their hometown, guide them to return to their homes to start businesses and become rich leaders, select and train party members and rural cadres from among them, and enrich the grassroots cadre team. This is a solution to the problem of rural party members and grassroots party organizations.
Outstanding migrant workers can be brought back, and they must be allowed to stay and do well.
In recent years, Sichuan has begun to pay close attention to the party building of migrant workers. On the basis of strict selection criteria, it has established institutional mechanisms such as directional referral, service guarantee, training, promotion, selection and use of outstanding migrant workers, so that they can improve their abilities, have security at work, have hope in life, and truly take root in the countryside, and have a sense of accomplishment in starting a business.
This year is the closing year of the decisive battle against poverty. To do a good job of linking poverty alleviation and rural revitalization, talent is the key factor.
Party committees and governments at all levels should attach great importance to the group of outstanding returning migrant workers, and through comprehensive measures, build them into a team and force that can be retained, can fight, and cannot be taken away, so as to provide a strong organizational guarantee and talent support for rural poverty alleviation and development and revitalization.
Because of the epidemic, this year's college graduates are a very special one. On the evening of July 11, the bilibili summer graduation song will bring a special live online performance for the graduates, musicians such as Lao Lang, Pu Shu, Li Yuchun, and Mao Buyi will send songs and blessings to the recent graduates.
Well-known up owner SealWu Wu Yifan also brought a "Weeds", which is a rap-style song based on Lu Xun's prose poetry collection of the same name, which is extremely popular among young people.
Due to the epidemic, many graduates failed to appreciate the ritual sense of setting ears and awarding degree certificates on the spot, so they transferred the sense of ritual to the online.
Statistics show that the popularity of this 2.5-hour song performance peaked at more than 35 million.
"Follow your heart, seize the opportunity, and ignore the consequences, sometimes there will be unexpected gains."
Although it is a graduation song party, many songs also moved non-recent graduates.
"I really want to cry when I watched the whole show. Everyone's youth is full of beauty and regrets, but they are all worth remembering, and we must go on bravely."
Beijing's natural ecology continues to improve, attracting more than 500 species of wild animals to "settle" in the city - chinanews.com

The capital's natural ecology continues to improve to attract wild animal cities to "settle"
There are more than 500 species of wild animals in Beijing
News from our newspaper (Reporter Wang Bin) A reporter from the Beijing Youth Daily learned from the Municipal Landscaping Bureau that in recent years, with the continuous improvement of the capital's natural ecological environment, the types and numbers of wild animals have continued to increase.
At present, the number of terrestrial spine wild animals that inhabit Beijing has increased to more than 500 species, including national first-class protected animals such as brown horse chicken and black stork, as well as national second-class protected animals such as gazelle, big swan, gray crane, and mandarin duck.
Whether it is planted into the urban forests in the second ring, or the small wetlands embedded in the buildings, it not only brings the wild interest of nature to the citizens of the capital, but also attracts wild animals to "settle" in the city.
In the midsummer season, the Songshan National Nature Reserve, located in the Yanshan Mountains in the northwest of Yanqing District, is full of vitality.
A raccoon was playing leisurely by the mountain stream, and two dog badgers were fighting each other.
Looking back, a wild boar can't help but scratch its body and is rubbing against the bark. Hu Qiaoli, director of the Songshan National Nature Reserve Management Office, introduced that as of the end of 2019, in this green sea with a total area of more than 6,200 hectares, there are 178 species of wild animals, including the national first-level protected animal golden eagle and the national second-level protected animal spoon chicken and antelope. Nearly one-third of the city's wild animal species can be seen here.
"In Songshan, wild animals are the real 'owners', and our staff can only be regarded as' bodyguards' at best."
Hu Qiaoli said that in order to understand the situation of wild animals and plants in the reserve on the ground, there are more than 30 professional rangers every day, patrolling along 16 carefully designed protection routes, and there will be a "big circle" every month, spending a whole day walking almost the entire reserve.
"During the inspection, it is not only necessary to check and record biodiversity, but also to inspect and install artificial bird nests, rescue injured wild animals, install field infrared cameras, etc."
Songshan National Nature Reserve has now installed more than 200 infrared cameras to record the living conditions of wild animals in the forest.
Hu Qiaoli introduced that with the continuous enrichment of biodiversity in the reserve in recent years, more and more wild animals have appeared in the lens. The leopard cat, raccoon and pig badger have become "resident guests", and the "appearance rate" of the national second-level protected animal antelope is also getting higher and higher.
Zhang Zhiming, director of the Wildlife and Wetland Protection Division of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Landscaping, introduced that the number of terrestrial spine wild animals in Beijing has increased from 461 species in 1994 to more than 500 now. The types and numbers of wild animals in Beijing have continued to increase in recent years.
The presence of wild animals in cities is becoming more common, which is closely related to the continuous upgrading of the greening of the capital city in recent years.
In particular, the new round of afforestation and greening construction of one million acres, which began in 2018, proposes to reshape the urban ecological environment, improve the ecological function of woodland green space, and highlight the concept of "near nature".
The planning strives to achieve interconnection and interaction with the surrounding green spaces to facilitate wild animals to "visit relatives and friends", and the trees planted are also honey sources and food plants that animals love.
I work on helping computers communicate with the world around us.
There are many ways to do this, and I like to focus on helping computers to talk about what they see and understand.
Given a scene like this, a modern computer vision algorithm can tell you that there's a woman and there's a dog.
It can tell you that the woman is smiling.
It might even be able to tell you that the dog is very cute.
I work on this problem thinking about how humans understand and live with the world.
The thoughts, memories and stories that a scene like this might evoke for humans.
All the interconnections of related situations.
Maybe you've seen a dog like this before, or you've spent time running on a beach like this one, and that further evokes memories and thoughts of past vacations, past times to the beach, times spent running around with other dogs.
One of my guiding principles is that by helping computers to understand what it's like to have an experience, to understand what we believe and feel in common, then we're in a position to start evolving computer technology in a way that's complementary to our experiences.
So, digging deeper into this, a few years ago I began working on helping computers to produce human-like stories from sequences of images.
So one day, while I was working on my computer, I asked it what it thought about a trip to Australia.
It took a look at the pictures and saw a koala.
It didn't know what the koala was, but it said it thought it was an interesting-looking creature.
Then I shared with the computer a series of images of a house burning down.
The computer took a look at the picture and it said, "This is an amazing view! This is spectacular!"
It sent chills down my spine.
The computer saw a terrible, life-changing and life-destroying event and thought it was a positive thing.
I realized that the computer recognized the contrast between red and yellow and thought it was something worthy of a positive review.
Part of the reason is because most of the images I put into the computer are positive images.
That's because people tend to share positive images when they talk about their experiences.
When was the last time you saw a selfie at a funeral?
I realized that in the process of improving AI, it was task by task, dataset by dataset, creating huge gaps, flaws and blind spots in the understanding of computers.
And while doing so, I was coding for all sorts of biases.
Prejudice reflects a limited view, and it comes from a single dataset -- one that reflects what humans share, such as prejudice and stereotyping.
I thought back to the evolution of the technology that brought me to where I was that day -- that the first color images were calibrated against a white woman's skin, meaning that color photography was biased against black faces.
And that same bias, that blind spot continued into the '90s.
The same blind spot exists even today in how well we recognize the faces of different people in facial recognition technology.
In today's research, I think of state-of-the-art technology that tends to limit our thinking to one dataset and one problem.
And in doing so, we're creating more blind spots and biases that can be further amplified when using artificial intelligence.
I realized then that we had to think deeply about how the technology we invent today will be viewed in five to ten years.
In the interaction between humans and the environment, humans take time to correct problems, so evolution is slow.
Artificial intelligence, by contrast, is evolving at an incredible rate.
And that means that it really matters that we think about this carefully now -- reflect on our own blind spots, our own biases, and consider how that's affecting the technology we're creating now, and discuss what today's technology will mean for the future.
CEOs and scientists have weighed in on what they think about the future of AI.
Stephen Hawking warns that "Artificial intelligence could end mankind."
Elon Musk warns that this is an existential risk and one of the greatest risks we face as a civilized society.
Bill Gates pointed out, "I don't understand why people aren't more worried about artificial intelligence."
But these views -- they're part of the story.
The math, the models, the basic building blocks of artificial intelligence are something that we can all access and use.
We have open-source tools to learn machines and make our own contributions at the same time.
And beyond that, we can share our experiences.
We can share in terms of technology and how it relates to us, and how it excites us.
We can discuss what we love.
We can communicate with the foreseeable future, and that might be more beneficial in terms of technology, or there might be more problems over time.
If we all focus on opening up the discussion on AI and looking to the future, this will help create a general conversation and awareness about what AI is, what it can become, and all the things we need to do to achieve the results that best suit us.
We already see and know this in the technology we use today.
We use smartphones, digital assistants and automatic vacuum cleaners.
Are they evil?
Maybe sometimes.
Are they beneficial?
Yes, they are, too.
They're not exactly the same.
And there you already see the light of the future.
The future continues on from what we build and create right now.
We set in motion the domino effect, which uncovers the evolutionary path of artificial intelligence.
In our time, we shape the AI of tomorrow.
Technology that immerses us in augmented reality, bringing to life the world of the past.
Technology helps people to share their experiences when they have difficulty communicating.
Technology built on online visual media that can be used in self-driving cars.
Technology that produces language based on the understanding of images can evolve into technology that helps the visually impaired to have a better understanding of the visual world.
We also see how technology can lead to problems.
We have technology today that analyzes the physical characteristics of our birth -- such as the color of our skin or the look on our face -- to determine whether we're criminals or terrorists.
We have the technology to process data, process data about gender or race, to determine if we can get a loan.
All that we see now is a snapshot of the evolution of artificial intelligence.
Because where we are now is a moment in evolution.
This means that what we do now will affect the future of things and the world of the future.
If we want AI to evolve in a way that helps humans, we need to define strategies and goals that enable that path right away.
What I want to see is the direction of development that suits human culture and the environment.
Technology can help us heal people with neurological conditions or other disabilities and make life equally challenging for everyone.
Technology that works regardless of your characteristics or the color of your skin.
What I focus on today is the technology of tomorrow and 10 years from now.
Artificial intelligence can turn out in many different ways.
But in this case, it's not a driverless car without any destination.
This is the car that we can drive at the same time.
We choose when to speed up and when to slow down.
We choose if we need to make a turn.
We choose what the AI of the future will be.
There will be a vast playing field where artificial intelligence can be everything.
It will become a lot of different things.
Now it's up to us to figure out what we need to put in place to ensure that the results of artificial intelligence will be better for all of us.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Black land "planted" out of agricultural modernization - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 26
In the midsummer, two spraying planes passed by the 10,000 mu high-yield demonstration field at the second operation station of the fifth management area of Friendship Farm, forming two white lines, and the big words "the first field in the world" planted with black rice seedlings in the green field stand out.
Kong Lingqiang, director of this operation station, said that this kind of plane can spray more than 6,000 acres of arable land a day, and the efficiency is about 8 times that of drones and hundreds of times that of humans.
This farm is located in Youyi County, Heilongjiang Province, my country's largest grain-producing province. From the sound of rice cutting in the past to the sound of "rumbling" motors today, traditional Chinese farming and farms have been transformed on this black soil belt.
In addition to airplanes, satellites are also used in the modern agricultural production of Friendship Farm.
Kong Lingqiang introduced that on the one hand, they use satellite remote sensing technology to achieve precise fertilization, reduce agricultural input, and reduce pollution; on the other hand, satellite navigation technology can improve the level of standardized agricultural machinery field operations.
In this year's rice production process, the farm expanded the operating area of satellite navigation unmanned rice transplanting technology from 3,000 mu last year to 30,000 mu.
This technology makes the planting of seedlings more uniform, maximizes the use of sunlight and arable land resources, and saves 16 yuan in labor costs per mu.
The farm tried new technologies such as informatization and intelligence in agricultural production, forming the largest agricultural machinery group in my country from the ground to the sky.
According to statistics, the total number of farm agricultural machinery currently stands at 49,000 units (pieces), and the comprehensive mechanization rate in the field has reached 99.8%.
Agricultural machinery operations achieve 100% GPS satellite navigation, 100% precision sowing in dry fields, and 100% operation in dry fields.
"Green agriculture, smart agriculture, and digital agriculture are the direction of agricultural modernization."
Liu Hualien, director of Friendship Farm, said.
The key to agricultural modernization lies in scientific and technological progress.
Heilongjiang Agricultural Reclamation, represented by farms, has played a demonstration and leading role in modern large-scale agriculture "aircraft carrier" in recent years, and has initially established a modern agricultural industry system dominated by large-scale planting, standardized production, and industrial management.
On the outskirts of Youyi County, there is an Agricultural Machinery Expo Park covering an area of 350,000 square meters.
Here is a centralized exhibition of more than 140 agricultural machinery and tools introduced and used by Heilongjiang Agricultural Reclamation over the years.
These agricultural machinery and farms have witnessed the development of China's agricultural modernization.
Small Home for All-Jiangkouhe Lianhe, Hefei, Anhui, Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, July 26 Title: Offering a small family home for everyone — the transfer of the masses in the Jiangkouhe Lianwei, Hefei, Anhui Province
Xinhua News Agency reporters Chen Shangying, Wang Liwu, Liu xiacun
At more than 4: 00 pm on July 25, Fu Kunbao, wearing rubber shoes covered with mud, went from the former house to the back room, and his wife Zhou Yan came back and forth busy packing things.
"When I received a call from a village cadre to transfer, I was still weeding in the field."
Fu Kunbao said that he has transferred more than 60 acres of land and planted rice, and is now growing well. "I also took medicine yesterday, and I haven't packed my tools yet."
Fu Kunbao pointed to the pesticide sprayer placed in the corner. "No one wants his home to be flooded, leave a small home for everyone."
In response to the continued high water level pressure and possible heavy rainfall in Chaohu Lake, Hefei City, Anhui Province, is preparing to open the Jiangkouhe Lianhe flood distribution and water storage at Fu Kunbao's home on the 26th.
Jiangkouhe Lianwei is located in Feixi County, next to the Chaohu dike.
There are thousands of villagers involved in Yan Dian Township and Sanhe Town in the polder who need to be transferred.
As of 16: 00 on the 25th, the water level of Chaohu Lake, my country's fifth largest freshwater lake, remained at a high level of 13.2 meters, 0.7 meters above the guaranteed water level.
Fu Kunbao's kitchen is clean and tidy. There is a pot of pumpkin head vegetables on the table, and there are eggs and some brine in the refrigerator.
"I didn't expect to move. The water in Jiangkouhe looks good at present."
Zhou Yan said that the home is a bungalow, and some large objects have not yet figured out where to put them.
"Pack up your valuables first, and large items such as refrigerators and televisions can be placed in the homes of high-lying neighbors or relatives for the time being."
Wang Lili, a village cadre, gave Fu Kunbao an idea.
Wang Lixi is responsible for the transfer and resettlement of 13 villagers, and notifies each household to confirm each person's resettlement plan.
The nearest resettlement site to Fu Kunbao's family is Su Primary School in Yan Dian Township, about 2 kilometers away.
In addition to the large items, Fu Kunbao and his wife have a headache with more than 1,000 kilograms of grain in the family and some newly bought furniture.
"The grain is ready to be dragged to a relative's house, and the furniture can't be moved."
As soon as the couple discussed, they put a stool under the newly bought bed and raised the bed by about half a meter.
At 6 pm, Fu Kunbao began to use a tricycle to transport things to relatives' homes. Zhou Yan continued to clean up at home.
At more than 11 o'clock in the evening, the couple looked back and forth at home, pulled the switch, and were ready to go to the resettlement site.
"I hope the water will retire early."
Fu Kunbao said.
At 9: 30 am on July 26, the reporter saw at the scene of Jiangkouhe Lianhe that the local area had made various preparations before flood distribution.
Zhang Jike and Lin Xiaozhai team up to support muscle youth - Xinhuanet
The sports youth hot-blooded sports show "Sports Boys" officially landed on Hunan Satellite TV on July 11.
Sports leader Zhang Jike and sports assistant Lin Xiaozhai cross-border on the same stage. Lin Dan and Fu Yuanhui commented on their own styles, and the hard core of the "giant" power pull device made the program "burn" full.
In the first episode, 11 sports teenagers appeared on the power track, and while the appearance of the audience was stunning, the "strong conflict" "strong confrontation" and "strong heart" on the arena also attracted attention.
Among them, the "strong conflict" comes from Super A sports student Qiao Wenyi, who openly challenged Xu Zhibin, who is known as the "Flower Beautiful Man" on the same track before the race, choked that Xu Zhibin's physical conditions should go to the singing and dancing program, and even released the cruel words "Don't cry when you lose".
Some remarks made the teenagers and sports leaders on the field take a breath.
And the "strong confrontation" is more like a fight between gods. Sun Jianqi, known as the "big devil", meets the equally powerful Zhang Xindong and staged a strong confrontation.
Their identities are also unexpected. Sun Jianqi is an actor who loves fitness, and Zhang Xindong is a retired special forces player and three-time Warrior Medal winner.
At the beginning of the game, the two teenagers tried their best to quickly pull out the small pole, and the lasting confrontation on the big pole made the audience sweat for them.
In the tense situation, Zhang Jike, as one of the sports leaders of "Sports Boys", was also watching the battle seriously.
In the comments section, he was also very careful, patiently encouraged the teenager who lost the game, and helped every mistake in the resumption process.
Sports assistant Lin Xiaozhai is a fancy assist, and she makes no secret of her appreciation for the teenagers who are online.
When I learned about the overloaded daily training of sports teenagers, I was even more impressed.
Lin Dan and Fu Yuanhui, who are also sports leaders, have their own styles, one is a calm "prophet" and the other is a "flood girl" who uses a smile to dispel the tension.
In addition, Jike Junyi and Liu Ye, as sports assistants, have also created a lot of laughing topics around sports teenagers.
Church fire in Nantes, France: Parish volunteers admit to arson and silence - chinanews.com
Chinanews.com, July 26. According to foreign media reports, on July 18, the religious and historical architectural treasures of Nantes, France, and the famous Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul were severely damaged in a fire, and the large pipe organ was completely destroyed.
On the 26th local time, the Nantes prosecutor announced that a diocese volunteer in charge of defense work in the cathedral had been charged with "arson and destruction".
He has admitted that he set the fire in the church.
According to the report, local prosecutor Senas said that the 39-year-old diocese volunteer from Rwanda admitted that he had set fire to three places in the cathedral at night.
The person's lawyer said that the arsonists now regret doing such a thing.
This person entered France by way of asylum a few years ago, was sheltered in the parish where the fire occurred, and was taken in in the church.
The prosecutor pointed out that recently, he tried to renew his visa and was in dialogue with the police station about this.
But the church said it still couldn't believe that this believer, who is usually very kind and smiling, but doesn't talk much, will destroy the church he loves so much.
On the day of the fire on July 18, the volunteer had been questioned and investigated by the police because of logical problems in the narrative, but he was later released.
The picture shows firefighters rescuing at the scene.
On the evening of the 25th, as professional engineers from the laboratory of the Paris Central Police Department obtained new evidence, this person was summoned again.
This time, the man admitted to his arson.
According to reports, if convicted of deliberate arson and destruction, the suspect may face 10 years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros.
According to reports, the fire caused serious damage to the Cathedral of St. Pierre and St. Paul. The pipe organ in the church was completely burned, and the stained glass window behind the pipe organ was also severely damaged.
Brunet, the chief architect of the French historic preservation building, believes that it is conservatively estimated that the restoration of the Nantes Cathedral will take at least 3 years.
Comprehensive news: U.S. unilateralism undermines relations between the two countries. International public opinion supports China's countermeasures against the United States - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26. Comprehensive Xinhua News Agency reporters abroad reported: On the morning of July 24, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the U.S. Embassy in China that China had decided to revoke the establishment and operation license of the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu, and put forward specific requirements for the Consulate General to cease all business and activities.
International public opinion believes that the unilateral measures taken by the United States have caused serious problems in Sino-US relations. China has responded to the unreasonable provocations of the United States, and it is legitimate and necessary to take countermeasures.
Andrés Borks, director of the China Studies Center of the Institute of International Studies of the University of Chile, said that the unilateral measures of the United States have destroyed the bridge of understanding between the peoples of China and the United States and caused the relationship between the two major powers to encounter a crisis.
China's notification to the United States to close its Consulate General in Chengdu is a countermeasure to the unilateral measures of the United States and conforms to diplomatic practice.
Patricio Giusto, a professor at the Catholic University of Argentina and director of the Arab-Chinese Research Center, believes that the above-mentioned Chinese decision is a legitimate and necessary countermeasure to the previous provocation of the United States, and is not aimed at ordinary Americans.
The United States tried to use pressure on China to cover up its inadequate response to COVID-19 and divert the attention of the American people.
Bambang Suryono, chairman of the Asian Innovation Research Center, an Indonesian think tank, said that the provocative diplomatic stance adopted by the United States has caused serious problems in Sino-US relations, and bilateral relations are facing severe challenges.
China's notification to the United States to close its Consulate General in Chengdu is a normal countermeasure and conforms to diplomatic practice. It not only reflects China's principled position of resolutely safeguarding its own interests, but also reflects the rational and beneficial nature of China's diplomacy.
Tanzanian current affairs commentator Francis Semwinza said that China's above decision is a legitimate and necessary response to the provocation of the United States.
For Sino-US relations to return to normal, the US should take the initiative to improve relations with China and stop interfering in China's internal affairs.
The United States should focus on how to achieve a win-win situation with China economically and politically, and how to benefit the two peoples and the entire international community.
Ali Yousef, executive director of the Arab-China Friendship Association Federation based in Sudan, said that the countermeasures that China was forced to take were a legitimate and necessary response to the unreasonable actions of the United States, in accordance with international law and the basic norms of international relations, as well as diplomatic practice.
The previous US request to close the Chinese Consulate General in Houston seriously violated international law and the basic norms of international relations.
It is hoped that the United States will rescind the previous relevant decisions and create the necessary conditions for the return of bilateral relations to normal.
Singapore's "Lianhe Zaobao" published an editorial saying that the greater strategic intention of the United States is to contain China and prevent China from continuing to rise.
In the face of the tight pace of the United States, although China is very reluctant to see Sino-US relations continue to deteriorate, it has to take countermeasures.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 26 (Reporter Mao Xin) The reporter learned from the Guangdong Maritime Police Bureau that recently, the Bureau, in conjunction with the Guangzhou Customs and Public Security Department, knocked out a large-scale smuggled refined oil gang. It was initially verified that the gang has smuggled about 120,000 tons of refined oil since 2019, with a case value of about 800 million yuan, and tax evasion of about 240 million yuan.
The Guangdong Maritime Police Bureau and the customs anti-smuggling department have gradually mapped out the division of labor and organizational structure of the gang.
On July 8, the Maritime Police, Customs, and Public Security Departments respectively carried out a unified network collection operation in Guangzhou, Foshan and other places, as well as in the Pearl River Estuary. Four suspected smuggling ships were seized on the spot, and a total of 4,700 tons of refined oil were seized from the ships and oil depots involved, respectively, and a batch of fund accounts were frozen.
It is understood that the joint operation dispatched a total of 8 ships and 2 helicopters, divided into multiple action teams to coordinate operations, and carried out a full-chain attack on sea smuggling and illegal operations on land. All 35 major criminal suspects were present.
The case is currently under further investigation.
The relevant person in charge of the Guangdong Maritime Police Bureau said that in the future, it will continue to maintain a high-pressure situation, crack down on various illegal and criminal activities of smuggling at sea, and maintain good order in the waters under its jurisdiction.
Hurricane "Hannah" landed in Texas or caused river surges and flash floods - chinanews.com
Chinanews.com, July 26. Comprehensive foreign media reported that at 5: 00 pm local time on the 25th, Hurricane "Hannah" landed in Texas, United States, which will bring strong winds and heavy rains to Texas, soaring rivers, and may also cause life-threatening flash floods.
The National Hurricane Center said that Hurricane "Hannah" is expected to carry heavy rains across parts of southern and northeastern Texas, and the rain may cause some streams to surge and life-threatening flash floods.
According to the report, the most severely affected by Hurricane "Hannah" is the area south of Corpus Christi to the mouth of the Rio Grande River, and the Rio Grande Valley may experience widespread flash floods.
Texas Governor Abbott said on the 25th: "Any hurricane is a huge challenge."
Thirty-two counties in the state entered a disaster emergency due to the hurricane.
Corpus Christi, a city with a population of more than 320,000, has closed libraries and museums, and residents are waiting.
Abbott also said that as Texas is hit hard by COVID-19, the hurricane cannot be allowed to bring more casualties to Texas.
According to reports, precipitation in southern Texas is expected to reach 6 to 12 inches on the night of the 26th, and 3 to 5 inches of rainfall will also occur in northern Texas and coastal areas of Louisiana.
Due to global warming and other factors, the formation of "Hannah" predates the previous Atlantic hurricane season.
In general, the first hurricane in the Atlantic usually does not form until mid-August.
Poland will withdraw from the European Treaty on violence against women
The Polish Ministry of Justice said on Saturday that Poland will take steps next week to withdraw from the European Treaty on the Prevention of Violence against Women.
The cabinet of the Polish right-wing government said that the treaty requires schools to teach students about gender issues, trampling on the rights of students' parents.
Polish Justice Minister Giobro held a press conference and said that his Ministry of Justice will submit a request to the Ministry of Labour and Family to start withdrawing from the treaty on Monday.
That treaty is also known as the Istanbul Convention.
Giobro said, "The treaty contains some elements that we think are harmful to the ideological nature of the meaning."
Poland's ruling Law and Justice Party and its ruling coalition partners have a close alliance with the Roman Catholic Church and promote a conservative social agenda.
Polish President Duda made hostility to gay rights one of the main issues during his successful re-election campaign this month.
On Friday, thousands of Poles (most of them women) held protests against withdrawal from the convention in Warsaw and other cities.
Lempat, one of the organizers of the protest, said in a protest march in Warsaw that "the purpose of withdrawing from the treaty is to legalize domestic violence."
Some protesters held up banners that read "Law and Justice Party is a hell for women."
The Law and Justice Party has long complained about the Istanbul Convention.
The previous centrist government in Poland ratified the convention in 2015.
The Law and Justice Party government stated that the treaty does not respect religion and requires that liberal social policies be taught in schools.

Brazilian President's COVID-19 test result truns negative - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Brasilia, July 25 (Reporter Zhou Xingzhu) Brazilian President Bolsonaro announced on his personal social media account on the 25th that his latest test for COVID-19 was negative.
In addition to publishing the latest test results, Bolsonaro also posted photos of himself holding a hydroxychloroquine kit on social media.
Bolsonaro has always insisted that this drug can effectively treat COVID-19 infections, and has repeatedly shown that he is taking this drug through social media live broadcasts.
According to Brazilian media reports, Bolsonaro drove a motorcycle after announcing the results of the virus test that day, went to many places in the capital Brasilia, and also met with a Congressman.
Previously, Bolsonaro had been working in isolation at the presidential residence.
Bolsonaro announced in a joint live broadcast of several local media on the 7th of this month that he himself tested positive for COVID-19 on the 6th, and conducted two more tests on the 14th and 21st, both of which were positive.
Jiangxi opens up a "green channel" for young people on the front line of flood fighting to join the army - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, July 26 (Guo Dongming, Xiong Liang) The Recruitment Office of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government recently made it clear that individuals or their children who have excelled in this flood relief and disaster relief mission meet the recruitment requirements, and those who are both qualified in medical examinations and political examinations will be given priority.
"After the young conscripts are registered, we will jointly check with the communities where the young conscripts are located, the street armed forces department and the recruitment office of Xunyang District, and give priority to the soldiers."
Wang Hui, deputy minister of the People's Armed Forces Department of Ningyang District, Jiujiang City, said that affected by the floods, they began to concentrate on 3 days to organize medical examinations for young candidates from the 25th.
Zhou Jingfan, a 22-year-old college graduate from Xunyang District, Jiujiang City, is a 22-year-old college graduate. His mother is a community worker and his father is a veteran of a certain department of the Air Force. Zhou Jingfan's parents have been on duty on the front line of flood control and flood fighting for more than ten days.
"These days, I see in the news that the people's soldiers are desperate to defend their hometown on the front line of flood fighting. I also want to be like them."
Zhou Jingfan said that he had a dream of joining the army since he was a child, and his determination to join the military camp was strengthened by this flood fight.
Jiujiang City also regards flood fighting and rescue as a "living teaching material" for conscription propaganda. They use the community as a unit to call on young conscripts to volunteer to participate in tasks such as patrolling dikes and on duty. They now understand the nature and purpose of the people's army and strengthen their confidence in joining the army and serving the country.
Luo Jiuyu, political commissar of the People's Armed Forces Department of Jiuyang District, Jiujiang City, said that by giving priority to the recruitment of soldiers, he hopes to motivate more young conscripts and create a good social atmosphere in which it is glorious to participate in missions and join the army.
According to the Vietnam News Agency, Grivori believes that Vietnam has made great contributions to the development of ASEAN in the past 25 years.
Vietnam is not only a responsible member of ASEAN, but also the locomotive of ASEAN.
Grivori said that Russia and even the Asia-Europe Economic Union believe that Vietnam has contributed to ASEAN to improve its status and promote its image abroad.
He emphasized that "ASEAN should therefore thank Vietnam."
Grivori said that analysts recognize Vietnam's peace initiative.
Vietnam is willing to share its experience with ASEAN countries and propose constructive peace measures on the problems facing the Asia-Pacific region, including the East China Sea issue.
With regard to the cooperation between Vietnam and Russia under the ASEAN framework, Grivori believes that Vietnam provides support for the cooperative relationship between Russia and ASEAN and helps Russia gain benefits under this cooperation framework.
The Asia-Europe Economic Union, including Russia, can enter the ASEAN market after signing a free trade agreement with Vietnam.
Grivori proposes to maximize the free trade area between the Asia-Europe Economic Union and ASEAN countries, thereby creating a platform for economic and security stability.
Grivori also believes that Russia, Vietnam and ASEAN are on the right track and will achieve their goals.
From now until the end of 2020, Beijiang Province will have the necessary conditions, especially in terms of infrastructure, human resources and land, in order to proactively welcome the inflow of foreign capital, especially multinational groups that have value chains and transfer advanced technology.
In addition, Beijiang Province will complete the submission of the Prime Minister's decision to invest in infrastructure construction and operation projects in the Vietnam-Korea Industrial Zone and approve the addition of the province's two industrial-urban-service areas, Anshan-Beilong and Angao, to the overall plan for the development of Vietnam's industrial zone to 2020.
At the same time, Beijiang Province is working hard to accelerate the progress of various projects, especially the infrastructure construction and operation projects of industrial park clusters such as Hefu, Gwangzhou, Shuangxi-Neihuang, etc., to form a land fund for attracting investment.
In 2020, the Beijiang Provincial Bureau of Industry and Trade will provide suggestions and suggestions on the planning of industrial zones and industrial clusters for inclusion in the provincial planning.
Beijiang Province has determined to combine the development of industrial park clusters with ensuring national defense security, protecting the ecological environment, and ensuring food security, thereby promoting the balanced development of industry; it has comprehensive infrastructure such as electricity, water supply, transportation and telecommunications, and is integrated with urban construction, trade services, workers' housing and other social infrastructure such as health care, education, etc.

In the industrial park cluster, the province calls for small and medium-sized investment projects in the production and utilization of local labor, especially in the fields of agricultural products and food processing.
In the future, Beijiang Province will focus on accelerating investment in the infrastructure of the logistics and logistics center of Beijiang City, and develop simultaneously with the industrial park cluster to optimize the circulation of goods and money and help reduce production costs, increase the value of goods, optimize the supply chain, and develop multimodal transport, thereby creating attractiveness for investors to invest in the province.
The upgraded version of the Russian armed helicopter card-52m was first produced at the end of the year - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 25. According to the plan of the Russian Ministry of Defense, the upgraded version of the Russian armed helicopter (hereinafter referred to as Wuzhi) Ka-52-Ka-52m will be completed for the first time in December this year. The model will be greatly improved in terms of reconnaissance, communications and weapon performance.
According to a recent report by the Russian "Yediot", the Wuzhika-52m is called the "Super Alligator". Its development contract was signed by the Russian military and military industrial units in April last year. At present, the first two of the upgraded version of Wuzhi are undergoing transformation and replacement at the Far East Helicopter Manufacturing Plant of the Russian "Progress" Aerospace Group. Its national-level testing and improvement will be completed by October 2022.
According to Russian experts who understand the above-mentioned upgrade work, the "predecessor" of the "super alligator" - Wuzhika-52 - was officially installed in November 2011. The model revealed some weaknesses in use. This renovation and upgrade is precisely to "make up for shortcomings".
According to the report, compared with the Ka-52, the Ka-52m will partially adopt new protective materials that will not increase weight. Its pilot cockpit will be reinforced and equipped with new equipment to resist missile attacks, thereby increasing the probability of battlefield survival; a more powerful generator will be assembled to power more complex airborne electronic equipment; the photoelectric system will be upgraded to detect and identify more distant battlefield targets; the new light multi-purpose missile equipped with major attack armored combat vehicles and reinforced concrete fortifications has a range of up to 20 kilometers, which is about double the range of similar missiles used by Russia's active armed forces; its defense weapons and communication equipment will be used as much as possible with the Mi-28NM armed helicopters that can attack air targets, making related maintenance simple and economical.
In addition, the Ka-52m will have more advanced electronic guidance systems, weapon targeting systems and navigation equipment.
Russian experts also said that it is worth noting that the Ka-52m will be equipped with communication equipment to communicate with drones, so as to obtain real-time information transmitted by nearby drones in the air, such as displaying images taken by drones on the cockpit screen of the helicopter.
According to the plan, the pilot of the Ka-52m can directly control the drones that cooperate with it, thereby improving the pilot's grasp of the battlefield situation and the guidance of long-range missiles.
According to Russian media reports, Russian Deputy Defense Minister Krivoruchko said in December last year that the Russian Ministry of Defense plans to purchase more than 110 Wuzhika-52Ms by 2027.
The new law stipulates that indoor public places in Campania must wear masks from now on, and violators can be fined up to 1,000 euros.
On June 1, local time, the Colosseum in Rome, the capital of Italy, reopened.
According to reports, according to the latest epidemic prevention decree issued by the regional government, people in Campania must wear masks in all public transportation, as well as in and out of shops, bars, supermarkets and exhibition halls.
Those who violate this regulation can be fined up to 1,000 euros.
The decree also stipulates that all passengers from non-Schengen countries entering the Campania region must be quarantined.
The regional government will authorize health agencies to coordinate arrangements for specific hotels to isolate positive asymptomatic people.
The decree came into effect on July 25.
In less than an hour, three customers who entered the supermarket have accepted the fine.
Hebei River and Lake Ecological Water Supply 1.75 billion cubic meters since this year - chinanews.com
Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, July 26 (Reporter Wang Kun) The reporter learned from the Hebei Provincial Water Resources Department that since the beginning of this year, Hebei Province has coordinated the use of river diversion water and local reservoir water, and has successively implemented ecological water replenishment to 28 rivers and Baiyangdian, including the Hutuo River, Tanghe River, and Baiyangdian River. A total of 1.75 billion cubic meters of ecological water replenishment has been completed.
Hebei Province firmly grasped the favorable opportunity of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project to increase the flow of water, and used the diversion of river water to implement ecological water replenishment to rivers such as the Tang River, the Shahe River, and the Shuilong River.
At the same time, nine large and medium-sized reservoirs such as Xiyang and Dongwushi and Baiyangdian have been used to implement ecological water replenishment to rivers such as Liangyang River and Qinglong River, resulting in a cumulative water surface area of more than 90 square kilometers.
In order to do a good job in ecological water replenishment, the Hebei Provincial Department of Water Resources actively organizes the investigation of hidden dangers in water replenishment rivers, rectification and reinforcement, and river cleaning, refines practical measures, and strengthens inspection and management.
Through supervisory inspections and centralized unannounced visits, various problems were resolved in a timely manner to ensure the safe and orderly replenishment of the river.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Hebei Provincial Water Resources Department, the orderly implementation of river and lake ecological water replenishment has effectively restored the river and lake water ecological environment in Hebei Province, promoted the recharge and conservation of coastal groundwater, and greatly improved the living environment and economic development environment along the route. It is of great significance to achieve the goal of river and lake management and protection of "clear water, green shores, smooth rivers, and beautiful scenery".
You all know the truth of what I'm going to say.
I think the intuition that inequality can cause social fragmentation and corruption has been around since before the French Revolution.
The difference is that we can now find evidence that we can compare societies, societies with different levels of equality, to understand the effects of inequality.
I'm going to show you some data and explain why that data is actually related.
But first, let's see how miserable our lives are.
(Laughter) I'd like to start my speech with a paradox.
This shows you life expectancy in relation to gross national income -- how rich countries are on average.
You see the countries on the right, like Norway and the United States, are twice as rich as Israel, Greece, Portugal on the left.
But that doesn't affect their life expectancy.
There's no suggestion of a relationship.
But if we look within our societies, we can see that there are huge differences in health within their entire societies.
This is still life expectancy.
These are small towns in England and Wales -- the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.
There's a big difference between the poor and the rest of us.
Even the people just below the top have poorer health than the people at the top.
So income means a lot in our societies, but it doesn't make sense in comparison between societies.
The explanation of that paradox is that, in our societies, we're looking at relative income or social status, social status -- where we are in relation to each other and the size of the differences between us.
As soon as you have that idea, you should immediately wonder: What happens if the gap widens, what if it narrows, widens or narrows the income gap?
That's what I'm going to tell you.
I'm not using any hypothetical data.
My data comes from the United Nations -- like the World Bank -- on the income differences between these rich, developed market democracies.
The method we use, simple and easy to understand, and you can download it, is to compare the income differences between the top 20 percent and the bottom 20 percent in each country.
You can see that the countries on the left are more equal -- Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden -- and the top 20 percent are about 3.5 to 4 times as rich as the bottom 20 percent.
But on the more unequal end -- U.K., Portugal, USA, Singapore -- the income differences are twice as large.
In this way, our country (the UK) is twice as unequal as some of the other successful democratic markets.
Now I'm going to show you what that does to our societies.
We collected data on problems with social gradients, which are more common at the bottom of the social ladder.
Internationally comparable data include life expectancy, children's maths and literacy scores, infant mortality rates, suicide rates, proportion of the population in prison, teenage pregnancy rates, levels of trust, obesity, mental illness -- which in standard diagnostic classification includes drug and alcohol addiction -- and social mobility.
We put all of this into one coefficient.
They're all weighted equally.
A country's score is the average of these factors.
As you can see, these scores are related to the inequality comparison I've just shown you, and I'm going to show that data over and over again.
The more unequal countries do worse on all kinds of social problems.
There's a very strong correlation.
But if you look at the same index of health and social problems in relation to gross national income per capita and gross national income, there's nothing there, no correlation anymore.
We were a little bit worried that people might think that we were choosing specific problems to suit our theories and then artificially creating evidence, so we also published a paper in the British Medical Journal on the UNICEF index of child well-being.
It has 40 different parts, summed up by others.
It includes whether children can talk to their parents, whether they have books at home, what immunization rates are, and whether there's bullying at school.
Everything goes into it.
So that's how the index relates to the same level of inequality.
Children do worse in the more unequal societies.
Highly significant relationship.
But again, if you look at the relationship between child well-being and national income per capita, you're going to get nowhere. There's no suggestion of a relationship.
All the data I've shown you so far reveals the same thing.
The average well-being of our societies is no longer dependent on national income and economic growth.
They're very important in poorer countries, but not in the rich developed world.
And the differences between us and where we are in relation to each other now seem very important.
Now I'm going to show you some of the parts of our index.
This is the mutual trust index.
It's the proportion of the population who agree that most people can be trusted.
This is data from the World Values Survey.
You see, on the more unequal side, about 15 percent of the population feel they can trust others.
But in the more equal societies, it rises to 60 or 65 percent.
If you look at measures of participation in community activities or social capital, there are very similar relationships closely related to inequality.
I would say, we did this work twice.
We did it first on these rich developed countries, and then we changed the test and repeated it on the 50 American states -- asking the same question: Do the more unequal states do worse on all of these measures?
This is the relationship between trust and inequality in a general social survey conducted by the federal government.
Very similar scatter over a similar range of levels of trust.
The same thing is going on.
Basically we found that almost all of the factors related to trust that are reflected in international surveys are also reflected in the 50 states that we surveyed separately.
This is no coincidence.
This is mental illness.
The World Health Organization collects data using the same diagnostic interviews on random samples that allow us to compare rates of mental illness in each society.
This is the proportion of the population with any mental illness in the previous year.
It goes from about 8 percent to more than 24 percent -- which means that society as a whole is three times as likely to have mental illness as any other society.
Again, these are closely related to inequality.
This is the crime rate.
The red dots are American states, and the blue triangles are Canadian provinces.
But look at the differences in their numbers.
The murder rate goes from 15 homicides per million up to 150.
This is the proportion of the population in prison.
This is a tenfold difference, and the exponential function will magnify the difference.
But the changes in the prison population range from 40 to 400.
Crime is not the main reason for this relationship.
In some places, crime can explain part of the reason.
But it's more about harsher sentencing, or harsher sentencing.
The more unequal societies are more likely to retain the death penalty.
This is children dropping out of high school.
Again, there's a big difference.
If we discuss the selection of social talents, we can see that this gap is very damaging.
This is social mobility.
It's actually a measure of mobility based on income.
Basically, it's asking: Do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons, or is there no relationship between the two?
On the more unequal side, fathers' income is more important -- in the U.K., USA.
And in northern Europe, fathers' income is less important.
There's more social mobility.
As we often say -- and I know there are a lot of Americans in the audience here -- if Americans want to realize their "American dream", they should go to Denmark.
(Laughter) (Applause) I've shown you in italics here.
I can also show you some other problems.
Those problems are more common at the bottom of the social gradient.
But there are endless problems with social gradients that are worse in unequal countries -- not just a little bit worse, but anything from twice as common to 10 times as common.
Think of the expense, the human cost.
I'd like to go back to this graph that I showed you earlier where we put it all together to make two points.
First, in graph after graph, we find that the countries that do worse, whatever the outcome, seem to be the more unequal ones, but the ones that do well seem to be the Nordic countries and Japan.
So what we're looking at is the relationship between general social disorder and inequality.
It's not just one or two things that go wrong, it's almost everything.
The other very important point I'd like to make on this graph is that if you look at the bottom, Switzerland and Japan, they're very different countries in all sorts of ways.
The status of women, the extent to which they stick to the nuclear family, are at two extremes in the rich developed world.
But another very important difference is how they achieve greater equality.
Sweden has big differences in income, but it uses taxes, state benefits, generous benefits and so on to close the gap.
Japan is rather different.
First of all, Japan has a smaller pre-tax wage gap.
It has lower taxes.
It also has a smaller welfare state.
And in our study of the American states, we find a stark contrast.
Some states do well through redistribution, while others do well because they have smaller income differences before tax.
So we conclude that it doesn't matter how you achieve greater equality, what matters is that you can achieve that equality.
I'm not talking about complete equality, I'm talking about what does exist in rich developed market democracies.
Another surprising thing about this graph is that it's not just the poor who are affected by inequality.
There seems to be some truth in John Donne's words: "No man is an island."
Through a series of studies, we can compare the behavior of people at each social level in more or less equal countries.
This is just one example.
This is infant mortality.
According to the British General Socio-Economic Classification, some Swedes very kindly classified a lot of infant deaths.
This is an anachronistic classification based on fathers' occupations, so single mothers have their own set of data.
But when we look at the so-called "lower social classes", it's unskilled manual work.
In the middle are skilled manual jobs, then advanced non-manual jobs, up to professional jobs -- doctors, lawyers, managers of large companies.
You can see here that Sweden is doing better than Britain, doing better at every level of society.
The biggest differences are at the bottom of society.
But even at the top, living in a more equal society has some advantages.
We showed five different sets of data covering educational outcomes and health in the United States and internationally.
It seems that on the whole -- the more equal societies show the most obvious differences at the bottom, but they also have some advantages at the top.
I should explain what's going on.
I think I'm showing and discussing the psychosocial effects of inequality.
It's more about feelings of superiority and inferiority, being valued and looked down upon, respected and devalued.
Of course, the feelings generated by the competition for status drive the consumerism of society.
But it also leads to status insecurity.
We worry more about how we're judged and seen by others, whether we're attractive, smart, all that sort of thing.
Social-evaluative judgments increase the fear of these social-evaluative judgments.
Interestingly, some similar work is going on in social psychology: Some people reviewed 208 different studies in which volunteers were invited to a psychological laboratory and then tested for their stress levels and their responses to doing stressful tasks.
In this observation, scientists were interested in what kind of stress is most likely to raise levels of cortisol, the most important stress hormone.
The result is tasks that include social-evaluative threats -- tasks that threaten self-esteem and social status -- tasks in which others can negatively judge your performance.
These stresses have a very particular effect on the physiology of stress.
So far we have been criticized.
Of course, there are people who don't like this, and people who find this very surprising.
But I should tell you that when people criticize us for picking and choosing data, we never do so.
We have an unconditional rule that if our data source contains data for the country we're looking at, then we incorporate it into the analysis.
Our data source determines whether the data is valid, not us.
Otherwise it would be biased.
What about other countries?
There are 200 studies of health in relation to income and equality in the academic peer-reviewed journals.
This is not confined to these countries here, but it hides a very simple proof.
The same countries, the same measure of inequality, one problem after another.
Why don't we control other factors?
I've shown you that per capita national income doesn't make any difference.
Of course, others have used more sophisticated methods in the literature to rule out poverty, education and other factors in the experiment.
What about causality?
Correlation in itself does not prove causality.
We spent a good bit of time.
Indeed, people have a good understanding of the causality of our outcomes.
The biggest change in our understanding of the drivers of long-term health in the rich developed world is how important chronic stress from society is affecting the immune system and the cardiovascular system.
Or for example, the reason why violence is becoming more common in more unequal countries is because people are sensitive to being looked down upon.
I would say that in order to solve this problem, we have to deal with the post-tax and pre-tax problems.
We should limit income and curb the bonus culture at the top.
I think we have to do everything we can to hold our leaders accountable to their employees.
I'd like to conclude by saying that we can improve our real quality of life by reducing the differences in income between us.
In this way, we'll find that we've suddenly solved the psychosocial well-being of an entire society, and that's amazing.
Thank you.

(Deutsche Welle Chinese website) In the past two weeks, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Spain has rebounded significantly, with thousands of new cases in many days.
The British government temporarily decided on the evening of Saturday (July 25) to remove Spain from the safe travel list from 0: 00 local time on the 26th, and people entering the United Kingdom from Spain must be quarantined for 14 days.
British tourists who were on holiday in Spain expressed surprise, worry, and even anger when they heard about this decision, because the news was sudden and caught off guard.
According to reports, British Transport Secretary Grant Shapps is also currently on holiday in Spain.
Before the UK issued the quarantine measures, Norway had also announced that people returning to Norway from Spain would be quarantined for 10 days.
France and Belgium advise their residents to abandon plans for vacations in Barcelona and surrounding areas ahead.
The beaches in these areas are overcrowded, and people cannot maintain social distance from each other. At one time, the police needed to take measures to reduce the number of beach tourists.
Tourism is an important pillar industry in Spain
Spain: It's safe here
In response to the decision made by the United Kingdom, the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Sunday that the epidemic in the country is under control.
Spanish Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya emphasized to the media: "Spain is safe, not only for Spaniards, but also for tourists."
The Spanish government will try to persuade the British government to exclude the Balearic Islands and Canary Islands from the quarantine measures.
The reason is that the infection rate in these two tourist resorts is much lower than that in the UK.
In order to prevent the spread of the epidemic, the Catalonia region of Spain has also restarted the "foot ban".
Tourism is an important pillar industry in Spain, and Spain is one of the most popular holiday destinations for British tourists.
The British decision is expected to greatly affect Spain's tourism industry.

Zhong Fu's first day: Beijing takes a break from the high temperature and heat to open the rainfall pattern - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 (Reporter Ni Yuanjin) July 26 is the first day of this year's "Zhong Fu."
The heavy wind, showers and convective weather in the early morning of the 26th dispelled the heat and heat that had been shrouded in Beijing for days, and a new round of rainfall weather will last for several days.
The Beijing Meteorological Station announced at 11: 00 on the 26th that there were scattered showers (accompanied by weak thunder and lightning) in Beijing on the 26th, and the daily maximum temperature was only 27 ℃; there was light to moderate rain at night (accompanied by weak thunder and lightning), and the minimum temperature at night was 23 ℃.
From the 24th to the 25th, the city of Beijing was in a high temperature blue warning. The daily maximum temperature in most areas was around 37 ℃, and the local high temperature exceeded 40 ℃.
Futian is the hottest, humid, and sultry day of the year. There are "three volts" in a year, and the hottest is in the middle. The Chinese people say "bitter summer" at this time.
When I fell in, my family filled the barn, and there was a folk saying that "one-volt dumpling and two-volt noodles."
According to the current forecast, there will be more rainy weather in Beijing in the next three days.
The meteorological department reminds the public to minimize travel in mountainous areas and guard against geological disasters.
It is understood that this year's "Zhong Fu" has 20 days, starting on July 26 and ending on August 14.
After entering "Zhong Fu", people will feel weak and loss of appetite.
You can choose mung beans, coix seeds and other foods that have the effects of clearing heat and relieving heat, strengthening the spleen and appetizing, as well as bitter foods such as bitter vegetables and bitter gourd, which can help increase appetite and dispel heat.
The engine may turn off. The FAA urgently ordered the investigation of 2,000 Boeing airliners - Xinhuanet
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an emergency airworthiness directive on the 24th, requiring emergency inspections of about 2,000 Boeing 737NG and 737 Classic airliners registered in the United States. The reason is that the corrosion of the air check valve of the above-mentioned airliner may cause the engine to stop in the air.
The FAA said that it has so far received 4 reports of 737NG and 737Classic airliner engines parking in the air, so it has made emergency inspection requirements. The inspection targets are airliners that have been parked for 7 days or more in a row and airliners that have flown less than 11 times so far after being relaunched.
The FAA warned that if the level 5 check valves of all two engines of the airliner are corroded, they may become stuck in the open position, causing the airliner to completely lose power and unable to restart the engine.
This aviation regulatory agency ordered that once the check valve is found to be corroded, the air operator must replace this key component before the airliner is put into service again.
Boeing responded later that day that the outbreak of COVID-19 has reduced travel demand, and many airliners have been sealed or used less, and "check valves are more likely to be corroded".
Boeing also said that it has advised air operators to inspect the passenger aircraft involved in the directive, and if problems are found, Boeing will provide assistance in repairing and replacing check valves.
The Associated Press reported that airliners owned by major U.S. air operators usually fly multiple times in a day, but after the outbreak of COVID-19, a large number of airliners were grounded; with the recent slow growth in passenger travel demand, some airliners have resumed operations.
The FAA did not release the details of the four air parking reports.
Alaska Airlines disclosed one of the incidents later on the 24th.
The airline operator said in a statement that one of its airliners was en route from Seattle, Washington, to Austin, Texas, on July 15, when an engine suddenly turned off, and the airliner finally made an emergency landing at Austin Airport.
Alaska Airlines said that it had replaced the engine of the airliner and had inspected the engines of six airliners in accordance with FAA instructions.
American Airlines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines said on the 24th that their airliners did not have engine stalls associated with air check valves.
Four airliners under American Airlines will be inspected, and 28 airliners under United Airlines will be inspected.
Delta Air Lines said it would inspect 20 of its airliners, but did not say whether there had been engine outages.
Several media reported that the FAA's emergency airworthiness directive is another impact on Boeing.
Indonesian Lion Airlines and Ethiopian Airlines each crashed a Boeing 737MAX in October 2018 and March 2019, respectively, killing a total of 346 people.
This series of airliners was subsequently grounded worldwide. Production ceased in January this year, and production resumed in May.
FAA Director Steve Dixon admitted in June that the FAA "made a mistake" in its supervision of Boeing with regard to the 737MAX airliner.
"Ding Dong Online! Hello Teacher" will be launched next week, led by Xue Zhaofeng. "Knowledge Initiator - Xinhuanet
A new variety has been launched.
The interactive knowledge sharing program "Ding Dong Online! Good Teacher" will be broadcast on Hunan Satellite TV from July 20.
It is understood that the program will create a brand-new all-age youth classroom, and a group of attractive and talented teachers will be on the scene to challenge the output of interesting knowledge.
Unlike the serious impression of teacher groups in the hearts of the public in the past, "Ding Dong Online! Good Teacher" gathers a group of intellectual representatives with both face and talent.
They are not only young knowledge role models from various disciplines, but also a group of all-round "paragraph players" who can shake burdens and are good at teaching and entertaining.
In the program, this group of outstanding young knowledge role models, as "knowledge sharing officers", will challenge interesting knowledge classes.
They need to show the most interesting side of their discipline through an attitude of knowledge output to impress the audience present.
The "question group" composed of audiences of all ages will raise ever-changing questions on the spot, making the teaching of the "knowledge sharing officer" more difficult, and adding a little stimulating atmosphere to the program.
It is revealed that this "knowledge sharing officer" includes outstanding young teachers such as Li Yongle, a physics teacher at the Middle School Affiliated to Renmin University of China, Zhang Xuefeng, a famous teacher for the examination of research, and Wang Lei, a history teacher with ten years of experience.

Chief Secretary for Administration of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government: The situation is severe and the fight against the epidemic - chinanews.com
Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 26. Zhang Jianzong, Chief Secretary for Administration of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, said on the 26th that the situation of COVID-19 in Hong Kong continues to be severe. If the epidemic gets worse, the SAR government will decisively take stricter control measures to further restrict the business of business premises and reduce the space for citizens to go out.
However, at this stage, the SAR government has no intention to introduce a "home order" or a "foot ban" to restrict citizens from going out.
Zhang Jianzong published a blog entitled "The Situation is Severe and Fully Fight Against the Epidemic" on the same day.
He said that this wave of epidemic is the most severe in six months, and the next two weeks will be very critical. We must do our best to prevent the virus from spreading further in the community.
In addition to the necessary measures taken by the SAR government, citizens' self-discipline and cooperation are also very important.
He urged citizens to stay at home as much as possible, reduce social contacts and eat out.
Citizens should cooperate with the compulsory measures to wear masks to protect themselves and others, and pay attention to personal and environmental hygiene and frequent hand washing. They should also suspend non-essential gatherings or gatherings of relatives and friends and reduce them to markets.
He said that the central government has always been very concerned about the changes in the Hong Kong epidemic and supported the SAR government's epidemic prevention and anti-epidemic work, and has actively responded to the latest request of the Chief Executive to provide assistance in increasing testing capabilities and retrofitting the Asia International Expo for work similar to "square cabin hospitals".
Zhang Jianzong said that the free virus testing provided by the SAR government for specific high-risk groups, namely residential care homes for the elderly, disabled homes and nursing home employees, restaurant employees, taxi drivers and property management employees, has been fully launched, involving as many as 400,000 people.
He is very concerned about the infection cases that appear in residential care homes for the elderly. The SAR government has arranged specific temporary quarantine centers for residents of residential care homes for the elderly.
He said that the SAR government is building an isolation and quarantine facility near the Penny's Bay Quarantine Center in Lantau, New Territories, and is expected to provide an additional 700 isolation rooms by the end of September.
The Chief Executive also announced on the 19th that the SAR government will build 2,000 more isolation rooms at the Penny's Bay Quarantine Center and strive to be completed by the end of this year.
Together with the 800 quarantine centers already in use, the Penny's Bay Quarantine Center is expected to provide a total of 3,500 isolation rooms by the end of the year.
There are currently four quarantine centers in operation in Hong Kong, providing a total of about 2,600 isolation rooms.
In addition, the SAR government reopened the Lei Yue Mun Park Resort on Hong Kong Island on the 24th as a community isolation facility for patients under the age of 50 who have the ability to take care of themselves.
The "nourishing agent" of the party history and the history of New China - chinanews.com

Recently, General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized during a visit to the Siping Battle Memorial: "It is necessary for 1.4 billion people and more than 90 million party members, especially leading cadres at all levels, to learn the history of the Communist Party of China and the history of New China."
Conscientiously studying the history of the Party and the history of New China is a compulsory course for party members and cadres not to forget their original intentions and keep their mission in mind. They must draw rich nourishment from them, cultivate the feelings of their families and countries, and follow the long march of the new era.
A magnificent party history and the history of New China record the hard work and glorious history of the Communist Party of China since its birth, and show the faith and loyalty that the Communists have forged with their lives and blood, and the original intention and mission that they will always adhere to.
History is the best textbook. For party members and cadres, party history and New China history are the brightest chapters in this textbook.
Every party member and cadre must continuously strengthen the historical thinking of taking history as a mirror and moving towards the future, based on the new journey and new mission, take the "baton" of the times, and walk the long march of the present generation.
Cast the soul with history, and adhere to the original mission in the study of party history and the history of New China.
Turning over the history of the party and the history of New China, it is full of the eternal and unchanging original mission of the Chinese Communists and their firm and rock-solid beliefs, which demonstrates the simple feelings of the Communists to be with the people forever.
To understand important events, important meetings, and important figures in the history of the Party and New China at close range is not only an intuitive soul shock, a baptism of thought, but also a deep understanding of the connotation of the original faith from the soul, and the weight of the mission.
For party members and cadres, if they want to continuously sharpen their original mission and maintain their advanced qualities, they must find the origin of our departure and the fulcrum of our original heart from the history of the party and the history of New China, maintain a clear understanding and a firm stand, and excite the power to work hard for the country and the people to ensure that the red rivers and mountains laid down by the revolutionary ancestors with their blood and lives are passed on from generation to generation.
It is wise to study history and pass on the lofty spirit in the study of party history and the history of New China.
Since the founding of the Communist Party of China, it has successively shaped a series of great spirits such as the Red Boat Spirit, Jinggangshan Spirit, Long March Spirit, Yan'an Spirit, Anti-Japanese War Spirit, Xibaipo Spirit, "Two Bombs and One Star" Spirit, and Space Spirit.
These great spirits precipitated by history have provided our party with a strong spiritual incentive to overcome various risks and challenges on the way forward. It is a precious spiritual wealth that cannot be defeated, washed away, or taken away.
The process of studying party history and Chinese history is a process of revisiting these spirits and shaping one's own spirit. We must consciously take the lofty spirit of the revolutionary ancestors as the mirror, stick to the spiritual home of the Communists, build a solid spiritual foundation for advancing the great cause and realizing the great dream, and inherit and carry forward these spirits to shine a new light of the times.
Reading history and self-examination, in the study of party history and the history of New China, continue to preserve righteousness and dispel evil.
For party members and cadres, there has never been any history that can bring more profound warning, enlightenment and reference than party history and New China history.
In the history of the Party and the history of New China, we can see not only the great deeds of the older generation of revolutionaries who are determined to devote themselves to their beliefs and persevere in their struggle to achieve the set goals, but also the profound lessons of certain figures who have been shaken by their ideals and beliefs and walked to the opposite of the revolution, enlightening and warning us that with firm determination and will, we will never stagnate, never slack, always maintain a strong and tenacious fighting spirit, and constantly purify the party spirit and self-discipline.
If you want to truly become a firm believer and loyal practitioner of the lofty ideals of communism, you need to brush away the "dust" of thought and strictly prevent "dirt" from getting stained. Party history and New China history should become the basis for every party member and cadre to examine himself and warn himself.
Know history and inspire, and bravely pick up the important tasks of the times in the study of party history and the history of New China.
General Secretary Xi Jinping once pointed out: "Studying the history of the party and the history of the country is a compulsory course to adhere to and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics and continue to advance the various undertakings of the party and the country."
Look back at history and ask the original heart in order to continue the glory and move towards the future.
Every party member and cadre should take the study of party history and the history of New China as a lifelong pursuit, constantly set the course of life in the study, and brave the historical mission, dare to take responsibility, and take the initiative in their respective jobs.
Adhere to the advanced deeds of the older generation of revolutionaries as a reference and guidance, continuously polish the political qualities of the Communists, maintain the posture of striving for the future and striving for success, and the more difficult and more difficult the fighting spirit, and write their own brilliant stroke in the grand journey of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
"Plug up Jiangnan" to pursue the poetic "Yellow River Dream " - chinanews.com
(China's Poverty Reduction Story) "Put Jiangnan" in Pursuit of Poetic "Yellow River Dream"
China News Service, Yinchuan, July 26 (Yang Di) "Jiuqu Yellow River Wanli Sha, waves and waves ripple from the horizon."
The Yellow River, which has aroused the feelings of countless literati, has given birth to the beautiful and rich Ningxia Plain. Now, Ningxia, which has the reputation of "plugging up Jiangnan", is adhering to the concept of "ecological priority and green development" and pursuing the poetic "Yellow River Dream".
The "Bibo Dream" of Heqing Water Show
"The Yellow River in the world is rich in Ningxia", and the Yellow River flows through Ningxia for 397 kilometers, which is the "mother river" for raising one party.
However, with the rapid advancement of industrialization and urbanization, the development, utilization and management and protection of rivers and lakes are unbalanced, and chaos such as over-standard sewage discharge, lake reclamation, and encroachment on water areas have emerged, leading to black and smelly water bodies, excessive water quality, dirty environment, and ecological degradation.
Now, Ningxia is promoting the diverse restoration of water ecology and striving to return the Yellow River to Xiuhe Qing.
Water control must start at the source.
In Yinchuan, Ningxia, the local area adopted the method of "standard improvement + pollution control + strict management". All sewage from industrial parks have been treated centrally, all urban sewage treatment plants have achieved level I A standard discharge, and the black and smelly water bodies in urban built-up areas have been basically eliminated, and the third batch of Chinese black and smelly water demonstration cities has been successfully declared.
In addition, Ningxia fully implemented the river and lake long system in 2017, and now it has achieved full coverage of the five-level river and lake long responsibility system in districts, counties and villages, and the river and lake long patrol has become the norm.
The 64-year-old Gu Jincheng, who lives in a village by the Yellow River, witnessed the changes in the Yellow River: "The previous water had a bad smell, and after rectification, the smell was gone."
Gu Jincheng said that the ecological environment is better and his life is more comfortable. Now he often goes for a walk by the Yellow River with his family to feel the blue water and blue sky.
The "Wetland Dream" of Sagull Xiang Collection
Birds, green trees, plank roads, clear water... the beauty of the "sand gulls Xiang Collection" written by Fan Zhongyun has become a reality in the Yellow River Wetland Park in Yinchuan, Ningxia.
The Yellow River flows through Ningxia, forming a variety of wetlands such as river wetlands, lake wetlands, and swamp wetlands along the way, which plays an important role in promoting the rational use of water resources and water ecological balance, and has also become an important international bird migration channel.
Since 2009, relevant departments in Ningxia have invested a total of about 3.45 billion yuan in wetland protection projects. At present, Yinchuan Wetland covers an area of 19,200 hectares, with a wetland protection rate of 78.5%, and there are nearly 200 natural lakes and marsh wetlands. There are 5 national wetland parks, 1 national urban wetland park, 6 autonomous region-level wetland parks, and 8 municipal parks.
Lu Jinhu, deputy director of the Yinchuan Wetland Protection Center, told reporters that wetland protection has increased biodiversity, which is particularly evident in birds. "The gull is an endangered bird, with only more than 20,000 in the world, of which more than 2,000 live in Yinchuan Wetland."
At the same time, Ningxia has delineated a 500-meter red line for the wetland protection area on both sides of the Yinchuan section of the Yellow River in accordance with the law, stipulating that except for public welfare projects, no unit or individual may carry out development, construction and business activities within the scope of protection.
Zhao Shaoyong, deputy director of the Yinchuan Water Conservancy Service Center, introduced that through the treatment of the source of pollution, the comprehensive improvement of river and lake ecology, and the construction of terminal wetlands, the water quality of the nine main yellow drains in Ningxia has now reached 100% of the water level. "Now the water is clear, the fish are swimming, and the flowers are blooming."
The "Drinking Water Dream" of inclusive people's livelihood
Yinchuan City in Ningxia once had an "awkward" title: The only city along the Yellow River that "guarded the Yellow River for water and drink."
Since 2010, Yinchuan City has been facing a persistent shortage of water during the peak summer period. The "pain of water shortage" in the past ten years has become a painful summer experience for many high-floor residents. However, under the current situation that major water sources are at the limit of over-mining and a large area of groundwater over-exploitation funnel area has been formed under the urban underground, water-borne water shortage has become a difficult problem besetting Yinchuan City.
Thanks to the improvement of the water quality of the Yellow River, drinking purified Yellow River water has become a good way to solve the drinking water problems of local residents.
Ding Ming, deputy director of the Yinchuan Water Affairs Bureau, introduced that in order to improve the living and production water needs of urban and rural residents in Yinchuan, Ningxia launched the Yinchuan Metropolitan Area West Line Water Supply Project in due course, replacing the original underground water source with high-quality Yellow River water.
"On December 29, 2019, the water supply project officially opened water to the three districts of Yinchuan City. In 2020, residents of Minning Town and Helan County also drank the Yellow River water."
Ding Ming said that the Yinchuan Water Conservancy Department will comprehensively consider the transformation of the integration of regional rural drinking water and urban water supply. "In the next step, we will integrate all scattered rural water supply points into the Western Line water supply project, and it is expected that the integrated urban and rural water supply in Yinchuan region will be basically achieved by the end of this year."
Compaction Responsibility Departments Strengthen Flood Control and Disaster Relief Work - chinanews.com
Compacting the responsibilities of various departments to strengthen flood control and disaster relief work
CCTV News (News Service): News from the Ministry of Water Resources, at 12 o'clock today (July 25), the river section below Wangjiaba, the main stream of the Huaihe River, exceeded the warning water level by 0.64 to 3.31 meters, and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River exceeded the warning water level by 0.05 to 2.02 meters.
Taihu Lake has lasted for 28 days since it exceeded the warning water level on June 28.
At 12 o'clock today, the average water level of Taihu Lake was 4.67 meters, 0.02 meters above the guaranteed water level.
Today, the National Defense Council discussed and judged, and decided to continue to maintain the Yangtze River and Huaihe River flood control level II response, requiring all localities to consolidate their responsibilities and further implement various flood control and disaster relief work.
Today, the National Defense Office and the Ministry of Emergency Management urgently dispatched professional waterlogging vehicles from Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian to help Jiangxi solve local problems such as urban waterlogging caused by heavy rainfall.
The United States launched a countervailing investigation against China for the first time with the "undervaluation of the RMB exchange rate"
In response to the recent announcement by the US Department of Commerce, it has decided to launch an anti-dumping countervailing investigation against tie-in (strap) products originating in China, and to initiate an investigation on the "RMB exchange rate undervaluation" project.
China's Ministry of Commerce pointed out that this is the first time that the United States has filed an investigation into the so-called "RMB exchange rate undervaluation" project in a countervailing case. China firmly opposes this.
China's Ministry of Commerce issued a press release in this regard on the evening of the 23rd, stating that China implements a managed floating exchange rate system based on market supply and demand and adjusted with reference to a basket of currencies, and that the market plays a decisive role in the formation of the exchange rate.
The press release emphasized that on the whole, the RMB exchange rate is at a reasonable equilibrium level and has not been undervalued.
Since 2005, the RMB has appreciated by more than 17% against the US dollar.
According to data released by the Bank for International Settlements, from the beginning of 2005 to May 2020, the nominal effective exchange rate of the RMB appreciated by 38%, and the real effective exchange rate appreciated by 49%. It is the strongest currency in the G20 economy and one of the most appreciated currencies in the world.
The Ministry of Commerce pointed out that the exchange rate issue is beyond the competence of members to conduct countervailing investigations in accordance with the rules of the World Trade Organization.
The United States amended its regulations in February this year to conduct countervailing investigations on the exchange rates of other countries. It has been suspected of violating WTO rules and has been opposed by many parties.
The press release stated that even in accordance with U.S. regulations, the applicant's complaint contained a large number of errors and did not have the necessary anti-subsidy elements such as financial support, benefit granting, and specificity.
China urges the US to abide by existing international rules and stop countervailing investigations into the so-called "undervaluation of the RMB exchange rate".
Affected by the further increase in tensions in Sino-US relations, the offshore and onshore RMB exchange rates against the US dollar fell sharply on the 22nd, and both fell below the US $1 to RMB 7.0 mark.
Whether the US Department of Commerce's move is intended to force the yuan to rise deserves attention.
The spot exchange rate of RMB against the US dollar rose above the 7.0 mark on the 23rd and closed at 6.9961.
The middle price of the officially regulated RMB exchange rate against the US dollar was lowered by 17 basis points on the 24th to 6.9938.

Venezuela's foreign minister accused the United States of fabricating lies to launch an unprovoked attack on China - Xinhuanet
Ariasa said that the U.S. government has recently put constant pressure on China in terms of politics, diplomacy, economy and public opinion, which is an unfounded attack on a sovereign country.
Ariasa forwarded the tweet posted by Chinese Ambassador to Venezuela Li Baorong on his personal account earlier that day and made the above comments.
Li Baorong said in a tweet that China strongly condemns the US for forcibly entering the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, which is a serious violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and the Sino-US Consular Treaty, and China will make a legitimate and necessary response to this.
Venezuelan Vice President Rodríguez, Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Long and other government officials, social celebrities and mainstream media reporters have also forwarded Li Baorong's tweets, condemning the actions of the United States as a serious violation of international law.
The 26th was the day before Philippine President Duterte issued his fifth State of the Union address (SONA) during his term of office. On that day, a total of more than 80,000 COVID-19 cases were confirmed in the Philippines, of which the number of confirmed cases by the staff of the Presidential Information Department (PCOO) and its immediate agencies increased to 25.
To this end, PCOO has specially prepared a working group that has not contacted the confirmed staff to cooperate with President Duterte's press release of SONA.
PCOO Minister Martin Andanal said in an interview with DZBB Radio on the 26th that two plans have been prepared for President Duterte to publish SONA.
According to plan A, Duterte will publish SONA at the Philippine Congress (Batasang Pambansa) building in Quezon City on the afternoon of the 27th.
Due to the epidemic, only 50 seats were arranged for some government cabinet members and legislators at the scene, and a special video conference room was set up for other cabinet members, local government officials, etc.
All participants passed a quick test on the same day before entering the Capitol.
Once one of the participants tested positive, plan B was launched, that is, President Duterte announced SONA at the Presidential Palace in Malacanan, and fewer seats were arranged at the scene.
In accordance with established practice, SONA will broadcast live to the Philippines in real time.
As of the time of writing, the Philippine Presidential Palace has not confirmed whether Duterte's family will attend SONA.
Andanar said that President Duterte's SONA will focus on how the government will lead the Philippines to respond to COVID-19 and restore social and economic life; it will also mention his commitments when he took office, namely, anti-government corruption, combating illegal drugs, and poverty reduction.
Duterte will also explain other plans of this administration, including creating more jobs, revitalizing the economy, promoting education, and helping overseas Filipino workers who are suffering from the epidemic.
Yinchuan: Classification and policies to support kindergartens to stabilize the teaching team - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, July 26 (Reporter Ai Fumei) Affected by the epidemic, the kindergarten in Yinchuan City, Ningxia, has not yet been restored. In particular, the pressure on private kindergartens has increased, which will have a certain impact on the stability of the kindergarten teacher team and the sustainable development of the future.
In response to this, Yinchuan City has adopted a number of measures such as pre-allocated subsidy funds for inclusive private kindergartens, job stabilization subsidies for non-inclusive private kindergartens, and rent relief for private kindergartens to support these kindergartens in stabilizing the teaching team.

At the same time, for private kindergartens that rent state-owned asset-type operating premises, Yinchuan City will reduce and reduce the rent of houses for 3 months during the epidemic prevention and control period, and encourage developers and other types of rental entities to assume social responsibility, reduce and exempt kindergarten rents for more than 3 months, and reduce and exempt relevant taxes and fees in accordance with the policy.
The Yangtze River forms the No.3 flood of 2020, the Ministry of Water Resources detailed the practical response measures - chinanews.com
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 (Reporter Hu Lu) On the 26th, the Yangtze River flood No. 3 of 2020 formed.
When presiding over the meeting on the 26th, Minister of Water Resources E Jingping requested that the Three Gorges Reservoir be carefully scheduled, that the water from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and Dongting Lake be considered in a coordinated manner, that the wrong peak scheduling be implemented, that sufficient storage capacity be left to prepare for possible major floods, and that the flood control safety of the middle and lower reaches of the main stream and important embankments of Dongting Lake be ensured.
According to forecasts, in the next three days, there will be heavy to heavy rains in parts of eastern Southwest China, southern Jianghuai, northern Jiangnan, southern eastern Hubei, and central Guangxi. Among them, there will be heavy rains in parts of northern Hunan, southwestern Jiangsu, etc.; there will be moderate to heavy rains in central and western North China and heavy rains in central Hebei.
The Ministry of Water Resources predicts that due to its impact, the inflow of the Three Gorges Reservoir in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River may reach about 60,000 cubic meters per second around the 28th, and the water level of the Lianhuatang River section and Dongting Lake in the middle reaches of the main stream will rise again and exceed the protection by about 0.20 meters; the water level of the main stream of the Huaihe River will generally recede, and the water level of Hongze Lake will continue to rise slowly; Haihe River Daqing River system and Yongding River will experience a process of rising water.
E Jingping proposed that the Huaihe River Basin should further increase flood discharge, reduce the water level of Hongze Lake as soon as possible, and prepare to face possible major floods.
It is necessary to fully do a good job in the response to heavy rains and floods in the Yili Surabaya system.
He said that the Taihu Lake Basin must continue to increase flood drainage efforts, reduce the water level of Taihu Lake and the surrounding river network as soon as possible, and reduce the risk of high water level and typhoons in Taihu Lake.
In addition, he emphasized that floods in northern areas such as Inner Mongolia and Hebei have risen up and down, and the warning time is short, which can easily cause mountain torrents and mudslides, making it difficult to defend; there are many small and medium reservoirs and silt dams, showing safety risks.
58 APPs that violate user rights and interests have been exposed involving more than a dozen listed companies - chinanews.com
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology reported that in accordance with laws and regulations such as the Cybersecurity Law, the Telecommunications Regulations, and the Regulations on the Protection of Personal Information of Telecommunications and Internet Users, it has recently organized third-party testing agencies to inspect mobile phone applications and urge companies with problems to make rectification.
The problems with these 58 APPs include private collection of personal information, collection of personal information beyond the scope, frequent application for permissions, excessive request for permissions, difficulty in account cancellation, private sharing to third parties, and denial of permissions.
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology requires that 58 APPs should complete the rectification and implementation work before July 30. If the rectification is not completed within the time limit, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology will organize and carry out relevant disposal work in accordance with laws and regulations.
A reporter from Sino-Singapore Jingwei found that behind the 58 APPs notified, more than a dozen US, Hong Kong, and A-share listed companies were involved.
For example, "Fangduo" is a product of Fangduo, a US-listed company. There are five problems: Private collection of personal information, collection of personal information beyond the scope, private sharing to third parties, forcing users to use directional push functions, and frequent application for permissions.
Public information shows that Fangduo landed on Nasdaq in November 2019 and is "the first domestic industrial Internet SaaS (software service) model real estate intermediary company", providing online solutions for many intermediary merchants.
In response to the problem of the difficulty of deregistration of the APP account of "Where to Go" pointed out in the notice, according to the Beijing News, the company responded that in order to prevent black property from using frequent registration and deregistration for benefits, where to go has been registered on the basis of self-cancellation. The interval between registration and cancellation is one month.
Taking into account the convenience of cancellation and account security, it has been changed to cancellation with immediate effect, and is currently awaiting review.
A cyber security expert who did not want to be named told the Sino-Singapore Jingwei client that the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has released a number of APP notifications of violations of user rights and interests this year.
Among them, the three problems of private collection of personal information, excessive request for permissions, and difficulty in account cancellation have been repeatedly "managed".
It can also be found from the notification that the current APP violation of privacy has attracted more and more attention.
On July 24, the same day that 58 APPs infringing on user rights and interests were notified, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said that it had issued a notice a few days ago to deploy and carry out special rectification actions to promote APP infringement on user rights and interests in depth.
The special rectification will strengthen supervision and inspection in accordance with regulations, urge relevant enterprises to strengthen the protection of APP personal information, promptly rectify and eliminate outstanding problems such as illegal collection, use of user personal information and harassment of users, deception and misleading users, and inadequate implementation of application distribution platform management responsibilities, and purify APP application space.

Lewis' public memorial service has been held in Alabama since Saturday.
There were two memorial services on the first day.
On Saturday, at the public memorial service at Troy University in Alabama, five siblings and a nephew talked about Lewis as a loving and fearless family man.
Lewis' youngest brother, Henry "Grant" Lewis, said at the meeting: "He spent his lifetime to helpe others."
Samuel Lewis said that his mother had warned John "not to cause trouble, not to cause trouble."
He added that John did not heed his mother's warning, saying that "We all know that John always got into trouble and always getting into trouble, but that's because he insisted on the right thing, which was a good trouble."
Lewis' brothers and sisters reminded people at the memorial service that John's most famous argument was to create "good trouble", that is, as long as it is for justice, he does not shy away from provoking trouble.
John once applied to Troy University in Troy, Alabama, where he was born, but Troy University, an all-white school at the time, rejected his application for admission.
John Lewis, who preached the gospel to chickens on his farm as a child, eventually earned a degree in religion and philosophy from Fisk University.
Many years later, Troy University awarded Lewis an honorary doctorate.
Senator Doug Jones from Alabama said that the current protesters are "protesting peacefully and non-violently", just like Lewis did in the civil rights movement.
Jones said: "Even if President Trump knocked over a boat and described all the protesters as thugs, he was wrong.
The protesters are patriots, and they want the United States to move towards a more equal country. "
A series of six-day events to commemorate Lewis will culminate at a funeral in Georgia this week.
Lewis' coffin was parked at a public memorial service at Troy University on Saturday, and people came to pay tribute to the pioneer of the civil rights movement.
Later on Saturday, a private ceremony paid tribute to him in a small church in Selma, Alabama, followed by a public memorial service.
On Sunday, Lewis' body will pass through the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma.
In 1965, he and the demonstrators demanding the right to vote for blacks were severely beaten by the Alabama police in front of this bridge, and the police also threw tear gas at the demonstrators.
Lewis was almost killed at the time.
This day will later be called "Bloody Sunday".
Lewis' body will be transported to Montgomery, the capital of Alabama.
Mayor Steven Reed encouraged people to line up on the sidewalk to complete this final journey with Lewis.
At the same time, officials require the public to wear masks and maintain social distance when participating in activities.
Alabama Governor Kay Ivey ordered the flags to be lowered at half-mast on Saturday and Sunday in honor of Lewis.
During the nearly one-week commemoration, Lewis's body will be placed in the Alabama State Capitol in Montgomery, the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta, and the U.S. Capitol in Washington for people to express their condolences.
U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced last week that people can come to the U.S. Capitol on Monday and Tuesday to pay their respects to Lewis.
Due to the coronavirus, the public mourning will take place outdoors.
Shenzhen publicly solicited comments on the introduction of health regulations - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Shenzhen, July 26 (Reporters Mao Siqian and Bai Yu) Encourage residents to do physical examinations frequently and detect problems early; prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors; establish an online game health review system; employers must be equipped with full-time and part-time health management personnel... The "Shenzhen Special Economic Zone Health Regulations (Draft for Comments)" was officially released a few days ago, and Shenzhen residents will have their own "health law".
In order to encourage residents to do physical examinations frequently and detect problems early, the above-mentioned draft for comments proposes that the health department should formulate a basic catalogue of health check-up items based on factors such as different ages and occupations.
The cost of health check-ups that fall within the scope of the basic catalogue of health check-up items shall be paid by the social medical insurance coordination fund at the standard of once per person per year.
The draft for comments makes it clear that employers should rationally allocate human resources, arrange staff working hours, and implement a rotation system for employees with heavy mental and physical workloads, so as to avoid excessive loss of human functions or physical and mental health damage to employees' health, and strictly implement the paid leave system for employees.
In addition, employers must be equipped with full-time and part-time health management personnel, and regularly organize and carry out employee health examinations.
In terms of the physical and mental health of minors, the draft for comments proposes that the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors is prohibited, and the sales location of alcoholic beverages is restricted. For violations of the regulations, the market supervision and management department will order corrections and impose a fine of 30,000 yuan.
In addition to "prohibition", minors should also "exercise more".
According to the requirements of the draft for comments, the school should arrange student sports activities for more than one hour every day.
For online games, public security, culture, radio, tourism, sports, network supervision, health department should improve the health supervision system of Internet service business premises, establish an online game health review system, and create a good communication space and communication culture for promoting the healthy growth of teenagers.
In addition, the draft for comments also proposed that influenza patients must wear masks when entering and leaving public places, and medical and health institutions fined 20,000 yuan for leaking patients' privacy without consent.
It is worth noting that, in addition to the physical and mental health of residents, the draft for comments also requires that various departments in Shenzhen should assess the impact of public policy implementation on the health of the population before formulating plans involving urban spatial planning and construction, industrial park planning and construction, resource development and utilization and ecological environment protection, and biomedical industry development, normative documents, and approving major construction projects and implementing major public service projects.
If it has not been assessed or will have a more serious adverse impact on urban public health or the health of residents, it shall not be formulated or approved for implementation.

Recently, General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized during an inspection in Jilin Province that it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the party, promote the extension of party organizations to the most basic level, improve the work system of grassroots party organizations, and provide a strong guarantee for the governance of urban and rural communities.
Adhering to the leadership of party building and implementing the party's leadership to all aspects of grassroots governance is a fundamental requirement for the direction of doing a good job in grassroots governance.
To improve the level of grassroots governance, we must adhere to the leadership of party building, promote the transformation of the party's political advantages, organizational advantages, and mass work advantages into governance advantages by strengthening political leadership, building battle fortresses, and gathering red forces, and transmit the party's power and propositions to the "nerve endings" "the last kilometer".
Pay attention to calcium supplementation and soul-building, and strengthen political leadership.
To strengthen the political leadership of grassroots governance, it is necessary to implement the "calcium supplementation and soul-building" project.
It is necessary to study and understand Xi Jinping's thoughts on socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era as the primary task, to take "not forgetting the original intention and keeping in mind the mission" as the eternal topic of party building and the lifelong topic of party members and cadres, to strengthen the understanding of the principles of reading the original texts, and to continue to promote the party's innovative theories through special training, batch training, seminars and exchanges, holding large lecture halls, etc., and promote party members and cadres to further strengthen the "four consciousness", strengthen the "four self-confidence", and achieve the "two maintenance" to better perform their duties and responsibilities.
Through the combination of online and offline learning methods, broaden the channels of learning and education, and guide grassroots party organizations and party members and cadres to truly integrate learning and education into daily life and focus on the regular.
Pay attention to practice and exercise, in the process of resolving key and difficult issues in the field of grassroots governance, solve the annoying and disturbing concerns of the masses, and hone the party spirit and ability.
Grasp the promotion of norms and build a battle fortress.
Grassroots party organizations are not only an important part of the grassroots governance system, but also an important carrier for the demonstration of governance capabilities.
To promote the standardization of grassroots party organizations, we must start with the work regulations of party branches, focus on issues such as the weakening and virtual leadership of party organizations, and strengthen the foundation, make up for shortcomings, and promote development by establishing a linkage mechanism between the upper and lower levels, innovating the branch establishment form, normalizing and rectifying weakness and lax, establishing and improving the decision-making and discussion mechanism, and serving the masses mechanism.
In rural areas, strengthen the standardization of village-level party organizations, standardize organizational forms, learning activities, and management mechanisms against the standardized construction standards of party branches, and effectively promote the implementation of the "three meetings and one lesson" and thematic party day activities.
In cities, pay attention to street communities, explore innovative branch setting forms, focus on weak areas, "blocking points" and "pain points", and actively build urban party building alliances to achieve effective coverage of party work.
At the same time, establish and improve the grassroots governance system and mechanism, improve the decision-making and discussion mechanism of discussing major issues, jointly handling major issues, deciding important issues, discussing urgent issues, resolving difficult issues, and leading grassroots party organizations, improve the mechanism for party members and cadres to contact and serve the masses, gather the hearts of the people in serving the people, enhance the sense of acquisition, happiness, honor, and pride of party members and the masses, and make grassroots governance warmer.
Play a pioneering role and gather red forces.
Grassroots party members and cadres are the cornerstone of grassroots governance.
Improving grassroots governance capabilities focuses on improving the governance capabilities of grassroots party members and cadres, focusing on the demonstration and leading role of "red cells" in grassroots governance, and gathering red forces at the forefront of contacting and serving the masses.
It is necessary to make the improvement of governance capabilities a compulsory course for grassroots party members and cadres, continuously strengthen ideological quenching, professional training, and practical training, carry forward the spirit of responsibility in their own positions and in urgent, difficult and dangerous tasks, and lay a solid foundation and contribute to the modernization of the national governance system and governance capabilities.
It is necessary to widely carry out "community whistle-blowing and party member reporting" activities, and participate in community construction, management and service by participating in thematic party day activities, contacting people in difficulties, determining service projects, claiming micro-wishes, and making reasonable suggestions, so that party members can play a role in community governance.
It is necessary to give full play to the role of unemployed party members in rural areas, and guide the majority of grassroots party members to actively participate in various tasks such as poverty alleviation, ecological construction, petition and maintenance of stability, and banning the burning of straw to better integrate the red forces and serve the people.
The foundation is strong.
The grassroots party organization is the foundation of the ruling building.
Only by insisting on strengthening the relationship between the party and the masses and increasing the well-being of the people as the focus, and taking party building as the fundamental way to promote the innovation and development of grassroots governance, can we build a solid foundation, let the grassroots party organizations pull out and stand up, and the grassroots party members and cadres can catch up and rush up, and promote grassroots governance to be "soul", orderly, powerful, and effective.

Hoh Xil Tibetan antelope enters the return season - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 25 (Reporter Wang Jinjin) The reporter learned from the Wudaoliang conservation station of the Hoh Xil Management Office, Jiangyuan Park, Director of Sanjiangyuan National Park Management, that monitoring showed that the Tibetan antelopes that had previously migrated to the Zhuonai Lake area in the hinterland of Hoh Xil to give birth are ending their babies and beginning to take their cubs back to their original habitat.
Monitoring footage near the Wudaoliang Conservation Station shows that on July 25, about 40 female Tibetan antelopes led 3 Tibetan antelope cubs through 3002 kilometers of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway and the Wudaoliang North Bridge of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway. The Tibetan antelopes have begun to relocate.
Experts analyze that in recent years, the number of Tibetan antelope cubs in the returning flock accounts for a quarter to a fifth of the total number of Tibetan antelope flocks.
Lien Xinming, deputy researcher of the Northwest Plateau Biology Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: "At the beginning of the return, the Tibetan antelope faces a high risk of predation, so the number of cubs in the flock will be relatively small, and there may even be no cubs."
According to statistics from the Hoh Xil Management Office of Jiangyuan Park, Director of Sanjiangyuan National Park Management, the overall number of Tibetan antelopes relocating has been increasing year by year. The number of Tibetan antelopes relocating in 2019 was 4,860, an increase of 338 over 2018.
Liang Xinming said: "It is expected that the return of Tibetan antelopes this year will end in early September, and the number of returning Tibetan antelopes is still expected to continue to increase."
Tibetan antelope is a national first-class protected animal.
At the end of May every year, Tibetan antelopes from Sanjiangyuan in Qinghai, Qiangtang in Tibet, and Aljinshan in Xinjiang all go to Zhuonai Lake in the hinterland of Hoh Xil to give birth.
Wu Xiaomin, an expert in the protection of Tibetan antelopes in my country and a researcher at the Shaanxi Provincial Institute of Zoology (Northwest Endangered Animals Research Institute), said: "The return of Tibetan antelopes is the process of female Tibetan antelopes returning to their habitat after they have given birth. At first, the returning groups that left the breeding grounds were relatively large, but then the Tibetan antelopes will return to their respective habitats according to different geographical populations and along different paths."
In order to ensure the safe relocation of Tibetan antelope flocks, the reporter learned that the Hoh Xil Management Office of Jiangyuan Park, Director of Sanjiangyuan National Park Management, has arranged staff to continuously carry out video monitoring and district patrols in the main relocation area.
If a Tibetan antelope flock is found trying to cross the road, the mountain patrol team will carry out temporary traffic control at the first time to allow the flock to pass through the wildlife passage safely to ensure that it is as little human interference as possible on the way back.
So, how to relieve heat in daily life?
Experts recommend that you try to avoid high temperature periods when you go out in summer, and it is best not to walk or work in the hot sun around noon, because the sun is the strongest during this period and the possibility of heatstroke is higher.
If you have to go out during this period, you must do a good job of protection, such as playing a sunshade, wearing a sun hat, and wearing sunglasses. If possible, it is best to apply sunscreen to prevent sunburn.
Choose light-colored, breathable cotton, linen, and silk textures as much as possible, and wear less chemical fiber clothing, so as not to lose heat in time when you sweat a lot, causing heatstroke.
In hot and sultry weather, you should prepare enough water to drink, drink it in time, and don't wait to drink water until you are thirsty, because once you feel thirsty, your body is already short of water, control it at 150 ml to 200 ml at a time, drink warm water, and don't drink ice water.
According to the temperature, the average person drinks 1.5 to 2 liters of water a day, and the high-temperature workers drink 3 to 5 liters of water a day.
When you sweat more, you can appropriately supplement some salt water to make up for the salt lost by the human body due to sweating.
In addition, the human body is prone to lack of potassium in summer, which makes people feel tired and tired. Potassium-containing tea is an excellent summer drink.
Eat more fruits and vegetables with high water content in summer, such as lettuce, cucumber, tomatoes, etc.; fresh fruits, such as peaches, apricots, watermelons, melons, etc., with a water content of 80% to 90%, can be used to supplement water; dairy products can not only replenish water, but also meet the body's nutritional needs.
In addition, people working in high-temperature environments should appropriately supplement drinks containing potassium, magnesium and other elements.
In summer, the days and nights are short, the temperature is high, the body's metabolism is strong, the consumption is also large, and it is easy to feel tired.
Adequate sleep can relax the brain and body systems, which is not only conducive to work and study, but also a measure to prevent heatstroke.
Experts say that the best bedtime is from 22: 00 to 23: 00, and the best time to get up is from 5: 30 to 6: 30.
Be careful not to lie under the air-conditioning outlet and electric fan during sleep to avoid air-conditioning diseases and hot colds.
Experts suggest that people who are engaged in outdoor activities or high-temperature operations can carry ten drops of water, human Dan, patchouli Zhengqi water or patchouli Zhengqi pills with them, or place them in the nearest workplace and use them at any time to prevent heat stroke.
I want you to take a moment to consider the very simple fact that, by far, most of what we know about the universe comes from light.
We can stand on the Earth and look up at the night sky and see the stars with our naked eyes.
The strong sunlight is so dazzling.
We can see the light reflected off the Moon.
Since Galileo pointed his rudimentary telescope at the celestial bodies in the universe, the universe as we know it today has come to us through light.
With the help of modern telescopes, we've been able to collect stunning silent images of the universe -- a series of images that go all the way back to the Big Bang.
But the universe is not a silent movie, because the universe is not really silent.
I want to tell you that the universe has its own soundtrack, and the universe itself is constantly playing, because space can vibrate like a drum.
So it can send out a series of sounds to the universe when something big happens.
Now, we want to be able to add sound to this magnificent visual composition of the universe.
And although we've never heard anything from outer space, we should be able to turn up the volume in the next few years to hear what's going on there.
For the ambitious goal of capturing the sound of the universe, we turn our focus to black holes and the promise they have, because black holes can bang on space-time like mallets on a drum and make a very special sound, and I'd be happy to play you some of the sounds we predicted.
We might one day see a shadow and a black hole can cast a shadow on a very bright background, but we haven't yet.
And although black holes are not seen, they're likely to be heard because they bang on space-time like a drum.
The idea that the universe can ring like a drum comes from Albert Einstein, and actually a lot of what we think comes from him.
Einstein realized that if the universe were empty, if the universe were empty, it would look like this picture, except for the auxiliary lines drawn on it.
But if we were freely falling through the universe, even without these auxiliary lines, our paths would draw them, because we would find that we travel along straight lines, along straight lines that don't bend through the universe.
Einstein also realized -- and this is the really crucial part (matter also means "matter") -- that if you put energy and matter in the universe, the universe would bend, and a freely falling object would be deflected along a curved path in space as it passed by a celestial body like the Sun.
This is Einstein's great general theory of relativity.
Even the path of light can be bent.
And when you bend so much, you're in orbit around the Sun, like the Earth around the Sun, the Moon around the Earth.
These are the natural curves in the universe.
But Einstein didn't realize that if you took the Sun and you crushed it down to six kilometers -- so you took a million times the mass of the Earth and you crushed it to six kilometers across, you would make a black hole, an object so dense that if light veered too close, it would never escape -- a dark shadow against the universe.
But Einstein always thought black holes were a mathematical oddity.
He didn't believe in black holes.
He believed that nature would protect us from the formation of black holes.
It was decades before the term "black hole" was coined and people realized that black holes are real celestial bodies -- in fact, they're the death state of very massive stars that collapse catastrophically at the end of their lifetime.
Our Sun will not collapse to a black hole.
It's actually not massive enough.
But if we did a little thought experiment -- as Einstein was very fond of doing -- we could imagine crushing the Sun down to six kilometers, and putting a tiny little Earth in orbit around it, maybe 30 kilometers away from the black hole Sun.
The Earth will shine by itself, because now that the Sun is gone, we have no other source of light -- so our little Earth has to shine by itself.
You will find that you can even put the Earth in orbit 30 kilometers outside of the black hole and make it orbit happily.
This black hole is actually about the size of Manhattan.
It could swell up to Hudson Street before it destroys the Earth.
But basically that's what we're talking about.
We're talking about an object compressed to half the size of Manhattan.
So we move this Earth close to the black hole -- 30 kilometers -- and we notice it's perfectly orbiting around the black hole.
There's a sort of myth that black holes devour everything in the universe, but you actually have to get very close to fall in.
But what's impressive is that from our vantage point, we can always see the Earth.
It cannot hide behind the black hole.
Some of the light from the Earth falls into the black hole, but some of it is bent by the black hole and seen by us.
So you can't hide anything behind a black hole.
If this is Battlestar Galactica and you're fighting the Cylons, don't hide behind the black hole.
They can see you.
Our Sun will not collapse to a black hole; it's not massive enough, but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
And if one of them were to devour the Milky Way, that's what it would look like.
We'll see a shadow of a black hole against the hundreds of billions of stars in the Milky Way Galaxy and its luminous dust lanes.
If we were to fall towards this black hole, we would see light being refracted around the black hole, and we might even begin to enter the shadow without feeling that something dramatic was happening.
It would be bad if we tried to fire the rocket and get out of there, because we couldn't escape, not even light.
Although the black hole is dark from the outside, it's not dark from the inside, because all the light from the galaxy can fall into the black hole with us.
And even so, due to the relativistic effect of time dilation, our clocks seem to slow down relative to galactic time, and it looks as if the galaxy outside is accelerating, right before we are destroyed by the black hole.
It's like a near-death experience where you see the light at the end of the tunnel, but it's a complete death experience.
(Laughter) There's no way you can tell anyone that you see light at the end of the tunnel.
So far, we've never seen a shadow like this of a black hole, but black holes can be heard, even if they're not seen.
Imagine, in a real astronomical scene -- imagine two black holes that have lived together for a long time.
Maybe they were stars and then collapsed to two black holes -- each one 10 times the mass of the Sun.
Now we're going to crush them down to 60 kilometers.
They can be rotated hundreds of times a second.
At the end of their lives, they get close to each other at the speed of light.
They can traverse thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second, and as they do so, they not only bend space, but they leave behind in their wake a vibration of space, an actual wave of space-time.
Space squeezes and stretches as black holes collide with the universe.
These vibrations travel through space at the speed of light.
This computer simulation was done by a relativistic group at NASA Goddard.
It took almost 30 years to solve this problem.
This is one of the groups.
It shows two black holes spinning around each other, these are imaginary curves.
And as you can see -- it might be a little fuzzy -- you can see the red waves coming out, and these are the gravitational waves.
They're real cosmic sounds that will travel out from these black holes at the speed of light as they merge with each other until the two black holes merge into one quietly spinning black hole.
If you stand close enough, your ear will resonate with the squeezing and stretching of space.
You can really hear the sound.
Of course, you'll helplessly find your head squeezed and stretched, so you might not be able to understand what's going on.
But I'd like to play for you the sound of our prediction.
This is the result of my group's research -- a relatively simple computational model.
Imagine a less massive black hole falling into a more massive black hole.
The sound you hear comes from a small black hole colliding with space as it gets closer to a massive black hole.
If they were far away, it would be very quiet.
But gradually the sound became like a mallet beating space, causing space to vibrate like a drum.
We can predict what the sound will be.
We know that, as it falls, it gets faster and it gets louder.
And eventually, we're going to hear the little black hole fall completely into the big black hole.
I never thought the sound was so loud -- it was actually amplified here.
At home, it sounds kind of anticlimactic.
It sounds like ding, ding, ding.
This is another sound from our group.
I'm not going to show you images here, because black holes don't leave any useful trails, and real space doesn't show you those virtual curves.
But if you hear that sound while you're on vacation in the universe, I suggest you run.
(Laughter) Want to get away from the sound.
Both black holes are moving.
The two black holes are getting closer together.
In this case, they're both wobbling violently.
And then they're going to merge.
That chirp is a hallmark of black holes merging -- a chirp at the end of the fusion.
So here's our prediction for what we're going to see.
Luckily we're safe in Long Beach, California.
There's no doubt that somewhere in the universe two black holes have merged.
And surely, the space around us can also feel these vibrations that travel a million light years, or a million years ago, at the speed of light and eventually meet us.
But the sound is too quiet for us to hear at all.
There are experiments in the world that take a lot of effort to build -- one called LIGO -- that will detect spatial vibrations that are less than one nucleus at a distance of four kilometers.
This is a very bold attempt, and its sensitivity will not be surpassed in the next few years -- it will be used to detect spatial vibrations.
Another research project on the universe, called LISA, is expected to be launched within the next 10 years.
LISA will be able to see super-massive black holes -- black holes millions or billions of times the mass of the Sun.
In this Hubble image, we see these two galaxies.
They look like they're still hugging each other.
They may each have a super-massive black hole at their core.
But they're not standing still, they're actually merging.
These two black holes will collide, and they will merge over a billion-year period.
So it's beyond our human perception to collect the sounds that they make.
But LISA can see the final stages of two super-massive black holes that started merging a long time ago, the last 15 minutes before they merge.
This detection is not limited to black holes, but it can also be used to detect any major disturbance in the universe -- the biggest of which is the Big Bang.
When the term was coined, some people mocked -- "Oh, who would believe in a Big Bang?"
This animation from my friends at Proton Studios shows looking at the Big Bang from the outside.
We don't really want to do that; we want to be inside the universe, because there's no such thing as standing outside the universe.
So imagine you're inside the Big Bang.
The universe is everywhere, everything in the world is around you, and the space is wobbling disorderly.
Fourteen billion years have passed, and the sound is still ringing around us.
Galaxies form, and generations of stars form in them, and on one planet, at least one such planet, is habitable.
Here, we're frantically building experiments, doing calculations, writing computer codes.
Imagine a billion years ago, two black holes collided.
The sound has been ringing through space for a long time.
We're not even here.
It gets closer and closer -- 40,000 years ago, we were still painting on the rock walls of the cave.
If the sound we were going to pick up was from the Big Bang, it would sound like this.
Strictly speaking, it's noise.
It's white noise, it's a chaotic ringing.
But it's everywhere around us, as long as it's not offset by some other process in the universe.
If we could detect these sounds, it would be like music to our ears, because this quiet echo comes from the moment we were created, from the universe that we look up at.
So in the next few years, we'll be able to turn up the soundtrack a little bit so that the universe can be presented to us in audio.
But if we can detect those earliest moments, it will also take us a step closer to understanding the Big Bang, enabling us to ask some of the most difficult and elusive questions.
If we play the history of the universe backwards, we know that there was a Big Bang in the past, and we might even hear the cacophonous sound of it, but was our Big Bang the only Big Bang?
I mean we have to ask, has there been a Big Bang like that before?
Will it happen again?
I'd like to say that if you raise the significance of this question to the level that TED advocates for people to rethink, at least for this last minute, we can ask questions that we might never be able to answer.
But we have to ask: Is it possible that our universe is just an episode in a larger history?
Or, is it possible that we're just a branch of a multiverse -- each branch with its own Big Bang -- maybe some of them with black holes buzzing, maybe some without -- maybe some with conscious life, maybe some without -- not in our past, not in our future, but somehow connected to us?
So we have to wonder, if there's a multiverse, in some other branch of that multiverse, is there life?
This is life in our multiverse.
Are there other creatures in the multiverse, wondering about our existence, wondering about their own origins?
If so, I can imagine them as we are, computing, writing computer code, building instruments, trying to detect the faint sounds of their origins and wondering who else is out there.
Thank you. Thank you.

Graduate art exhibition moved into the shopping mall public welfare exhibition - Xinhuanet
In the "cloud graduation" season of colleges and universities, a rare offline graduate art exhibition opened warmly last weekend.
However, it is neither in the art gallery nor on the campus, but in the public space of Chaoyang Dayue City, and is open to the public for free until August 23.
The reporter learned that this 2020 graduate art exhibition has collected 50 works / groups of 57 young artists from the Central Academy of Fine Arts, China Media University and Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts. The exhibition space extends from the 2nd floor to the 6th floor, and makes full use of the light box in the building to display graphic works to maximize the artistic atmosphere of the graduation season.
Under the epidemic, the significance of this exhibition is particularly special.
Ge Ping, head of beauty Chen in Dayue City, Chaoyang, admitted: "We have chosen to bring the graduation exhibition towards the 'cloud' back to offline space again. We also hope that more people will see young people's exploration of themselves and understanding of the world, and magnify the healing power of art for society and the soul."
She revealed that the works in this exhibition were collected from graduates of several major art colleges, and selected from them suitable for commercial space display. The forms of works range from traditional shelf paintings and sculptures to new media devices, interactive animation, and VR panorama. The volume and richness are the highest in the past year.
Among them, Li Yunxiao expressed his feelings in the epidemic through a mixture of mechanical and manual creative language in "The First Battle of 2020"; Liu Jiaying discussed the themes of "cryptocurrency", "credit creation", and "transaction" through the work "Sound Money" created by the Taifang blockchain; Zhang Jiaqi's "Cat Forest" and Qiu Daqiang's "Bohemian" both show animals that are often accompanied by humans, from which you can see the young artist's understanding of the relationship between humans and animals; and Zhu Zhongyu's work "Winter of Faith-Gift" is a reminder to young people who are growing up, "When one day you succeed in your career, don't forget your original heart, remember that simplicity and sincerity."
Among the few graduates who personally set up the exhibition is Li Jingyin from the Sculpture Department of Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts.
"I came to Beijing on July 7. I was actually a little worried about the epidemic. I also did a nucleic acid test three days in advance. I brought alcoholic cotton and test reports to the exhibition."
His work "Yesterday is a Mystery" has a complex structure and must be done by himself.
At the same time, he also undertakes the task of helping his classmates repair damaged works.
"The cloth exhibition lasted until 4: 30 in the morning, and then it was repaired. The time was very tight. I forgot to take a picture with the work, and I was a little sorry."
He hopes that when the epidemic is more stable, he will come to Beijing with his classmates to see his work exhibition.

That morning, the 65-year-old Bolsonaro posted a picture on Twitter, in which he was wearing sneakers and no mask, sitting at a table with breakfast, with a smile on his face, one hand holding up his thumb, and the other hand holding up a box of hydroxychloroquine drugs.
He wrote on the tweet: "Good morning everyone! COVID-19 test results: negative."

Reward 50,000 yuan for Hubei Enshi to praise the sand dam landslide "early warning first person " - chinanews.com
Hubei Daily News (Reporter Lin Jing) On July 26, Enshi City notified Chen Guangming, a geological disaster site monitor who had made an important contribution to the early warning of sand dam landslides, and sent him a prize of 50,000 yuan.
At the same time, the city's party members and cadres are called upon to learn from his spirit of dedication, daring to take responsibility, initiative and dedication.
On July 21, a landslide occurred in the sand dam of Ma'er Village, Tunpu Township, Enshi City, causing the formation of a barrier lake in the main stream of the Qingjiang River. Chen Guangming, 58, was the first person to warn of the landslide.
On the afternoon of July 17, Chen Guangming learned of the cracking of the walls of the villagers' homes and immediately went to the scene to check.
As soon as he walked five or six hundred meters from his home, he saw the village road split by four or five centimeters, extending along the road to the corn field, about 50 meters in length.
Chen Guangming was alert and sent photos of road cracking to the township's "geological disaster monitor contact group" as soon as possible.
After on-site inspection and judgment by the relevant person in charge of the Nature Planning Institute of Tunpu Township, the possibility of landslide is very high, and the decision to evacuate the masses was made immediately.
Chen Guangming's timely warning provided 36 hours of valuable time for the safe evacuation of 1,339 people from 315 households in the affected area.
There were no casualties in this major geological disaster.

The development of new drugs by the University of Australia is expected to be used to treat vascular blockages caused by COVID-19 - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Sydney, July 26 (Reporter Chen Yu) Researchers at Monash University in Australia are developing a new drug that can help prevent heart disease and stroke, and hope that this drug can be used to treat vascular blockages caused by COVID-19.
Researchers have found that before a heart attack or stroke, an enzyme in platelets accelerates platelet clotting.
As a result, they developed a drug that can temporarily inhibit platelet clotting, thereby avoiding clogging of blood vessels and preventing heart disease and stroke.
The researchers said that this drug will only inhibit the clotting effect of platelets when there are signs of heart disease or stroke.
Since studies have shown that similar vascular blockage is one of the main causes of death in severely ill patients with COVID-19, researchers hope that this drug can be used in the treatment of such severe patients in the future.
At present, the drug has achieved good results in animal model experiments, and researchers are preparing for the next stage of human clinical trials.
The research results have been published in the American journal "Science and Transformation Medicine" a few days ago.
He became the first spectator to enter the CBA League after allowing the audience to watch the game live.
On the same day, in the second stage of the 2019-2020 Chinese Men's Basketball Professional League (CBA) rematch (Laoshan Division) held in Qingdao, Shandong Province, medical staff, teachers, and people from the public security front passed through the official ticket purchase platform to complete the relevant procedures, including nucleic acid testing, and entered the field to watch the game of the Shanghai Jiushi Team against the Shandong Xiwang team.
During the game, spectators must wear masks all the way, take seats in pairs, and strictly maintain a one-meter interval.
When leaving the field, the audience must maintain the "one-meter line" social distance in an orderly exit in the order of moving forward from behind, first on both sides, and then in the middle.
Xinjiang deeply ploughs "sunflower fields" to use clean energy - chinanews.com

China News Service, Hami, Xinjiang, July 26: Xinjiang deeply ploughs "sunflower fields" to use clean energy
More than 6,000 pentagonal sunglasses, each 48 square meters, are neatly arranged in a circle, such as a silver "sunflower field", which rotates with the sun and reflects sunlight to a heat absorption tower more than 200 meters high in the center to generate electricity.
The reporter saw this scene on the 25th at the Hami molten salt tower-type photothermal power plant of the China Electric Power Project in Yumu Town, Iwu County, Hami City, Xinjiang.
"The so-called molten salt tower photothermal power generation is to concentrate sunlight through the mirror to the heat absorption tower to form heat energy, and then convert heat energy into electricity through traditional power generation technology."
Zhang Yong, deputy general manager of CLP Hami Solar Thermal Power Generation Co., Ltd., introduced that its design principle is similar to that of solar cookers used in rural areas in northwestern China, which must gather sunlight.
The power plant started construction in October 2017, and was connected to the grid at the end of last year, covering an area of 6,600 acres. A total of 14,500 sunglasses are planned to be installed.
"Compared with traditional solar power generation technology, its biggest advantage is that it can store the accumulated heat energy and generate electricity at night."
Zhang Yong said that the 13-hour heat storage system configured by the project can enable the generator set to maintain continuous and stable operation without being affected by light changes; it can also quickly participate in the peak adjustment of the power grid according to the demand of power grid load peaks and valleys.
After the project is fully completed, it can achieve an annual power generation of 198 million degrees, save more than 60,000 tons of standard coal each year, reduce more than 60 tons of sulfur dioxide, more than 60 tons of nitrogen oxides, about 20 tons of soot, and more than 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide, providing a steady stream of clean energy for the local area.
In addition, there is another silver "sunflower field" in the Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park in Hami City.
Hami Fuguang Solar Photovoltaic Power Station covers an area of more than 2,300 acres, and the 714 power generation equipment that has been built also follow the sun's rotation, always maintaining a 90-degree right angle between the sun and the concentrated panel.
"We use double-axis tracking concentrated light power generation technology. Through unified integrated control, all power generation equipment will adjust the angle according to the sun's height to maintain power generation efficiency."
Duan Mengqi, director of the power station, said that under good light weather conditions, the power generation technology can increase the efficiency of traditional photovoltaic power generation by about 20%.
In the first half of this year, the power station has achieved power generation of more than 7 million degrees, supplementing local electricity demand.
Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park is currently a photovoltaic industry demonstration park with the largest monomer scale and the most complete type of photovoltaic components in Xinjiang. There are 38 photovoltaic power generation projects, with a total installed capacity of 820,000 kilowatts.
The power generation completed in the first half of this year exceeded 110 million degrees, an increase of 6% over the same period in 2019.
Hami is one of the regions with the best solar energy resources in China.
The annual average total solar radiation is more than 6,200 megajoules per square meter, and the annual sunshine hours are about 3,200 hours.
In recent years, the city has vigorously developed the photovoltaic industry and planted "sunflower fields".
A solar power generation scale of more than 2.5 million kilowatts has been built, and the city's photovoltaic power generation in the first half of this year exceeded 1.4 billion degrees, an increase of about 14% year-on-year.
Currently, there are more than 330 grid-connected photovoltaic power stations in Xinjiang, with an installed capacity of more than 10 million kilowatts.
It is estimated that photovoltaic power generation will reach 15 billion degrees this year, which can replace more than 6 million tons of standard coal.
The police reported that the detailed search and rescue work of "female college students travelling to Qinghai to lose contact" is still continuing - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 26 (Reporter Wang Jinjin Zhou Zhe) Recently, "a female college student lost contact after traveling to Golmud, Qinghai" attracted the attention of netizens.
The Public Security Bureau of Golmud City, Haixi Mongol Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, reported on the 26th that Huang Moumou, a student from a certain university in Nanjing, is still in a state of disconnection, and the police in many places are going deep along Huang Moumou's lost connection and actively carrying out search work.
On July 10, 2020, the Public Security Detachment of the Public Security Bureau of Golmud City, Haixi Prefecture, received a notice from a superior that Huang Moumou, a student from a certain university in Nanjing, took the Z164 train from Nanjing to Golmud on July 5, and on July 9, his mobile phone was turned off and lost contact in the southwest area of Qingshui River, Sonan Dage Protection Station, Qumalai County, Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, and asked for assistance in finding it.
According to the investigation by the Public Security Bureau of Golmud City, Huang Moumou entered the province of Qinghai at 19: 54 on July 6, and arrived in Golmud at 4: 00 on the 7th.
At 8 o'clock on the same day, Huang Moumou, a missing person, took a taxi from the Yellow River Hotel in Golmud City to G109 National Road, and arrived at the Kekexili Sonan Dage Protection Station at 12 o'clock. The taxi driver returned alone. Huang Moumou arrived at the Qingshui River area near the Sonan Dage Protection Station at 15: 00 on the 7th and shut down in the area at 18: 00 on the 9th.
In further investigation, the police found that Huang Moumou had passed through the Najiigou checkpoint at 17: 07 on July 13.
The Neijigou checkpoint is a checkpoint set up by Naqu City, Tibet Autonomous Region, at Nanshankou, Golmud City. Since the checkpoint does not have video surveillance, it is impossible to determine the information of the person and the vehicle on which he is travelling. The police can only drive along the way to search, and if Huang Moumou is found at various checkpoints along the way in Tibet, immediately contact the Golmud Public Security Bureau.
According to the latest situation, at 1 am on July 26, the Golmud City Public Security Bureau organized rescue forces to carry rescue equipment and went to the Qinghai-Tibet Highway Non-freezing Spring Protection Station and Sonan Dage Protection Station to search, and actively contacted the Sichuan police, the Tibetan police, and the Nanjing police to work together. The search and rescue work is still continuing.
The local police hope that if the majority of netizens and all sectors of society have relevant clues, they will promptly provide them to the Golmud police and the Nanjing Jiangning police, so as to find the missing person Huang Moumou as soon as possible.
At the same time, relevant experts suggest that tourists should be standardized, rational, and civilized during outdoor activities, always pay attention to roadside warning signs, and do not risk entering no-man's land. In case of emergencies, they must call the police in time.
The US media revealed the truth about the US unprovoked request that China close the Consulate General in Houston - chinanews.com

The US media revealed the truth about the US unprovoked request that China close the Consulate General in Houston
On the 24th, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the U.S. Embassy in China that China had decided to revoke the license for the establishment and operation of the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu, and put forward specific requirements for the Consulate General to cease all business and activities as a countermeasure to the sudden request of the United States on the 21st that China close the Consulate General in Houston.
This behavior of the U.S. government has aroused many concerns, and its political motives have been questioned by foreign media and scholars.
Why is China required to close the Consulate General?
Several foreign media said that it is not clear why the United States chose the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, but for the purpose of this move, the foreign media said bluntly: For the general election.
CNN reported on the 23rd that the US request that China close the Consulate General in Houston has aroused public doubts about its political motives.
The article stated that the US government's disastrous response to COVID-19 has caused President Trump's pre-election poll support to be relatively low.
White House officials said privately that the tough strategy adopted against China is to save Trump's approval rating and also to shift the responsibility for the failure of the White House's response to the epidemic.
The article believes that the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is a "politically driven and very cautious" target chosen by the United States. The U.S. government chose it "to create a tough attitude while avoiding the risk of major conflict."
The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) also believes that when the US election season approaches and the US economy is severely hit by the epidemic, Trump believes that "playing the 'China card' has a political advantage."
The current situation is "a spiraling, tit-for-tat struggle", which is promoted to a certain extent by the U.S. government from the perspective of domestic considerations, and will only worsen the tension between China and the United States.
CBS reported that Trump's re-election prospects are under pressure due to the outbreak of the epidemic, and he has repeatedly accused China of the epidemic.
Almost every day, the United States has new actions against Trump's absurd argument that "China exploits the United States."
"The Consulate General of Houston is very important in establishing contacts between the two countries."
The Associated Press commented that the U.S. request for China to close its consulate in Houston has increased tensions between the world's two largest economies.
If the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is closed, in addition to the diplomatic impact, Chinese citizens in the southern United States face difficulties in obtaining consular services, as do American citizens seeking visas and other services.
A business group in Houston expressed regret over the US request that China close the Consulate General in Houston, saying that the Consulate General has played an important role in establishing trade, investment and cultural ties between the two countries.
The Associated Press believes that this reflects the importance of China's economy.
The website of the US "Foreign Policy" magazine believes that the US move "is part of a series of provocative measures that will only worsen US-China relations."
Reuters quoted Jonathan Pollack, an expert on East Asia issues at the Brookings Institution, a US think tank, as saying that since the establishment of comprehensive diplomatic relations between the United States and China in 1979, he could not think of any action comparable to this action by the United States against the Chinese Consulate General in Houston.
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported that the US move is unprecedented in more than 40 years of diplomatic relations between China and the United States.
Analysts believe that this move may cause lasting damage.
The Chinese Consulate General in Houston was established in 1979 and was the first Chinese Consulate General in the United States.
At present, China has one embassy and five consulates general in the United States.

After that, he took a speedboat to the waters of the Neva River in the center of St. Petersburg and went ashore to watch the military parade held on the Neva River.
Putin said in a speech at the military parade that the modern technical level of Russian naval equipment has continued to improve in recent years, and the Russian Navy will receive a total of about 40 new ships equipped with unique hypersonic strike systems in 2020.
In addition, Russian Navy Commander-in-Chief Yevmenov said in an interview with the Russian Defense Ministry newspaper "Red Star" that Russia's plan to build ships has been effectively implemented, and the number of new ships that the Russian Navy plans to receive in 2020 is the largest in recent years.
In 1696, Tsar Peter the Great set out to form a maritime fleet, creating the history of the Russian navy.
The last Sunday in July of each year is the Russian Navy Day.
In response to the new changes in the epidemic prevention and control work, since July 17, trade unions at all levels in Xinjiang have responded to the call of the Autonomous Region Federation of Trade Unions and actively participated in the epidemic prevention and control work.
Tianshan North and South Trade Union cadres, employees, and model workers walked into street communities and residents to carry out activities such as delivering vegetables and medicines, disinfecting and sterilizing, and publicizing epidemic prevention knowledge, serving the workers and the masses, and demonstrating the "hard core power" of the trade union with practical actions.
Recently, the consolation team of the Tianshan District Federation of Trade Unions in Urumqi City sent a batch of urgently needed epidemic prevention and control living materials to the staff at 12 isolation points.
After the outbreak, Tianshan District invested more than 1.05 million yuan in the first time, which was urgently allocated to 23 directly affiliated grassroots trade unions.
After receiving the company's notice on the prevention and control of the epidemic, Zhao Xiangguo, deputy secretary of the Party Committee of China Construction Xinjiang Construction Industry and president of the Trade Union, volunteered to stay on duty in the unit to escort the employees.
He sends cooking utensils, food and daily necessities to the employees who live in the unit dormitory and newly recruited employees, and organizes personnel to send them daily necessities every two days.
"From July 21, the cadres and employees who adhere to the front line of the battle against the 'epidemic' will be mapped out, and the method of online ordering and door-to-door delivery by merchants will be adopted. The 704 front-line employees in Urumqi area will be supplemented with epidemic prevention supplies and living materials."
The person in charge of the Xinjiang Transport Union told reporters that in the face of the sudden epidemic, they made every effort to ensure epidemic prevention and control services, steadily promote all aspects of transportation development, and create a strong atmosphere of fighting the "epidemic".
At the current high temperature in summer, trade unions at all levels are keeping an eye on front-line workers in key areas for epidemic prevention and control, and putting "sending cool" care and care into practice.
On July 19, the Urumqi County Federation of Trade Unions launched a "sending cool" condolences to front-line workers in epidemic prevention and control. Police stations, card points, and health systems across the county received comforts such as drinks and fruits.
"Trade union cadres should further improve their political positions, strengthen their responsibilities, warm their hearts with care, and inspire fighting spirit with actions.
It is necessary to give full play to the role of trade union organizations in rallying and uniting employees, do a good job in epidemic prevention and control services, actively safeguard the health rights and interests of the majority of employees, and send care to front-line employees. "
The relevant person in charge of the Autonomous Region Federation of Trade Unions said.

Spokesman for the Embassy in the United Kingdom: The Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security - chinanews.com
Chinanews.com, July 26. According to the website of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom, on the 25th, the spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom answered questions from reporters about false statements about cyber attacks.
The spokesman emphasized that the Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security and has always resolutely opposed and combated any form of cyber attacks and cyber crimes.
A reporter asked: According to the media, hacker organizations related to China have interfered with the network system of a British company, launched attacks on British and American technology companies that have patent data, and invaded the government networks of EU countries.
The spokesman said that the Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security and has always resolutely opposed and combated any form of cyber attacks and cyber crimes.
Cyberspace is highly virtual, difficult to trace, and diverse actors. Sufficient evidence should be presented when investigating and characterizing cyber incidents, and no unfounded guesses should be made.
The spokesman said that a series of incidents such as the "Prism Gate" in the past proved that the United States has been conducting the world's largest cyber theft operation.
Maintaining peace and stability in cyberspace is in the common interest of all countries.
The spokesman pointed out that China's achievements in scientific and technological innovation were not stolen or stolen, but obtained through self-reliance and hard work.
In 2019, China submitted about 59,000 patent applications through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), with an annual growth rate of 10.6%, making it the country with the largest number of international patent applications.
China has become a big country in innovation and intellectual property.
Data from the Urumqi Central Branch of the People's Bank of China show that in the first half of the year, new loans to agriculture-related and small and micro enterprises in Xinjiang exceeded the annual increase in 2019.
In the first half of this year, the Urumqi Central Branch of the People's Bank of China used a variety of monetary policy tools to guide the banking sector to continuously increase its loan investment, and provided sufficient funds for epidemic prevention and control and the resumption of work and production.
Urumqi free nucleic acid testing Most districts have basically completed secondary testing in high-risk areas - chinanews.com
Chinanews.com, Urumqi, July 26 (Reporter Sun Tingwen Zhao Yamin) Zhang Wei, director of the Urumqi Health Commission, said in a briefing on the latest epidemic and nucleic acid testing in Urumqi on the 26th that at present, most districts in Urumqi have basically completed free nucleic acid testing.
The expert group of the State Council and experts from the autonomous region and Urumqi City are making further assessments of the development of the epidemic based on the results of nucleic acid testing and epidemiological investigations.
The Press Office of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region held a press conference on the 26th to report on the epidemic situation and prevention and control in Xinjiang.
According to him, from 0: 00 to 24: 00 on July 25, there were 22 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Urumqi (of which 5 were confirmed cases of asymptomatic infection), and 38 new cases of asymptomatic infection.
As of 24: 00 on July 25, Urumqi has 135 confirmed cases and 147 asymptomatic infections.
The new asymptomatic infections on the 25th were also basically detected through the city's free nucleic acid testing and active screening.
Zhang Wei, director of the Urumqi Municipal Health Commission, said on the 26th that most districts in Urumqi City have basically completed free nucleic acid testing.
He also said that from the experience of other parts of the country, there are many factors that affect the results of nucleic acid testing, such as the sensitivity of the test reagent, the time of infection and detoxification of the tested person, the cooperation of the tested person when the specimen is taken (poor compatibility may cause the specimen not to be taken in place), and the testing environment, the operation proficiency of the inspectors, etc.
For various reasons, false negative results can also appear in nucleic acid testing.
The so-called false negative means that the tested person is indeed an infected person, but the nucleic acid test result is negative.
In addition, for people who have had close contact with confirmed and suspected cases, two nucleic acid tests are usually required to exclude them.
For people who have been to high-risk areas in the epidemic, if they have fever and respiratory symptoms, a negative nucleic acid test can be a false negative, so two nucleic acid tests are also required to exclude it.
He said that in view of the above, for the health of the people of all ethnic groups in the city, starting today, Urumqi City will conduct a second free nucleic acid test in key areas such as Tianshan District and Shaibak District, and carry out "checking for omissions".
It is reported that Tianshan District and Shaibak District are high-risk areas for the epidemic.

Every year, the Shanghai International Film Festival, with the attitude of continuous innovation and continuous improvement, is a new start and a new start.
Therefore, it is necessary to take every step well to serve the spiritual life of the people and the high-quality development of the film and television industry.
This year is even more so.
In order to cherish the hard-won epidemic prevention and control situation, the Shanghai International Film Festival, on the one hand, strictly abides by the epidemic prevention requirements and implements the epidemic prevention and control measures in detail; on the other hand, it holds the vision of gathering wisdom for Chinese film creation and meeting the viewing needs of movie fans, and opens up online and offline multi-section activities.
On the first day of the opening, from offline viewing to industry forums, film festival-related activities strictly implemented relevant epidemic prevention policies.
The forum activities are controlled within 50 people, and the attendance rate is strictly controlled within 30%.
As the film festival organizing committee upholds, in any case, "putting the life safety and physical health of the people first" is a major prerequisite.
Offline activities have been greatly streamlined, and the "cloud" has become a lot of excitement.
In order to implement the important concept of "people's city and people's city for the people", as a festival for the people, this year's Shanghai International Film Festival plans to innovate and transform, using online "cloud display" and master class "cloud sharing" to meet the diverse needs of movie fans.
On the first day of the opening, the official partners of the film festival, Migu Video and Oriental Pearl Blockbuster, respectively, "cloud" multiple "Belt and Road" films to give back to fans.
That night, the Golden Jue Opening Forum and Jia Zhangke Master Class were also launched on multiple platforms such as CCTV, Learning Power, and Wenhui App, allowing people to follow the latest trends in Chinese films without leaving their homes.
At the opening forum yesterday, Yan Xiaoming, member of the party group and deputy director of CCTV, delivered a speech and announced the opening of the film festival. Zhou Huilin, member of the Standing Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and Minister of Propaganda, delivered a speech, and Deputy Mayor Zong Ming attended.
White House epidemic expert Fauci: Cautious optimism about the development of a vaccine in early 2021
Fauci made the above remarks at an online video conference hosted by the International Leadership Foundation on the 25th.
He reminded that it is not clear how COVID-19 will develop in autumn and winter, nor what the ultimate impact of the epidemic will be. "The only way to end this is for each of us to choose to be part of the solution."
According to data from Johns Hopkins University in the United States, as of 21: 00 on the 25th, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the United States has reached 4.176 million, with 146,000 deaths.
Fauci said that some parts of the United States are currently struggling to fight the rebounding epidemic.
Although the epidemic situation varies from place to place and requires tailored response plans, diverse anti-epidemic strategies do not mean that there is no close connection between regions.
The epidemic in one region will eventually affect other regions.
"This is not the time for complacency", Fauci said. "Our work is not complete, we must step up our efforts, and we must remain vigilant against the uncertainty of the future."
He freshman, an American Chinese medical expert and founder of "cocktail therapy" to treat AIDS, pointed out at the meeting that COVID-19 in the United States has not yet reached its peak.
"Each of us must do our part to slow the spread of this virus."
He University called on the public to use their own practical actions to buy time for scientists to step up the development of COVID-19 treatment drugs and vaccines.
The International Leadership Foundation is a non-profit organization that aims to promote international exchanges in the United States and the Asia-Pacific region. It is committed to improving the status of Asian-Pacific Americans in the United States and nurturing international youth leaders.
On the same day, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Zhao Xiaolan, U.S. Congressman Meng Zhaowen, and Dong Jiling, founder of the International Leadership Foundation, spoke at the meeting.
They paid special tribute to Asia-Pacific medical workers and volunteers fighting the epidemic on the front line, and called on the American public to continue to adhere to epidemic prevention guidelines such as "social distance" to curb the spread of the epidemic.

Brazilian studies have shown that hydroxychloroquine is ineffective in the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 - chinanews.com
Recently, a Brazilian study showed that hydroxychloroquine is ineffective in patients with mild COVID-19.
The study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
Pakistani researchers divided 667 patients from 55 hospitals across the country into three groups and conducted clinical trials; mainly compared the therapeutic effects of hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with other antibiotics azithromycin, and analyzed whether it would help improve the condition of mild and moderate patients with COVID-19.
The results show that hydroxychloroquine not only has no therapeutic effect, but may have traumatic side effects on organs.
This research was carried out by several authoritative hospitals in Brazil such as Hospital Israel Albert Einstein, Cardiology Hospital (HCor), Syrian Lebanese Hospital (Hospital Sírio-Libanês), etc., in collaboration with the Brazilian Clinical Research Institute (BCRI) and the Brazilian Critical Care Research Network (BRICNet).
On the 25th local time, Brazilian President Bolsonaro announced through a social platform that the fourth nucleic acid test result was negative.

On the 25th, the 2020 Hunan Red Tourism Cultural Festival and the first Xiangtan Red Cultural Industry Expo opened in Shaoshan.
In recent years, the demand for red tourism has gradually increased.
However, the development of the red tourism industry is also facing difficulties such as a small number of young groups, homogenization of tourist projects, and single commercialization channels.
Especially this year's epidemic raid, the national cultural and tourism industry has been seriously frustrated, and red tourist attractions are also facing severe challenges.
For example, the use of technological means such as drone shooting and VR immersion experience can meet the tourist needs of "people who have not arrived, the scene has arrived"; the introduction of webcasting means to promote the famous and special products of red scenic spots can directly improve the economic benefits of red tourism; the introduction of "cloud" technology to create boutique displays with prominent themes, clear orientation, and rich connotations to fully demonstrate and enhance the missionary function of red scenic spots; and innovate the dissemination method of red culture to "live" revolutionary cultural relics, make red tourism popular, let red genes pass on, and enhance the attractiveness of red scenic spots.
This cultural festival uses the popular "county and city (district) long + professional anchor special promotion" method to promote red cultural tourism specialties, and uses 5G technology to provide real-time viewing and smart city demonstrations to promote red cultural tourism attractions. These are all attempts to put wisdom wings on red tourism, and look forward to Hunan's red tourism becoming more and more popular.
Us-China trade talks representatives meet in August
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post quoted an anonymous person familiar with the matter as reporting that Liu He, head of China's trade negotiation team and vice premier of the State Council, and Lai Haizhe, co-leader of the US team and trade representative, are expected to hold formal talks in August to assess the implementation of the first phase of the Sino-US trade agreement.
The report said that although China has significantly increased its purchases of U.S. agricultural products in the past few months, due to factors such as COVID-19, China's purchases are still some distance from the quantities promised in the trade agreement.
Analysts say that the recent closure of each other's consulates by the United States and China, together with other disputes, may undermine any progress in trade between the two sides.
The first phase of the Sino-US trade agreement came into effect one month after it was signed on January 15. The agreement stipulates that the high-level trade framework group formed by the two sides should hold talks every six months.
People familiar with the matter revealed that this meeting will be "an important turning point" for both parties to assess the progress of the agreement.
But this person also said that if the tension between the United States and China leads to a low willingness to talk at this time, the two sides may agree that the May 8 conference call between Lai Haizhe and Liu He has met the terms of the semi-annual talks in the trade agreement.
Since this year, Sino-US relations have deteriorated rapidly. Disputes between the two sides include a series of issues such as the origin of COVID-19, trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the South China Sea and ideology.
Although US President Trump boasted about his achievements in the first phase of the agreement at the beginning of the year, his attitude has changed recently.
He said at a White House press conference on the 23rd that although China has recently purchased a record number of U.S. corn in a single day and has also bought a lot of soybeans, "but this trade agreement now means less to me than it was when it was reached."
An anonymous Beijing government consultant also believes that due to poor US-China relations, a new round of trade negotiations is unlikely to take place, and that "trade issues have lost weight in Sino-US relations."
However, he revealed that Chinese economic and trade-related units still met on the 23rd to discuss a series of issues, including how to increase imports from the United States. "We have tried our best to buy, so any additional purchases will be difficult."
Peng Jining, vice chairman of the US-China Trade National Committee, said that maintaining the momentum of the first phase of the agreement is "more important than ever" and said that China has made progress in further opening up its financial markets to US companies this year.
An analyst at Plenum, an independent research company, said: "It is better to talk than not to talk, although it may only be regarded as routine."
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 (Reporter Wei Yukun) The reporter learned from the Ministry of Emergency Management on the 26th that the National Defense Office and the Ministry of Emergency Management, together with the National Food and Material Reserve Bureau, have once again urgently transferred 1.35 million woven bags, 1.2 million square meters of woven cloth, 130,000 square meters of geotextiles and other 6 categories of central reserve flood control materials to Anhui to support flood fighting and rescue work.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Ministry of Emergency Management, at present, the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Huaihe River basin maintain high water level fluctuations. The "Yangtze River 2020 No. 3 Flood" formed in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River on the 26th, increasing the risk in some areas.
The meteorological department predicts that there will be heavy rainfall in Chongqing, Guizhou, and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in the next three days, and the flood control situation is still severe and complex.
According to reports, since the flood season, the Ministry of Emergency Management has deployed a national comprehensive fire rescue team to pre-position professional rescue forces in key flood control areas. It has participated in a total of 10,364 flood fighting and rescue operations, dispatched more than 130,000 fighters, 1,7778 fire trucks and 11,887 boats, rescued 37,777 people in distress, and evacuated more than 107,000 trapped people.
Hao Yusheng, chief representative of Nasdaq China: Now is the best time node for Chinese companies to go to the United States for IPOs-Economic Watch-Professional Financial News website
Economic Observer Network reporter Zhang Bin Because of the Ruixin Coffee forgery incident, the US market has imposed stricter supervision on Chinese stocks, coupled with the long-term pressure on valuations, and Chinese stocks listed in the United States are under pressure. Netease, JD.com and other Chinese stocks have recently started their journey back to Hong Kong for listing.
Recently, shell, ideal car and other companies have been enthusiastic about going public in the United States.
Under the epidemic and the Chinese stock crisis, is this the best time for Chinese companies to go public in the United States?
"In terms of recent IPO cases and the next companies to go public in the United States, IPOs in the United States have not been affected in essence, but the market is very good now, and even this point in time is the best time node for Chinese companies to go to the US for IPOs in the past 10 years."
Hao Yusheng, chief representative of the China region of the Nasdaq Stock Exchange, said at the "2020 Listed Company Leaders Summit China Shares Branch" hosted by Snowball.
In April this year, the US Securities Regulatory Commission (SEC) and the US Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) issued the "Statement on the Important Role of Audit Quality and Supervision in Obtaining Audit and Other International Information-A Discussion on the Current Challenges of Information Access for Listed Companies in the United States with a large number of operations in China."
The statement stated that although international cooperation and coordination have increased significantly in recent years, the problems of US regulators in terms of access to information still exist, and the SEC and PCAOB still face legal and practical challenges; corresponding to this document, the PCAOB website lists in detail the list of listed companies that have encountered audit obstacles and their audit institutions, and a large number of Chinese stock companies are listed.
In addition, in May this year, the U.S. Senate passed the Foreign Companies Accountability Act, which introduced additional information disclosure requirements for foreign companies to list in the United States.
In Hao Yusheng's view, the Chinese stock crisis has not affected the appetite of investors.
"When this news first came out, it caused everyone's panic. Everyone was asking if they could go public in the United States in the future, but later we found that these problems were not a problem on the investor's side. Investors may ask these questions during the recent IPO roadshow in the United States, and even become standardized questions, but this has not been regarded by investors as an important factor in investing in and not investing in a Chinese company.
It is recommended that everyone try to treat the current situation with an ordinary heart.
Of course, this time may look like the worst situation in the past two years, but in terms of investor appetite, it has not been affected in any way.
So from now until the end of this year or before the US election, the upsurge of IPOs to the United States will continue. "
On May 9 this year, Jinshan Yun officially listed on Nasdaq in the United States, becoming the first Chinese company to go to the United States for an IPO after the epidemic.
"Jinshan Yun's listing gives Chinese companies preparing for IPOs a lot of confidence."
Hao Yusheng said.
According to the China Stock Data Report for the first half of 2020 released by Snowball, in the first half of this year, a total of 20 Chinese companies went to the US for IPOs, an increase of 17.6% over the same period last year; in terms of total initial fund-raising, 20 companies raised a total of 2.725 billion, up more than 52.4% from the same period last year; in terms of industry distribution, the number of IPOs in the health care industry in the first half of this year was outstanding, an increase of 100% over the same period last year.
According to Hao Yusheng, the quality of Chinese companies that went to the US for IPOs in the first half of this year is higher, and high-quality companies with strong fundamentals and growth will be more favored by investors.
In the short, medium and long term, Hao Yusheng continues to be optimistic about Ming China's IPO in the United States.
"In the short term, the wave of IPOs to the United States continues; in the medium term, Chinese companies have more choices, A-shares, Hong Kong stocks, and US stocks. Everyone will take the US election and Sino-US relations as factors for market selection and time selection; in the long run, everything will return to normal, and market fluctuations are cycles, both political and economic, and will eventually return to the normal stage. The stock market has always been volatile."
Hao Yusheng also said, "There are more uncertain factors this year, but for high-quality companies, whether the market is good or bad, as long as they are solid and have growth that investors can see, other factors are relatively minor, and investors need to invest in excellent Chinese companies."

Then he came to the public space on the first floor of the National Centre for the Performing Arts and began a dialogue with Yang Yang, Zhang Haochen and the tuner of the National Centre for the Performing Arts in front of three nine-foot pianos with stories.

Commentator of the People's Daily: Concentrate on doing your own affairs and building new advantages for future development-On learning and implementing General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the Entrepreneurs Symposium - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 25
At present, the global epidemic and the world economic situation are still severe and complex, and the challenges facing my country's development are unprecedented.
Maintaining strategic determination, enhancing confidence in winning, and concentrating our efforts on our own affairs are the keys to our response to various risks and challenges.
At the recent entrepreneur symposium, General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized that in the current external environment of rising protectionism, downturn in the world economy, and shrinking global markets, we must concentrate our efforts on our own affairs, give full play to the advantages of the domestic super-large-scale market, and gradually form a new development pattern with the domestic big cycle as the main body and the domestic and international double cycles mutually promoting each other, improve the modernization level of the industrial chain supply chain, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation, accelerate key core technology issues, and create new advantages for future development.
Those who observe the situation are wise, and those who control the situation win.
In the external environment of the in-depth development of economic globalization, the "two ends" of the market and resources have played an important role in the rapid development of my country.
Now, the world under the impact of the epidemic is undergoing profound changes, facing more unstable and uncertain factors, and economic globalization is encountering headwinds and back waves.
Do a good job of ideological preparation and work preparation to respond to changes in the external environment for a longer period of time, and promote my country's economy to ride the wind and waves and maintain stability and distance. An extremely important aspect is to take the expansion and satisfaction of domestic demand as the strategic basis for development, give full play to its own advantages, and add impetus to my country's economic development by thriving the domestic economy and unblocking the domestic cycle, and drive the recovery of the world economy.
We must deeply realize that building a complete domestic demand system is related to my country's long-term development and long-term stability.
The Party Central Committee reviewed the situation and clearly proposed to resolutely implement the strategy of expanding domestic demand. This is the need to respond to the impact of the epidemic, to maintain the long-term sustainable and healthy development of our economy, and to meet the needs of the people's growing good life.
The advantage of a large economy is that it is internally recyclable.
My country has the world's most complete and largest industrial system, strong production capacity, and perfect supporting capabilities. It has more than 100 million market players and more than 170 million people with higher education or various professional skills. There is also a super-large domestic demand market formed by 1.4 billion people, including more than 400 million middle-income groups. It is in the rapid development stage of new industrialization, informatization, urbanization, and agricultural modernization, and the potential for investment demand is huge.
Public ownership is the main body, multiple ownership economies develop together, distribution according to work is the main body, and multiple distribution methods coexist. Socialist market economy system and other socialist basic economic systems can not only stimulate the vitality of various market entities, liberate and develop social productive forces, but also promote the organic unity of efficiency and fairness, and continuously achieve common prosperity.
We must firmly grasp the strategic basis of expanding domestic demand, make production, distribution, and circulation more dependent on the domestic market to achieve a virtuous circle, clarify the strategic direction of supply-side structural reforms, and promote aggregate supply and aggregate demand to achieve a dynamic balance at a higher level.
It is necessary to accelerate the construction of a complete domestic demand system, vigorously promote technological innovation and other innovations, accelerate the promotion of strategic emerging industries such as digital economy, intelligent manufacturing, life and health, and new materials, form more new growth points and growth poles, and gradually form a new development pattern that takes the domestic big cycle as the main body and the domestic and international double cycles promote each other.
Openness brings progress, and closure is bound to lag behind.
General Secretary Xi Jinping has repeatedly emphasized that the door to China's opening will not be closed, but will only open wider and wider.
Taking the domestic big cycle as the main body, it is by no means to close the door to operate, but to give full play to the potential of domestic demand, make the domestic and international markets better connected, and make better use of the two international and domestic markets and two resources to achieve stronger and more sustainable development.
At the same time, there is no contradiction between expanding domestic demand and opening up. The smoother the domestic cycle, the more conducive to building a new pattern of openness, and the more conducive to forming new advantages in participating in international cooperation and competition.
Although protectionism is on the rise internationally, we must stand on the right side of history, persist in deepening reforms, expanding opening up, strengthening open cooperation in the field of science and technology, promoting the construction of an open world economy, and promoting the construction of a community with a shared future for mankind.
The Chinese nation has experienced many tribulations in its history, but it has never been crushed, but it has become more and more courageous, constantly growing in tribulations and rising from tribulations.
On the way forward, there is the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the remarkable advantages of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, strong mobilization capabilities and strong comprehensive strength, and the unity and struggle of the entire party, the whole army, and the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country. We will certainly be able to overcome all difficulties and obstacles, maintain the good momentum of our country's economic and social development, build a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way, and successfully embark on a new journey of building a modern socialist country in an all-round way!
Yu'ebao's income went down "post-90s" but "retaliatory" to save money?
With the decline in Yu'ebao's earnings, not only did the "post-90s" not escape from the balance treasure, but began to "retaliate" to save money?
The "Yu'ebao Post-90s Savings Report" (2020 edition) recently released by the China New Economic Research Institute and Alipay shows that in the first half of the year, "post-90s" prefer to save money: The amount of money saved per capita increased by nearly 40% compared with 2019.
Interestingly, the "post-90s" tend to start with a small amount of "small money", and 60% of the average amount of money saved is less than 20 yuan...
Using the balance to save money has also become the "post-90s" habit of saving money.
Data shows that of the 700 million Yu'ebao users, 134 million are "post-90s".
China has 174 million "post-90s", that is to say, about 3 out of every 4 "post-90s" in the country are using the balance to save money.
At present, the 7-day annualized yield of money funds such as Yu'ebao has fallen to about 1.5% from a level above 2% at the beginning of the year.
Even so, it did not affect the pace of "post-90s" saving money.
In the context of the improvement of Yu'e Bao's "money saving effect", many young people who are used to using Yu'e Bao have also directly transformed into "basic people".
Alipay data shows that as of July 13, the number of new "basic people" on Alipay has more than doubled year-on-year in the past month, and more and more young people have achieved "advanced" financial management on Alipay.
Some analysts believe that the flow of funds from the balance treasure to the stock market is also an important reason for the clear decline in the share of money funds in June.
The report also shows that "post-90s" girls tend to save more money, on average 20% more than boys save; 60% of users who hold funds on the Alipay platform are men, and women tend to choose more robust financial management methods than men.
After saving money, what are the plans for the "post-90s"?
Alipay data shows that "post-90s" have the habit of saving money for their goals, and the most users use travel as a goal to save money.
Affected by the epidemic, many "post-90s" saved money to prepare for travel after the epidemic; the resumption of cinema operations also provided a new way to shift from saving money to consumption.

The majority of party members and cadres, and the people's children and soldiers held fast to the flood-fighting positions, and the will and actions of "the party flag is in the position" and "the flood will never retreat" have become the most assured and trustworthy solid barrier for the people in the disaster area.
The bright party flag flying high on the flood-fighting embankment is selfless dedication and responsibility.
In times of crisis, it shows the true qualities of party members. At a time when the lives and property of the people are seriously threatened, party members and cadres, people's children's soldiers, small families, care for everyone, selfless dedication, dare to take responsibility, and take the hard battle of winning flood control, flood fighting, rescue and disaster relief as a comprehensive test of ability, style, and accomplishment. It is this spirit of selfless dedication and responsibility that greatly inspires the confidence and determination of the people in the disaster area to overcome the disaster, and gathers a strong spiritual force to win flood prevention, flood relief and disaster relief.
"The people are supreme and life is supreme" is not only tested in peacetime, but also tested at critical moments.
On the flood-fighting embankment, the majority of party members and cadres and the people's children and soldiers must let the people see the bright red party flag, the figure of struggle, and the voice of encouragement everywhere at any time, and use the steel dam that cannot be washed down by the flood to add luster to the party flag, and let a bright party flag fly high on the flood-fighting embankment!

A total of 13 people from the Information Department of the Philippine Presidential Palace tested positive - chinanews.com
(Fight against COVID-19) A total of 13 people from the Information Department of the Philippine Presidential Palace tested positive
Chinanews.com, Manila, July 26 (Reporter Guan Dongdong) The Information Department of the Presidential Palace of the Philippines (PCOO) issued a notice on the 25th that the Minister of the Ministry, Martin Andanal, was tested negative for COVID-19 on the 24th.
As of the afternoon of the same day, a total of 13 PCOO staff had tested positive, and three positive people had died and two were still receiving treatment.
Due to contact with an infected staff member of PCOO, Andanar and 49 PCOO staff were tested for COVID-19 on the 24th.
The report released on the 25th showed that 10 of the staff tested positive.
PCOO Deputy Minister of Administrative and Legal Affairs Marvin Gatpayat said that the site is located in the new administrative office building of the Presidential Palace and was originally scheduled to resume operations on the same day that President Duterte delivered his fifth State of the Union address on the 27th.
On the same day, Martin Andanal assured the public that PCOO will continue to perform its duties to the Filipino people, ensure that important information is provided to the public in a timely manner, and strengthen contact tracing and testing to avoid further spread of coronavirus among PCOO staff. He prayed for the speedy recovery of the staff who tested positive.

France increases its military investment in space - Xinhuanet
French Defense Minister Florence Parley said on the 24th that France will increase its space defense budget by hundreds of millions of euros to develop space military forces to prevent "unfriendly actions" that other countries may make in outer space.
Parley told the Provence newspaper that between 2019 and 2025, the expenditure budget for French space military projects will increase from the previously proposed 3.6 billion euros (about 4.2 billion US dollars) to 4.3 billion euros (5 billion US dollars).
According to the French Military Planning Act 2019-2025 approved by the French Parliament in 2018, France is expected to update its existing observation satellites and communication satellites in the future, launch three electromagnetic listening satellites, and improve the modernization level of space surveillance radars.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced in July last year that a space military command and an "aviation and space force" will be established within the French Air Force.
Parley said that she will officially announce the establishment of this space force when she visits a military school in Salon, Provence, later.
Parley said that this space force is affiliated with the Air Force and has a strength of 500 by 2025.
She said: "The idea that people used to think that space served the common interests of science is gone forever. Now space is a place for countries to compete for global hegemony."
Parley reiterated Macron's previous statements, saying that France has no intention of provoking an arms race.
"We are by no means engaged in an arms race. But it is my responsibility to fully recognize the threats we may face."
Parley recalled the surveillance of a military satellite shared by France and Italy in 2017.
She said that it was a Russian satellite that "peeped".
Russia denies this statement.
Parley said that France "soon" will have small patrol satellites capable of detecting and locking "the black hands behind those unfriendly actions."
French media believe that the reason why France seeks to establish a space force is due to US President Donald Trump's request in February last year that the US Department of Defense draft a bill to establish a space force.
Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act in December last year, approving the establishment of the sixth largest military service in the United States, the Space Force.
Some experts worry that these US measures have accelerated the pace of US space militarization and may trigger a new round of space arms race.

The report said that the shared accommodation market has been warming up since March - chinanews.com
News from our newspaper (Reporter Yang Zhaokui) The "China Shared Accommodation Development Report 2020" (hereinafter referred to as the "Report") recently released by the National Information Center Sharing Economy Research Center shows that due to the impact of the epidemic, in the first five months of 2020, the transaction volume of my country's shared accommodation market fell by 72.1% year-on-year.
However, the shared accommodation market has rebounded since March, and the market transaction volume, order volume and reception number have gradually recovered.
The "Report" shows that the transaction volume of the shared accommodation market has dropped sharply. On the one hand, due to the sharp decline in travel accommodation demand under the epidemic prevention and control, the order volume has dropped sharply. The total number of orders in the first five months has dropped by 65% year-on-year, and the number of receptions has dropped by 63% year-on-year; on the other hand, the weakness of demand has also led to a relatively significant decline in overnight prices, with the average overnight price in the first five months falling by 16% year-on-year.
However, the market transaction volume in March, April, and May increased by 78%, 199%, and 35% respectively; the number of orders increased by 141%, 152%, and 50% respectively; and the number of receptions increased by 81%, 112%, and 28% respectively.
The "Report" pointed out that the development of the shared accommodation industry has been promising for a long time, but there are still many uncertainties in the near future.
In this regard, Yu Fengxia, deputy director of the Sharing Economy Research Center of the National Information Center, told the "Workers' Daily" reporter that the development of shared accommodation requires stronger policy support. On the one hand, it is necessary to do a good job in the implementation of policies already in place in the early stage, further strengthen policy coherence, and focus on creating a better business environment; on the other hand, it is necessary to further increase policy guidance and support from many aspects such as stimulating consumer demand, enriching the supply of tourism accommodation services, innovating service methods, and strengthening cooperation between the government and platform enterprises.

Chinanews.com, Xiamen, July 26 (Yang Fushan Zhang Shushan Xu Jingyi) The Vascular Surgery Department of Shanghai Changhai Hospital, Naval Military Medical University, a well-known vascular surgery center in China, signed a contract with the Vascular Surgery Department of Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University on the 25th to establish a collaboration center to promote exchanges and cooperation between the two sides in the field of vascular surgery, especially in the field of acute and severe aortic diseases.
Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University said that after the vascular surgery of the two hospitals formally form a collaborative unit, they will carry out remote consultations, make real-time online consultations with Changhai Hospital to formulate treatment plans, select talents for further training, and jointly carry out surgical technology exchanges and teaching rounds every week; for complex cases, Changhai experts can be invited to the hospital to perform operations according to the needs of the patients, so that patients in southwestern Fujian can enjoy the top domestic medical resources without leaving the province.
The two hospitals will also work together to carry out surgical innovation and scientific research, aortic disease popularization and early screening, etc.
The aortic special seminar hosted by Beijing Health Promotion Association and undertaken by Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University was held in Xiamen on the same day.
The above-mentioned two well-known hospitals in Shanghai and Xiamen held a signing ceremony for the Vascular Surgery Collaboration Center at the same time at the meeting, announcing the formation of a collaborative unit to jointly improve the treatment level of vascular surgery-related diseases in southwestern Fujian.
Shanghai Changhai Hospital Vascular Surgery is the only vascular surgery institute in the army and the only vascular system disease clinical medicine center in Shanghai. It is also the first national key discipline of vascular surgery. It led the establishment of the Chinese Physicians Association's Endovascular Angiology Professional Committee, which is a top team with deep accumulation in the industry.
Professor Huang Xiaojin, Director of Vascular Surgery, Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University, was interviewed by the media.
The Vascular Surgery of Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University is the first vascular surgery set up by an independent discipline in Fujian Province. It has long been committed to the diagnosis and treatment of aortic and peripheral vascular diseases. In 2018, it was approved to build a provincial key clinical specialty.
In the treatment of aortic diseases, in addition to the treatment of dissected aneurysms and aortic aneurysms, there is extensive experience in emergency ruptured aortic aneurysms.
"The vascular surgery of Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University is very outstanding in this region in terms of development history, breadth, difficulty, complexity, etc., so this time we set up a collaboration center. In addition to the aorta, we can also carry out all-round in-depth cooperation in medicine, teaching and scientific research in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases such as lower limb arteries and carotid arteries."
Professor Feng Rui, deputy director of vascular surgery at Shanghai Changhai Hospital, said.
Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University and Shanghai Changhai Hospital signed a contract in 2018 to establish the "Li Zhaoshen Famous Medical Studio" in the Department of Gastroenterology.
Professor Huang Xiaojin, director of vascular surgery of the hospital, said in an interview with a reporter from Chinanews.com that the vascular surgery of the hospital has also been in communication with Changhai Hospital for a long time. This time, the two hospitals formally formed a collaborative unit, bringing cooperation and exchanges between the two sides to a new level.
He said that the hospital will regularly invite Shanghai experts to Xiamen to carry out surgical technology exchanges, teaching rounds, difficult case discussions, etc., and further carry out remote consultations. Currently, it plans to conduct remote consultations once a week; in addition, the department will also send personnel for further training and exchanges to strengthen the training and development of disciplinary talents.
The reporter learned at the meeting that vascular disease is the largest cause of death in China. The aorta, as the main channel of various organs of the human body, flows from the heart to the whole body and plays an important role.
The occurrence of aortic disease is often accompanied by high risk, high mortality, and high difficulty in treatment. The thickest section of the aorta is 4 cm in diameter. Once a hemangioma is formed, a rupture occurs, or the vascular intima ruptures to produce a dissection, it will cause massive bleeding, which is very dangerous.
In recent years, as people's lifestyles have changed and the pace of life has accelerated, China has become the world's largest country with hypertension, and aortic diseases have also increased. Today, with the development of surgical technology and industrial materials, the treatment of aortic diseases continues to develop in the direction of minimally invasive, rapid and efficient.
Doctors can properly "divert" the blood flow by piercing the thigh and placing a stent in the aorta to avoid the impact on the aneurysm or ruptured dissection, and achieve a good therapeutic effect. Some operations even require only local anesthesia.
This academic seminar invited more than ten domestic experts to discuss the new progress in the treatment of aortic diseases, and conducted cutting-edge technical training and difficult case discussions in the form of a conference salon.
The reporter learned at the meeting that with the development of surgical technology and industrial materials, the current treatment of aortic diseases continues to develop in the direction of minimally invasive, rapid and efficient.

On July 24, Ai Qiyi "Journey" also embarked on the journey of webcasting - Xinhuanet
Directed by Chen Desen and produced by Zheng Baorui, the action adventure film "Journey", starring Liu Xianhua, He Rundong, Lin Chenhan, and Jiang Luxia, will be launched on July 24.
This is also the second major production film to choose webcasting after "Mom".
"Journey" is adapted from an online game of the same name. It tells the story of Qingyuan Village boy Dong Yilong and Chu Soul, a warrior of the Chu Family Army, who set out on a journey to participate in the selection of Marshal Ma, a soldier of the Southern Zhao State. On the way, they met King Kong's little sister, and the three joined forces to complete their mission.
This year is the 15th anniversary of the game's "Journey" IP, and the launch of the movie of the same name is undoubtedly a tribute to the classic game.
At the same time as the release was announced, the movie "Journey" released the "National War" version of the set poster and the "Live" pilot trailer.
The excellent picture quality presents a grand picture of the national war in the world, portraying the profound brotherhood of the two protagonists, Dong Yilong and Chu Soul.
"Journey" chooses the overhead era to build the story background.
In the fictional Central Plains mainland, among the ten countries, the Southern Zhao Kingdom and the Northern Yan Kingdom live next to each other.
In order to defend the increasingly powerful Beiyan, Nanzhao held a martial arts convention to select generals.
The news reached the remote Qingyuan Village. Villager Dong Yilong wanted to become the flag bearer of the family and represented the Qingyuan Village family. The villagers questioned his qualifications. After some efforts, Yilong finally embarked on a journey with the warrior Chu Soul.
The total investment in the film is nearly 300 million yuan, and the total special effects lens accounts for up to 80%.
It is conceivable that special effects have become one of the biggest viewing points of "Journey".
The post-special effects production team is also quite promising. The special effects team MORE VFX, which created "Wandering Earth", uses imaginative visual art and top technology to restore the "journey" world.
Some of the classic game scenes, Phoenix City, Qingyuan Village, and Beast King Valley will also appear in the movie, and game players should set off a wave of nostalgia at that time.
In addition to the special effects team, behind-the-scenes production is also a group of accomplished figures in the industry.
Director Chen Desen has directed "October Siege" and "Purple Rain Storm", and producer Zheng Baorui has filmed "Kill the Wolf 2", "Sun Wukong in the Journey to the West", etc., the action scenes are under the responsibility of Dong Wei, the best action director of the Golden Horse Award and the Golden Horse Award, and art director Ma Guoqiang is also the winner of the two Academy Awards for Best Beauty.

China Railway Chengdu Bureau Group
Chinanews.com, Chongqing, July 26 (Reporter Han Lu) The reporter learned from China Railway Chengdu Bureau Group Co., Ltd. on the 26th that the Zhengwan High-speed Railway Small Three Gorges Tunnel with a total length of about 18.9 kilometers was fully connected on the same day.
It is understood that the Small Three Gorges Tunnel is not only the longest high-speed rail tunnel within the Three Gorges Reservoir area, but also the longest single-hole double-track high-speed rail tunnel with a design speed of 350 kilometers per hour among the projects currently under construction in China.
The Zhengwan high-speed railway is located in the three provinces and cities of Henan, Hubei, and Chongqing. It is connected to the Beijing-Guangzhou and Xulan high-speed rail in the north of Zhengzhou, and the Chongqing-Chongqing high-speed railway in the south of Wanzhou. It is an important part of my country's "eight vertical and eight horizontal" high-speed railway network along the river channel and the Hunan channel.
The Zhengwan High-speed Railway Small Three Gorges Tunnel was completed on the 26th.
The picture shows the passage through the scene.
The Zhengwan high-speed railway starts in Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, and runs southwest through Pingdingshan City, Nanyang City, and Xiangyang City, Hubei Province to Wanzhou District, Chongqing City. The new line is about 818 kilometers long, with a design speed of 350 kilometers per hour, and about 184 kilometers in Chongqing.
Among them, the Zhengzhou-Xiangyang section has been opened for operation in advance on December 1, 2019, and the Chongqing section is stepping up construction.
The Small Three Gorges Tunnel, which was fully connected on the 26th, is a full-line control project of the Zhengwan High-speed Railway. The project is located at the junction of Fengjie County and Wushan County, Chongqing City, with a total length of about 18.9 kilometers and a maximum buried depth of 890 meters.
Construction of the tunnel began in February 2017, and the entire line was opened on July 26, 2020.
According to Wang Guojun, head of the design of the Zhengwan High-speed Railway Tunnel, China Railway Second Engineering Group Co., Ltd., the survey and design party, the location of the Small Three Gorges Tunnel is very complex in topographic and geological conditions, facing risks such as karst, mud inrush, and large deformation of soft rock. It is a high-risk tunnel of Class I, and the tunnel design and construction are extremely difficult.
"During the construction of the project, we used geological survey methods, geophysical methods, and advanced drilling methods to advance geological forecasting, and adopted special design plans for more than 30 caves of various types. For example, a 24-meter-long bridge was designed and built, spanning large caves with a longitudinal length of more than 10 meters and a depth of more than 55 meters in the tunnel to avoid tunnel settlement", Wang Guojun said.
According to the China Railway Tunnel Bureau of the construction party, during the construction of the tunnel, a combination of dredging and blocking was adopted. Through the construction of horizontal tunnels, grouting and water blocking, the strengthening of tunnel structure support and the construction of sewage treatment stations, it not only ensured the orderly progress of the project, but also avoided the damage of construction drainage to the water body of the Small Three Gorges Scenic Area. At the same time, it successfully overcame construction difficulties such as the 7-kilometer-long soft rock large deformation and other bad geology, and the daily maximum water inrush of 157,000 cubic meters.
After the full line of Zhengwan High-speed Railway is completed and opened to traffic, it will become a new convenient and fast passenger passage from southwestern China to the Central Plains, North China, and Northeast China. It is of great significance to improve the capacity and quality of the northeast railway passage in southwestern China, improve the regional road network layout, accelerate the development of tourism resources and urbanization along the route, promote coordinated regional development, and promote the implementation of the western development strategy.
Experts say that the collection of immigration data through the U.S. Census for the allocation of seats in the House of Representatives is unconstitutional
Some civil rights organizations and several U.S. cities and counties have sued the U.S. federal government, claiming that the Trump Presidential Palace's attempt to exclude undocumented immigrants from the U.S. census is unworkable and unconstitutional.
The U.S. Census will determine the distribution of seats in the House of Representatives of the United States Congress.
Sarah Brannon, executive lawyer of the American Civil Liberties Union, told VOA, "It won't work."
She went on to say that Trump's request to determine the citizenship of the people surveyed in the census is difficult to achieve, and "not very reliable".
Another civil liberties organization, Common Cause, filed a lawsuit Thursday to challenge Trump's executive order.
Some cities in New Jersey and Georgia joined the lawsuit.
Arlington County, Virginia, also joined the lawsuit on Friday.
Garvey, chairman of the Arlington County Management Board, said, "The U.S. Constitution requires an accurate count of our population every 10 years. We must accurately count everyone living in Arlington County. This illegal attempt to scare away people and reduce the number of our immigrant communities cannot be allowed to succeed."
Other organizations and individuals praised President Trump's executive order.
Alabama Attorney General Marshall said that the executive order was a "victory" for the state.
He said, "The allocation of seats in the House of Representatives and electoral college seats in each state must be based on the number of residents living in each state, and the number of residents legally residing."
The US Supreme Court last year prevented the Trump administration from including citizenship issues in the 2020 census form.
President Trump signed an executive order earlier this week instructing Secretary of Commerce Ross, who oversees the U.S. Census Bureau, to submit data on the undocumented population obtained from the census, so that the administration can exclude these undocumented populations from the state's census figures, and use this to determine whether each state will increase or decrease or maintain seats in the House of Representatives.
The United States redistributes seats in the House of Representatives every 10 years according to demographic changes.
Heavy rains fell in 33 districts and counties in Chongqing. Local flood control level emergency response - chinanews.com
Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, July 26 (Reporters Ke Gaoyang, Li Song) The reporter learned from the Chongqing Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters that Chongqing has ushered in a new round of heavy rainfall since July 25, with heavy rains in 33 districts and counties, and 4 small and medium-sized rivers have experienced over-warning water level floods, and the local area has initiated a flood control level emergency response.

Respond to the situation and promote the construction of industrial projects-View headlines-Hunan Daily News-Huaxing Online
In Hunan in the midsummer, the heat wave hit the face.
And the enthusiasm released by the on-site observation meeting to promote the construction of industrial projects in the province has overshadowed the heat of the three-volt day, and the distinct orientation of "comparing industry with strength, and talking about heroes with projects" agitated Sanxiang.
The development of Hunan always depends on building projects and training industries.
In the face of the extremely unusual first half of the year, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the whole province adhered to a game of chess, went all out to fight the two hard battles of epidemic prevention and flood control, and regarded industrial projects as the "first move" to implement the "six stability" and "six guarantees".
From a year-on-year decline in GDP of 1.9% in the first quarter to a year-on-year growth of 1.3% in the first half of the year, the difficulty of the period and the magnitude of the effort are self-evident.
On this precious report card, the construction of industrial projects is the key support for Hunan to accelerate economic recovery, development and stability.
The situation is smooth and irreversible.
The construction of industrial projects should be put into the overall situation, not only good at accumulating, accumulating, and planning, but also good at recognizing changes, seeking changes, and adapting.
In the current complex and severe background of the current international situation, in addition to the hard work of attracting investment, it is necessary to calm down to study the new characteristics of the current new situation, grasp the rules more, be more scientific and precise, and better integrate into the new development pattern that takes the domestic big cycle as the main body and the domestic and international double cycles promote each other.
Pay more attention to improving the basic capabilities of the industry.
In the first half of the year, not only did a large number of heavyweight investment projects in emerging industries break ground and sow hope in our province, but also industrial enterprises with traditional advantages accelerated their deployment in the digital, intelligent, and green industrial transformation.
The Yiyang Aoshikang Third Science Park project transforms the existing production line, and the high-end printed circuit board intelligent production line takes the lead; the new plant area of Hunan China Tobacco Changde Cigarette Factory is committed to the process of intelligent transformation and construction of a modern factory. It is also a vivid portrayal of "old trees sprouting new buds..." focusing on the country's major strategy and "two æs one weight", focusing on consolidating and upgrading advantageous industries, actively cultivating and developing emerging industries, and comprehensively increasing technological innovation and localization substitution efforts, in order to continuously consolidate the basic conditions and save momentum for transformation.
Pay more attention to cultivating and developing new economic and new business models.
The sudden COVID-19 has brought the popularity of the "cloud economy", stimulated the potential of the digital economy, and provided new opportunities for industrial transformation: In the first half of the year, the province's computer and office equipment manufacturing, electronic and communications equipment manufacturing industries grew by 12.6%, the online retail sales of wholesale and retail enterprises above the quota increased by 32.2% year-on-year, and the online meal fee income of catering companies increased by 35.6% year-on-year.
It is the general trend to cultivate new opportunities in the crisis, open a new situation in the changing situation, actively promote digital industrialization and industrial digitization, and guide the integrated development of the digital economy and the real economy.
Pay more attention to optimizing and stabilizing the industrial chain supply chain.
Construction machinery is the main force in Hunan's industry, but two-thirds of the supporting enterprises are outside the province, and there is still room and potential on the supporting chain.
Strengthening industrial chain thinking and grasping projects requires not only the continuous accumulation of leading enterprises and the realization of technological breakthroughs in key links of the industrial chain; it also requires the painstaking cultivation of various regions to stimulate the "chain" lock response with strong chains to complement the chain, promote the coordinated layout of relevant supporting industries, and accelerate the construction of an independent, controllable, safe and reliable industrial chain supply chain.
To overcome difficulties and support enterprises, Hunan is still a hot land and paradise with a good business environment and emerging market opportunities.
All parts of the province have made frequent moves, new moves, and practical moves, thinking that the "burden reduction" of enterprise relief has led to the "acceleration" of high-quality development; Shaoyang implements "shareholder-style" services, and does not prevaricate for enterprises, policies are not discounted, and problems are not solved overnight... In the process of recovering the losses caused by the epidemic, all kinds of "do everything possible" to find shortcomings and pain points, and realize the vivid story of turning crises into opportunities.
Focusing on studying industry, cultivating industry, developing industry, and firmly optimizing the business environment will surely win the favor of more investors.
The wind and waves are still ahead, but the state of riding the wind and waves has become the norm for the whole province to grasp the construction of industrial projects and promote high-quality development.
At this critical period, we must learn and implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's series of important instructions, effectively respond to external uncertainties with the certainty of our own work, persevere in promoting the construction of industrial projects, and share enthusiasm and sweat to ensure the successful conclusion of the "13th Five-Year Plan" and the comprehensive construction of a well-off society.

Cultivate new business forms and open up new spaces for employment - chinanews.com
New employment methods continue to emerge, opening up new spaces for employment, and many innovative service policies have been introduced successively, helping new employment forms to thrive.
The latest data from the National Bureau of Statistics show that the unemployment rate in the national urban survey in June was 5.7%, a decrease of 0.2 percentage points from May.
This is also the two consecutive declines in the unemployment rate surveyed in cities and towns across the country since April. Behind the monthly decline in unemployment rate data is the continuous emergence of new employment opportunities in new business formats.
Now the salary of more than 5,000 per month, coupled with the freshness of embracing information technology, makes Guo Mei more and more motivated.
In the innovation incubation base of Shanxi Transformation Comprehensive Reform Demonstration Zone, there are more than 2,300 data annotators.
Not only data annotators, but since this year, the state has also defined 25 occupations such as nucleic acid testers and online learning service providers as new occupations, developed vocational skills standards, and launched skills training programs to support the development of practitioners.
In response to new employment methods and new entrepreneurial paths, the state is also innovating employment services.
Recently, 13 departments including the National Development and Reform Commission jointly issued the "Opinions on Supporting the Healthy Development of New Business Forms and New Models, Activating the Consumer Market and Promoting Employment Expansion", providing workers with diverse employment opportunities.
Multiple departments will jointly cultivate new individuals in the market and further reduce the cost of online entrepreneurship and employment for self-employed people; make new business practitioners more secure, and policies such as rights protection and social security for flexible employment will be introduced one after another.

The overall stability of employment and prices shows that the economy has a "temperature " - chinanews.com

The overall stability of employment and prices shows that the economy has a "temperature"
Economic Daily, China Economic Network Reporter Lin firecan
In the first half of this year, in the face of the impact of COVID-19, my country coordinated efforts to promote epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development. The epidemic prevention and control situation has continued to improve, the economy has steadily recovered, and the employment and price performance that is closely related to the people's livelihood has been generally stable. The Chinese economy has handed over a report card of economic performance with temperature.
In the first two months of this year, the surveyed unemployment rate increased.
Especially in February, the production and operation activities of many enterprises were basically in a state of suspension of work and production, and the employment demand of enterprises was reduced, recruitment was delayed or cancelled, and the surveyed unemployment rate in cities and towns increased.
With the gradual improvement of the epidemic prevention and control situation, the production and life order of the whole society has been continuously restored.
The Party Central Committee adheres to the general tone of steady progress, further strengthens the macro-policy countermeasure, comprehensively strengthens the employment priority policy, and actively promotes the work of assisting enterprises to stabilize and expand employment.
My country has stepped up its policies to stabilize jobs, played a combination of the policy of "relief, delay and return", phased reduction and exemption of three social insurance unit contributions, allowed deferred payment of social insurance premiums, expanded the return of unemployment insurance for small, medium and micro enterprises, and benefited from the training policy for workers, and provided absorption subsidies and trainee subsidies for enterprises to absorb the employment of key groups.
With the implementation of various employment stabilization policies, the demand for employment by enterprises has steadily rebounded, the employment situation has gradually improved, and the surveyed unemployment rate in cities and towns has gradually decreased. In June, the surveyed unemployment rate was 5.7%.
Zhang Yi, director of the Population and Employment Statistics Division of the National Bureau of Statistics, said that in the second quarter, various employment policies continued to be effective. The labor force who withdrew due to the impact of the epidemic in the early stage returned one after another. The urban labor participation rate in June increased by about 10 percentage points from February, close to the level of the same period last year.
Data show that the total urban employment in June increased by more than 19% compared with February, and most industries reached the pre-epidemic level; the average weekly working hours of corporate employees reached 46.8 hours, an increase of 6.6 hours over February and slightly higher than January by 0.1 hours.
Prices are also related to thousands of households.
In January this year, the CPI rose by 5.4% year-on-year, setting a new high in many years.
Entering February, although the year-on-year increase in CPI fell slightly, it was still in the "5 range".
The year-on-year increase in CPI is at a high level, due to factors driving consumer demand before the Spring Festival, as well as factors such as the wrong month of the Spring Festival and a low year-on-year base.
However, the impact of COVID-19 on prices is particularly obvious.
Affected by the prevention and control of the epidemic, in January and February, there were delays in logistics, untimely supply of materials, and increased transportation costs of materials across the country. In addition, some citizens hoarded and rushed to buy, and the prices of some daily necessities increased significantly.
In response to the disturbance caused by the epidemic prevention and control to the price situation, relevant departments have included important living materials in the scope of emergency transportation guarantee to ensure smooth transportation of materials.
Under the action of a series of policy measures, the market supply of vegetables and fruits has been strongly guaranteed.
In response to the rapid increase in pork prices at the beginning of this year, after the central government issued a policy of ensuring supply and stabilizing prices, various regions and departments quickly implemented it. The supply of pork reserves has improved significantly, the production capacity of live pigs has been restored in an orderly manner, and the order of production and marketing has gradually become normal.
Since March, pork prices have continued to decline, and in May the year-on-year increase in food prices fell to 10.6%; in June, affected by factors such as the slowdown in the exit of live pigs, reduced imports, and the rebound in group consumer demand, pork prices rose slightly.
The seasonal variation of fresh vegetable prices is obvious, with an average increase of 3.4% in the first half of the year.
Affected by the high comparison base in the same period last year, the price of fresh fruits continued to decline year-on-year, with an average drop of 13.3% in the first half of the year.
The basic lives of the masses are effectively guaranteed, and the overall economic and social situation remains stable and orderly.
With the gradual recovery of transportation and logistics, various places have increased their efforts to ensure supply, and the market supply and demand situation has improved.
Starting in March, the CPI fell for four consecutive months, and the year-on-year increase also fell from 4.3% in March to 2.5% in June, and the overall price level returned to stability.
In the second half of the year, prices in my country will continue to remain at a moderate level, with little overall inflationary pressure, but it is still necessary to promote the restoration of production and living order under the premise of normalizing epidemic prevention and control.
Effectively respond to natural disasters such as floods and droughts in major agricultural production areas such as grain, fruits and vegetables, strengthen market supervision, and resolutely crack down on disturbing market order such as hoarding and price hikes.

As an artist, connection is very important to me.
Through my work I'm trying to make it clear that humans are not separate from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I first went to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and I saw an iceberg for the first time.
I was in awe.
My heart beat fast, my head was dizzy, trying to understand what it was that stood in front of me.
The icebergs around me were almost 200 feet out of the water, and I could only help but wonder that this was one snowflake on top of another snowflake, year after year.
Icebergs are formed when they break off of glaciers or break off of ice shelves.
Each iceberg has its own unique personality.
They have a distinct way of interacting with their environment and their circumstances.
Some refuse to give up and hold on to the end, while others can't take it anymore and crumble in a fit of intense passion.
It's easy to think, when you look at an iceberg, that they're isolated, that they're separate, alone, more like we humans sometimes think of ourselves.
But the reality is far from it.
As the iceberg melts, I breathe in its ancient smell.
As the iceberg melts, it releases mineral-rich fresh water that nourishes everything.
I set out to photograph these icebergs as if I was taking portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these individual moments they existed in that way and would never exist that way again.
When they melt, it's not a death; it's not an end, but a continuation of their path through life.
Some of the icebergs I've photographed are very young -- thousands of years old.
Some of the ice is over 100,000 years old.
The last picture I'd like to show you is of an iceberg I photographed in Kekertsuatsiak, Greenland.
This is a very rare opportunity for you to actually witness an iceberg rolling.
So here it is.
You can see a small boat on the left.
This is about a 15-foot boat.
I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and how it deforms on the water.
Here you see it begin to roll, the boat moves to the other side, and a man is standing there.
This is an average-size Greenlandic iceberg.
It's about 120 feet above the water, or 40 meters.
This video was shot in real time.
(Music) Like this iceberg, they show you different aspects of its personality.
Thank you.
(Applause)

"The banks of Qinghai Lake in midsummer are full of golden flowers and bees flying. There is a high altitude, a large temperature difference between day and night, and little air pollution. The strong light has bred the most tenacious and generous bees, creating the characteristics of high activity, high protein, high nutritional value, low sugar and low fat in Qinghai royal jelly."
On the 26th, Zhang Jianxun, deputy director of the Industry and Information Administration of Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, said.
On the same day, the live delivery of bee products from the "One Heart War Epidemic Spring Pulp to Help Farmers" was held on the banks of Qinghai Lake. The China Bee Products Association and representatives of entrepreneurs and beekeepers gathered to promote Qinghai's characteristic bee products. A total of nearly 10,000 bottles of Qinghai Plateau royal jelly were sold online and offline, with a total of nearly 3.8 million yuan.
The picture shows beekeepers displaying bee products on site.
It is reported that this live delivery activity uses the Beijing Houdeli Bee Industry Chain Network, Express Hand, Taobao and other well-known domestic bee product retail companies, live broadcasts, and e-commerce platforms to promote the exchange and cooperation of "enterprises + beekeepers + growers", and continues to issue "Qinghai Plateau Spring Pulp Consumption Coupons" to consumers through online and offline channels. It is estimated that the company will make a total profit of nearly 5.28 million yuan throughout the year.
In this regard, Wu Na, president of Beijing Houdeli Bee Industry Co., Ltd., believes that it is "very worthwhile": "This move can expand the visibility of Qinghai bee products, attract more consumers to understand and like bee products without adding pure nature, and drive bee farmers to increase their income."
At present, the company has signed a production cooperation strategy agreement with Qinghai Yunmei Bee Industry Co., Ltd. and Qinghai Huabao Bee Industry Co., Ltd. to jointly promote the rapid development of the local bee industry in Qinghai.
The picture shows the sea of rape flowers by Qinghai Lake.
This spring, due to the need to set up road access barriers for epidemic prevention and control, the way of beekeepers to "chase flowers for honey" was blocked. Many bees died due to missed flowering and lack of food, and the income of beekeepers was seriously affected.
"At the end of the year, beekeepers follow the flowering period and travel long distances from Yunnan and Sichuan all the way north to the northwest. They eat, sleep and live without a fixed place, and they work very hard.
As companies, we have a responsibility to help them. "
Wu Na said.
"Small bees are 'environmental scouts', and bees cannot survive in heavily polluted areas." Zhao Xiaochuan, executive vice president of the China Bee Products Association, introduced that bee pollination is an important link in the ecological chain and plays an irreplaceable role in protecting plant diversity and improving the ecological environment.
At the same time, bee pollination can increase crop production and improve quality, especially in areas with extensive planting and poor management conditions, the significance of pollination is greater.
Research data show that pollination can increase rapeseed production by 15% to 30%.
The picture shows Zhao Xiaochuan (right), executive vice president of the China Bee Products Association, promoting Qinghai bee products.
"The economic, ecological and social benefits created by bee pollination are far greater than the value of bee products themselves. The bee industry has great potential in human health, crop production, vegetation reproduction, and ecological protection, and people have always known little about this."
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
Today, the number of beekeepers is getting smaller and smaller. In addition to beekeepers who have been traveling all year round, there are still many poor households with limited mobility who choose to use beehives to participate in cooperatives.
"The state has financial support, we contact technicians to help guide, and beekeepers lack understanding and judgment of the market environment. To open a market, they also need the help and coordination of the government, enterprises, and industry associations."
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
"I hope you will pay more attention to and help beekeeping groups in the future", Wu Na said. "Our bee products are also screened and controlled in strict accordance with national standards to ensure quality and protect consumer rights and interests while helping beekeepers."

Liu Yunlong, the old face of the spy war drama, plays a stammering actor - Xinhuanet
Produced by Liu Yunlong and directed by Yin Fei, and starring Liu Yunlong, Su Qing, Liang Guanhua, and Li Liqun, the large-scale spy war drama "Winning" landed on Guangdong Satellite TV's "Dynamic Theater" at 7: 30 pm on July 16.
The play tells the story of Tang Fei (played by Liu Yunlong), an underground member of the Communist Party of China lurking in the Japanese pseudo-police station, who joined forces with Soviet agents to assassinate the leader of the Japanese agent and smash the Japanese plot.
"Winning Chance" is adapted from historical facts, and the material is taken from the dusty Soviet military archives for many years.
During the defense of Moscow, the Soviet Red Army's Far East elite advanced westward to assist. At this time, the "Northern Movement" of the Japanese Kanto Army thought it had an opportunity and wanted to send troops.
In order to relieve the danger of the enemy, the Communist Party of China and Soviet Communist Party intelligence personnel jointly implemented the "Mudan Ula" plan.
According to this historical background, the well-known screenwriter Deng Yuan has been polished several times, making the plot twists and turns.
Liu Yunlong is both a producer and a leading actor in "Winning".
In the play, his role of Tang Fei is the chief of the Criminal Division of the Linhe Police Department. He is a happy and even a little ruffian stuttering policeman. His real identity is an underground member of the Communist Party of China.
The heroine Cai Meng, who is the chief of the Linhe Security Bureau, is appreciated by the Japanese boss Fukuhara, and there is a subtle and ambiguous relationship with Tang Fei.
Su Qing has tried many different types of roles in recent years, from Lu Ruowen in "Those Years We Are Young" to Er Qing in "Yanxi Strategy", all of which impressed the audience and their acting skills were recognized.
This time Su Qing and Liu Yunlong are partners for the first time. The setting of stammering sheriff and charming policewoman is quite interesting and innovative.
In addition to the two protagonists, there are many powerful actors such as Liang Guanhua, Li Liqun, Qian Bo, Lei Han, Shen Junyi and other powerful actors in "Winning Chance". The old drama Bone Bone is also one of the highlights of the play.
It is understood that the production of "Winning Chance" is also very sophisticated, with the crew spanning nearly 2,000 kilometers across Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Liaoning provinces.
In order to restore the bizarre urban style of the Northeast Japanese occupation period, the crew and art team rushed to work day and night, carefully polishing every detail of the scene construction and props, making the scene in the play exquisite and full of historical texture.

The film tells the story of the down-and-out boxer Venus returning to the ring and fighting for dignity, and shows a passionate journey of dreaming.
The movie "Jedi Attack" takes Thailand as the main plot and takes "Thai boxing" as the starting point for the dream pursuit of the down-and-out boxing champion Venus. The whole story is based on the adaptation of traditional Chinese cultural values. Whether it is Venus's determination to fight fake punches for the master in the early stage, or his efforts to regain his dignity with the support of friends and lovers in the later stage, it shows the men's pursuit and great love for family and dreams in traditional Chinese culture.
Combined with the classic Hollywood sports movie story mode and the strong combination of professional teams from China and Thailand, "Jedi Strike" not only presents an international effect, but will also impress different types of audiences.
At the same time, "Jedi Strike" extensively shows the plot of Thai boxing and training, the intensity and blood of the scene.
In the film, Zhang Xiaoliang, a game designer played by Dongyu, helps Venus, played by William Liao, return to the ring and take off the crown through a fighting game, combining novel and interesting high-tech with hot-blooded competitive competitions. It also shows the brotherhood of Zhang Xiaoliang and Venus who seem to be "different" and actually have the same goal.
In addition, the long-flowing love between Venus and Jingjing is also very touching. Jingjing's silent support for Venus and Venus' firm commitment to Jingjing have made the audience see the "Tiehan tenderness" on Venus, and have also added a lot of human touch to this down-and-out boxer.

Green space opens a new round of mixed reform of Shanghai state capital to transfer 17.5% of shares-Economic Watch-Professional Financial News website
Economic Observation Network reporter Rao Xianjun On July 26, Greenfield Holdings (600606.SH) issued the "suggestive notice that state-owned shareholders intend to transfer part of the company's shares and resume trading through public solicitation of transferees."
The content of the announcement shows that in order to further deepen the reform of state-owned state-owned enterprises, optimize the structural adjustment of state-owned assets, and improve the equity structure of green space, Shanghai Real Estate (Group) Co., Ltd. (Hereinafter referred to as "Shanghai Real Estate") and Shanghai Urban Investment (Group) Co., Ltd. (Hereinafter referred to as "Shanghai Urban Investment") intend to transfer part of the company's shares held by agreement through public solicitation of transferees, and the total proportion of shares to be transferred shall not exceed 17.5% of the total equity of green space.
The price of the shares to be transferred this time shall not be lower than the higher of the following two: The arithmetic average of the daily weighted average price for the 30 trading days before the indicative announcement date (July 27, 2020); the company's audited net asset value per share in the most recent fiscal year.
At present, the new strategic investor in Greenland is still inconclusive. According to the public announcement information, it is estimated that the new strategic investor will need to pay about 14 billion yuan to take the 17.5% equity transferred in the mixed reform of Greenland.
It is worth noting that after the completion of this share transfer, it is expected that Greenland will still have no controlling shareholders and actual controllers, but the control structure may undergo major changes.
Since its establishment, Greenfield Holdings has carried out many institutional and mechanism reforms: From 1992 to 1997, it operated in accordance with market-oriented rules under a purely state-owned system; from 1997 to 2013, it established and continuously improved the shareholding system of state-owned holding and employee shareholding; from 2013 to 2015, it introduced strategic investors to form a mixed ownership system of cross-shareholding and mutual integration of state-owned and non-public capital; since 2015, it has been listed as a whole and has become a public company.
Green's current mixed reform plan is similar to Gree. In December 2019, Hillhouse Capital led Zhuhai Mingjun to take over 15% of Gree Electric (000651.SZ) with 41,662 million yuan. Gree Group retired as a minority shareholder. After completing the mixed reform, Gree Electric implemented modern corporate management methods such as executive incentive plan and no real control structure.
Shanghai Real Estate and Shanghai City Investment are both state-owned enterprise groups wholly owned by the Shanghai SASAC. Zhang Yuliang, chairman and president of Greenfield Holdings, said that Greenfield's move is an important measure for Shanghai to promote the comprehensive reform of state-owned state-owned enterprises and accelerate the new phase of state-owned state-owned enterprise reform in accordance with the requirements of the Party Central Committee. It fully demonstrates the new ideas of reform adapted to local conditions and tailored to local conditions. By introducing new outstanding strategic shareholders to listed companies, it supports enterprises to further improve the degree of marketization, enhance the freedom of operation and management, and accelerate the full release of reform vitality.
Inter-provincial travel resumes the country's first inter-provincial car tourism train to open - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, July 25 (Reporter Li Ping) At 12: 20 on July 25, more than 200 Shanghai tourists who took the D771 train successfully arrived in Lanxi City, Zhejiang Province. This is also the first inter-provincial train tour in the country since the Ministry of Culture and Tourism resumed inter-provincial (district and city) team tours on July 14.
Lanxi City, located in central and western Zhejiang, has beautiful scenery. There are many scenic spots such as Zhuge Bagua Village, Underground Changhe, Zhiyan Ancient Village, etc. During the two-day and one-night itinerary, more than 200 Shanghai tourists will appreciate these attractions one by one.
Li Li, deputy general manager of Shanghai Railway International Tourism (Group) Co., Ltd., said that in accordance with the latest policy, the company pays close attention to the demand for inter-provincial travel, communicates with Lanxi City as soon as possible, and carefully launches the "Shanghai to Lanxi" and "Summer Honor Day Tour" products, which were sold out in less than a week.
Aunt Sun from Shanghai said that because of the epidemic, she has not gone out this year.
"I have been bored at home for a long time. As soon as I saw a group tour, I immediately shared the news with my friends to sign up. I have never been to Lanxi before and look forward to this trip very much." Said Aunt Sun.
It is understood that in September last year, Lanxi City and Shanghai Railway International Tourism (Group) Co., Ltd. signed a strategic cooperation agreement for the "take high-speed rail to Lanxi" project, which plans to open 12 high-speed rail tourism trains from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai and Anhui to Lanxi in one year.

Us White House advisers "counter-bite" states resume work prematurely
On July 23, local time, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the United States exceeded 4 million, accounting for 30% of global cases.
In the past few months, US President Trump has repeatedly asked all states across the country to resume work and school. It was only recently that he changed his attitude and took the initiative to wear masks in public, and his advisers "bite back" saying that some state governments resumed work too early.
On the 22nd, White House presidential adviser Killian Conway said at a press conference that some state governments had failed to comply with resumption standards and had restarted places such as bars prematurely.
Conway also mentioned that the previous statement that the president has "absolute power" to decide on the resumption of work in the states is a false rumor.
"The president is a federalist, and he believes that all states have autonomy."
She defended Trump.
However, the "rumor" in Conway's mouth was said by Trump himself at the White House epidemic briefing on April 13.
This self-defeating operation was ridiculed by netizens as "rewriting history".
Kylian Conway wants to rewrite history. She is a liar.
Trump called Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer a dictator because she followed medical guidelines and insisted on stopping work.
Trump wants to promote the resumption of work so that he can hold a rally.
This is not the first time Kylian Conway has caused controversy.
On April 15, Conway blurted out in an interview with Fox News: "This is COVID-19, not COVID-1, friends!"
She seems to understand "19" as a version number, which was wildly ridiculed by netizens: Read the newspaper without common sense!
Recently, we've seen the effects of cyber attacks on the business world.
Data breaches at companies like JPMorgan Chase, Yahoo, Home Depot and Target have caused losses of hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars.
A few more attacks like this, and the entire world economy will collapse.
The public sector has not been immune.
From 2012 to 2014, there was a very serious data breach at the US Office of Personnel Management.
Security clearance and fingerprint information was stolen, affecting 22 million employees.
And you may have heard that some government-sponsored hackers are trying to use stolen data to influence election outcomes in some countries.
Two recent examples are the theft of large-scale data from the German Bundestag and the theft of emails from the US Democratic National Committee.
The cyber threat is already affecting our democratic processes.
And it's likely to get worse.
The more advanced computer technology is, the more vulnerable the means we use to protect our data.
In particular, a new type of computer technology, called quantum computing, uses microscopic particles in nature to dramatically increase the computational power of computers.
It's powerful enough to crack many of the encryption systems we use today.
So are we hopeless?
Should we start packing our electronic survival gear for the upcoming data apocalypse?
I think, not yet.
Quantum computers are still in the labs, and it will take years for them to be put to practical use.
More important, there have been major breakthroughs in the field of encryption.
For me, this is a very exciting time in the history of secure communications.
About 15 years ago, when I learned that we had unlocked new skills to create quantum effects that don't exist in nature, I was excited.
The idea of using the fundamental laws of physics to advance encryption excites me.
Today, a select group of companies and labs, including mine, are taking this technology to practical applications.
That's right.
We're going to fight quantum with quantum.
How does this work?
First, let's take a quick look at the world of encryption.
You need a briefcase, you have some important documents to send to your friend, James Bond, and you need to lock it up for safety.
Because these materials are top secret, we're going to use a super-advanced briefcase.
It comes with a special combination lock that, once locked, converts the contents of the document to random numbers.
So you just put the documents in, close the lock, and by this time the documents have been converted to random numbers, and you send the briefcase to James.
While the briefcase is on its way, you call him to give him the code.
As soon as he gets the briefcase, he enters the code, the documents are unscrambled, and you successfully send an encrypted message to James Bond.
(Laughter) A fun example, but it does illustrate three things important for encryption.
The code -- we call this an encryption key.
You can think of it as a code.
The call to James to give him the code.
We call this key exchange.
This ensures that we can safely deliver the keys to the right place.
And the lock used to encrypt and decrypt the documents.
We call this an encryption algorithm.
Using the key, it converts the contents of the document to random numbers.
A good algorithm can do this, and it's hard to break the code without the key.
The importance of the algorithm is that if someone gets the briefcase and opens it, without the key and without knowing the encryption algorithm, they can't read the document.
All you get is a bunch of random numbers.
Most security systems rely on a secure method of key exchange to communicate the key to the right place.
However, rapid increases in computing power are putting at risk many of the key exchange methods we currently use.
For example, we now have a very widely used system -- RSA.
When it was invented in 1977, it took about 40 billion years to break a 426-bit RSA key.
And in 1994, just 17 years later, the code was broken.
As computers have become more and more powerful, we've had to use larger and larger codes.
Now we often use 2048 or 4096 bits.
As you can see, the battle between the encryptors and the breakers is going on, trying to defeat each other.
And when quantum computers arrive in the next 10 to 15 years, they will even more rapidly crack the complex mathematical algorithms that underlie the encryption systems we use today.
In fact, quantum computers will turn our security castle into a mere house of cards.
We have to find a way to protect our castle.
There's been a growing body of research in recent years looking at how quantum effects can be used to enhance encryption.
There have been some exciting breakthroughs.
Remember the three things important for encryption -- high-quality keys, secure key exchange and a strong algorithm.
However, advances in science and engineering have put two of these priorities at risk.
First of all, the keys.
Random numbers are the building blocks of encryption keys.
But today, they're not truly random.
For example, we generate keys based on the frequency of random numbers, generated by software, which we call pseudo-random numbers.
Numbers generated by a program or a mathematical method will always have some, perhaps less obvious, pattern in them.
The less random the numbers are, or in technical terms, the less entropy they contain, the easier they are to predict.
Recently, some casinos have been attacked in a creative way.
They took pictures of the slot machines for a period of time and then analyzed them.
The cyber criminals used reverse engineering to create the pseudo-random number generator behind the turntable.
So they have a good chance of predicting the spins of the wheels and making a lot of money.
The keys are equally insecure.
Having a true random number generator is important for generating secure passwords.
For years, researchers have been working on building true random number generators.
But most designs are either not random enough, fast enough, or difficult to reuse.
But the quantum world is truly random.
It's important to take advantage of this true randomness.
Devices that can measure quantum effects can produce a continuous stream of random numbers very quickly.
The casino crime that I was talking about is no longer possible.
Several universities and companies around the world are focusing on building true random number generators.
At my company, our quantum random number generator was born out of a two meter by one meter optical table.
And then we reduced it to the size of a box.
Today, it's possible to put it on a PCI card and plug it into an ordinary computer.
This is the world's fastest, truly random number generator.
It measures quantum effects to produce a billion random numbers per second.
Today it has been widely used around the world to improve the security of cloud providers, banks and government agencies.
(Applause) But even with a true random number generator, we still face the second big cyber threat: The problem of secure key exchange.
Current key exchange technology will not stand up to a quantum computer.
The quantum solution to this problem is called quantum key distribution, or QKD, which takes advantage of a fundamental, counterintuitive characteristic of quantum mechanics.
The act of looking at a microscopic particle changes that particle.
Let me give you an example.
Consider again, we're going to give the code to James Bond.
But this time, instead of calling him, we're going to use quantum effects to carry the code on a laser and send it to James via standard optical fiber.
We assume that Dr. No wants to get the code.
Fortunately, Dr. No's attempt to intercept this quantum key will leave an electronic fingerprint that James and you can detect.
This allows the intercepted key to be discarded.
And the keys that are left behind can provide strong data protection.
Because this security mechanism is based on the fundamental principles of physics, a quantum computer, or any future supercomputer, will not be able to crack it.
My team and I are working with leading universities and the defense sector to improve this exciting technology and develop the next generation of security products.
The Internet of Things heralds a highly interconnected era, with 25 to 30 billion devices expected to be connected to the Internet by 2020.
For our societies to function properly in an IoT world, trust in these interconnected device systems is essential.
We believe that quantum technology will be very important in building this trust, enabling us to fully benefit from these amazing innovations that can enrich our lives.
Thank you.

The 3-year-old child's college playground was smashed. Is it reasonable to sue the school after receiving compensation?
2020-07-26 05: 01: 11 Source: Legal Daily Author: Wang Sishuo Editor: Wang Sishuo
The playground was smashed, and the child was compensated before suing the school.
Zhao Yifan, our correspondent
The 3-year-old Xiaowen was accidentally hit in the head by Chen of the softball team while playing on the playground of a certain university.
After Chen made compensation, Xiaowen's father, Mr. Wen, as Xiaowen's legal representative, sued the school to the court, demanding that the school where the incident occurred apologize and pay a total of 20,000 yuan for medical expenses and moral damages.
Recently, after hearing the case, the Haidian District People's Court of Beijing held that the school had set up a protective net on the playground at the time of the incident, and had fulfilled its proper safety guarantee obligations, and Chen had paid compensation. According to the judgment, the plaintiff's claim was rejected.
Mr. Wen claimed that he took Xiaowen to play on the school playground during the summer vacation of 2019, when the softball team was training on the playground.
In order to avoid the risks posed by this, Xiaowen, Mr. Wen and many other children and parents operate in safe areas designated by the softball team.
But then the softball player Chen dropped his hand while pitching, causing the softball to fly over the guard net into the above-mentioned safe area and hit the back of Xiaowen.
Mr. Wen immediately took Xiaowen to the hospital for treatment and was diagnosed with head trauma.
Mr. Wen believes that the facilities of the school stadium do not comply with relevant safety regulations, and the team and related facilities have not been effectively managed.
The school's negligence led to the above-mentioned incident, which caused Xiaowen to suffer great physical and mental pain, and also brought great pain to his family. The school should bear legal responsibility for this.
In this regard, the school argued that the school had set up a protective net on the playground and posted management regulations and training notices, informing them that entering the playground must maintain a safe distance from the training site and reminding them of their own safety. The plaintiff could not prove that the school "failed to meet its safety guarantee obligations", so it did not agree to compensation.
After the trial, the court held that the site of the incident was a site open to the public free of charge by the university involved. Although the school has a safety guarantee obligation for the management of the playground, this safety guarantee obligation only needs to meet the general duty of care.
At the time of the incident, the school set up a protective net on the playground, and it has fulfilled its proper safety guarantee obligations, and Chen also compensated Xiaowen for various losses such as medical expenses and transportation expenses in accordance with the previous compensation agreement. The two parties agreed to resolve the dispute at one time.
Afterwards, Xiaowen's parents again claimed compensation from the school. According to the law, the court ruled that all the plaintiff's claims were rejected.
After the verdict was pronounced, neither party appealed, and the judgment is now in effect.
According to Article 37 of my country's Tort Liability Law, the school, as the manager of a public place, has the obligation to ensure safety; in the case of damage caused by the actions of a third party, the third party bears tort liability, and the manager of a public place who fails to fulfill the obligation of safety guarantee shall bear corresponding supplementary responsibilities.
The judge stated that as the manager of a public place, he is most likely to understand the actual situation of the entire place and foresee possible dangers and damages, so that he is most likely to take necessary measures to prevent the occurrence of losses or reduce the extent of damage, and the cost of avoiding and mitigating damage is the lowest, so the law stipulates that it shall bear the corresponding guarantee obligations for engaging in social activities.
In this case, for unspecified people entering the playground that is open to the public free of charge, the school's safety guarantee obligations should be compatible with the social activities it engages in. Specifically, it should take basic safety measures and have an obligation to inform about hidden dangers.
In judicial practice, it is not appropriate to impose excessive safety guarantee obligations on managers of public places.
If the school has already set up a protective net and fulfilled its obligation to inform, it can be determined that the school is not at fault and should not bear legal responsibility.
In addition, for third-party infringement, even if the manager of a public place such as a school fails to fulfill his safety guarantee obligations, his liability is as a supplement to compensation for damages. According to the newly promulgated Civil Code, after the manager assumes supplementary liability, he can also recover from a third party.
Therefore, in such accidents, the victim should not expand the scope of the claim after he has received compensation from the direct infringer.
Today I'd like to show you the way we make things in the future.
I believe that soon our buildings and machines will be self-assembling, replicating and repairing themselves.
So I'm going to show you what I think is the current state of manufacturing, and then compare it to some natural systems.
So in the current state of manufacturing, we have skyscrapers -- two and a half years, 500,000 to a million parts, very complex, new technologies in steel, concrete, glass.
We have exciting machines that can take us into space -- five years, 2.5 million parts.
But on the other hand, if you look at the natural systems, we have two million types of proteins that can fold in 10,000 nanoseconds, and we can replicate DNA with three billion base pairs in about an hour.
That's the complexity of our natural systems, but they're extremely efficient, far more efficient than anything we can build, far more complex than anything we can build.
They're more efficient in terms of energy.
They rarely make mistakes.
They can repair themselves for longevity.
So there's something super interesting about natural systems.
And if we can translate that into our built environment, then there's a lot of potential for the way we build things.
I think the key is self-assembly.
If we want to use self-assembly in our physical environment, I think there are four key factors.
The first is that we're going to decode all the complexity of what we're going to build -- our buildings and machines.
We need to decode them into simple sequences -- basically the DNA of how our buildings work.
And then we need programmable parts that can take that sequence and use it for folding or reshaping.
We need some energy to activate so that these parts of us can fold up according to the program.
We need some type of error correction redundancy to ensure that we successfully build what we want.
So I'm going to show you some of the projects that my colleagues and I are working on to achieve this self-assembling future.
The first two projects are MacroBot and DeciBot.
These projects are large-scale reconfigurable robots -- 8-foot, 12-foot long proteins.
They're embedded in electromechanical devices, sensors.
You decode what you want to fold into, into a sequence of angles -- negative 120, negative 120, 0, 0, 120, negative 120 -- something like that; a sequence of angles, or turns, and you send that sequence through the wire.
Each unit takes its own message -- so negative 120 -- it rotates, checks if it's in place and then passes the sequence to its neighbor.
There are many outstanding scientists, engineers, designers working on this project.
I think this project really reveals: Is this really scalable?
I mean, thousands of dollars and lots of man-hours to make this eight-foot robot.
Can we really scale it up? Can we really embed robots in every part?
The next question is to look at passivity, or passively trying to make reorganization programmability.
But it goes a step further, and it tries to do actual computing.
It basically embeds the basic building block of most computing, the digital logic gate, directly into each part.
This is a NAND gate.
There's one tetrahedron on each gate that's going to be used for computing, and there's two input tetrahedrons.
One of them is the input from the user, as if you were building a brick.
The other one is the input of a brick that was placed before.
And then it gives you an output in three-dimensional space.
This means that users can build bricks the way they want them to.
It calculates on what it was doing before and what you said you wanted it to do.
Now it starts moving in three-dimensional space -- up or down.
So on the left-hand side, [1,1] input equals 0 output, which goes down.
On the right, [0,0] input is a 1 output, which goes up.
So what this really means is that our structures now contain the blueprints that we want to build.
So all the information about what you want to build is embedded in it.
This means that we have some form of self-replication.
In this case, I call it self-guided replication, because your structure contains precise blueprints.
If you have an error, you can replace a part.
All the local information is embedded to tell you how to fix it.
So you have something that climbs, you can read it and output it one by one.
It's directly embedded; there's no external instructions.
The last project I'm going to show is called Biased Chains, and it's probably the most exciting example of a passive self-assembly system we've seen right now.
It has reconfigurability and programmability that makes it a completely passive system.
So basically you have a chain of elements.
Each element is exactly the same, and they're biased.
Each chain, or each element, wants to turn right or left.
If you want to assemble a chain, you need to program it.
You tell each unit whether to turn left or right.
And when you shake the chain, it folds up into any structure that you've programmed for it -- so in this case, a spiral, in this case, two cubes connected.
So basically you can program in three-dimensional space -- or one-dimensional, two-dimensional -- and the chain is completely passive.
So what does this tell us about the future?
I think this tells us about the possibility of self-assembly, self-replication and self-repair in our physical structures, our buildings and machines.
There's new programmability in these parts.
And from that you have new possibilities for computing.
We're going to have spatial computing.
Imagine that our buildings, our bridges, our machines, all of our bricks can actually compute.
What an amazing parallel and distributed computing power and new design possibilities.
This is exciting potential.
I think these projects I've shown you are just a small step towards the future, if we implement these new technologies for a new self-assembling world.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Under the normalization of epidemic prevention and control, people's enthusiasm for sports and fitness is high.
With the gradual liberalization of inter-provincial tourism business, the tourism market is also about to usher in a recovery.
Fujian Province resumed its inter-provincial tourism business from July 21. On the first weekend after opening, Xiamen, a popular tourist destination, ushered in a peak in passenger flow.
As a popular tourist destination city, many tourists arrive in Xiamen on weekends.
Xiamen Railway Station expects that the summer transportation will send 3.7 million passengers, while the airport passenger flow is dominated by students, tourists, and visiting relatives.
The tourism market has gradually recovered. In July, Xiamen Airport operated an average of 440 flights a day, and domestic flights have recovered to 80% of the pre-epidemic level.
The airline encrypted the air express lines from Xiamen to Shanghai, Beijing, Kunming, Xi'an and other major cities to seize the recovered tourism market.
At present, many travel agencies in Xiamen have successively launched a batch of summer domestic inter-provincial travel products, and the team itinerary is mainly based on outdoor attractions.
In response to the summer passenger transport peaks in railway stations and airports, relevant units have deployed additional manpower in areas where people are easy to gather, such as check-in counters and security channels. Fujian has also optimized and upgraded the "Eight Fujian Health Code", which has achieved health data sharing and mutual recognition with 31 provinces, and promoted the orderly recovery of the tourism market.
Can Andy Lau Liu Qingyun "dismantle" the new spark - Xinhuanet
"Bomb Disposal Expert 2" recently announced that it will be released on December 24, becoming the first scheduled film for the New Year.
The second part is still directed by Qiu Litao, produced and starred by Andy Lau, and unfolds with a brand-new story.
It is reported that the addition of the "nuclear bomb" element in the second part also makes the challenge faced by the bomb disposal experts more difficult. Several startling shots in the preview have made people hang on the line. The mushroom cloud of the big bang, the airport engulfed by fire, the scene is quite shocking.
Three years ago, "Bomb Disposal Expert", produced by the original team, won the May 1st box office champion of that year, and won 7 nominations at the Hong Kong Film Awards. Qiu Litao × Andy Lau also became the audience's gold medal partner.
This time, "Bomb Disposal Expert 2" also makes people look forward to whether this pair of ace combinations can spark new sparks.
"Bomb Disposal Expert 2" tells a brand-new story: Former bomb disposal expert Pan Zhengfeng (Andy Lau) fainted at the scene of the bombing and was listed as a suspect by the police.
In order to find the truth, he had to ask his friend Dong Zhuowen (Liu Qingyun), who is also a bomb disposal expert, for help.
The female inspector eager to solve the case, Pang Ling (Ni Ni), who is also Pan's ex-girlfriend, was also involved.
He is still a bomb disposal expert, but the complexity of Andy Lau's new role can be felt from the advance notice: He broke a leg, put on a prosthetic limb, and was chased by Liu Qingyun, who is also a bomb disposal expert, while being directed by his ex-girlfriend Ni Ni.
What kind of relationship is the three people, what exactly did Andy Lau do at the Xiangdao Hotel, what kind of cases he was involved in, what twists and turns he has experienced in his career as a bomb disposal expert, and various mysteries make people curious.
It is understood that the highlight of the film is the field viewing of Hong Kong's world landmark buildings, coupled with the top special effects production team, which brings a shocking and realistic visual impact.

Chinanews.com, July 26. Comprehensive Russian Satellite Network reported that July 26 is Russian Navy Day, and the main military parade to celebrate Navy Day was held in St. Petersburg and Kronstadt.
Russian President and Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation Putin arrived in Kronstadt to participate in the celebration, and 15 ships and submarines there were inspected.
On July 28, 2019 local time, St. Petersburg, Russia, held a grand military parade to celebrate the Navy Day.
According to reports, Putin congratulated the navy officers and soldiers on the Navy Day, and drove by the ships that were going to participate in the naval parade in a small boat on the Gulf of Finland, and then inspected the troops under review at the subjective platform.
Putin said that the Russian naval fleet is equipped with the latest ships and special equipment, and the equipment level is constantly improving.
Putin said at the military parade on Russian Navy Day: "The Russian naval fleet has warships equipped with high-precision weapons, strategic diving cruisers and multi-purpose submarines, state-of-the-art aircraft and other aircraft, unique weapons and special equipment."
On June 24, local time, Russia held a Red Square military parade to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the victory in the Patriotic War.
He also said that the Russian naval fleet will rely on digitization and effective defense methods to gain unique advantages.
According to reports, the main naval parade to celebrate the Russian Navy Day was held in St. Petersburg and Kronstadt. A total of 46 ships participated, including the frigate "Admiral Kasatonov" and the "Vice Admiral Kulakov" large anti-submarine ship, as well as large landing ships, small missile ships, frigates, submarines, etc.
Among them, the series of ships were statically displayed next to the Winter Palace Bridge in St. Petersburg, the most notable of which was the replica of Russia's first battleship "Poltava" in the early 18th century.
In order to avoid the spread of COVID-19, only local residents and special guests can enter Kronstadt during this year's naval parade.
The last Sunday in July of each year is Russian Navy Day.
Yang Honggnian, founder of the Beijing Philharmonic Chorus, died at the age of 86 - chinanews.com
Beijing News (Reporter Liu Zhen) On July 26, the Beijing Philharmonic Chorus published an obituary. The founder of the Beijing Philharmonic Chorus, a well-known Chinese conductor and music educator, and Yang Honggnian, a lifelong academic member of the Central Conservatory of Music and professor of the Department of Command, died in Beijing at 13: 55 on July 26, 2020 at the age of 86.
The picture is from the official website of the Beijing Philharmonic Chorus.
Yang Honggnian was born in 1934, a native of Nanjing, Jiangsu, and has loved music since childhood.
In 1951, he was the conductor of the chorus of Nanjing People's Radio Station. In the autumn of 1951, he was admitted to the Music Department of Shanghai East China Normal University. He studied and directed under Professor Yang Jiaren and German conductor Hitzman, and the former Soviet expert Arzamanov learned the style and polyphony.
In 1958, he taught in the Music Department of Beijing Art Normal College, and in 1973 he was transferred to the Composition Department and Command Department of the Central Conservatory of Music.
Yang Honggnian founded the Beijing Philharmonic Chorus in 1983.
For more than 30 years, with the tenet of "love and dedication", he has led this choir to sing all over the world, and has won dozens of awards in important competitions at home and abroad.
He has directed the performances of more than 30 groups including the Central Orchestra Chorus, the Central National Song and Dance Troupe, the Oriental Song and Dance Troupe, and the Shanghai Chorus, and held many symphony concerts and chorus concerts.
Publications include "Orchestra Training", "Chorus Training", "Two Songs Writing", "Children's Songs" (upper and lower volumes), and papers "On Chorus Phonetic Issues", "On the Sound Hierarchy Layout of Orchestral Music", as well as translations of "Chorus Accessories Law" and "Debussy's Harmony Language".
Do you know how many flowering plants there are?
There are a quarter of a million -- at least as many as we know -- a quarter of a million species of flowering plants.
And flowers are a real bugger.
It's really difficult for plants to produce.
It takes a lot of experience and a lot of resources.
Why does it bother you so much?
The answer, of course, is, like so many other things in the world, sex.
I know what's on your mind when you look at these pictures.
The reason why sexual reproduction is so important -- plants have many other ways to reproduce.
They can take the form of cuttings; they can have sex with themselves; they can pollinate themselves.
But they do need to spread their genes to mix with other genes so that they can be eco-friendly.
Evolution works that way.
Now the way that plants transmit this information is through pollen.
Some of you may have seen these pictures before.
As I said, every home should have a scanning electron microscope that can see these.
There are as many different types of pollen as there are flowering plants.
It's actually quite useful for forensics and so on.
Most of the pollen that causes hay fever for us comes from plants that use the wind to spread the pollen, which is a very inefficient process, and that's why it gets up our noses all the time.
Because most of them are discarded, hoping that the germ cells contained in the pollen, the male sex cells, will happen to fall on another flower.
All the grasses, which means all the grains, and most of the trees have wind-borne pollen.
But most species actually use insects to do this, and in a way that's smarter, because it doesn't require much pollen.
Insects and other species can carry pollen and transfer it directly to where it is needed.
So obviously, we're aware of the relationship between insects and plants.
It's a symbiotic relationship, whether it's a bird or a bee, they get something in return, usually nectar.
Sometimes this symbiotic relationship can lead to wonderful adaptations -- the red-skirt moth is a beautiful adaptation.
The plant gets something, and the hawk-moth spreads the pollen elsewhere.
Plants have evolved to create landing strips everywhere, and bees may have lost their way.
There are markings on many plants that look like other insects.
These are the anthers of a lily, cleverly done so that when an unsuspecting insect lands on it, the anther flips over and whops it on the back with a lot of pollen so that it can follow the insect to another plant.
There's an orchid that looks like it's got jaws, and in a way, it does; it forces the insect to crawl over, get covered in pollen, and take it somewhere else.
Orchids: There are at least 20,000 species of orchids -- amazingly diverse.
They have all sorts of tricks.
They have to try and attract pollinators to help them through the process.
This orchid, known as Darwin's orchid, because it was studied by Darwin and made a wonderful prediction when he saw it, you can see that there's a very long nectar tube hanging down from the orchid.
So basically what the insect has to do -- we're in the middle of the flower -- it has to stick its proboscis in the middle and all the way down to the nectar tube to get the nectar.
Darwin said, looking at this flower, "I guess something has coevolved with it."
And there's no doubt that it's insects.
I mean, it's usually rolled up, but when it straightens out, that's what it looks like.
Now you can imagine that if nectar is such a valuable thing that it's expensive for the plant to produce and it attracts a lot of pollinators, then, as in human sex, people might start to deceive each other.
They might say, "I have some nectar. Would you like to come and get it?"
This is a plant.
This is a plant that insects in South Africa love, and they have evolved long proboscis to get the nectar at the bottom.
This is an mimic.
This plant is mimicking the first plant.
There's a fly with a long proboscis that doesn't get any nectar from the mimic, because the mimic doesn't give it any nectar. It thought it could get it.
So not only did the fly not get the nectar from the mimic plant, but also -- if you look very closely at the top of the head, you can see that there's some pollen that's going to be spread to another plant, if only some botanist hadn't come along and stuck it to a blue card.
(Laughter) These lies are all over the plant kingdom.
This flower with its black dots: They might look like black dots to us, but I tell you, to a male insect of the right species, they look like two very, very sexy females.
(Laughter) When the insect gets there and lands on it, it immerses itself in pollen, which, of course, it will take to another plant, and if you look at the scanning electron microscope image that every home should have, you can see that there are actually some patterns there, three-dimensional patterns.
It even makes the insect feel comfortable and looks good.
These electron microscope images -- this is an orchid disguised as an insect -- you can see that different parts of the structure have different colors and different textures to our eyes, and insects may perceive very, very different textures.
This orchid has evolved to mimic the glossy metallic surface you see on some beetles.
You can see this surface under a scanning electron microscope -- very different from the other surfaces we've seen.
Sometimes the whole plant mimics an insect, even to us.
I mean, I think it looks like some sort of flying animal or beast.
It's a wonderful and amazing thing.
That's what's smart about it. It's called obsidian.
I think it's cunning sometimes.
To the right species of bee, this would look like another very aggressive bee, and it would fly over and hit it on the head many, many times, trying to drive it away, and, of course, it would get covered in pollen.
The other thing it does is that this plant mimics another orchid that has a lot of food for insects.
But there's nothing there.
So it's deceiving on two levels -- incredible.
(Laughter) We see ylang ylang, the part that has a strong aroma.
I actually smelled it before.
These flowers don't really have to be that gaudy.
They're sending out a fantastic array of scent to any insect that's interested.
This one doesn't smell so good.
This flower actually smells pretty nasty, and again, it's evolved, and it looks like carrion.
So flies love it.
The flies fly in and they pollinate.
This is white star arum, also known as dead horse arum.
I don't know what a dead horse smells like, but this one probably smells pretty much like it.
It's really horrible.
Green-headed flies can't help themselves.
They fly into it, they fly all the way into it.
They lay their eggs on it, thinking it's a nice bit of carrion, and not realizing that there's no food for the eggs, that the eggs are going to die, but at the same time the plant will benefit, because the bristles release and the flies disappear and pollinate to another flower -- fantastic.
This is the arum plant, arum maculatum, arum maculatum, which in this country is called elongated grass.
I photographed this in Dorset last week.
This guy heats up by about 15 degrees above ambient temperature -- amazing.
And if you look inside, there's something a bit like a dam behind the spadix, flies are attracted by the heat -- this is boiling volatile chemicals, little insects -- and they're trapped under this container.
They drink the sweet nectar and then they all get a little sticky.
At night they're covered in pollen, sprayed down over them, and then the bristles we saw above wilt and allow these pollen-covered bugs to escape -- incredible.
And if you think this is incredible, this is one of my favorites.
This is the spring plume.
Anyone here from Brazil should know about this plant.
This is the most amazing thing.
Its stamens are about a foot long.
It has a power that no other plant that I know of has, and when it blooms -- this is the spadix in the middle -- for about two days, it produces a certain degree of metabolic change somewhat similar to that of mammals.
Instead of having starch, which is the food of plants, it has something very similar to brown fat and burns it at a rate that burns fat, metabolizes, about the rate of a kitten.
It's twice the energy output of a hummingbird by weight -- absolutely amazing.
And it did something unusual.
Not only will it heat up to 155 degrees Fahrenheit, 43 or 44 degrees Centigrade, for two days, but it will keep constant temperature.
There's a thermoregulation mechanism in there that keeps constant temperature.
Why do you do this? I hear you ask.
Now you don't know, there's some beetles that just love to mate at this temperature.
They get inside, and they get covered in pollen.
(Laughter) And the plant showers them with pollen, and they leave to pollinate.
What a wonderful thing it is.
Now we think most pollinators are insects, but actually in the tropics, many birds and butterflies pollinate.
Many tropical flowers are red, and that's because butterflies and birds are similar to us, we think, and can see red very well.
But if you look at the spectrum, birds and us, we see red, green and blue and see that spectrum.
Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet, and they see various shades of ultraviolet.
And there's some color behind that.
"Wouldn't it be great if we could see those colors", I hear you ask.
Yes, we can see.
So what does an insect see?
Last week I took these pictures of the desert lotus, helianthemum, in Dorset.
As we can see, these are little yellow flowers, little yellow flowers all over the place.
And that's what it looks like in visible light.
This is what it looks like if you take out the red.
Most bees don't perceive red.
Then I put an ultraviolet filter in front of my camera and took a long exposure at a specific frequency of ultraviolet light, and I got this picture.
It's like a real fantastic bull's eye.
Now we don't know exactly what a bee sees, and when I call it red, you know what I'm looking at.
We have no way of knowing what's going on in it, whether it's an insect or some other human being.
But that's what the contrast looks like, standing out from the background.
Here's another little flower -- different range of ultraviolet frequencies, different filters to match the pollinators.
And that's about what it looks like.
Just in case you think that all yellow flowers have this property -- no flower was damaged during the shooting; it was just attached to the tripod, not taken off -- under ultraviolet light, look at this.
This can be used as the basis for sunscreens, because sunscreens work by absorbing ultraviolet light.
So maybe the chemicals in it are useful.
Finally, this is an evening primrose that Bjorn Rorslett from Norway sent me -- a wonderful hidden pattern.
I love the way it's hidden.
I think it's poetic. These pictures were taken with ultraviolet filters, and the main use of this filter is for astronomers to take pictures of Venus -- actually the clouds on Venus.
This is the main use of this filter.
Venus, of course, is the god of love and fertility, which is the flower story.
And just as flowers spend so much effort trying to get pollinators to accept their invitations, they've also somehow managed to convince us that they're rich in content and that we send flowers to each other at times of birth and death, especially at weddings, and when you think of it, that's the moment that genetic material is transferred from one organism to another.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Chinanews.com, Chongqing, July 26 (Reporter Liu Xian) The Chongqing Development and Reform Commission announced on the 26th that the city has so far retired 4,404 fishermen, accounting for 42.54% of all fishermen involved.
In an interview with a reporter from Chinanews.com, the 53-year-old Li Daiguo said that his grandfathers were fishing in the Longxi River. Since the age of 11, he has been fishing with his father, shaking his boat, walking along the Longxi River, up to Liangping, Chongqing, and down to longevity. Every time he leaves home, he is ten and a half months, relying on fishing to support his family.
But since 1997, as the rural population has gradually poured into the town, there are more and more residents in Gaoanchang Town, causing more and more serious environmental pollution.
Paper mills, chemical plants, and breeding farms have been built along the Longxi River, which also pollutes the river.
By 2007 and 2008, the Longxi River had become a smelly ditch.
"The scales of the fish caught are all black, and the inside is also black after being cut open."
Li Daiguo said that it is becoming more and more difficult to fish after the river is polluted.
The local area began to make great efforts to control the pollution of the Longxi River, including clearing the river, patrolling the river, and managing and protecting aquatic resources.
Li Daiguo also retired from fishermen to production and became a member of the river patrol team to manage and protect aquatic resources.
From January 1, 2020, Chongqing Aquatic Life Reserve and related waters in the main urban area have implemented a comprehensive ban on fishing.
According to data from the Chongqing Development and Reform Commission, as of now, Chongqing has retired 3,403 fishing vessels and 4643 fishing vessels that have signed withdrawal agreements, accounting for 63.3% and 86.3% of the total three-year mission, respectively.
4404 fishermen have been retired, accounting for 42.54% of all fishermen involved.
Of the 4,404 people who have retired, 4,267 have been employed, accounting for 96.89% of the fishermen who have retired.
Pension insurance coverage covers 2,691 people, accounting for 61.10% of fishermen who have retired.
In the next step, Chongqing will carry out in-depth special rectification actions, accelerate the clean-up and rectification of the Yangtze River's main stream shoreline utilization projects, complete a new round of surveys of the Yangtze River's river drainage outlets and carry out corresponding rectification actions, basically complete the rectification task of "three phosphorus" (referring to phosphate mines, phosphorus chemicals, and phosphorus gypsum banks), clean up and rectification work of small hydropower, promote special afforestation and greening actions on both sides of the Yangtze River, strengthen the construction of green mines, consolidate the achievements of the special rectification of illegal docks and illegal sand mining on the main stream of the Yangtze River, and further promote the prohibition of capture and withdrawal in the Yangtze River basin.
Israel strengthens the prevention and control of repeated epidemics - chinanews.com

Israel strengthens the prevention and control of repeated epidemics
At the beginning of the outbreak of COVID-19, Israel's prevention and control measures were effective.
However, with the gradual lifting of the ban on prevention and control measures, the number of confirmed COVID-19 in Israel has recently increased significantly. The Israeli government has repeatedly taken emergency measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On February 28, the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Israel, so that it quickly closed all entry and exit ports, suspended non-essential industries, schools changed to online teaching, restricted public transportation and non-essential social activities, blocked cities with severe epidemics, and the military and police jointly maintained prevention and control measures.
This series of measures quickly achieved positive results. By mid-May, the number of new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Israel fell back to single digits in a single day.
With the epidemic under control, Israel's various prevention and control measures have been fully unblocked. Since June, the number of newly diagnosed COVID-19 has gradually rebounded.
Especially after entering July, the spread of the epidemic has continued to accelerate.
In recent days, there have been more than 1,500 new cases in Israel every day for 8 days. As of July 25, there were 916 new cases on that day.
As of July 25, Israel has 59,745 confirmed cases and 448 deaths.
In the face of the rapid rebound of the epidemic, the Israeli government has repeatedly taken emergency measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On July 6, after the number of confirmed cases exceeded 30,000, the Israeli government closed public entertainment venues such as gyms, swimming pools, bars, and nightclubs, and introduced a policy of restricting public transportation, stipulating that the maximum number of passengers per bus should not exceed 20.
On the 17th, the Israeli government announced a series of new restrictive measures, including the implementation of "closure of the city" on weekends, etc., stipulating that the "closure of the city" will be implemented from 17: 00 every Friday to 5: 00 every Sunday.
During this period, people can go out, but shops, shopping centers, barber shops, beauty salons, libraries, zoos, museums, exhibition halls, swimming pools and tourist attractions will be closed, while supermarkets, pharmacies and other basic service places will remain open.
At the same time, on all dates and time periods, gatherings of more than 10 people are prohibited, gyms, studios and other places will be closed, restaurants and cafes are prohibited from eating, and only takeaway services are allowed.
At the same time, the Israeli people did not pay enough attention to the severity of the epidemic and failed to form a joint force with the government in fighting the epidemic.
After the recurrence of the Israeli epidemic, many people took to the streets to protest and march because the government's prevention and control measures affected their own economic interests.
On July 11, tens of thousands of people held a demonstration in Tel Aviv, believing that the anti-epidemic policy affects the economy.
On the evening of the 21st, thousands of protesters gathered in front of Prime Minister Netanyahu's residence in Jerusalem to protest against Prime Minister Netanyahu's promulgation of prevention and control measures such as banning restaurants and cafes without compensation.
In addition, many people also fail to observe regulations such as wearing masks and maintaining a safe social distance of two meters during outdoor activities. In order to avoid being fined by the police for not wearing masks, many people only wear masks on their chins or hang them on their wrists.
During the recurrence of the epidemic, the school was the hardest hit area for the spread of COVID-19. According to a reporter's recent visit to this kindergarten, neither the teachers nor the students in the kindergarten wore masks as required by the government, nor did they maintain a safe social distance of two meters from each other, laying down hidden dangers for a large number of teachers and students to be infected with the virus.
Professor Eli Waxman, a member of the Israeli National Security Council's expert advisory group to combat the epidemic, believes that Israel is moving towards a "dangerous situation", pointing out that the epidemic prevention and control measures currently taken by Israel are not enough, and all leisure and entertainment venues and summer schools should be closed to control the further spread of the epidemic.
Waxman said that Israel lacks an overall plan to combat the epidemic. The parliament and government departments should abandon their respective interests as soon as possible, reach an agreement on the fight against the epidemic, and formulate clear steps that include relevant restrictions in different departments.
Tel Aviv, July 25. Our reporter in Tel Aviv, Wang Jiong
Wu Fengfang, a farmer in Guyuan, Ningxia, could not resist his old companion Dai Tianfu, and the two men drove from their home 20 miles away to the Liangyun Cultural Compound.
Despite the inconvenience of his legs and feet in the past two years, 77-year-old Dai Tianfu still expects to "come here every other time and get used to it."
This is an inconspicuous courtyard in Yuanzhou District, Guyuan City. Unlike ordinary farmyards, there are often melodious Qin operas in the courtyard, as well as colorful shadow plays, embroidery works, traditional Qin operas, eyebrows, etc.
The owner of the compound is called Liang Yun, who used to be a carpenter.
More than 10 years ago, he, who loves shadow and singing, began to plan to build a cultural compound.
With the Liangyun Cultural Compound, the cultural life of the villagers has become rich and colorful.
The reporter has not yet entered the Liangyun Cultural Compound, and the tune of Qin cavity has been spread out.
It is Bai Lixiang, a villager from a neighboring village, who is singing Qinqiang excerpts for the villagers.
She has loved Qinqiang since she was a child, and now she is well-known in the local area. As long as she has free time, she will come to the cultural compound to perform programs for the villagers.
Recently, Bai Lixiang also played live webcasting.
Bai Lixiang said: "It is a very happy thing to have a stage for more people to see their performances."
On the stage, the singer takes one look, and the player plays one tune at a time. Although he is an amateur, his enthusiasm is undiminished.
Just like the simple style of the farmyard, outside the Qin cavity, the "grassroots" art and non-heritage culture in the Liangyun Cultural Compound came to the face.
The compound also houses more than 300 items of farming utensils from different ages, traditional and hand-made tiles, paper-cuts, embroidery, shadow and other objects.
Liang Yun led the reporter into the exhibition hall in the courtyard, which showed his collection of old objects, old wine pots, three strings, spinning wheels, etc.
Why did an ordinary farmer build a cultural compound?
"Shadow play is my family craft. I have been learning this craft since I was 15 years old."
Liangyun Cultural Compound was established in 2012 and became the first rural "intangible cultural heritage exhibition hall" in Ningxia. It is also a demonstration compound for the protection of intangible cultural heritage in Guyuan City.
In addition to Liangyun Cultural Compound, more than 120 cultural compounds and 79 folk performance groups have emerged in Yuanzhou District, Guyuan City. Among them, there are more than 50 cultural compounds of a certain size, such as Shenjiahe Cultural Compound, Wang Yonghong Cultural Compound, Yang Lang Cultural Compound, etc., covering various towns and streets in Yuanzhou District, with more than 5,000 participants.
These grassroots artists are active in the field, enriching the cultural life of the masses and meeting their spiritual needs.
"As life gets better and better, traditional culture cannot be left behind like this."
"Liu's Spy War Drama" Returns Again "Winning Chance" to watch Liu Yunlong Li Liqun's opponent "Dao Opera " - Xinhuanet
The 40-episode spy war drama "Winning" will land on Beijing Satellite TV from July 16.
"Winning Chance" is adapted from real historical facts and is based on the Soviet military archives that have been dusty for many years and first appeared.
Actor Liu Yunlong, who is well known to the audience as the "spy war drama", broke through the image in the play and challenged a "stuttering agent" with a sense of joy.
In recent years, the popularity of dramas such as "The Pretender", "Mask", and "Kite" has proved that spy war-type dramas have strong vitality.
Unlike previous spy war works, "Winning" looks at the world and extends the background of the story to the Soviet Far East battlefield.
It is set against the background of the final phase of the Anti-Japanese War in 1944, and tells the story of Tang Fei (played by Liu Yunlong), a secret intelligence worker of the Communist Party of China, who, under the leadership of the secretary of the Linhe Provincial Committee of the Chinese Underground Party and the director of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Agency, carried out the "Mudan Ula" strategic operation of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Agency.
In many spy war dramas, the male protagonist, as a high-level spy, is a perfect image of handsome, high intelligence, and mature.
But in Liu Yunlong's view, such a person is not suitable to be a spy. "A spy should be the kind of person who cannot be found in a pile of people. If he comes on the stage, he is the kind of person who is very handsome. I wish everyone would pay attention to you. Can you still lurk? There is a line in" Kite, "'You don't come to catch me, I forget that I am a Kuomintang', and the spy is going to be elitist."
So in "Winning", Liu Yunlong ingeniously designed his hero Tang Fei as a "stuttering agent" with a sense of joy.
The other camp in "Winning Chance" is supported by the Japanese Fuyuan played by Liang Guanhua and Fang Shibao, director of the Police Department played by Li Liqun.
Two powerful actors, one from the south and the other from the north, have added many highlights to the whole play.
Director Yin Fei used the term "drag show" to describe the confrontation between Li Liqun and Liu Yunlong in the play. "It is definitely a drag show. The two of them have a special understanding, and this tacit understanding on them is very influential to me. Many times their plays are 'hanging'. For example, we only wrote the length of half a page of paper, and if I don't stop during filming, they can go on."
The masters do not rob each other, and the director does not disturb the play. When the actors are all in the role and ensure their own character status, they can not only shape the character from the perspective of the character, but also bring more viewing possibilities to the audience. Yin Fei said that such a play is enough.
In the play, you can also see many familiar faces in the "Liu's spy war drama". The famous and majestic "Mountain City F4" in "Kite" also gathered three people in "Winning".
Hou Yu and Liu Mingyang, who played Song Xiaoan and Zhao Jianzhi, once again played Tang Fei's right arm.
Director Yin Fei introduced, "There is no inferiority in these two people, they just drifted with the tide in that era and that environment."
Liu Yunlong also offered, "We must have a human touch. This human touch means that the people around me must have good and bad, and bad people are enemies, but we must also develop them, and our team must grow."
The ending of these two people in the play was also carefully designed by Liu Yunlong, who believes that he will give the audience a satisfactory answer.

4 students drowned in Arong Banner, Inner Mongolia Official: This incident sounded the alarm - chinanews.com
Chinanews.com, Hulunbel, July 26 (Reporter Li Aiping) On the evening of the 25th, the reporter learned from the government of Arong Banner, Hulunbuir City, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region that four local students died of drowning.
At 15: 50 on July 24, the Arong Banner Public Security Bureau 110 received a report that six junior high school students were drowning there.
After receiving the police, the local police rushed to the scene as soon as possible and rescued 2 students on the spot. Then the local emergency bureau, water conservancy bureau and other units rushed to the scene one after another to participate in the rescue.
According to reports, the rescue site dispatched more than 80 people including public security police, forest police, firefighting, medical care, etc., dispatched 3 rubber boats to continuously salvage the surrounding waters, and hired professional rescue teams to arrive at the scene and conduct underwater searches through sonar detection.
The reporter learned that local rescuers found the first student who died at 6: 40 on July 25, the second student who died at 11: 30 on the 25th, the third student who died at 12: 40 on the 25th, and the last student who died at 13: 34 on the 25th. After the above four people were salvaged, they were identified by the local 120 emergency center as having no vital signs.
Officials said that the drowning incident sounded a wake-up call to the whole society.
At present, the relevant departments of the local government are collating some knowledge about drowning prevention, hoping that the tragedy will not happen again.
Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 25. Xu Zhengyu, Secretary for Financial Affairs and the Treasury of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, said that Hong Kong's financial market remains active and orderly.
He expressed optimism about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
Xu Zhengyu said at an online seminar co-organized by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Toronto and the Hong Kong-Canada Chamber of Commerce (Canada Association) on the 24th (Toronto time) that Hong Kong is experiencing difficult conditions due to the "regulatory disturbance" and COVID-19.
The exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar is stable and biased towards the strong exchange guarantee level.
The banking system has no obvious signs of capital outflows. On the contrary, more than $11 billion in capital has flowed in since June.
The total amount of bank deposits has also continued to increase in the past few months. There has been a series of public offering fund-raising activities in the stock market, and market transactions have repeatedly increased.
Xu Zhengyu said that COVID-19 has put pressure on the global economy and financial markets, but Hong Kong's basic advantages remain unchanged.
Hong Kong has many advantages, including geography, rule of law, high-speed communications, free flow of information and capital, and a simple and low tax system, making Hong Kong a leading international financial center.
Xu Zhengyu pointed out that the SAR government has set aside 6 billion Hong Kong dollars in the "epidemic prevention and anti-epidemic fund" to create about 30,000 time-bound jobs in the public and private sectors in the next two years, covering people with different skills and academic qualifications.
To support the development of financial technology, the SAR government has also launched the "Thousand People Plan" to subsidize local financial technology companies, start-ups and other companies with financial technology-related businesses to create 1,000 new jobs, hire local talent and enrich Hong Kong's financial technology talent pool.
Looking ahead, Xu Zhengyu expressed optimism about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
He encouraged Canadian companies to make good use of Hong Kong's advantages and its status as an international financial center, an international asset and wealth management center, and a global offshore RMB business hub to develop and invest in the Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao Greater Bay Area and surrounding areas.
The "Lancet" published an article praising China's anti-epidemic efforts to encourage countries to learn from experience - chinanews.com
The Lancet magazine published an article on the 25th that China, as a country with a population of 1.4 billion and a size similar to that of Europe or the United States, has effectively controlled COVID-19 at this stage, and there has been no large-scale spread, which has largely controlled the domestic epidemic.
The article stated that in the past ten years, China has invested a lot in domestic research and public health construction, which makes China's preparation for COVID-19 much better than that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that year.
The author said that when the SARS outbreak broke out in 2002, China was initially ill-prepared, especially the pathogen could not be identified.
When COVID-19 was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists were soon able to identify the type of virus and shared genome sequencing data with the international community on January 11, 2020.
By the end of January, doctors from mainland China and Hong Kong clarified the clinical characteristics of the virus and warned the world about the threat of COVID-19 through research papers published in The Lancet.
China has also been at the forefront of vaccine research. When the country declared a state of emergency, through close domestic cooperation, such research was carried out very quickly and strictly. In May and July, the results of the early trials of COVID-19 vaccine developed by China were announced in The Lancet.
China's experience shows that it is very important to invest in national health and research systems to effectively improve laboratory capabilities.
This is the basis for the country to respond quickly and effectively to health emergencies and global health security.
Other countries, especially low-income and middle-income countries, are very worthy of reference and learning.
In addition, China's experience has proved that on the basis of strong research, there must be a strong high-level and decisive scientific basis to make correct decisions, so that COVID-19 can be effectively controlled.
The article emphasizes that the government and its leaders must respect science, understand the value of science, and act on it in the most beneficial way for society.
In the early stage of the outbreak, the National Health and Construction Commission of China dispatched three groups of infectious disease experts to Wuhan to investigate the risk and spread of COVID-19. Their suggestions provided the basis for the decision to "close the city" in Wuhan on January 23; when some experts raised the necessity and urgency of building a square cabin hospital, the government quickly made a decision and implemented it quickly; at the same time, the extensive participation of the community and the masses also made the epidemic quickly and effectively controlled.
The article finally emphasizes that in response to global health emergencies, countries need to strengthen global cooperation and jointly respond.
CCTV reporter Yang Hong
Binghai, a former inspector of the Wuhai Municipal Committee of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, was expelled from the party - chinanews.com
Chinanews.com, July 26. According to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Commission for Discipline Inspection: A few days ago, with the approval of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Committee, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Commission for Discipline Inspection conducted a case review and investigation on the serious violations of discipline and law by the former inspector of the Wuhai Municipal Committee.
After investigation, Binghai, as a leading cadre of a party member, lost his ideals and beliefs. For his own self-interest, he blatantly violated the principle of party spirit and opposed inspection and rectification; he was indifferent to organizational concepts, arranged transfer work for others in violation of regulations, and accepted property from others in the selection and appointment of cadres; he was economically greedy, obtained huge benefits from illegal business enterprises, engaged in power and money transactions, and used power for personal gain; life was corrupt, causing adverse effects.
Buckingham seriously violated political discipline, organizational discipline, integrity discipline, and life discipline, constituted a violation of the law and was suspected of bribery crimes and corruption crimes, and did not converge or stop after the 18th CPC National Congress. The nature is bad and the circumstances are serious, and should be dealt with seriously.

On the afternoon of the 25th local time, a small plane crashed into the top floor of a multi-storey residential building in Wesel County, North Wales, Germany. The accident killed three people.
The Duisburg prosecutor, the Wesel County Police Department, and the Wesel City Fire Department jointly issued a statement that evening, stating that at about 14: 40 that day, a two-seater small plane crashed into a house in the attic on the top floor of a multi-storey residential building on Camp Street in Wesel County, killing three people.
It took off from Mar City, Ruhr District, North Wales, on the same day, took off again after stopping at the airport in Wesel County, and then crashed into a residential building.
The deceased may be a female resident in the hit house and two passengers on a small plane.
A two-year-old child in the room suffered only minor injuries and was rescued safely.
The rest of the residents in the room were not injured in the accident, but their emotions have not yet recovered.
The scene screen reported by the German news agency showed that the house affected by the accident once emitted thick smoke, and the firefighters saw that the house was severely damaged after extinguishing the fire.
At present, the cause of the plane crash is not clear.
The "Rhine Post" quoted the police as reporting that there were clues that the plane had disintegrated before it hit a residential building.
The police said that multiple parts of the crashed plane were found near the scene of the accident.
The German criminal police is working with the Duisburg prosecutor and the German Federal Aviation Accident Investigation Agency to investigate the cause of the accident.
The reporter learned from the Chinese Consulate General in Düsseldorf that day that the museum contacted the local police and fire department. According to the judgment on the spot, there were no Chinese citizens among the casualties.
The Ministry of Health of Singapore announced on the 26th that as of 12 o'clock that day, there were 481 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Singapore, with a total of 50,369 confirmed cases; a total of 27 deaths.
Data show that among the newly confirmed cases, 5 are local community cases, 4 are imported cases, and the rest are foreign workers living in special dormitories.
Singapore's Ministry of Health said that 98% of new confirmed cases are related to known infections.
There are still 173 COVID-19 patients receiving treatment in the hospital. Most of them are in stable or improved condition, and no one is in the intensive care unit.
In addition, 4648 people were quarantined in community facilities.
Foreign workers account for the vast majority of COVID-19 infections in Singapore.
According to statistics, there are 200,000 foreign workers living in 43 special dormitories for foreign workers in Singapore, and about 100,000 foreign workers living in other types of dormitories.
The Singapore Anti-epidemic Interdepartmental Working Group recently said that the Singapore government is stepping up testing for the last few dormitories for foreign workers with high rates of COVID-19 infection.
After completing the testing of all dedicated dormitories, the vast majority of foreign workers will be able to resume work, but they will still have to undergo regular COVID-19 testing.
Dapeng's director "Good luck" was shortlisted for the Golden Goblet Award - Xinhuanet
On July 18, the 23rd Shanghai International Film Festival announced the official list of films selected for the Golden Goblet Award.
Director Dapeng's first realistic film, "Good luck", was successfully shortlisted for the Golden Goblet Award of the Shanghai Film Festival, and the film officially released its first poster.
Poster view
The film "Good luck" is Dapeng's first realistic work, and it is also his second bond with the Golden Goblet Award.
The film tells a story: A comedy director had a whim and returned to his hometown in the northeastern countryside, hoping to make a literary and artistic film for the family during the New Year. As a result, he encountered a series of accidents.
The family members gathered for making the movie completed the final party.
In the movie poster released today, a member of this family-" Three Uncle "Wang Jixiang is sitting in the middle of the picture smoking a cigarette. The background is the black land of the Northeast dressed in silver, and the foreground is the red lantern that the Chinese people must hang during the New Year.
The red lanterns, which symbolize joy and reunion, form a huge contrast with the desolate Wang Jixiang, which also seems to reveal the complexity and entanglement in this extended family relationship.
It is reported that in the film, except for the daughter of "Three Uncle" Wang Jixiang, who is played by actor Liu Lu, the rest of the roles are completed by the real director's family. The experimental audio-visual style of the film breaks the boundary between drama and reality, and brings the audience a brand-new immersive viewing experience.
According to director Dapeng, the creation of "auspicious Ruyi" originated from "a providence". A series of sudden changes in the family during filming made the original filming plan have to be changed. The life without a script was eventually recorded as a movie, but released tension beyond design.
How exactly does director Dapeng face this "providence", and how should he continue to welcome the changes brought about by this providence?
There is no doubt that "good luck" is full of experimentation. The almost all-round lineup and innovative audio-visual style turn the life in front of the camera into a movie. Under the package of real images, the audience will also find the shadow of themselves and their families from the family presented in the film. With the end of this family gathering in the film, a series of thoughts are aroused.
NEWS.GOV.MO: COVID-19 Infection Response Coordination Center Enquiry Hotline Statistics (July 25 08H00-July 26 08H00)
From 08H00 on July 25, 2020 to 08H00 on July 26, the enquiry hotline of COVID-19 Infection Response Coordination Center received 292 telephone enquiries.
291 enquiries about the epidemic have been immediately transferred to representatives of relevant departments for follow-up, as follows:
271 cases from the Health Bureau (involving: Inquiring about isolation; inquiring about nucleic acid testing; inquiring about two places; health codes; other.)
17 cases from the Public Security Police (involving: Inquiring about immigration measures; inquiring about entry and exit measures for licensed vehicles from Guangdong and Macao; inquiring about the Zhuhai government hotline; inquiring about document stay issues).
1 case from the Tourism Bureau (involving: Inquiring about isolated hotels.)
1 case from the Education and Youth Bureau (involving: Inquiring about the method of Macao students returning to the United Kingdom to study.)
1 case from the Maritime and Water Affairs Bureau (involving: Asking whether Hong Kong fishing vessels are required to report to the Maritime and Water Affairs Bureau and nucleic acid testing-related matters.)
At the Bayong Zhuokang sentry point, platoon commander Yu Wang and a soldier were on duty.
In this place where the average annual temperature is more than ten degrees below zero, a row of simple barracks stands at the mountain pass. Not far from the barracks, a national flag is fluttering in the wind. The soldiers are on duty in the wind every day, and they need to regularly patrol higher altitude locations.
The soldiers climbed up the steep slope of the rubble, requiring both hands and feet.
It was late July, when flowers and plants were flourishing in low-altitude areas, and in Bayan Zhuokang, only the ditch behind the barracks had relatively dense green.
Gao Peng, a soldier who has been stationed at the outpost for 6 years, pointed to the ditch and said that this is their back garden. Only in July and August can the grass grow slowly every year. After a while, all turned yellow and covered with snow.
Foot patrols can take about 9 hours.
In the harsh plateau environment, the soldiers stationed here are accompanied by snow-capped mountains and glaciers all year round, and they also regularly patrol the higher mountain passes.
A few days ago, a patrol team composed of 8 soldiers, led by instructor Liang Yixin, once again embarked on the patrol road.
Each soldier carries a weight of about 30 jin and marches towards the target point early in the morning.
On the way, a soldier rebelled, and his comrades gave emergency relief.
In addition to patrol missions, the soldiers at the Baudjokang sentry point have to conduct tactical and physical training every day.
Time passes by, the altitude continues to rise, the oxygen content is getting lower and lower, and the physical strength is constantly overdrawn. These factors test the will of the patrol members.
They clenched their teeth and insisted, crossing several landslide points one after another, and crossing several difficult and dangerous beaches.
At about 16 o'clock, it was lunch time for the patrol members. They took out their own dry food, sat on the spot at an altitude of more than 5,700 meters, accompanied by rain and snow, and supplemented their physical strength with food.
The soldiers at the Bayong Zhuokang sentry point conducted tactical and physical training.
During the break, they will play cards together, and the loser will do push-ups, both for entertainment and physical exercise.
After a short rest in the cold wind, they climbed to the target point of the patrol, took out the national flag on the mountain pass, and made a solemn declaration.
Behind them are the snow-capped mountains, and in front of them are dozens of kilometers of no-man's land. They are the safest guardians of the country.
Beijing consumption season restarts - Xinhuanet
Beijing restarted the activities of the Beijing consumption season in accordance with the principles of "comprehensive restart, key planning, orderly promotion, and strict organization."
On July 26, 1.5 million government and enterprise consumption vouchers were issued, including 1 million offline catering and shopping vouchers and 500,000 smart product vouchers, which consumers can receive at JD.com APP.
Liu Meying, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce, introduced at the media briefing held on the 25th that the consumption season after the restart will further reduce corporate capital allocation on the basis of maintaining the existing preferential subsidies for consumer voucher card packages.
Starting from early August, the current 1: 1 allocation of capital from the government and enterprises will be adjusted to 2: 1. For example, if consumers receive a card package to the store for consumption, they can enjoy a discount of 120 yuan, of which the government subsidizes 60 yuan and the enterprise makes a profit of 60 yuan; after the adjustment, the government subsidizes 80 yuan and the enterprise makes a profit of 40 yuan.
During the consumption season, the three major operators will subsidize traffic and terminals around 5G consumption, further promoting Beijing's 5G new infrastructure and 5G new consumption.
Chen Maobo pointed out that Hong Kong's economy has been hit by another outbreak of the epidemic and all walks of life are struggling together - chinanews.com
China News Service, Hong Kong, July 26. Chen Maobo, Financial Secretary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, said on the 26th that Hong Kong is facing the impact of the new wave of COVID-19, and business contacts and economic activities that had seen signs of recovery have also been hit.
The SAR government once again calls on owners of all sizes to reduce rents and spend the difficult time with retailers, restaurants and small and medium-sized enterprises.
Chen Maobo published an article entitled "The Rugged Road to Recovery" online on the same day.
He said that the recent high number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Hong Kong and the severe situation have affected the people's livelihood and troubled the economy.
When the epidemic is repeated, the first priority is to strictly prevent input cases, and deal with and interrupt the virus transmission chain as quickly as possible; when the epidemic is controlled, economic activities should be resumed accordingly in due course.
He pointed out that in the face of the impact of the new wave of the epidemic, business contacts and economic activities that had seen signs of recovery have also been hit.
For the business community, in addition to the spirit of the contract, social responsibility is equally important, especially those groups that have received large government subsidies in the "Employment Guarantee Program".
He mentioned that Hong Kong's economic situation in the second quarter of this year is still very severe, but the contraction seems to have slowed down slightly.
In terms of exports, he believes that the external situation of Hong Kong is still severe.
Chen Maobo said that the development history of Hong Kong in the past few decades shows that every crisis hides new opportunities, and every difficulty hides the key to future development.
One winter morning, a few years ago, I was driving to work in Johannesburg, South Africa, and noticed a haze hanging over the city.
I drive by there almost every day, but this time it's unusual, and I've never seen anything like this before.
Johannesburg is known for its distinctive skyline, but it was almost invisible that morning.
It didn't take long for me to realize that what I was seeing was a severe haze caused by air pollution.
The contrast between the beautiful environment I knew and this smog-covered skyline stirred up something within me.
I was worried that it was possible that the once colorful sunset would be swallowed up by a dark haze.
At that moment, I felt an urge to do something, but I didn't know what to do.
All I know is that I can't just stand idly by.
The biggest challenge was that I didn't know much about environmental science, air-quality management, or atmospheric chemistry.
I'm a computer engineer, and I'm pretty sure I can't code my way out of this air pollution problem.
(Laughter) In what capacity will I solve this problem?
I'm just a citizen.
In the following years, I learned a very important lesson that we should all take to heart if we are to achieve a better future.
Even if you're not an expert in a particular field, your expertise may hold the key to solving problems in that field.
Sometimes the unique perspective you have can inspire unconventional thinking that can shape the situation, but you need to be bold enough to try.
That's the only way you'll ever know.
What I knew at the time was that if I was to try to make a difference, I had to know enough about pollution first, so I became a student again.
I did some basic research and soon learned that air pollution is the world's biggest environmental health risk.
Data from the World Health Organization shows that in 2012, almost 14 percent of all deaths worldwide were attributable to household and ambient air pollution, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.
Air pollution causes more deaths each year than malaria and AIDS.
In Africa, premature deaths from unsafe sanitation, or childhood malnutrition, pale in the face of air pollution, and it comes at a huge economic cost: Over 400 billion US dollars in 2013, according to a study by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.
In my work, I explore cutting-edge advances in artificial intelligence, including the symbiotic relationship between humans and machines, to find a beneficial footing and help us make better decisions.
When I thought about the problem of air pollution, it became clear that we needed to find a better way to make better decisions about how to manage air pollution, and given the scale of the problem, it was necessary to work together.
So I decided to get to know some people working in the field.
I started talking to officials in Johannesburg and other surrounding cities, and I joined the local scientific community, and I also made a few phone calls to people who were completely unfamiliar but related.
The experiences that I embarked on helped me to gain a deeper understanding of the problem.
It also helped me to avoid the trap that people in my profession sometimes fall into when trying to innovate: To quickly adopt a technology before they've really grasped the problem.
I began to wonder, what could I do to improve the situation?
I began by asking myself how I could effectively integrate my knowledge and skills in software engineering and artificial intelligence with the expertise of the people I'd reached out to.
I wanted to create an online air-quality management platform that would uncover trends in pollution in the future and make predictions about what might happen.
I was sure that my idea would become a practical solution, but I faced uncertainty and had no guarantee of success.
All I have is a specific set of engineer skills, the skills I have gained from my work. (Laughter) Of course, for people who have been working in the field of air pollution for many years, my skills are brand new.
I have come to realize that sometimes a fresh perspective, a new skill set, can lead to something remarkable.
Our willpower and imagination are a guiding light, guiding us through obstacles and opening a new chapter.
After I gained a deeper understanding of the air pollution problem and found data on air pollution over the past decade, as well as meteorological data in and around Johannesburg, my colleagues from South Africa and China and I created an air-quality decision support system and uploaded it to the cloud.
This software can analyze historical and real-time data to reveal trends in pollution over time and space.
We then used new machine learning technology to predict future levels of pollution a few days in advance.
This means that residents can make better decisions about their daily itinerary and where to settle with their families.
We can predict adverse pollution events ahead of time, define heavy polluters, and the relevant authorities can order them to adjust their operations.
Through assisted scenario planning, city planners can also make better decisions about how to expand infrastructure, such as human settlements in industrial zones.
We have set up a pilot of this technology that has been running for 120 days, covering all of South Africa.
Our expected results were validated, and the predictive data we showed showed a close correlation with the data we collected on the ground.
Through our management, we have brought cutting-edge, world-leading instruments to predict air quality with unprecedented resolution and accuracy, benefiting the city I drove into one winter morning not long ago, when I said to myself, "Something is wrong. I have to figure out what to do."
So the point is: What if I hadn't investigated the problem of air pollution further?
What if I didn't pay attention to the state of the environment in my country and hoped that someone, somewhere else, would take care of it?
What I've learned is that when working hard to advance a cause that we firmly believe in, it's important to focus on the possibility of success and consider the consequences of inaction.
We should not be distracted by opposition and resistance, it should motivate us further.
So wherever you are in the world, the next time you find that some natural curiosity is being piqued, and it's about something you care about, you have some crazy or bold ideas, even if it's not your area of expertise, ask yourself this: Why not?
Why not just go ahead and tackle the problem as best as you can, in your own way?
You might be pleasantly surprised.
Thank you.
(Applause)
The largest earthquake in Taiwan this year occurred in the waters of eastern Taiwan - chinanews.com
China News Service, Taipei, July 26. An earthquake of magnitude 6.1 on the Richter scale occurred at 20: 52 on the 26th in the eastern waters of Taiwan, with a maximum magnitude of 4. The earthquake was felt throughout Taiwan, making it the largest earthquake in Taiwan this year.
According to Taiwan media reports such as the Central News Agency, China Electronic News, ETtoday News Cloud, the Taiwan Meteorological Department reported that the epicenter of the earthquake was 86.5 kilometers southeast of the Yilan County Government, that is, the waters of eastern Taiwan, with a depth of 53 kilometers.
The China Earthquake Network determined that the earthquake was 5.5.
The maximum magnitude across Taiwan is: Hualien County Level 4, Yilan County, Taitong County, Nantou County, Yunlin County Level 3, and other counties and cities measured a magnitude of 1 to 2.
Taiwan's meteorological department pointed out that this earthquake is the largest in Taiwan this year and is a submerged zone earthquake at the junction of plates. Its epicenter has often had earthquakes in the past and has been relatively active since this year.
In the next week, it is still not ruled out that aftershocks of magnitude 4 or above will occur.
Many people think driving is something that only those who can see can do.
A blind person driving a car safely and independently was thought to be an impossible task until now.
Hello, my name is Dennis Hong, and we built a car for the freedom and independence of the blind for the visually impaired.
Before I talk about this car for the blind, let me briefly talk about another project I worked on called the DARPA Urban Challenge.
This is about building a robotic car that can drive itself.
You press the start button, you don't touch anything anymore, and it can reach its destination completely automatically.
In the 2007 Challenge, our team won half a million dollars and came in third place.
Around that time, the National Federation of the Blind, or NFB, challenged the design team about who could develop a car that would allow a blind person to drive safely and independently.
We thought we'd give it a try, because we thought, "Hey, how hard is this going to be?"
We already have an autonomous car.
We just put a blind person in it and we're done, right?
(Laughter) We couldn't have been more wrong.
What NFB wants is not a car that can drive a blind person around, but a vehicle where a blind person can make active choices and drive.
So we had to give up everything we had and start from scratch.
To test this crazy idea, we developed a small dune buggy prototype vehicle to test its feasibility.
In the summer of 2009, we invited a lot of blind youth from all over the country and gave them a chance to take it for a spin.
It was an absolutely amazing experience.
But the problem with this car is that it's designed to only be driven in a very limited environment, like a closed parking lot -- even on a path made of red traffic cones.
So with this success, we decided to take the next big step, to build a real car that can be driven on real roads.
So how does it work?
Well, it's a relatively complex system, but let me explain it and simplify it.
We have three stages.
We have induction, computing and non-visual interfaces.
The driver is obviously invisible, so the system must be able to perceive the environment and collect data for the driver.
For this, we use an initial measurement unit.
It measures acceleration, angular acceleration -- like a human ear, inner ear.
I combined this information with a global positioning system to predict the location of the vehicle.
We also use two cameras to detect the lanes of the road.
We also use three laser range finders.
The laser scans the environment to detect obstacles -- the vehicle approaching from the front, the back and any obstacles that run into the road, any obstacles around the vehicle.
All this vast amount of information is then fed into the computer, and the computer can do two things.
First, one thing is to process the information to understand the environment -- which are the lanes of the road, which are the obstacles -- and convey that information to the driver.
The system is also smart enough to figure out the safest way to drive.
We can also issue instructions on how to operate the vehicle's operating procedures.
But the question is: How can we send information and instructions to a blind person fast enough and accurate enough to make sure he can drive?
So for this, we developed many different types of non-visual user interface technology.
The original three-dimensional ping sound system, vibrating vests, voice-controlled gears, leg straps, even shoes that put pressure on the foot.
But today we're talking about three of these non-visual user interface technologies.
The first interface is called the DriveGrip.
This is a pair of gloves, and it has vibrating elements on the knuckle, so you can transmit instructions on how to drive -- the direction and the amplitude.
Another device is called SpeedStrip.
This is a chair -- actually, this is a massage chair.
We take it apart, and we rearrange the vibrating elements in different patterns, and we let them transmit information about the speed, as well as instructions on how to use the accelerator and the brake.
Here, you can see how the computer understands the environment, and because you can't see the vibration, we actually put red light-emitting diodes on the driver, so he can see what's happening.
This is the sensed data, which is transferred from the sensor to the computer.
So these two devices, DriveGrip and SpeedStrip, are very effective.
But the problem is these are instructional cue devices.
So this is not really freedom, right?
The computer tells you how to drive -- turn left, turn right, speed up, brake.
I call this the co-driving problem.
So we're moving away from instructional cue devices and focusing more on informational devices.
A good example of this non-visual information interface is called AirPix.
Think of this as a monitor for the blind.
This is a small desktop, with lots of holes in it, and compressed air comes out of it, so it can be described as a picture.
So even if you're blind and you put your hand over it, you can sense the lanes and obstacles.
In fact, you can also change the frequency of the air coming out and possibly the temperature.
This is actually a multi-dimensional user interface.
Here, you can see the left and right cameras and how the computer interprets and sends this information to the AirPix.
So, we're showing a simulator, a blind person driving with an AirPix.
This program is very helpful for training blind drivers and quickly testing different theories for different types of non-visual user interfaces.
So basically that's how it works.
But this is a model car, and it's not going to be on the road unless it's proven to be as safe as, or safer than, today's car.
I truly believe that this will happen.
But will societies, will they accept this radical idea?
How are we going to handle insurance?
How are we going to issue driver's licenses?
There are many different kinds of obstacles behind the technology challenge that we need to address before it becomes a reality.
Of course, the main goal of this project is to design a car for the blind.
But potentially more important than that is the tremendous value of the by-products of this project.
Sensors that can be used to see through the dark, the rain and fog.
And with this new type of interface, we can use these technologies to make them safer vehicles for visible people.
Or for the blind, everyday home appliances -- educational facilities, office facilities.
Imagine that in a classroom a teacher writes on the blackboard and a blind student can also use these non-visual interfaces to understand and read what the teacher writes.
This is extremely precious.
Today, what I've shown you is just the beginning.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Marinichev said that the change in value is affected by the devaluation of the ruble and the epidemic.
He said, "The cost of services is increasing.
Because of the epidemic, people are beginning to spend more time on the Internet. "
Marinichev does not rule out that annual Internet prices will rise seriously, believing that operators can provide customers with higher speed and more services to offset people's dissatisfaction with price increases.
"Chinese Doctor" plans to pay tribute to the anti-epidemic hero - Xinhuanet
Recently, with the respect of Chinese filmmakers "heroes in the fight against the epidemic, Yu Dong, chairman of Bona Pictures Group, and director Liu Weiqiang (picture left) held discussions and exchanges with academician Zhong Nanshan in Guangzhou on the filming and production of the anti-epidemic film" Chinese Doctor. "
Bona Pictures hopes to pay tribute to all medical and epidemic prevention workers fighting on the front line of epidemic prevention and control through "Chinese Doctor"!
In 2021, the film will be released nationwide as a tribute film celebrating the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.
At present, Bona Pictures is organizing the original crew of the movie "Captain of China" to make the film "Chinese Doctor" under the arrangements and deployment of the Central Propaganda Department and the National Film Bureau, with the support of the Guangdong Film Bureau and the Hubei Film Bureau. This is a film that reflects the unity of the people of the country to fight COVID-19 under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee.
The film focuses on the front line of Wuhan's fight against the epidemic. It will take Wuhan medical staff and provincial and municipal aid medical teams as the background. From the perspective of human nature, using a unique narrative, as well as a very powerful lens language, the panoramic view shows the touching story of Chinese medical staff full of dedication and sacrifice on the front line of the fight against the epidemic.
It is understood that in the first time on the day when Wuhan was unsealed, Bona Company overcame many difficulties and dispatched a collection team to go deep into the front line of the epidemic, face-to-face exchanges with hundreds of medical workers to understand and collect information. So far, it has interviewed academician Zhong Nanshan himself, the first person from Guangzhou to assist Wuhan, the Guangdong medical team to assist Hubei, and the white-clothed angels at the forefront of the anti-epidemic front such as Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan Union Hospital, Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan Central Hospital, etc., have taken a large number of precious first-hand video materials.
Academician Zhong Nanshan also raised expectations and hopes for the filming of the film at this symposium: "I look forward to it. I hope that you will not only visit some experts who have made more public appearances, but also interview more medical staff who are working hard on the front line, they are the majority."
He said that he had seen "Me and My Fatherland" and "Chinese Captain" before, and thought that the way to tell the big pattern story from the perspective of ordinary people is very good.
"Now some foreign friends still have some misunderstandings about China."
When it comes to the dissemination of the film, Academician Zhong Nanshan said that at present some people abroad like to label the virus as politicized, and he hopes that the film can impress the audience from the perspective of human nature: "In addition to being shown in China, it is best to be shown abroad. It is necessary to impress the audience with a true humanistic spirit in a way that both domestic and foreign audiences can understand."
Academician Zhong Nanshan also fondly recalled the film "Man to Middle Age" in the 1980s. "After so many years, what impressed me most about the film after the reform and opening up was" Man to Middle Age. "At that time, my doctors and friends abroad were crying. If" Chinese Doctor "could play such a role, it would be great."
Academician Zhong Nanshan said that if "Chinese Doctor" can resonate with foreign audiences, it will be very successful.
During the discussion and exchange, academician Zhong Nanshan also shared his views and suggestions on the current international epidemic prevention and control. "I believe that people are always smarter than viruses."
Academician Zhong Nanshan said that although the virus is difficult to predict, since the primitive society, mankind has weathered thousands of dangers. Today's modern society has developed medical technology and social management measures. Together with the fact that medical staff and even ordinary people all over the world have a basic understanding of the scientific response to COVID-19, people will no longer be as passive as before. "Next, we must pay attention to two aspects of work, one is to study how the world can strengthen cooperation, and the other is to pay attention to the comfort of people's hearts."

A total of more than 30,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Japan - Xinhuanet
According to statistics, there were 239 new confirmed cases in Tokyo on the 26th, and more than 200 new cases in a single day for 6 consecutive days, with a total of 11214 cases.
In addition, there were 141 new confirmed cases in Osaka Prefecture, 90 new cases in Fukuoka Prefecture, and 80 new cases in Aichi Prefecture.
The number of telecommunications network fraud crimes rose by 70% in the first half of the year - chinanews.com
Chinanews.com, July 26. According to the Supreme Inspection website, in the first half of this year, procuratorial organs across the country prosecuted 58,101 people for fraud crimes, an increase of 35% year-on-year.
Especially among the crimes that hinder the prevention and control of the epidemic, fraud crimes are frequent, and the number of fraud crimes prosecuted by procuratorial organs accounts for 43.4% of all crimes that hinder the prevention and control of the epidemic.
The Supreme People's Procuratorate has carried out targeted guidance. Among the ten batches of typical cases involving epidemic prevention and control that have been released so far, a total of 9 cases involving fraud crimes.
Judging from the handling of cases by procuratorial organs in the first half of the year, there are many names involved in fraud crimes, ranging from national macro policies to people's clothing, food and housing, including epidemic-related fraud, "medical care" fraud, "health care product" fraud, "admissions agency" fraud, "routine loan" fraud, fraudulent state subsidy fraud, national asset unfreezing fraud, etc., continue to "innovate", covering education, medical care, employment, pension, social security, land acquisition and demolition, precise poverty alleviation, financial credit and other fields, not only causing economic losses to victims, but also seriously affecting economic and social development.
In particular, some telecommunications network frauds break through the restrictions of national boundaries, regions, and personnel, and have the characteristics of stakeholder, cross-border, remote, and electronic payment. There are many non-specific victim groups and great harm.
For example, some set up special companies, rent high-end office buildings, set up multiple departments or posts, use legal online platforms to promote and recruit, train and evaluate recruiters, adopt corporate operation mode management, and wear a "legal cloak", which is more confusing.
Punishing and preventing crimes in accordance with the law, and promptly issuing early warnings to the public and relevant departments are the unshirkable responsibilities of procuratorial organs.
In judicial cases, procuratorial organs conscientiously perform their duties, not only insisting on maintaining a high-pressure posture against fraud crimes, but also refining various law enforcement measures in a targeted manner, and promoting social governance by issuing procuratorial recommendations.
The procuratorial organs strictly control the facts, evidence, procedures and application of the law in approving and prosecuting fraud cases, and take the facts as the basis, and the law as the criterion, so as not to be in vain.
Especially for telecommunications network fraud crimes, pay attention to the central role of electronic data in fact determination, and strive to build an evidence chain of mutual confirmation between electronic data, verbal evidence, and documentary evidence.
For example, in response to an epidemic-related fraud case handled by the Yinzhou District Procuratorate of Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, the procuratorial organ intervened in advance as soon as possible. From the occurrence of the case to the completion of the case, it took only 5 days, which reflects the attitude and determination to handle it quickly and strictly and maintain the stability of the overall social situation.
In the process of reviewing arrests and reviewing prosecutions, we pay attention to the prosecution of missing offenders in cases, correct the omission of 733 people by public security organs, and correct the omission of public security organs to review and prosecute 1113 accomplices.
In the first half of the year, procuratorial organs across the country issued 298 procuratorial recommendations for fraud crimes, promoting joint efforts to prevent fraud crimes and promoting in-depth governance.
For example, in response to the loopholes in the supervision of telecommunications companies, banks, intermediary organizations, etc., found in the handling of cases, the Guangzhou Procuratorate of Guangdong Province and the Dongguan Procuratorate promptly put forward procuratorial suggestions, urging relevant units to strengthen supervision, improve mechanisms, and promote the construction of long-term systems.
Fourth, make every effort to recover stolen goods and recover damages.
Local procuratorial organs seize important links such as intervening in investigations to guide evidence collection, review and prosecution, urge investigative agencies to actively recover stolen money, cooperate with relevant departments to do a good job of recovering stolen goods, and strive to minimize the economic losses caused by fraud crimes to the people.
For example, in the Lin Moumou road loan case handled by the Beijing Municipal Procuratorate, the case involved 22 properties waiting to be sealed up. In the case that the property may be disposed of in advance by other cases, the "Letter of Suspension of Execution" was first issued and delivered to the relevant court in a timely manner. It is recommended that the previous seizure court suspend the execution of the property involved in the case, and dispose of it uniformly after the facts of the crime are ascertained, so as to make the best efforts to recover the property involved in the case and recover the losses of the victims.
The prosecutor reminded everyone to be very vigilant against fraud crimes, don't expect "pie in the sky", and don't be credulous when you think it's cheap, and keep your "money bag".
Yina Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province: Shorter apple trees widen the road out of poverty - chinanews.com

In the heat and heat, a reporter from Economic Daily-China Economic Network walked into Zhonghai Village, Yina Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province.
Under the scorching sun, villager Li Yuanzhong was weeding in the base. Although his face was flushed with sun, he hummed a few small songs from time to time.
Weining County, where Yina Town is located, because of its low latitude, high altitude, sufficient light, and large temperature difference between day and night, produces apples with high sugar content and good taste. It has a certain reputation in the surrounding area, but also because of its small size and many spots, it has not been able to sell a good price and failed to form an industrial scale.
Yina Town used to be a poverty-stricken township that "covered the valley with potato for spring and autumn." The local poverty incidence rate was as high as 25.8% 10 years ago.
As the fight against poverty has entered a critical period of decisive victory, it is urgent to change traditional planting habits, adjust the industrial structure, and increase the income of farmers.
After many visits, Chen Chao, secretary of the Party Committee of Yina Town, and a group of people in the town believe that industrial development cannot go the same way.
To this end, Yina Town introduced leading enterprises and planted apples in a modern way.
Hou Jianwen, deputy general manager of Weining Beyond Agriculture Co., Ltd. came to Yina Town from Shaanxi in 2015 to investigate, saw the local planting conditions at a glance, and began to plant apple trees there in 2016.
At first, the village mobilized Li Yuanzhong to transfer the land to plant apple trees, and Li Yuanzhong and his wife murmured in their hearts: "After planting apples for so many years, they did not see who in the village planted apples and made a fortune."
"All the apples planted are dwarfed apples, which will not make the apple tree grow too high."
What Li Yuanzhong did not expect was that this time the apple planting adopted a new method. The irrigation pipe was laid under each apple tree, and the water and fertilizer were poured to the roots of the tree together. When the fruit was harvested in the autumn, the tractor drove directly into the orchard and stood to pick the fruit.
At present, the Apple base has gradually entered a productive period, and the market is as expected by Hou Jianwen. Apple is not worried about selling, and is loved by consumers in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou.
The growing apple industry has brought new changes to Li Yuanzhong's life. Although he is still planting land, he has a new source of income.
Li Yuanzhong's family has more than 9 acres of land transferred to the Apple base. In addition to the guaranteed land transfer fee every year, there is also a profit bonus after hanging the fruit. The couple usually work in the base. "One person can get 80 yuan a day, and there is work all year round."
Li Yuanzhong told reporters that last year's profit dividend earned more than 2,800 yuan, together with the land transfer fee and the couple's labor income, the family earned more than 80,000 yuan. "There is no worry about food and clothing, and the well-off life has been lived."
"At present, it has begun to bear fruit. The annual output value of 1 mu of apples exceeds 15,000 yuan, about 10 times that of corn."
Chen Chao told reporters that the whole town of Yina has currently planted 20,000 acres of apples, and there are 6,000 acres in Zhonghai Village alone, covering 4,056 households and 17,200 people, including 656 poor households and 2,952 people who have established file cards. The salary paid in a year exceeds 6 million yuan, which truly realizes that the base is built in front of the home, and there is no need to go out to work.
Li Yuanzhong, whose waist is gradually bulging, also began to realize his "wish".
During the Lunar New Year this year, Li Yuanzhong bought a Land Cruiser and now drives his car to and from work every day. "There are still more than a dozen acres of land in the family. The next step is to expand the size of the Apple base and transfer it all to them, and the income will be more."

Membrane separation technology helps crack the "greenhouse effect"
Schematic diagram of new hybrid matrix membrane preparation technology
Our reporter Shang Rui reported: A few days ago, the Tianjin University Atmospheric Environment and Bioenergy Team made significant progress on the "membrane separation method to capture carbon dioxide", and successfully developed a new hybrid matrix membrane preparation technology to greatly improve the carbon dioxide capture performance of membrane materials.
The relevant results have been published as the cover article of the international journal "Greenhouse Gas: Science and Technology."
The "greenhouse effect" is a major environmental problem that plagues human development, and carbon dioxide emissions are responsible for the "greenhouse effect".
How to efficiently capture and use carbon dioxide emitted by humans is the focus of scientists' attention.
"Membrane separation method" is an emerging carbon dioxide capture technology. It separates carbon dioxide gas with the help of membrane materials, and has the characteristics of high efficiency, energy saving and simple operation.
How to let the membrane material "breathe deeply" and improve the efficiency of gas separation is the bottleneck difficulty in capturing carbon dioxide by membrane separation.
The scientific research team of Tianjin University innovated ideas and explored the influence of different solvents on membrane gas separation performance through repeated experiments.
The experimental results show that with N-methylpyrrolidone as the preparation solvent, the carbon nanotubes in the generated membrane material are more evenly distributed and "more breathable", which effectively improves the gas separation efficiency and rate of the membrane material.
The carbon dioxide separation performance of the mixed matrix membrane prepared by this new technology is close to the current theoretical separation upper limit of such membrane materials.
"New technology provides new ideas for membrane separation to capture carbon dioxide."
Li Run, a member of the atmospheric environment and bioenergy team of Tianjin University, said: "We hope that this technology can provide strong support for future coal-fired power plants and chemical companies to process flue gas, and play a major role in controlling greenhouse gas emissions."
Understand what is a professional level difference before volunteering - chinanews.com

Understand what is a professional level difference before volunteering
Every year when you report for the college entrance examination, there are students or parents who do not understand the terms involved in the voluntary reporting, which affects the voluntary reporting.
This year, 5 colleges and universities including Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing University of Science and Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing Forestry University, and Beijing University of Chemical Technology jointly issued the 2020 enrollment policy, eliminating the professional level difference.
What is the meaning of professional level difference and what is the significance in voluntary reporting?
There are three ways of professional distribution rules
Experts remind that before filling in the volunteer, you must read the "Admissions Regulations" of your favorite school and understand the admission rules of colleges and universities, including the transfer ratio, professional distribution rules, etc.
The professional allocation rules refer to the three methods of major priority, score priority, and professional level difference for professional admission after colleges and universities are transferred.
Which method is specifically used by colleges and universities will be specified in the "Admissions Regulations".
But there are also some colleges and universities whose admission principle is that the total score is preferred, and there is no level difference between majors.
That is to say, candidates in the admission range will be queued according to the total score. When the score does not reach the first professional volunteer admission score line, it will be determined whether it has reached the second professional volunteer admission score line, so that until the admission to the last professional volunteer, there is no grade difference between the professional volunteers.
The so-called "professional level difference" is that when colleges and universities arrange candidates' majors, they determine the admission majors of volunteer candidates from different majors according to one or several points announced in the admission regulations. This score is the "professional level difference".
That is, the difference between the score of the college when admitting candidates for the first professional volunteer and the non-first professional volunteer, and the grade difference between the professional volunteers, such as 3 points, 2 points, 1 point, etc.
For example.
Suppose that student Xiaoming applied for college A and scored 560 points. His professional volunteers are: Computer, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering, and e-commerce. The professional admission of college A adopts the method of professional grade difference, which is divided into 2 points, 1 point, 1 point, and 0 points.
In the professional assignment, if Xiaoming's first professional volunteer meets the professional admission requirements and the major has a planned balance, then Xiaoming is admitted to the "computer" major; if the computer is not admitted, his score will be subtracted by 2 points. According to the score of 558 points, he will be ranked with the candidates who applied for the "international trade" of the first professional volunteer to determine whether they meet the professional admission requirements; if it is still not met, the score is subtracted by 1 point (that is, 557 points) for the admission of the third professional volunteer "automation"; if it is still not met, the score is subtracted by 1 point (that is, 556 points) for admission to the fourth major. If the follow-up major still fails to meet its professional volunteers, it will no longer be reduced, and so on.
Different universities have different professional level difference settings
With the popularization of parallel volunteering, many colleges and universities have now abolished the professional level difference, but some colleges and universities still retain this method this year. According to the "Admissions Regulations" announced by each school, more than 20 universities have set up professional level differences this year.
For example, Sichuan Agricultural University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University of Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Jiangxi Normal University, Chengdu Medical School, Northeast Electric Power University, Jiemei University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing University of Technology, Ningxia University, Shandong University of Technology, China Civil Aviation Flight Academy, etc.
In these colleges and universities, the professional level difference set by each university is different.
Some colleges and universities have a grade difference in each major, such as Ningxia University. Candidates whose files have been submitted to the school are admitted according to the order in which the candidates fill in their professional volunteers.
And some universities have set up different professional level differences between different majors.
For example, at Jiemi University, the total score of the professional volunteer level difference is 4 points, that is, the difference between the first professional volunteer and other professional volunteers is 3 points. There is no level difference between other professional volunteers, which is regarded as parallel volunteers, and the professional level difference between other professional volunteers and transfer professional volunteers is 1 point.
When filling in the volunteer, candidates and parents must carefully read the admission policy of the reported school to see if there is a professional level difference, and what is the form of the grade difference. While fully considering the scores, it is also necessary to reasonably analyze the school and major to be selected. If the college explicitly adopts the grade difference method for admission in the admission charter, candidates should pay attention to the gradient between the majors when choosing a major to improve the admission probability.

This year's first Atlantic hurricane landed in Texas, which was hit hard by the epidemic
The National Hurricane Center announced that morning that Hurricane Hannah reached a speed of 145 kilometers per hour and is expected to cause heavy rainfall in southern Texas and northeastern Mexico until next Monday, which in turn will cause rapid flooding.
At present, with the gradual advance to land, the custom has weakened. Despite power outages in some areas, there is no casualty statistics report for the time being.
Some local officials in Texas are preparing to deal with tornadoes that are likely to occur along the coast.
President Trump said through Twitter that the office is closely monitoring the dynamics of Hurricane Hannah and Hawaiian Hurricane Douglas, and called on the public to listen to the emergency management information of the local government to protect families and property.

Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 25. Qiu Tenghua, Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, said on the 25th that all APEC member economies should act in concert to jointly fight the epidemic and promote economic recovery, and should avoid establishing unnecessary trade barriers in accordance with the rights and obligations stipulated by the World Trade Organization.
Qiu Tenghua made the above remarks when participating in the video conference of trade ministers to fight COVID-19 convened by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) on the 25th.
At this meeting, the participating ministers exchanged views on the substantive plans that APEC can take to respond to the impact of COVID-19 and promote economic recovery in the region.
Qiu Tenghua said that the public health and economic crisis triggered by the epidemic has had an unprecedented and far-reaching impact on society and the economy.

Chengdu people gathered to watch the U.S. Consulate Police prevent people from "looking too happy"
In response to the closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, China announced on Friday that it would close the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu.
On Saturday, the badge of the U.S. Consulate was removed, and on Sunday, a dark glass car drove away from the consulate amid boos from passers-by.
On Sunday, many Chengdu people gathered in front of the US Consulate to take pictures, and those who had not been there were also driven by curiosity about current events.
The reporter from the Agence France-Presse Chengdu station also went to observe near the US Consulate in Chengdu and reported that there was a steady stream of curious people, and many parents took their children to take a walk to watch the consulate, take pictures of the building, or take their own photos.
The consulate was surrounded by guards, and the police "corrected" people's behavior from time to time. They seemed to not allow any unusual behavior: A woman was stopped as soon as she was about to sing a red song, and a guard confiscated a banner.
But the residents of a nearby residential building successfully pulled up a huge Chinese flag on their balcony and shouted slogans of support for China.
The Chengdu American Consulate opened in 1985, covering all U.S. consular-related affairs in southwestern China, especially the Tibet Autonomous Region.
A reporter from the Agence France-Presse Chengdu station said that the Chinese government's response to the United States was relatively restrained: Many Chinese asked the government to close the U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong online, but the official only said that "closing the US Consulate in Chengdu is a necessary and legal response to the unreasonable behavior of the United States."
At present, in addition to Chengdu, the United States also has consulates in Guangdong, Shanghai, Shenyang, Wuhan, and Hong Kong in China.
Large-scale financial media action "Walking the Village Live to Watch Poverty Alleviation" Start-Today's Highlights-Hunan Daily News-Huaxing Online
Hunan Daily: New Hunan Client, July 25 (our reporter) On July 25, the large-scale financial media operation "Walking the Village Live to Watch Poverty Alleviation", hosted by the Financial Program Center of China Central Radio and Television, set out from Xuzhou, Jiangsu. Two caravans carrying 5G new media mobile cloud production and broadcasting systems were seen by guests at the scene and drove slowly out of the scene.
General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that "2020 is a landmark year. We will build a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way and achieve the first centenary goal. 2020 is also the year of decisive victory in the fight against poverty."
The large-scale financial media action "Walking the Village Live to Watch Poverty Alleviation" is an important measure taken by the Financial Program Center of China Central Radio and Television to cooperate with this major theme and promote poverty alleviation.
This action will go into poverty alleviation villages in more than 20 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities across the country, dig out live poverty alleviation stories, directly hit the dramatic changes in the appearance of the village, and show how the villagers can break through the dilemma of survival and development and move towards the road to wealth.
This operation will last more than 3 months.
The reporter set out from Xuzhou and divided into two routes, all the way to the southwest line, passing through Anhui, Hubei, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, Chongqing, Yunnan, Tibet and other places; the other way to the northwest line, passing through Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Hebei and other places, the journey exceeds 10,000 kilometers.
In terms of reporting form, "Walking the Village Live to Watch Poverty Alleviation" boldly integrates.
The economic development of the villages visited by the caravan will be broadcast through the CCTV Finance Channel, CCTV Economic Voice, China Communications Broadcasting, and CCTV Financial New Media.
Among them, the live TV broadcast will be completed mainly in the midday news program "World Finance" of the CCTV Finance Channel (first broadcast time: Monday to Sunday 12: 00-13: 00), and the golden news section "Economic Information Network" of the CCTV Finance Channel will open a poverty alleviation report column (first broadcast time: Monday to Sunday 20: 30-21: 30).
At the same time, the caravan will conduct a 1-hour live broadcast of each village visited on the CCTV Finance client. By downloading the CCTV Finance APP, the audience can watch the live broadcast and participate in the raffle.
In terms of technology application and studio design, "Walking the Village Live to Watch Poverty Alleviation" has the courage to break through and pioneered the "Outfield New Media Caravan".
The car carries a 5G new media mobile cloud production and broadcasting system, using 5G + 4K / 8K + AI technology to achieve an organic combination of online and offline, large and small screens, and television broadcasting.
Equipped with Sanxun broadcast area, the broadcast area is converted from a container, 12 meters long, 2.55 meters wide, and 3.98 meters high. The box adopts a hydraulic automatic expansion structure, which can be turned up to 120 degrees.
The broadcast area can also be expanded automatically, with an external expansion platform with an area of more than 50 square meters, which can meet the scene requirements of most programs.
At present, Dongchuan District of Kunming City is already hot in summer, and what is hotter than the weather is the poverty alleviation workshop next to the relocation site.
Lu Ling, an employee of Kunming Aisford Electronic Technology Company, said, "Now, as soon as you leave your home, you enter the factory door to make money and care for your family, thanks to the free vocational skills training organized by the trade union."
Walking into the electronic component processing and poverty alleviation workshop in Tongdu Street, Dongchuan District, a busy picture came into view.
Lu Ling, in her 40s, is a single mother who takes care of children alone and also takes care of elderly parents.
In her most difficult time, the Dongchuan District Federation of Trade Unions helped come up with ideas to find a way to "send charcoal in the snow" after running.
Since 2018, Lv Ling has enjoyed housing, schooling, social security, employment and other assistance policies and assistance funds issued by trade unions at all levels.
This year, her child has successfully graduated and taken up employment. She herself has a job and income after participating in skills training, and she got out of poverty at the end of April.
It is reported that the special skills training project of the Dongchuan District General Organization to help combat poverty is part of the skills training work of the Yunnan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions.
Taking into account the characteristics of the employees in difficulties in the relocation sites for poverty alleviation and resettlement in the area, the district will conduct in-depth investigations to understand the training needs and determine the types of training. In the near future, it plans to train a total of 450 electricians, welders, pastry chefs, etc.
Recently, Li Yi, an employee of the Yunnan Menglian County Branch of the Agricultural Bank, wrote a sincere thank-you letter to the County Federation of Trade Unions.
In the letter, she sincerely thanked the trade union for the golden autumn assistance she received from August 2013 to January 2017 to help her complete her studies.
In 2004, Li Yi's father died in a car accident, and his mother was included in the files of employees in difficulties. Since then, she has always enjoyed the care of the document establishment policy.
With the help of the local trade union, Li Yi successfully completed her studies.
Since 2016, 3,809 households have been lifted out of poverty through institutional guarantees and precise assistance.
The successful relief of Lv Ling's family and Li Yi is a microcosm of the work of Yunnan Trade Union to promote the relief of needy employees.
According to Duan Kaiyuan, a staff member of the Legal and Rights Protection Work Department of the Yunnan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the provincial governor strengthened the dynamic management of the files of employees in difficulties, promoted the normalization of file-building work, and promptly incorporated into the assistance system for employees in difficulties who meet the requirements for file-building; broadened the application channels for employees in difficulties, and used WeChat to open an online file-building service platform for employees with difficulties, so as to facilitate employees in difficulties to voluntarily declare in a timely manner.
During the epidemic, it was difficult to go out to work. In order to help employees in difficulties alleviate the pressure of life, Yunnan Province has arranged a total of more than 13 million yuan to send warm funds. According to the national level of 2,000 yuan per household for employees in difficulties and the provincial level of 1,500 yuan per household for employees in difficulties, more than 6,000 national-level and more than 1,000 provincial-level employees in difficulties have implemented special warm sympathy activities.
At the same time, the provincial general manager docked with various Internet recruitment platforms such as human society departments and Zhilian recruitment, pushed recruitment information to employees in difficulties, and provided employment counselling, employment guidance and other services.
