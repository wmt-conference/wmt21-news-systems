New China Review: Making Outstanding Returning Migrant Workers a Living Force for Rural Renewal - Xinhua News
Talent is the key to rural revitalization.
Where to find talent?
The outstanding group of returning migrant workers is an indispensable force.
Xinhua News Agency
Chengdu, July 26, Xinhua News Agency (Xinhua)
Zhang Xiong, 34 years old, lives in Orchard Village, Meishan City, Sichuan. In 2010, he quit his job in Beijing with a monthly salary of tens of thousands and returned home to start a business.
After several years of hard work, the grape-growing family farm he runs now has an annual income of more than one million yuan, has become a well-known rich leader, and has also been selected to join the team of the village "two committees."
In recent years, inspired by a series of policies to support and benefit farmers, such as national poverty eradication and rural revitalization, more and more outstanding migrant workers like Zhang Xiong have chosen to return home to start their own businesses, activating a pool of spring water in the countryside.
Sichuan, the most populous and labor-exporting province in the western part of China, has implemented the "Outstanding Migrant Workers Reduction and Training Project" due to the favorable situation. In 2019 alone, more than 8,000 village party branch secretaries, 61,000 village reserve forces and more than 20,000 development party members were generated from the outstanding migrant workers, providing a strong guarantee for winning the battle against poverty and implementing the rural revitalization strategy.
Whether it is well-off or not depends on the country.
Since the reform and opening up, a large number of young and middle-aged laborers in China's rural areas have gone out to work to increase their incomes, and some have set up their own enterprises through hard work.
However, it has also objectively led to the emergence of "empty-mindedness" in rural areas to different degrees, especially the weakening of rural grass-roots organizations. The secretaries of village Party branches and the ranks of Party members have shown the characteristics of "one old and one low," that is, they are old and have low educational qualifications, the ranks of leaders of village Party organizations are not strong, and the problems are prominent.
If rural talents and other factors have been flowing to the cities in one direction, and the countryside is in the state of "blood loss" and "anemia" for a long time, revitalization is an empty word.
To attract back those migrant workers who are capable, conscious and interested in serving their hometown, guide them to return home to start their own businesses and become leaders in getting rich, train them into Party members and village cadres on the basis of merit, and enrich the cadre at the grass-roots level, which is the solution to the root causes of the disconnect between the rural Party membership team and the grass-roots Party organizations.
Excellent migrant workers should be brought back, and they should be allowed to stay and do well.
In recent years, Sichuan has begun to pay close attention to the Party building of migrant workers and, on the basis of strict selection criteria, has established institutional mechanisms such as targeted referral, service guarantee, training, empowerment, selection and use of outstanding migrant workers, so that they can improve their abilities, have job security and have hope in life, truly establish roots in the countryside and have a sense of accomplishment in starting a business.
This year is the closing year of the decisive fight against poverty eradication. Talent is the key factor to connect the fight against poverty eradication with rural revitalization.
Party committees and governments at all levels should attach great importance to the group of outstanding returning migrant workers and, through comprehensive measures, turn them into a team and living army that can stay, fight and cannot take away, so as to provide strong organizational guarantee and talent support for rural poverty eradication, prosperity, development and revitalization.
Because of the epidemic, this year's college graduates are very special. On the evening of July 11, the bilibili Summer Graduation Song Festival brought a special live online performance to the graduates. Old Wolf, Park Shu, Li Yuchun, Mao Yi and other musicians sent songs and blessings to the fresh graduates.
Well-known up master Seal Wu Yifan also brought a "Wild Grass," which is a rap song based on Lu Xun's prose and poetry of the same name, which is very popular among young people.
As a result of the epidemic, many graduates did not experience the ritual sense of picking ears and awarding diplomas on the spot, so they shifted the ritual sense to online.
According to the data, the popularity of the 2.5-hour live concert peaked at over 35 million.
"Follow your heart and seize the opportunity, regardless of the consequences, and sometimes you will have unexpected gains."
Although it is a graduation song party, many songs also moved non-recent graduates.
"Looking at the whole scene, I really want to cry. Everyone's youth is full of beauty and regret, but they are worth remembering and should go on bravely."
Beijing's natural ecology continues to attract more than 500 species of wild animals to "settle" in the city

The natural ecology of the capital continues to improve to attract wildlife cities to "settle"
There are more than 500 species of wild animals in Beijing
(Reporter Wang Bin) The reporter of Beijing Youth Daily learned from the Municipal Bureau of Landscape and Greening that in recent years, with the continuous improvement of the natural ecological environment in the capital, the species and quantity of wild animals have continued to increase.
At present, the number of terrestrial vertebrate wildlife living in Beijing has increased to more than 500 species, including national protected animals such as brown horse chicken and black stork, as well as national protected animals such as zebra, swan, gray crane and mandarin duck.
Both the urban forests planted everywhere in the Second Ring and the small micro-wetlands embedded between the buildings have not only brought the wildlife to the citizens of the capital, but also attracted wild animals to "settle" in the city.
In the middle of summer, the Songshan National Nature Reserve, located in the Yanshan Mountains in the northwest of Yanqing District, is vibrant.
A raccoon was playing leisurely by a mountain stream, while two badgers were playing with each other.
In retrospect, a wild boar couldn't help its "scratching" and was rubbing hard against the bark. Hu Qiaoli, director of the Songshan National Nature Reserve Administration, said that as of the end of 2019, there were 178 kinds of wild animals, including gold carvings of state-protected animals and state-protected animals of the second class, including chicken and gazelle, living in this green sea with a total area of more than 6,200 hectares. Nearly one-third of the wildlife species in the city can be seen here.
"In Matsuyama, wild animals are the real 'masters'. At best, our staff can only be regarded as the 'bodyguards' of others."
Hu Qiaoli said that in order to understand the wildlife in the protected area on the ground, more than 30 professional rangers patrol along 16 carefully formulated protection routes every day, and make a "big circle" every month, spending a whole day almost all over the protected area.
"During the inspection, we should not only check and record the biodiversity, but also check and install artificial bird nests, rescue injured wild animals, install field infrared cameras and so on."
Songshan National Nature Reserve has installed more than 200 infrared cameras to record the living conditions of wildlife in the forest.
Hu Qiaoli said that with the continuous enrichment of the biodiversity of the protected areas in recent years, more and more wild animals have appeared in the camera. Leopard cats, raccoons and badgers have become "permanent guests," and the "visibility rate" of the state's second-level protected animal, the gazelle, has become higher and higher.
Zhang Zhiming, Director of Wildlife and Wetland Protection of Beijing Landscape and Greening Bureau, said that the number of terrestrial vertebrate wildlife in Beijing has increased from 461 species in 1994 to more than 500 species today, and the variety and number of wild animals in Beijing have continued to increase in recent years.
Wild animals are becoming more and more common in cities, which is closely related to the continuous upgrading of urban greening in the capital in recent years.
In particular, the new round of million-acre afforestation construction, which began in 2018, proposes to reshape the urban ecological environment, enhance the ecological function of woodland green space and highlight the concept of "near nature."
The plan strives to connect and interact with the surrounding green areas to make it easier for wild animals to "visit relatives and friends," and the trees planted are also favorite honey and food plants for animals.
I am committed to helping computers communicate with the world around us.
There are many ways to do this. I like to focus on helping computers talk about what they see and understand.
In view of this situation, a modern computer vision algorithm can tell you that there is a woman and a dog.
It can tell you that the woman is smiling.
He can even tell you that the dog is very cute.
I deal with this problem and think about how human beings understand and coexist with the world.
Those thoughts, memories and stories may arouse human attention in such scenes.
the interconnection of all relevant situations.
Perhaps you have seen such a dog before, or you have spent time running on such a beach and further evoking the memories and thoughts of the past holidays. When you went to the beach, you spent time running around with other dogs.
One of my guiding principles is that by helping computers understand what kind of experience this is, and thus understand what we believe and feel in common, we will be able to continue to develop computer technology in a way that complements our experience.
Therefore, digging deep into this point, I began to devote myself to helping computers produce human-like stories from image sequences a few years ago.
So one day, when I was working with a computer, I asked about its views on my trip to Australia.
It looked at the picture and saw a koala.
It did not know what koala was, but the computer indicated that it thought it looked like a very interesting creature.
Then I shared a series of images about the burning of houses with the computer.
The computer looked at the picture and said, "This is an amazing landscape! This is spectacular!"
It chills my back.
The computer saw a terrible, life-changing and life-destroying event and thought it was a positive thing.
I realized that the computer recognized the contrast between red and yellow and thought it was something worthy of positive evaluation.
This is partly because most of the images I enter into the computer are positive.
That is because people tend to share positive images when talking about their own experiences.
When was the last time you saw selfies at the funeral?
I realized that in the process of improving artificial intelligence, it is the task to the task and the data set to the data set, creating huge gaps, defects and blind spots in the understanding of computers.
While doing so, I am coding various prejudices.
Prejudice reflects limited views and stems from a data set that reflects the same human beings, such as stereotypes and stereotypes.
I recall that the development of technology brought me to the situation I was in that day - the first color image was calibrated for the skin color of a white woman, which meant that color photography was biased against blackface.
And the same deviation, that blind spot continued into the 1990s.
Even today, the same blind spot still exists in how to recognize the faces of different characters in the application of facial recognition technology.
In today's research, I think of the most advanced technologies, which tend to limit our ideas to one data set and one problem.
By doing so, we are creating more blind spots and prejudices that will be further amplified when using artificial intelligence.
At that time, I realized that we had to reflect on how the technology we invented and created today would be viewed in five to ten years.
In the interaction between human beings and the environment, human beings use time to correct problems, so evolution is slow.
In contrast, artificial intelligence is developing at an incredible speed.
This means that it is indeed important, and we should now consider this carefully - reflect on our blind spots and prejudices, consider how these prejudices affect the technologies we create now, and discuss what today's technologies mean for the future.
CEOs and scientists have weighed their ideas about the future development of artificial intelligence.
Stephen Hawking warned: "Artificial intelligence will destroy mankind."
Elon Musk warned that this is an existing risk and one of the greatest risks we face as a civilized society.
Bill Gates pointed out, "I don't understand why people are less worried about AI."
But these views are only part of the story.
Mathematics, models, these basic components of artificial intelligence are all available to us.
We have open source code tools to learn machines and make our own contributions at the same time.
Besides, we can also share our experience.
We can share technology and its relationship with us, and how to excite us.
We can discuss what we love.
We can communicate with the foreseeable future, which may be more beneficial in terms of technology, or more problems may arise over time.
If we all focus on opening up the discussion of AI to the future, this will help create a regular conversation and awareness about what AI is, what it can be, and all the things we need to do to achieve the results that best suit us.
We have seen and understood this in the technologies used today.
We use smartphones, digital assistants and automatic vacuum cleaners.
Are they evil?
Maybe sometimes.
Are they beneficial?
Yes, so are they.
They are not identical.
You have seen the light of the future there.
The future will continue to start with what we build and create now.
We initiated the domino effect, which opened the evolutionary channel of artificial intelligence
In our time, artificial intelligence has shaped tomorrow.
So that we can immerse ourselves in augmented reality technology and revive the world of the past,
When people have difficulties in communicating, technology helps them share their experiences.
Technology based on online visual media can be used in self-driving cars.
Technology, which produces language based on the understanding of images, can evolve into technology to assist the visually impaired and help them better own the visual world.
We also see how technology can cause some problems.
Today, we have technology to analyze the physical characteristics of our birth - such as the color of our skin or the expression on our face - to determine whether we are criminals or terrorists.
We have the technology to process data, processing data on gender or race to determine whether we can get loans.
Everything we see now is just a snapshot of the evolution of artificial intelligence.
Because where we are now is an evolving moment.
This means that what we do now will affect the future development of things and extend to the future world.
If we want artificial intelligence to help human ways evolve, we need to define strategies and goals to open that path immediately.
What I want to see is the development direction of culture and environment suitable for human beings.
Technology can help us cure patients with neurological diseases or other disabilities, making them as challenging as everyone.
The operation of technology does not take into account your characteristics or skin color.
What I focus on today is the technology of tomorrow and ten years from now.
AI can emerge in many different ways.
But in this case, it is not an unmanned vehicle without any destination.
This is a car that we can control at the same time.
We choose when to accelerate and when to decelerate.
We choose whether we need to turn.
We choose what AI will look like in the future.
There will be a vast arena, allowing artificial intelligence to become everything.
It will become many different things.
It is now up to us to figure out what needs to be implemented to ensure that AI results are better for all humans.
Thank you.

Black land "planted" for agricultural modernization - Xinhua
Harbin, July 26, Xinhua News Agency (Xinhua)
In the middle of summer, two spraying planes passed the 10,000-acre high-yield demonstration field at the Second Operation Station of the Fifth Management Area of Friendship Farm, forming two white lines. The big words "the first field in the world" planted with black rice seedlings in the green field stood out.
Kong Lingqiang, the station director of the operation station, said that this kind of aircraft can spray medicine on more than 6,000 acres of cultivated land a day, which is about eight times more efficient than drones and hundreds of times more efficient than artificial ones.
This farm is located in the territory of Friendship County, Heilongjiang Province, the largest grain-producing province in China. From the sound of "rice cutting" in the past to the sound of "rumbling" today, Chinese traditional farming and farms have transformed in this black soil belt.
In addition to airplanes, satellites are also used in the modern agricultural production of Friendship Farm.
Kong Lingqiang introduced that, on the one hand, they use satellite remote sensing technology to accurately apply fertilizer, reduce agricultural input and reduce pollution; on the other hand, satellite navigation technology can improve the standardized operation level of agricultural machinery in the field.
In the course of rice production this year, the farm expanded the operating area of satellite navigation unmanned transplanting technology from 3,000 mu last year to 30,000 mu.
This technology can make seedlings more evenly planted, maximize the use of sunlight and cultivated land resources, and save 16 yuan per acre of labor cost.
Farms have tried new technologies such as informatization and intelligence in agricultural production, forming the largest group of agricultural machinery in China from the ground to the sky.
According to statistics, the total holdings of farm machinery are 49,000 units (pieces), and the comprehensive mechanization rate in the field has reached 99.8%.
The operation of agricultural machinery will achieve 100% GPS satellite navigation, 100% precision seeding in dry fields and 100% high-power locomotive operation in dry fields.
"Green agriculture, smart agriculture and digital agriculture are the directions of agricultural modernization."
said Liu Hualian, director of Friendship Farm.
The key to agricultural modernization lies in scientific and technological progress.
Agricultural reclamation in Heilongjiang, represented by farms, has played a demonstration and leading role in modern large-scale agriculture "aircraft carrier" in recent years, and has initially established a modern agricultural industry system dominated by large-scale cultivation, standardized production and industrial management.
On the outskirts of Friendship County, there is an agricultural machinery exhibition park covering an area of 350,000 square meters.
More than 140 sets (pieces) of agricultural machinery and tools introduced and used in Heilongjiang agricultural reclamation over the years are centrally displayed here.
These agricultural tools and farms have witnessed the development of China's agricultural modernization.
Xie Xiaojia for everyone -- Hefei, Anhui Province, Jiangkou River Union people of all ethnic groups transfer direct attack - Xinhua
Hefei, Xinhua News Agency, July 26, Question: Xie Xiaojia for everyone -- People from all ethnic groups in Jiangkou River Union, Hefei, Anhui Province
Xinhua News Agency reporters Chen Shangying, Wang Liwu and Liu Xia Village
At 4 o'clock in the afternoon of July 25, Fu Kunbao, wearing rubber shoes covered with mud, went from the front room to the back room, and his wife Zhou Yan were busy picking up things.
"After receiving the call from the village cadres asking for the transfer, I was still picking grass in the field."
Fu Kunbao said that he had transferred more than 60 acres of land and planted rice. At present, the growth rate is good. "Yesterday, he also took medicine and didn't clean up the tools or anything."
Fu Kunbao pointed to the pesticide sprayer placed in the corner. "No one wants his home to be flooded. Leave his home for everyone."
In order to cope with the continuous high water level pressure of Chaohu Lake and the possible heavy rainfall, Hefei City, Anhui Province, is ready to open the Jiangkou River Union River to store water on the 26th.
Jiangkou River Union is located in Faixi County, next to the Chaohu embankment.
Thousands of villagers involved in Yan Dian Township and Sanhe Town need to be transferred.
As of 16: 00 on the 25th, the water level of Chaohu Lake, the fifth largest freshwater lake in China, remained at a high level of 13.2 meters, exceeding the guaranteed water level by 0.7 meters.
Fu Kun Bao's kitchen is clean and clean. There is a basin of pumpkin dishes on the table, eggs and some brine in the fridge.
"I didn't expect to move. The water in Jiangkou River looks good now."
Zhou Yan said that the home is a bungalow, and some big objects have not yet thought about where to put them.
"Pack up the valuable items first. Large items such as refrigerators and TV sets can be placed in the homes of neighbors or relatives on high ground for the time being."
Wang Lizhong, a village cadre, advised Fu Kun Bao.
Wang Lijing was responsible for the transfer and resettlement of 13 villagers, and one family notified each other to confirm the resettlement plan for each.
The nearest settlement to Fu Kun Bao's home is Su Xiaoxue, Yan Dian Township, about 2 kilometers away.
In addition to large items, Fu Kunbao and his family also had more than 1,000 kilos of grain and some newly bought furniture.
"The grain is ready to be dragged to the house of relatives, and the furniture cannot be moved."
After discussion, the husband and wife put a stool under the newly bought bed and raised the bed by about half a meter.
At 6 o'clock in the afternoon, Fu Kunbao began to use a tricycle to transport things to his relatives' home. Zhou Yan continued to clean up at home.
After 11 o'clock in the evening, the husband and wife looked at the front and back of the house, pulled up the switch and prepared to go to the resettlement site.
"I hope the water will recede soon."
Fu Kunbao said.
At 9: 30 a.m. on July 26, the reporter saw at the scene of Jiangkou River Union that the local people had made all the preparations before the flood separation.
Zhang Jilin formed a team to support young people with muscle - Xinhua
The sports youth hot-blooded competitive show "Sports Bar Youth" officially landed on Hunan TV on July 11.
Zhang Jigke, the sports leader, and Lin Xiaojia, the sports assistant, were on the same stage. Lindane and Fu Yuanhui commented on their respective styles, while the hard core of the "giant" power pull device made the program "burn".
In the first episode, 11 sports teenagers appeared on the power track. While the appearance of the audience was amazing, the "strong conflict", "strong confrontation" and "strong heart" on the competitive platform also received attention.
Among them, the "strong conflict" came from Qiao Wenyi, a Super A sports student. Before the race, he openly provoked Xu Zhibin, who was known as the "beautiful man" on the same track, choked that Xu Zhibin's physical condition should go to the singing and dancing program, and even released the cruel words "Don't cry when you lose."
Some remarks made the youth and sports leaders on the court take a breath of coolness.
The "strong confrontation" is more like an immortal fight. Sun Jian Qi, known as the "Great Magic King", met Zhang Xindong, who is also strong, and staged a strong confrontation.
Their identities are also unexpected. Sun Jianqi is a fitness-loving actor, while Zhang Xindong is a retired special operations player and a three-time winner of the Warrior Medal.
At the beginning of the game, the two teenagers tried their best to pull out the small stick quickly. The lasting confrontation on the big stick made the audience sweat for them.
Under the tense competition situation, Zhang Jigke, as one of the sports leaders of Sports Bar Youth, also watched the game carefully.
In the comment session, he was also very careful and patiently encouraged the youth of the losing side to help every mistake in the process of replay.
Lin Xiaoyu, a sports assistant, is a fancy assist. She makes no secret of her appreciation for the young people with face value and strength online.
When learning about the overloaded daily training of sports teenagers, they are even more admired.
Lindane and Fu Yuanhui, who are also sports leaders, have their own styles. One is a calm "prophet" and the other is a "flood girl" who dispels the tension with a smile.
In addition, Jike Yuanyi and Liu Ye, as sports assistants, also created a lot of laughing topics around sports teenagers.
Church fire in Nantes, France: Parish volunteers admit to setting fire to the church.
CNS, July 26: According to foreign media reports, on July 18, the famous St. Peter and St. Paul's Cathedral, a treasure of religious historical buildings in Nantes, France, was severely damaged in a fire, and the organ was completely destroyed.
On the 26th local time, the prosecutor of Nantes announced that a parish volunteer who was in charge of guarding the cathedral had been charged with "arson and destruction."
He has admitted that he started the fire in the church.
According to the report, local prosecutor Senas said that the 39-year-old parish volunteer from Rwanda admitted that he set fire to three places in the cathedral at night.
The man's lawyer said that the arsonist regretted doing such a thing.
This man entered France several years ago through the way of asylum. He was sheltered in the parish where the fire occurred and taken in the church.
The prosecution pointed out that recently, he tried to renew his visa and was talking with the police.
However, the church said it still couldn't believe that the believer, who was usually very kind and smiling but didn't speak much, would destroy the church he loved so much.
On the day of the fire on July 18, the volunteer was questioned and investigated by the police because of the illogical problems in the narrative, but he was later released.
The picture shows firefighters at the scene.
On the evening of the 25th, he was summoned again because the professional engineer of the laboratory of the Paris Central Police Department obtained new evidence.
This time, the man admitted his act of arson.
It is reported that if convicted of intentional arson and destruction, the suspect may face 10 years' imprisonment and a fine of 150,000 euros.
It is reported that the fire caused serious damage to St. Pierre and St. Paul's Cathedral. The organ in the church was completely destroyed and the stained glass windows behind the organ were also seriously damaged.
According to Brunet, the chief architect of the French historic preservation building, it is conservatively estimated that the restoration of Nantes Cathedral will take at least three years.
Comprehensive news: US unilateralism undermines bilateral relations International public opinion supports China's countermeasures against the US - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26, Xinhua News Agency, foreign correspondent: On the morning of July 24, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the US Embassy in China that China had decided to revoke the establishment and operation license of the US Consulate General in Chengdu and put forward specific requirements for the Consulate General to stop all business and activities.
International public opinion believes that the unilateral measures taken by the United States have caused serious distress to China-US relations. It is legitimate and necessary for China to respond to the unreasonable provocations of the United States and take countermeasures.
Andrés Bolquez, director of the Center for China Studies of the Institute of International Studies of the University of Chile, said that the unilateral measures of the United States have destroyed the bridge of understanding between the Chinese and American peoples and put the relationship between the two major powers in crisis.
China's notification to the United States to close its Consulate General in Chengdu is a countermeasure to the unilateral measures taken by the United States and is in line with diplomatic practice.
Patricio Giusto, a professor at the Catholic University of Argentina and director of the Argentina-China Research Center, believes that China's above-mentioned decision is a legitimate and necessary countermeasure to the previous provocations of the United States and is not aimed at ordinary Americans.
The United States is trying to divert the attention of the American public by pressuring China to cover up its weak response to the new crown epidemic.
Bambang Sulyono, chairman of the Asian Innovation Research Center, an Indonesian think tank, said that the provocative diplomatic posture taken by the United States has caused serious distress to China-US relations and the bilateral relations are facing serious challenges.
China's notification to the United States to close its Consulate General in Chengdu is a normal countermeasure, in line with diplomatic practice, and reflects not only China's principled position of firmly safeguarding its own interests, but also the rational and beneficial nature of China's diplomacy.
Tanzania commentator Francis Semwinza said that China's above-mentioned decision is a legitimate and necessary response to the US provocation.
The US should take the initiative to improve its relations with China and stop interfering in China's internal affairs.
The United States should focus on how to achieve economic and political win-win results with China and how to benefit the two peoples and the international community as a whole.
Ali Youssef, executive director of the Sudan-based Federation of Arab-Chinese Friendship Associations, said that the countermeasures forced by China were a legitimate and necessary response to the unreasonable actions of the United States, in line with international law and the basic norms governing international relations, as well as with diplomatic practices.
Previously, the US requested the closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, which seriously violated international law and the basic norms governing international relations.
It is hoped that the US side will revoke the previous relevant decisions and create the necessary conditions for the return of bilateral relations to normal.
Singapore's Lianhe Zaobao published an editorial saying that the larger strategic intention of the United States is to encircle China and prevent its continued rise.
Facing the pressure of the United States, China is very reluctant to see the deterioration of China-US relations, but has to take countermeasures.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 26 (reporter Mao Xin) The reporter learned from the Guangdong Maritime Police Bureau that recently, the bureau, in conjunction with the Guangzhou Customs and public security departments, cracked down a super-large refined oil smuggling gang. It was preliminarily verified that the gang had smuggled about 120,000 tons of refined oil since 2019, with a case value of about 800 million yuan and tax evasion of about 240 million yuan.
The Guangdong Maritime Police Bureau and the anti-smuggling department of the Customs have jointly and gradually mapped out the division of personnel and organizational structure of the gang.
On July 8, the maritime police, customs and public security departments carried out a unified net collection operation in Guangzhou, Foshan and other places, as well as in the waters of the Pearl River Estuary. Four vessels suspected of smuggling were seized on the spot, a total of 4,700 tons of refined oil were seized from the vessels involved and the oil depot respectively, and a number of fund accounts were frozen.
It is understood that a total of eight ships and two helicopters were deployed in the joint operation, which was divided into multiple action groups to carry out a chain-wide attack on smuggling at sea and illegal operations on land, and all 35 major criminal suspects were brought to the case.
The case is currently under further investigation.
The relevant person in charge of the Guangdong Maritime Police Bureau said that it would continue to maintain a high-pressure posture in the future, crack down on all kinds of illegal and criminal smuggling activities at sea and maintain good order in the maritime areas under its jurisdiction.
Hurricane "Hanna" landed in the U.S. or caused river surge and flash floods.
On July 26, China News Service (CNS) reported that at 5: 00 p.m. local time on July 25, Hurricane "Hannah" landed in Texas, bringing strong winds, torrential rain, river surge and possibly life-threatening flash floods to Texas.
The National Hurricane Center said that Hurricane Hanna is expected to carry heavy rainfall across parts of southern and northeastern Texas, which may cause some streams to soar and life-threatening flash floods.
According to the report, the area most seriously affected by Hurricane Hanna is from the south of Corpus Christi to the mouth of the Rio Grande River, while widespread flash floods may erupt in the Rio Grande Valley.
Texas Governor Abbott said on the 25th: "Any hurricane is a huge challenge."
Thirty-two counties in the state declared a disaster emergency due to the hurricane.
Corpus Christi, a city with a population of more than 320,000, has closed its libraries and museums, and residents are waiting.
Abbott also said that at a time when Texas is being hit hard by a new pandemic, the hurricane cannot be allowed to bring more casualties to Texas.
It is reported that the precipitation in southern Texas is expected to reach 6 to 12 inches in the night of the 26th, and 3 to 5 inches in northern Texas and coastal areas of Louisiana.
Due to the influence of global warming and other factors, Hanna formed earlier than the previous Atlantic hurricane seasons.
In general, the first hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean usually does not form until mid-August.
Poland to withdraw from European treaty to prevent violence against women
The Polish Ministry of Justice said Saturday that Poland will take steps to withdraw from the European Treaty on the Prevention of Violence against Women next week.
Poland's right-wing government cabinet said the treaty required schools to teach students about gender issues, trampling on the rights of students' parents.
Polish Justice Minister Giobro said at a press conference that his Ministry of Justice will submit a request to the Ministry of Labour and Family to begin withdrawing from the treaty on Monday.
That treaty is also known as the Istanbul Convention.
Gioblo said, "The treaty contains some elements of a morphological nature that we consider harmful."
Poland's ruling Law and Justice Party and its governing coalition partners have a close alliance with the Roman Catholic Church and advocate a conservative social agenda.
Polish President Duda made hostility to gay rights one of the main issues during his successful re-election campaign this month.
On Friday, thousands of Poles (mostly women) protested against the withdrawal from the convention in Warsaw and other cities.
Lempat, one of the protest organizers, said at the protest march in Warsaw that "the purpose of withdrawing from the treaty is to legalize domestic violence."
Some protesters carried banners that read "PiS is a hell for women."
PiS has long complained about the Istanbul Convention.
Poland's previous centrist government ratified the convention in 2015.
The PiS government said the treaty did not respect religion and required liberal social policies to be taught in schools.
So far, however, the party has not decided to withdraw from the convention.

Brazilian President's New Crown Virus Test Results Turned Yin - Xinhua
Brasília, Xinhua News Agency, July 25 (Reporter Zhou Xingchu) Brazilian President Bosonaro announced on his personal social media account on July 25 that his latest test result for the new crown virus was negative.
In addition to publishing the latest test results, Bosonaro also posted photos of himself holding a hydroxychloroquine medicine box on social media.
Bosonaro has always insisted that this drug can effectively treat new crown virus infection and has repeatedly shown himself taking it live on social media.
According to Brazilian media reports, after announcing the virus test results on the same day, Bosonaro drove a motorcycle to various parts of the capital, Brasilia, and met with a member of the National Assembly.
Previously, Bosonaro had been working in isolation at the presidential residence.
On the 7th of this month, Bosonaro announced in the joint live broadcast of several local media that he had tested positive for the new crown virus on the 6th, and two more tests on the 14th and 21st, both of which were positive.
Jiangxi opens a "green channel" for anti-flood front-line youth to enlist - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, July 26 (Guo Dongming, Xiong Liang) The Recruitment Office of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government has recently made it clear that priority will be given to the recruitment of individuals or their children who have performed outstanding in the flood rescue and disaster relief mission who meet the requirements for recruitment and have passed both the medical examination and the political examination.
"After the young recruits are registered, we will give priority to the recruitment after verification by the community where the young recruits live, the street armed forces department and the Liuyang District Recruitment Office."
Wang Hui, vice minister of the Ministry of People's Armed Forces of Youyang District, Jiujiang City, said that due to the flood, they had concentrated three days to organize the medical examination of young candidates from the 25th.
Zhou Jingfan, a young recruit in Youyang District, Jiujiang City, is a 22-year-old college graduate. His mother is a community worker and his father is a veteran of an Air Force department. For more than 10 days, Zhou Jingfan's parents have been on duty on the front line of flood prevention and control.
"These days, seeing in the news that the people's soldiers are desperately defending their hometown on the anti-flood front, I also want to be like them."
Zhou Jingfan said that he had a dream of joining the army since he was a child, and the anti-flood campaign strengthened his determination to join the military camp.
Jiujiang City also takes flood prevention and rescue as a "living teaching material" for recruitment propaganda. Taking the community as a unit, they call on young conscripts to volunteer to take part in tasks such as patrolling and checking embankments and on duty, to understand the nature and purpose of the people's army and to strengthen their confidence in joining the army and reporting to the country.
Luo Jiuyu, Political Commissar of the Ministry of People's Armed Forces, Youyang District, Jiujiang City, said that by giving priority to the recruitment of soldiers, he hoped to encourage more young recruits and create a good social atmosphere in which it was glorious to take part in the task and join the army.
According to the Vietnam News Agency, Grivori believes that Vietnam has made great contributions to the development of ASEAN in the past 25 years.
Vietnam is not only a responsible member of ASEAN, but also its locomotive.
Grivori said that Russia and even the Asia-Europe Economic Union believe that Vietnam contributes to ASEAN to improve its status and promote its image abroad.
He stressed, "ASEAN should therefore thank Vietnam."
Grivori said that analysts recognized Vietnam's peace initiative.
Vietnam is willing to share its experience with ASEAN countries and propose constructive and peaceful measures to the problems facing the Asia-Pacific region, including the East China Sea issue.
Regarding the cooperation between Vietnam and Russia under the ASEAN framework, Grivori believes that Vietnam supports the cooperative relationship between Russia and ASEAN and helps Russia gain benefits under this cooperation framework.
The Asia-Europe Economic Union, including Russia, can enter the ASEAN market after signing a free trade agreement with Vietnam.
Grivori suggested maximizing the free trade area between the Asia-Europe Economic Union and ASEAN countries, thus creating a platform for economic and security stability.
Grivori also believed that Russia, Vietnam and ASEAN were on the right track and would achieve their goals.
From now until the end of 2020, Beijiang Province will have the necessary conditions, especially in terms of infrastructure, human resources and land, in order to actively welcome the inflow of foreign capital, especially multinational groups with value chains and the transfer of advanced technologies.
In addition, Beijiang Province will handle the proposal submitted to the Prime Minister of the government to decide on the investment of infrastructure construction and management projects in the industrial zones of Vietnam and South Korea and approve the document that will add the two industrial-city-service areas of Anshan-Beilong and Anong to the general plan for the development of industrial zones in Vietnam by 2020.
At the same time, Beijiang Province has made great efforts to speed up the progress of various projects, especially infrastructure construction and operation projects in industrial park clusters such as Hefu, Gwangju and Shuangxi-Nehuang, to form a land fund for attracting investment.
In 2020, Beijiang Provincial Bureau of Industry and Trade will make suggestions and suggestions on the planning of industrial zones and industrial clusters to be incorporated into the provincial plan.
Beijiang Province has decided to combine the development of industrial park clusters with ensuring national defense security, protecting the ecological environment and ensuring food security, thereby promoting the balanced development of industry; it has comprehensive infrastructure such as electricity, water supply, transportation and telecommunications, and is integrated with urban construction, trade services, workers' housing, health care, education and other social infrastructure.
In the industrial area, Beijiang Province strongly calls for investment projects in high-tech and clean technologies in power, electronics, telecommunications equipment, precision machinery, auxiliary industry and other fields.
In industrial park clusters, the province calls for small and medium-sized investment projects in production and the use of local labor, especially in agricultural products and food processing.
In the future, Beijiang Province will focus on accelerating the investment in the infrastructure of Beijiang Logistics Center and synchronize with the development of industrial park clusters in order to optimize the circulation of goods and money, help reduce production costs, improve the value of goods, optimize the supply chain and develop multimodal transport, thus creating an attraction for investors to invest in the province.
An upgraded version of the Russian helicopter gunship card-52M went out for the first time at the end of the year.
MOSCOW, July 25, 2020 / PRNewswire / -- According to the plan of the Russian Ministry of Defense, the upgraded version of the Russian helicopter gunship (hereinafter referred to as Wushi) Ka-52, the Ka-52M, will be renovated and replaced for the first time in December this year, and the aircraft will be greatly improved in reconnaissance, communications and weapons performance.
According to a recent report by the Russian News, the development contract of the Wuzhika-52M, named "Super Alligator," was signed by the Russian military and military industrial units in April last year. At present, the first two upgraded Wuzhika-52M are undergoing renovation and replacement at the Far East Helicopter Manufacturing Plant of the Russian "Progress" Aerospace Corporation, and its national testing and improvement will be completed by October 2022.
According to the Russian experts familiar with the above-mentioned upgrade work, the "predecessor" of the "super alligator", the Wuzhika-52, was officially installed in November 2011. The model revealed some weaknesses in its use. The purpose of the upgrade is to "fill the shortboard".
It is reported that compared with the Ka-52, the Ka-52M will partially adopt new protective materials that do not increase weight, and its pilot cockpit will be strengthened and equipped with new equipment to resist missile attacks, thus increasing the probability of battlefield survival; it will be equipped with more powerful generators to power more complex airborne electronic equipment; its photoelectric system will be upgraded to be able to detect and identify more distant battlefield targets; the new light multi-purpose missile equipped with mainly attacking armoured combat vehicles and reinforced concrete fortifications will have a range of up to 20 kilometers, about twice the range of similar missiles used in active service in Russia; and its defense weapons and communication equipment will be used to the maximum extent with the Mi-28NM helicopter gunship that can attack air targets, thus making related maintenance simple and economical.
In addition, Ka-52M will have more advanced electronic guidance system, weapon aiming system and navigation equipment.
Russian experts also said that it is worth noting that the Ka-52M will be equipped with communication equipment to communicate with UAVs, so as to obtain information transmitted by nearby UAVs in the air in real time, such as displaying images taken by UAVs on the cockpit screen of the helicopter.
According to the plan, the pilot of Ka-52M can directly control the drone with which he works, thus improving the pilot's mastery of the battlefield situation and guidance of long-range missiles.
According to Russian media reports, Russian Deputy Defense Minister Krivoruchko said in December last year that the Russian Defense Ministry planned to purchase more than 110 Wushu-52Ms by 2027.
The new decree stipulates that Campania must wear masks in indoor public places from now on, and violators can be fined up to 1,000 euros.
On June 1, local time, the Colosseum reopened in Rome, the capital of Italy.
It is reported that according to the latest anti-epidemic decree issued by the regional government, people in Campania must wear masks in accordance with the anti-epidemic requirements when travelling on all public transport and entering and leaving indoor public places such as shops, bars, supermarkets and exhibition halls.
Violation of this regulation is punishable by a maximum fine of 1000 euros.
The decree also stipulates that all passengers from non-Schengen countries entering the Campania region must be segregated.
The regional government will authorize health institutions to coordinate the arrangement of specific hotels to isolate positive and asymptomatic people.
The decree came into force on July 25.
In less than an hour, three customers who entered the supermarket have accepted the fine.
Hebei has replenished 1.75 billion cubic meters of river and lake ecological water since this year.
Xinhua News Agency Shijiazhuang, July 26 (Reporter Wang Kun) The reporter learned from the Hebei Water Conservancy Department that since this year, Hebei Province has implemented ecological water recharge to 28 rivers, including Hutuo River, Tanghe River, Xiangma River and Baiyangdian, making overall use of the water from the diversion river and local reservoirs, with a total of 1.75 billion cubic meters of ecological water recharge completed.
Hebei Province has grasped the favorable opportunity of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project to increase the flow of water and carried out ecological water recharge to rivers such as Tanghe, Shahe and Xuelong River.
At the same time, nine large and medium-sized reservoirs such as the Western Ocean, Dongwu Shi and Baiyangdian have been used to carry out ecological water recharge to rivers such as Liuyang River and Qinglong River, with a cumulative surface area of more than 90 square kilometers.
In order to do a good job in ecological water recharge, the Hebei Water Conservancy Department actively organizes and carries out the investigation of hidden dangers of recharge rivers, remediation and strengthening, and river cleaning, refines practical measures, and strengthens inspection and pipe protection.
Through supervision and inspection and centralized unannounced visits, various problems were solved in time to ensure the safety and order of river recharge.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Hebei Water Conservancy Department, the orderly implementation of river and lake ecological water recharge has effectively restored the river and lake ecological environment in Hebei Province, promoted the recharge and conservation of coastal groundwater, greatly improved the human settlements and economic development environment along the route, and is of great significance to the realization of the river and lake management and protection goal of "clear water, green shore, smooth river and beautiful scenery."
You should all know the facts I want to tell.
I believe that the intuition that inequality can lead to social fragmentation and corruption existed before the French Revolution.
The difference is that we can now find evidence that we can understand the impact of inequality by comparing societies with societies with different degrees of equality.
I will show you some data and explain why they are indeed relevant.
But first of all, let's see how hard our lives are.
(Laughter) I want to start my speech with a contradiction.
This chart shows the relationship between our average life expectancy and gross national income, which measures the average affluence of a country.
You can look at the countries on the right, such as Norway and the United States, which are twice as rich as those on the left, such as Israel, Greece and Portugal.
But this has not affected their average life expectancy.
There is no correlation.
But if we look within societies, we can find that there are great differences in health conditions within them.
The picture still shows the average life expectancy.
These are small towns in England and Wales - the poorest on the right and the richest on the left.
There are great differences between the poor and others.
Even those just below the top have worse health than those at the top.
Therefore, income means very much in our society, but the comparison between different societies is meaningless.
The contradictory explanation is that in our society, we look at relative income or social status and identity - that is, the relationship between us and the gap between people.
Once you have that idea, you should immediately think: what happens if the gap widens? What happens if the gap is narrowed? What happens if the income gap widens or decreases?
This is what I will tell you immediately.
I did not use any hypothetical data.
My data from the United Nations - like those from the World Bank - is about the income gap between these rich, developed-market democracies.
The method we use, which is easy to understand and you can download, is to compare the income gap between the top 20% and the bottom 20% of each country.
You can see that the countries on the left are relatively equal - Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden - and their top 20% are about 3.5 to 4 times richer than the bottom 20%.
But on the other side of inequality - the United Kingdom, Portugal, the United States, and Singapore - the income gap is twice as large.
By comparison, our country (the UK) is twice as unequal as some other equally successful democratic markets.
Next, I will show how this affects our society.
We have collected data on problems arising from differences within society, which are more common at the bottom of society.
Internationally comparable data include life expectancy, children's performance in mathematics and language, infant mortality, suicide rate, prison population, teenage pregnancy rate, mutual trust, obesity, mental illness - all of which meet the standard diagnostic classification, including drug and alcohol addiction - and social mobility.
We put all these into one coefficient.
They are all weighted equally.
A country's score is averaged by these factors.
You can see that these scores are related to the inequality comparison I have just shown, and I will show these data over and over again.
The more unequal the country, the worse it will perform on various social issues.
The correlation is very strong.
But if you compare the same health and social problems with the indices of per capita national income and gross national income, you will find nothing and no correlation.
We are a little worried that people may think that we choose specific problems to cater to our theories and then artificially create evidence, so we also published a paper on the UNICEF Child Welfare Index in the British Medical Journal.
It contains 40 different parts from the summary of others.
It includes whether children can talk to their parents, whether books are available at home, what is the immunization rate, and whether there is bullying in schools.
All are included.
This is how the index relates to the same level of inequality.
The more unequal the society, the worse the performance of children.
The relationship is remarkable.
But once again, if you look at the relationship between child welfare and per capita national income, you will achieve nothing. There is no sign of correlation.
All the data I present to you reveal the same thing.
The average welfare of our society no longer depends on national income and economic growth.
They are very important in poorer countries, but not in rich developed countries.
And our differences and our position relative to others now seem very important.
Below I will show you some divisions of our index.
This is the mutual trust index.
It refers to the proportion of people who agree that most people are credible.
This is data from the World Values Survey.
It can be seen that on the less equal side, about 15% of people feel they can trust others.
But in more egalitarian societies, the proportion rises to 60% or 65%.
When looking at community participation or the assessment of social capital, there is a very similar correlation with inequality.
I would say that we repeated this work twice.
The first was aimed at these rich developed countries, and we later changed the test subjects and repeated the test to 50 US states - investigating the same question: Do the more unequal the states do worse in all these assessments?
This is the relationship between mutual trust and inequality drawn by the federal government in a general social survey.
Very similar scatterpoints are distributed in a similar range of trust.
The same thing continues.
Basically, we found that almost all the factors related to mutual trust reflected in the international survey were also reflected in the 50 states we surveyed respectively.
This is no coincidence.
This picture is mental illness.
The World Health Organization uses the same diagnostic interview method to collect data through random sampling so that we can compare the rate of mental illness in each society.
This is the proportion of the population with any kind of mental illness in the previous year.
It ranges from 8% to more than 24% - indicating that the proportion of society as a whole suffering from mental illness is three times that of other societies.
Similarly, these are closely linked to inequality.
The picture shows the crime rate.
The red dot indicates the states of the United States and the blue triangle indicates the provinces of Canada.
But look at their quantity differences.
The murder rate ranged from 15 to 150 per million.
This is the ratio of prison inmates.
This is a 10-fold gap, which will be amplified by the exponential function.
However, the number of prisoners varies from 40 to 400.
Crime is not the main reason for this relationship.
In some places, crime can explain some of the reasons.
But there are more severe trials, or harsher trials.
The more unequal the society, the more inclined it is to retain the death penalty.
This picture shows children dropping out of high school.
Again, the gap is wide.
If we discuss the selection of social talents, we will find that the harm of this gap is very serious.
This picture shows the social mobility rate.
It is actually based on the current rate of income.
Basically, what it asks is: do rich fathers have rich children and poor fathers have poor children, or is there no relationship between the two?
On the more unequal side, the father's income is more important - for example, Britain and the United States.
In northern Europe, Dad's income is less important.
There is more social class mobility there.
As we often say - and I know there are many American listeners here - if Americans want to realize their "American Dream," they should go to Denmark.
(Laughter) (Applause) What I have shown is marked here in italics.
I can also show some other problems.
Those problems are more prevalent at the bottom of the social gradient.
But there are endless problems with social gradients, which are worse in unequal countries - not just a little worse, but twice as bad as everything.
Think of the cost, the cost of manpower.
I would like to return to the picture previously shown. We combine all of them to illustrate two points.
First, through one chart after another, we find that the countries that perform poorly, no matter what, seem to be the more unequal countries, but those that do well seem to be Northern Europe and Japan.
So what we see is the relationship between general social disorder and inequality.
Not just one or two things went wrong, but almost everything.
Another important point I would like to point out on this picture is that if you look at the bottom, Switzerland and Japan, they show that they are very different countries in all respects.
The status of women and their adherence to small families are at two extremes in rich and developed countries.
But another important difference is how they achieve greater equality.
Sweden has great differences in income, but it uses taxes, state benefits, generous relief, and so on to close the gap.
Japan is quite different.
First, the pre-tax wage gap in Japan is relatively small.
It has lower taxes.
It also has fewer benefits.
In the study of American states, we found a sharp contrast.
Some states do well through redistribution, while others do well because of the small pre-tax income gap.
Therefore, we conclude that it is not important how to achieve greater equality, but that it is important to achieve such equality.
I am not talking about total equality. What I am talking about does exist in rich developed market democracies.
Another unexpected thing about this graph is that it is not just the poor who will be affected by inequality.
John Donne (English poet) said something reasonable: "No man is an island."
Through a series of studies, we can compare the behavior of people of every social class in different countries with more or less equal degree.
This is just one example.
The picture shows the infant mortality rate.
According to the UK's general socio-economic classification records, some Swedes have very kindly classified many infant deaths.
This is an anachronistic classification based on the position of father, so single mothers form their own set of data.
But we look at the so-called "lower social class," which is unskilled manual work.
In the middle is manual work that requires skills, from high-level non-manual work to professional work - doctors, lawyers, managers of large companies.
It can be seen here that Sweden has done better than Britain and has done better in every social class.
The biggest differences are at the bottom of society.
But even at the top, living in a more egalitarian society has some advantages.
We presented five different sets of data, including educational outcomes and health status in the United States and internationally.
It seems that, on the whole, more equal societies show the most obvious differences at the bottom of society, but they also have some advantages at the top.
I should explain what happened.
I think I am showing and discussing the impact of inequality on social psychology.
It is more concerned about the sense of superiority and inferiority, being valued and looked down upon, respected and belittled.
Of course, the feelings generated by the competition for identity and status have promoted the progress of social consumerism.
But it also leads to insecurity of status.
We are more worried about how others judge and view us, whether we appear attractive, intelligent, or such.
Social value evaluation reinforces the fear of these social value evaluations.
Interestingly, some similar work is also being carried out in the field of social psychology: some people consulted 208 different studies; in the study, volunteers were invited to a psychological experimental center and then tested their stress Holmont and their reactions when performing stress tasks.
In this observation, scientists are interested in which type of stress can best improve the level of cortisol, the most important stress in the body.
The result is precisely those tasks that include social evaluation threats - tasks that threaten self-esteem and social status - in which others can negatively evaluate your performance.
These stresses have very special effects on stress physiology.
At present, we have accepted the criticism.
Of course, some people don't like this, others find it very unexpected.
However, I should tell you that when people criticize us for picking data, we have never done so.
We have an unconditional rule that if our data sources contain data from the countries we observe, we will include it in the analysis.
Our data sources determine whether the data is valid, not us.
Otherwise, there will be deviation.
What about other countries?
Of the academic peer-reviewed journals, 200 studies focused on the relationship between health and income and equality.
This is not limited to these countries here, but hides a very simple proof.
The same countries have the same measurement methods of inequality, one by one.
Why don't we control other factors?
I have shown that per capita national income does not have any impact.
Of course, others have applied more complex methods in the literature to exclude poverty, education and other factors in the experiment.
What about causality?
Correlation alone does not prove the causal connection.
It took us quite some time.
Indeed, the causal links between these outcomes are well understood.
The biggest change in our understanding of the drivers of long-term health in rich and developed countries is how important long-term social stress is to immunity and the cardiovascular system.
Or, for example, the reason why violence is becoming more common in more unequal countries is because people are very sensitive to being looked down upon.
I would say that in order to solve this problem, we should solve a series of problems after and before tax.
We should limit income and curb the bonus income culture at the top.
I think we must do our best to hold our leaders accountable to their employees.
What I would like to conclude is that we can improve our real quality of life by reducing our income gap.
In this way, we will find that we have suddenly solved the social and mental health problems of the whole society, which is really wonderful.
Thank you.
(Applause)
(Deutsche Welle) In the past two weeks, the number of new cases in Spain has risen sharply, with thousands of new cases in recent days.
On the evening of Saturday (July 25), the British government temporarily decided to remove Spain from the safe travel list from 0: 00 local time on July 26, and people entering the UK from Spain must be isolated for 14 days.
British tourists who were on holiday in Spain expressed surprise, worry and even anger when hearing the decision, because the news came suddenly and caught them by surprise.
It is reported that British Transport Secretary Grant Shapps is also currently on holiday in Spain.
Before the UK issued the quarantine measures, Norway had also announced that people returning to Norway from Spain would be quarantined for 10 days.
France and Belgium advised their residents to abandon their holiday plans in front of Barcelona and surrounding areas.
The beaches in these areas were so crowded that people could not maintain social distance, and the police once needed to take measures to reduce the number of beach tourists.
Tourism is an important pillar industry in Spain
Spain: It is safe here
In response to the UK's decision, Spain's Foreign Ministry said on Sunday that the epidemic was under control.
Spanish Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya stressed to the media: "Spain is safe, not only for Spaniards, but also for tourists."
The Spanish government will try to persuade the British government to exclude the Balearic Islands and Canary Islands from the quarantine measures.
The reason is that the infection rate of these two tourist resorts is much lower than that of mainland Britain.
In order to prevent the spread of the epidemic, the Catalan region of Spain has also relaunched the "ban."
Tourism is an important pillar industry in Spain, which is one of the most popular resorts for British tourists.
Britain's decision is expected to greatly affect Spain's tourism industry.

The first day of mid-voltaic: Beijing leaves the heat and heat to open the rainfall pattern - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 (Reporter Ni Yuanjin) July 26 is the first day of this year's "China Volleyball."
In the early hours of the 26th, strong winds, showers and convective weather dispersed the heat and heat that had enveloped Beijing for days, and a new round of rainfall will last for several days.
The Beijing Meteorological Observatory announced at 11: 00 on the 26th that there were scattered showers (accompanied by weak thunderstorms) in Beijing on the 26th, and the daily maximum temperature was only 27 ℃; there was light to moderate rain (accompanied by weak thunderstorms) at night, and the night minimum temperature was 23 ℃.
In the previous 24 to 25 days, the whole city of Beijing was under the high temperature blue warning. The daily maximum temperature in most areas was about 37 ℃, and the local high temperature exceeded 40 ℃.
Futian is the hottest, humid and sultry day of the year. There are "three volts" in a year, and the hottest is in the middle volts. It is at this time that the Chinese people say "bitter summer."
When entering the house, the family filled the barn. Folk people said "one volt of dumplings and two volts of noodles."
According to the current forecast, it will be cloudy and rainy in Beijing in the next three days.
The meteorological department advised the public to minimize play in mountainous areas and guard against geological disasters.
It is understood that this year's "middle voltaic" will last for 20 days, from July 26 to August 14.
After entering the "middle volt," people will feel weak body and loss of appetite.
In the diet, you can choose foods such as mung beans and coix that have the effect of clearing heat and relieving heat, strengthening spleen and appetizer, as well as bitter foods such as bitter vegetables and bitter gourd, which can help to improve appetite and relieve heat.
The FAA urgently ordered the investigation of 2,000 Boeing airliners - Xinhua News
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an emergency airworthiness directive on the 24th, requiring an emergency inspection of about 2,000 Boeing 737NG and 737Classic airliners registered in the United States, because the corrosion of the air check valve of the above-mentioned airliners may cause the engine to stop in the air.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said that it has received four reports of engine air parking of 737NG and 737Classic airliners so far, so it has made an urgent inspection request. The inspection targets are airliners that have been parked continuously for 7 days or more and airliners that have flown less than 11 times since they were put back into flight.
The Federal Aviation Administration warned that if the Class 5 check valves of both engines of the airliner were corroded, they might jam in the open position, causing the airliner to lose power completely and be unable to restart the engine.
The aviation regulator ordered that once the check valve is found to be corroded, air operators must replace this key component before the airliner is put into use again.
Boeing responded later that day that the outbreak of the new crown caused travel demand to decrease, so many airliners were sealed or used less, "check valves are more susceptible to corrosion."
At the same time, Boeing said it has advised air operators to inspect the airliners involved in the instructions. If problems are found, Boeing will provide assistance in repairing and replacing check valves.
According to the Associated Press, airliners owned by major US airline operators usually fly many times in a day, but after the outbreak of the new crown disease, a large number of airliners stopped flying; with the recent slow growth of passenger travel demand, some airliners have returned to operation.
The Federal Aviation Administration did not release the details of the four air parking reports.
Alaska Airlines disclosed one of the incidents later on the 24th.
The airline operator said in a statement that one of its airliners was on its way from Seattle, Washington to Austin, Texas, on July 15, when one of its engines suddenly stopped, and the airliner finally made an emergency landing at Austin Airport.
Alaska Airlines said it had replaced the engines of the airliner and had inspected the engines of six airliners in accordance with the instructions of the Federal Aviation Administration.
American Airlines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines respectively said on the 24th that their airliners had no engine failure related to the air check valve.
Four airliners of American Airlines will be inspected and 28 airliners of United Airlines will be inspected.
Delta Air Lines said it would inspect its 20 airliners, but did not say whether there had been engine failure.
According to many media reports, the FAA emergency airworthiness directive is another shock to Boeing.
One Boeing 737MAX of Lion Air Indonesia and Ethiopian Airlines crashed in October 2018 and March 2019 respectively, killing a total of 346 people.
The series of airliners were subsequently suspended worldwide, shut down in January this year and resumed production in May.
The head of the Federal Aviation Administration, Steve Dickson, admitted in June that the Federal Aviation Administration had "made a mistake" in regulating Boeing with regard to the 737MAX.
"Ding Dong Online! Good Teacher" goes online next week. Xue Zhaofeng leads the "Knowledge Initiator - Xinhua
There is a new variety of arts online.
The interactive knowledge sharing program "Ding Dong Online! Good Teacher" will be broadcast on Hunan TV from July 20.
It is understood that the program will create a new class for all-age youth, and a group of attractive and talented teachers will come on the stage to challenge the output of interesting knowledge.
Unlike the serious impression of teachers in the public mind in the past, "Ding Dong Online! Good Teacher" brings together a group of intellectual representatives with both face value and talent.
They are not only young intellectual role models from various disciplines, but also a group of all-round "players" who can shake burdens and are good at teaching and having fun.
In the program, this group of outstanding young knowledge role models, as "knowledge sharing officers," will challenge interesting knowledge classes.
They need to show the most interesting aspects of their subject through the attitude of knowledge output to impress the audience present.
All-age audience members of the "Tao Inquiry Group" will ask questions on the spot, making it more difficult for the "knowledge sharing officers" to teach and adding a bit of excitement to the program.
It was revealed that the "knowledge sharing officers" included Li Yongle, a physics teacher at the secondary school attached to Renmin University of China, Zhang Xuefeng, a famous examination and research instructor, and Wang Lei, a history teacher with ten years of professional experience, and other outstanding young teachers. They will show the "hard core" knowledge of various disciplines to the audience in unexpected ways.
In addition, the program also invited Xue Zhaofeng, a professor of economics, as the "knowledge initiator" of the program, and joined Du Haitao and Jin Mengjia, "teaching assistants of Ding Dong," to talk about youth with the audience and create an "open class on youth for all."
Chief Secretary of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region: Serious situation and full efforts to fight the epidemic
Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 26 - Zhang Jianzong, Chief Secretary for Administration of the Hong Kong SAR Government, said on July 26 that the situation of the new crown pneumonia epidemic in Hong Kong continues to be serious. If the epidemic turns bad, the SAR Government will resolutely take stricter control measures to further restrict business premises and reduce the space for citizens to go out.
At this stage, however, the Hong Kong SAR Government has no intention of introducing "home order" or "foot ban order" to restrict citizens from going out.
On the same day, Zhang Jianzong published a blog entitled "Serious situation and full efforts to fight the epidemic."
He said the epidemic was the most severe in half a year, and the next two weeks would be crucial to prevent the virus from spreading further in the community.
In addition to the necessary measures taken by the HKSAR Government, it is also very important for citizens to exercise self-discipline and cooperation.
He urged citizens to stay at home and reduce social contact and eating out.
Members of the public should cooperate with the compulsory measures of wearing masks to protect themselves and others, pay attention to personal and environmental hygiene and wash hands frequently. They should also suspend non-essential gatherings or meals of relatives and friends and reduce them to markets.

"Nutritional Agent" for the History of the Party and New China
2020-07-26 17: 37: 29 Source: People's Tribune website Author: Zhu Yanjing Responsibility Editor: Zhu Yanjing
Recently, when visiting the Siping Campaign Memorial Hall, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed: "The 1.4 billion people and 90 million Party members, especially leading cadres at all levels, should learn the history of the Communist Party of China and the history of the new China well."
A serious study of the history of the Party and the history of the new China is a compulsory course for Party members and cadres not to forget their original intentions and remember their mission. They should draw rich nourishment from it, enrich their national feelings and take the long journey for a new era.
A magnificent history of the Party and the history of New China records the hard work and glorious course of the Communist Party of China since its birth, and shows the faith and loyalty forged by the Communists with their lives and blood, and their original intention and mission to adhere to forever.
History is the best textbook. For Party members and cadres, the history of the Party and the history of New China are the most brilliant chapters in this textbook.
Every Party member and cadre should constantly strengthen the historical thinking of learning from history and moving towards the future, based on the new journey and mission, pick up the "baton" of the times and follow the long journey of the present generation.
Cast the soul of history and adhere to the original mission in studying the history of the Party and the history of the new China.
Opening the history of the Party and the history of the new China is full of the Chinese Communists' immutable original mission and rock-solid faith, demonstrating the simplicity of the Communists and the people.
To understand the important events, important meetings and important figures in the history of the Party and the history of the new China at close range is not only an intuitive shock to the mind and a baptism of thought, but also to read the connotation of the original faith from the depths of the soul and know the weight of the mission.
For Party members and cadres, in order to continue to sharpen the mission of the original heart and maintain the essence of the advanced spirit, we must find the origin and fulcrum of our original heart from the history of the Party and the history of the new China, maintain a clear understanding and firm position, inspire the strength to work hard for the country and the people, and ensure that the red rivers and mountains laid by the revolutionary forefathers with blood and life are passed on from generation to generation.
It is wise to study history and inherit the noble spirit in the study of the history of the Party and the history of the new China.
Since the founding of the Communist Party of China, it has successively shaped a series of great spirits such as the spirit of the Red Boat, the spirit of Jinggangshan, the spirit of the Long March, the spirit of Yan'an, the spirit of the Anti-Japanese War, the spirit of West Berpo, the spirit of "two bullets, one star" and the spirit of space.
These great spirits precipitated by history provide a strong spiritual incentive for our Party to overcome various risks and challenges on the way forward, and are a valuable spiritual wealth that cannot be defeated, lost or taken away.
The process of studying the history of the Party and China is the process of revisiting these spirits and shaping self-spirit. We should consciously take the noble spirit of the revolutionary forefathers as a mirror, adhere to the spiritual home of the Communists, build a solid spiritual foundation for advancing the great cause and realizing the great dream, and inherit and carry forward these spirits to shine a new light of the times.
Read the history of introspection, keep correct and dispel evil spirits in the study of the history of the Party and the history of the new China.
For Party members and cadres, no period of history can bring more profound warning, enlightenment and reference than the history of the Party and the history of the new China.
In the history of the Party and the history of New China, we can not only see the great deeds of the older generation of revolutionaries who are determined to devote themselves to their faith and unswervingly strive to achieve the set goals, but also the profound lessons of some figures who are shaken by their ideals and beliefs and come to the opposite of the revolution, enlightening and warning us to never stagnate or slacken with firm determination and will, always maintain a full and tenacious spirit of struggle, constantly purify the Party nature and cultivate ourselves.
To truly become a firm believer and faithful practitioner of the lofty ideal of communism, it is necessary to brush away the "dust" of thought and strictly prevent the "dirt" from getting stained. The history of the Party and the history of the new China should become the basis for every Party member and cadre to examine themselves and warn themselves.
Knowledge of history and motivation, in learning the history of the Party and the history of the new China, courageously choose the important responsibilities of the times.
General Secretary Xi Jinping once pointed out: "Studying the history of the Party and the national history is a compulsory course to adhere to and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics and to continue to advance the undertakings of the Party and the state."
Looking back at history and asking questions about the beginning is to continue the glory and move towards the future.
Every Party member and cadre should take the study of the history of the Party and the history of the new China as a lifelong pursuit, constantly set the course of life in their study, and take the historical mission, the responsibility and the initiative in their respective posts.
We will continue to take the advanced deeds of the older generation of revolutionaries as reference and guidance, constantly polish the political essence of the Communists, maintain the attitude of striving only for the future, working hard and making progress, and the spirit of struggle moving forward with greater difficulty, so as to write a brilliant piece of our own in the vast journey of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
"Scrambling to the South of the River" Seeking Poetic "Yellow River Dream" - China New Zealand
(The Story of Poverty Reduction in China) Seeking the Poetic "Yellow River Dream" by "Scrambling Jiangnan"
Yinchuan, China News Service, July 26 (Yang Di): "The Jiuqu Yellow River is thousands of miles of sand, and the waves come from the horizon."
The Yellow River, which has aroused the pride of countless literati, Chizi, has given birth to the beautiful and rich Ningxia Plain. Now, Ningxia, which has the reputation of "plugging into the south of the Yangtze River", is adhering to the concept of "ecological priority and green development" and pursuing the poetic "Yellow River Dream".
The "Bibo Dream" of River Clear Water Show
"The Yellow River in the world enriches Ningxia," and the Yellow River flows 397 kilometers through Ningxia, which is the "mother river" that nurtures one side.
However, with the rapid progress of industrialization and urbanization, there is an imbalance between the development, utilization, management and protection of rivers and lakes, and chaos such as exceeding the standard of sewage discharge, surrounding lakes for farmland and encroaching on water areas has emerged, resulting in black odor of water bodies, exceeding the standard of water quality, dirty environment and ecological degradation.
Now, Ningxia is promoting the diverse restoration of water ecology and making efforts to return the Yellow River to Xiuhe Qing.
Water treatment should start at the source.
In Yinchuan, Ningxia, the local government has adopted the method of "bid raising + pollution control + strict control." All sewage from industrial parks has been centrally treated, all urban sewage treatment plants have achieved Class I A standard discharge, and black odour water bodies in urban built-up areas have been basically eliminated. The third batch of China's black odour water demonstration cities has been successfully declared.
In addition, Ningxia fully implemented the river and lake long-term system in 2017. Now, the five-level river and lake long-term responsibility system in districts, counties and villages has been fully covered, and river and lake governors have become the norm.
Gu Jincheng, 64, who lives in a village on the edge of the Yellow River, witnessed the changes of the Yellow River: "The water used to have a stink, but after treatment, the stink is gone."
Gu Jincheng said that the ecological environment is better and his life is more comfortable. Now he often goes for a walk by the Yellow River with his family to feel the blue sky and blue water.
The "Wetland Dream" of Sardines
Flying birds, green trees, trestle roads, clear water... Fan Zhongyun's beautiful scenery of "gathering sand" has become a reality in the Yellow River Wetland Park in Yinchuan, Ningxia.
The Yellow River flows through Ningxia. A variety of wetlands, such as river wetlands, lake wetlands and swamp wetlands, have been formed along the way, which play an important role in promoting the rational utilization of water resources and water ecological balance, and have also become an important international migration route for birds.
Since 2009, the relevant departments in Ningxia have invested a total of about 3.45 billion yuan in wetland protection projects. At present, the area of Yinchuan wetland is 19,200 hectares, with a wetland protection rate of 78.5%. There are nearly 200 natural lakes and swamp wetlands, and there are five national wetland parks, one national urban wetland park, six regional wetland parks and eight municipal parks.
Lu Jinhu, deputy director of Yinchuan Wetland Protection Center, told reporters that wetland protection has increased biodiversity, especially in birds. "The remaining gulls are an endangered bird. There are only more than 20,000 in the world, of which more than 2,000 live in Yinchuan Wetland."
At the same time, Ningxia has designated a 500-meter red line for the wetland protection area on both sides of the Yinchuan section of the Yellow River according to law, stipulating that no unit or individual may carry out development, construction or business activities within the protection scope except for public welfare projects.
Zhao Shaoyong, deputy director of Yinchuan Water Conservancy Service Center, said that through the management of pollution sources, the comprehensive improvement of river and lake ecology and the construction of terminal wetlands, the water quality of the nine main Yellow Drains in Ningxia has reached 100% of the Class IV standard. "Now the water is clear, the fish are swimming and the flowers are blooming."
Pu Huiminsheng's "Drinking Water Dream"
Yinchuan City in Ningxia once had an "awkward" title: the only city along the Yellow River that "watches the Yellow River for water shortage."
Since 2010, Yinchuan City has been facing the persistent problem of water shortage during the summer peak. The "pain of water shortage" in the past decade has become a painful summer experience for many residents on high floors. However, under the current situation that major water sources are at the limit of overmining and a large area of groundwater overmining funnel area has been formed underground in the urban area, water scarcity has become a difficult problem perplexing Yinchuan City.
Thanks to the improvement of the water quality of the Yellow River, drinking the purified Yellow River has become a good solution to the drinking water problem of local residents.
Ding Ming, deputy director of Yinchuan Municipal Water Bureau, said that in order to improve the living and production water demand of Yinchuan urban and rural residents, Ningxia launched the Yinchuan Urban Area West Line Water Supply Project in time to replace the original underground water source with the high-quality Yellow River.
"On December 29, 2019, the water supply project officially provided water to the three districts of Yinchuan City. In 2020, the residents of Minning Town and Helan County also drank the Yellow River."
Ding Ming said that the Yinchuan water conservancy department will give overall consideration to the integrated transformation of regional rural drinking water and urban water supply. "In the next step, we will integrate all the decentralized rural water supply points into the western line water supply project, and we expect to basically realize the integrated urban and rural water supply in Yinchuan region by the end of this year."
All departments responsible for strengthening flood prevention and relief work
All responsible departments strengthen flood prevention and relief work
CCTV News (News Link): According to the information from the Ministry of Water Resources, at 12: 00 today (July 25), the river below Wangjiaba, the main stream of the Huai River, exceeded the alert level by 0.64 to 3.31 meters, and the river below Sha City and the two lakes in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River exceeded the alert level by 0.05 to 2.02 meters.
Taihu Lake has lasted 28 days since it exceeded the alert level on June 28.
At 12 o'clock today, the average water level of Taihu Lake was 4.67 meters, 0.02 meters above the guaranteed level.
Today, the General Administration of National Flood Prevention, after consultation and judgment, decided to continue to maintain the level II flood prevention response of the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, requiring all regions to tighten their responsibilities and further implement the flood prevention and relief work.
Today, the State Prevention Office and the Emergency Management Department urgently dispatched professional drainage vehicles from Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Fujian to help Jiangxi solve the problems of urban flooding caused by heavy rainfall.
US launches first countervailing investigation against China for "undervalued RMB exchange rate"
In response to the recent announcement by the US Department of Commerce, it has decided to launch an anti-dumping and countervailing investigation against strap (strap) products from China, as well as an investigation into the project of "undervalued RMB exchange rate."
China's Ministry of Commerce pointed out that this is the first time that the United States has opened a case in a countervailing case to investigate the so-called "undervaluation of the RMB exchange rate," which China firmly opposes.
China's Ministry of Commerce issued a special press release on the evening of the 23rd, saying that China implements a managed floating exchange rate system based on market supply and demand and adjusted by reference to a basket of currencies, and that the market plays a decisive role in the formation of the exchange rate.
The press release stressed that, on the whole, the RMB exchange rate is at a reasonable equilibrium level and is not underestimated.
Since 2005, the RMB has appreciated by more than 17% against the US dollar.
According to the data released by the Bank for International Settlements, from the beginning of 2005 to May 2020, the RMB nominal effective exchange rate appreciated by 38% and the real effective exchange rate appreciated by 49%, making it the strongest currency in the G20 economies and one of the largest currencies in the world.
The Ministry of Commerce pointed out that the exchange rate issue exceeded the competence of members to conduct countervailing investigations in accordance with the rules of the World Trade Organization.
In February this year, the United States amended its regulations to conduct countervailing investigations on the exchange rates of other countries, which has been suspected of violating WTO rules and has been opposed by many parties.
The press release said that even in accordance with US regulations, the applicant's complaint contained a large number of errors and did not have the necessary countervailing elements such as financial support, benefit granting and exclusivity.
China urges the US to abide by the existing international rules and stop conducting countervailing investigations on the so-called "undervalued RMB exchange rate."
Affected by the rising tension between China and the United States, the offshore and onshore RMB exchange rates fell sharply against the US dollar on the 22nd day of trading, and both fell below the 7.0 yuan mark against the US dollar.
Whether the US Department of Commerce's move is intended to force up the renminbi deserves attention.
The spot exchange rate of RMB against the US dollar rose below 7.0 on the 23rd to close at 6.9961.
The officially regulated central exchange rate of RMB against the US dollar was lowered by 17 basis points to 6.9938 on the 24th.

On the 26th, one day before President Duterte delivered his fifth State of the Union Address (SONA), more than 80,000 cases of new crown pneumonia were confirmed in the Philippines on that day, including 25 confirmed cases by the staff of the Presidential Information Department (PCOO) and its directly affiliated agencies.
To this end, PCOO has specially prepared a working group that has not contacted the confirmed staff to cooperate with President Duterte's press release of SONA.
PCOO Minister Martin Andanar said in an interview with DZBB Radio on the 26th that he had prepared two sets of plans for President Duterte to publish SONA.
According to Plan A, Duterte will deliver SONA at the Batasang Pambansa building in Quezon City on the afternoon of the 27th.
Because of the epidemic, only 50 seats were arranged for some government cabinet members and legislators, and a special video conference room was set up for other cabinet members and local government officials to watch.
All attendees passed the rapid test to enter the Capitol on the same day.
Once one of the participants tests positive, Plan B will be launched, that is, President Duterte will deliver SONA at the Malacanan Palace of the Presidential Palace, and fewer seats will be arranged at the scene.
According to the usual practice, SONA will be broadcast live to the whole Philippines.
At the time of writing, the Philippine presidential palace had not confirmed whether Duterte's family would attend SONA.
Andanal said that President Duterte's SONA will highlight how the government will lead the Philippines to deal with the new pneumonia epidemic and restore social and economic life. It will also mention the commitments he made when he took office, namely to fight government corruption, combat illegal drugs and reduce poverty.
Duterte will also explain other plans of the current administration, including creating more jobs, reviving the economy, promoting education, and helping overseas Filipino workers suffering from the epidemic.
Yinchuan: Classification and Measures to Support Kindergartens to Stabilize Teachers - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency Yinchuan, July 26 (Reporter Ai Fumei) Due to the impact of the epidemic, kindergartens in Yinchuan City, Ningxia, have not yet been reopened, especially the increased financial pressure on private kindergartens has had a certain impact on the stability and sustainable development of kindergarten teachers in the future.
Aiming at this, Yinchuan City has adopted a number of measures, such as pre-allocating subsidy funds to inclusive private kindergartens, providing job stabilization subsidies to non-inclusive private kindergartens, and reducing and reducing the rent of private kindergartens, to support these kindergartens in stabilizing the teaching team.
According to the relevant policies of Yinchuan City, if, during the epidemic period, the organizers of inclusive private-run kindergartens (including kindergartens that have been converted into inclusive kindergartens after the management of supporting kindergartens in urban areas) pay the basic living expenses of not less than 1,660 yuan per person per month to the teaching staff and staff according to the minimum wage standard in the three districts, the municipal finance will pre-allocate six-month subsidy funds according to the standard of 1,000 yuan per student per year for the average expenditure of inclusive private-run kindergartens to cover teachers' salaries and social insurance expenses.
For the non-inclusive private-run kindergartens that also provide the basic living expenses of not less than 1,660 yuan per person per month to teachers and staff, Yinchuan will arrange the six-month subsidy fund as the stabilization subsidy fund for kindergarten teachers according to the standard of 500 yuan per student per year.
At the same time, Yinchuan City will reduce and reduce the rent of houses for three months during the period of epidemic prevention and control for privately run kindergartens that lease houses with state-owned assets, and encourage developers and other rental entities to assume social responsibilities.

The Ministry of Water Resources has refined and implemented the response measures of the No. 3 Flood Formation of the Yangtze River in 2020
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 (reporter Hu Lu) On July 26, the third flood of the Yangtze River in 2020 formed.
When presiding over the meeting on the 26th, Minister of Water Resources Erg Zhenping requested that the Three Gorges Reservoir be carefully scheduled, that the incoming water from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and Dongting Lake be considered in an overall manner, that staggered peak scheduling be implemented, that sufficient storage capacity be reserved to prepare for possible major floods, and that the flood control safety of the middle and lower reaches of the dry stream and the important embankments of Dongting Lake be ensured.
It is forecast that in the next three days, there will be heavy to heavy rainfall in the eastern southwest, the southern part of Jianghuai, the western part of the northern part of Jiangnan, the southern part of eastern Hubei and the central part of Guangxi, among which there will be heavy rain in the northern part of Hunan and the southwest part of Jiangsu; and moderate to heavy rain in the western part of central China, including the central part of Hebei.
The Ministry of Water Resources estimates that the flow rate of the Three Gorges Reservoir in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River may reach about 60,000 cubic meters per second after 28 days, and the water level of the middle-stream dry stream Lotus Tong River section and Dongting Lake will rise again and exceed the protection by about 0.20 meters; the water level of the middle-stream dry stream of the Huai River will generally recede and the water level of Hongze Lake will continue to rise slowly; and the water system of Haihe Daqing River and Yongding River will have a process of rising water.
He Zhenping proposed that the Huai River basin should further increase the flood discharge, reduce the water level of Hongze Lake as soon as possible, and prepare for the possible major flood.
We should do a good job in dealing with the torrential rain and flood in Surabaya.
He said that the Taihu Basin should continue to strengthen the flood drainage, reduce the water level of Taihu Lake and the surrounding river network as soon as possible, and reduce the risk of high water level of Taihu Lake and typhoon.
In addition, he stressed that the steep rise and fall of floods in northern regions such as Inner Mongolia and Hebei and the short warning time were easy to cause flash floods and mudslides, making it difficult to prevent them. There were many small and medium-sized reservoirs and silt dams, and there were hidden dangers for safety.
More than 10 listed companies involved in the exposure of 58 APPs that infringe on users' rights and interests
The Ministry of Industry and Communications informed that, in accordance with the Cybersecurity Law, Telecommunications Regulations, Provisions on the Protection of Personal Information of Telecommunications and Internet Users and other laws and regulations, third-party testing institutions have recently been organized to inspect mobile phone application software and urge enterprises with problems to make rectification.
The problems of these 58 APPs include collecting personal information privately, collecting personal information beyond the scope, frequently applying for permissions, over-requesting permissions, difficult account cancellation, sharing to third parties privately, and denying permission to use.
The Ministry of Industry and Communications requires that the 58 APPs should be rectified and implemented by July 30. If they are not rectified within the time limit, the Ministry will organize and carry out the relevant disposal work according to law and regulations.
The reporter found that behind the 58 APPs notified, more than a dozen US, Hong Kong and A-share listed companies were involved.
For example, "Fannie Duo" is a product owned by Fannie Duo, a US-listed company. There are five major problems: collecting personal information privately, collecting personal information beyond the scope, sharing it privately to third parties, forcing users to use the targeted push function, and frequently applying for permissions.
According to public information, Fannie Mae Duo landed on NASDAQ in November 2019 and is "the first real estate agency in China with industrial Internet SaaS (software service) model," providing online solutions for many intermediary merchants.
In response to the "Where to Go" APP account cancellation problem pointed out in the notice, according to the Beijing News, Where to Go responded that in order to prevent illegal production from taking advantage of frequent registration and cancellation for profit, where to go has been set up for registration and cancellation at intervals of one month on the basis of self-cancellation.
Considering the convenience of cancellation and account security, the cancellation has been changed to take effect immediately and is currently awaiting audit.
A network security expert who did not want to be named told the client that the Ministry of Industry and Communications has issued three APP notices for infringing on users' rights and interests.
Among them, private collection of personal information, excessive requests for permissions and difficulties in account cancellation have been repeatedly "managed."
It can also be found from the notification that the violation of privacy by APP has attracted more and more attention.
On July 24, the same day that 58 APPs infringing users' rights and interests were notified, the Ministry of Industry and Communications said it had issued a notice to deploy and carry out special remedial actions to further promote APPs infringing users' rights and interests.
The special regulation will strengthen supervision and inspection according to regulations, urge relevant enterprises to strengthen the protection of APP personal information, promptly rectify and eliminate outstanding problems such as illegal collection, use of users' personal information and harassment of users, deception and misleading users, and inadequate implementation of the management responsibilities of the application distribution platform, so as to purify the APP application space.
Lewis Family: John Lewis is a fighter "fighting for the weakest"
John Lewis, a member of the United States Congress and civil rights fighter, was remembered as a fighter who "fought for the weakest" at the memorial service held for him on Saturday (July 25).
Lewis' public memorial service has been held in Alabama since Saturday.
There were two memorial services on the first day.
At the public memorial service at Troy University in Alabama on Saturday, Lewis' five brothers and sisters and a nephew spoke of him as a loving, fearless and family-oriented man.
Lewis' youngest brother Henry "Grant" Lewis said at the meeting: "He devoted his life to helping others."
Samuel Lewis said that his mother warned John "not to get into trouble, not to get into trouble."
He added that John did not heed his mother's warning. He said, "We all know that John will always get into trouble and always get into trouble, but it is because he insists on the right thing, which is good trouble."
Lewis' brothers and sisters reminded people at the memorial service that John's most famous argument was to create "good trouble," that is, to avoid provoking trouble as long as it is for the sake of justice.
John applied to Troy University (Troy University) in Troy, Alabama, where he was born, but Troy University, then an all-white school, rejected his application.
John Lewis, who preached the gospel to the chickens on his farm as a child, eventually received a degree in religion and philosophy from Fisk University.
Years later, Troy University awarded Lewis an honorary doctorate.
Doug Jones, a senator from Alabama, said the current protesters were "protesting peacefully and nonviolently," just as Lewis did in the civil rights movement.
Jones said, "Even if President Trump immediately beat the boat and described all the protesters as thugs, he was wrong.
The protesters are patriots who want America to move towards a more equal country. "
A six-day series of activities in memory of Lewis will culminate in a funeral in Georgia this week.
On Saturday, Lewis' coffin was parked at a public memorial service at Troy University. People came to pay their respects to the civil rights pioneer.
Later on Saturday, a private ceremony paid tribute to him in a small church in Selma, Alabama, followed by a public memorial service.
On Sunday, Lewis' body will pass through the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma.
In 1965, he and the demonstrators demanding black voting rights were severely beaten by the Alabama police in front of the bridge. The police also fired tear gas at the demonstrators.
Lewis was nearly killed.
This day was later called "Bloody Sunday."
Lewis' body will be transported to Montgomery, the capital of Alabama.
Mayor Steven Reed encouraged people to line up on the sidewalk to walk the last leg with Lewis.
At the same time, officials required the public to wear masks and maintain social distance when participating in the activities.
Alabama Governor Kay Ivey ordered flags to be flown at half-mast on Saturday and Sunday to honor Lewis.
During the nearly week-long commemoration, Lewis' body will be briefly placed in the Alabama State Capitol in Montgomery, the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta and the U.S. Capitol in Washington for public mourning.
U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced last week that people could come to the U.S. Capitol on Monday and Tuesday to pay their respects to Lewis.
Due to the coronavirus epidemic, a public memorial to Lewis will be held outdoors.
Shenzhen Public Consultation on the Introduction of Health Regulations - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Shenzhen, July 26 (reporters Mao Siqian and Bai Yu) encourages residents to do medical check-ups frequently to find out problems as soon as possible; prohibits the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors; establishes an online game health review system; and employers should have part-time health managers... Recently, the Health Regulations of the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone (Consultation Draft) were officially released, and Shenzhen residents will have their own "health law."
In order to encourage residents to do medical examination frequently and find out problems at an early date, the above-mentioned consultation draft proposes that the health department should draw up a basic catalogue of health medical examination items according to different age, occupation and other factors.
The health examination expenses falling within the scope of the basic catalogue of health examination items shall be paid by the Social Medical Insurance Co-ordinating Fund according to the standard of one person per year.
The consultation draft makes it clear that the employing unit should rationally allocate human resources, arrange the working hours of employees, implement a rotation system for employees with heavy mental and physical labor load, avoid excessive loss of human function or injury to their physical and mental health, and strictly implement the system of paid leave for employees.
In addition, employers should have full-time and part-time health management personnel and organize and carry out employee health check-ups on a regular basis.
With regard to the physical and mental health of minors, the consultation draft proposes that the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors is prohibited, and the sales location of alcoholic beverages is restricted. Those who violate the regulations will be ordered by the market supervision and administration department to make corrections and fined 30,000 yuan.
Besides "temperance," minors should also "exercise more."
According to the requirements of the consultation draft, the school should arrange students' sports activities for more than one hour every day.
With regard to online games, the departments of public security, culture, radio, tourism, sports, network supervision, health and other departments should improve the health supervision system of Internet service business places, establish the health examination system of online games, and create a good communication space and culture for the healthy growth of young people.
In addition, the consultation draft also proposed that influenza patients must wear masks when entering and leaving public places, and that medical and health institutions should be fined 20,000 yuan for disclosing patients' privacy without consent.
It is worth noting that, in addition to the physical and mental health of residents, the consultation draft also requires all departments in Shenzhen to evaluate the impact of the implementation of public policies on the health of the population before formulating plans and normative documents related to urban spatial planning and construction, industrial park planning and construction, resource development and utilization, ecological and environmental protection, and biomedical industry development, as well as approving major construction projects and implementing major public service projects.
If it has not been evaluated or will have a serious adverse impact on urban public health or residents' health, it shall not be enacted or approved for implementation.

Recently, during his visit to Jilin Province, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed the need to strengthen the leadership of the Party, promote the extension of the Party organization to the grass-roots level, improve the working system of the grass-roots Party organization, and provide a strong guarantee for the governance of urban and rural communities.
Adhering to Party building as the lead and implementing Party leadership into all aspects of grass-roots governance is a fundamental and directional requirement for doing a good job in grass-roots governance.
To improve the level of governance at the grass-roots level, we must adhere to the leadership of Party building, promote the transformation of the Party's political, organizational and mass work advantages into governance advantages by strengthening the political leadership, building battle bastions and consolidating the red forces, and transmit the Party's strength and propositions to the "nerve end" and the "last kilometer."
Pay attention to calcium supplements and strengthen political leadership.
To strengthen the political leadership of grass-roots governance, we must carry out the project of "filling calcium and casting soul."
We should make it a top priority to thoroughly understand Xi Jinping's thought of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, make "not forgetting the original heart and keeping the mission in mind" an eternal task for Party building and a lifelong task for Party members and cadres, strengthen the principle of understanding the original text by reading the original works, continue to promote the Party's innovation theory to be realistic through special training, batch training, seminars and exchanges, and hold lecture halls, and promote Party members and cadres to further enhance the "Four Consciousness," firmly "Four Self-confidence," "Two Safeguarding," and better perform their duties.
Through the combination of online and offline learning methods, we will broaden the learning and education channels and guide grass-roots Party organizations and Party members and cadres to truly integrate learning and education into daily and regular life.
Pay attention to practice and exercise, and in the process of solving key and difficult problems in the field of grass-roots governance, solve the troubles and troubles of the masses, and improve the Party's character and ability.
Grasp the improvement of norms and build battle fortresses.
Grassroots Party organizations are not only an important part of the grass-roots governance system, but also an important carrier of governance ability.
To promote the standardization of grass-roots Party organizations, we should start by grasping the working regulations of Party branches, focus on the weakening and vanishing of the leadership of Party organizations, and consolidate the foundation, fill the gaps and promote development by establishing an up-and-down linkage mechanism, innovating the form of branch establishment, normalizing the rectification of weakness and fragmentation, establishing and improving the decision-making and deliberation mechanism, and serving the masses.
In rural areas, we will strengthen the standardization of Party organizations at the village level, standardize the organization form, study activities and management mechanism against the standardized construction standards of Party branches, and effectively promote the detailed implementation of the system of "three meetings, one lesson" and thematic Party day activities.
In cities, we should pay attention to street communities, explore innovative forms of branch establishment, focus on weak areas, "blocking points" and "pain points", and actively build urban party-building alliances so that the work of the Party can be effectively covered.
At the same time, we will establish and improve the institutional mechanism of grass-roots governance, improve the decision-making and deliberation mechanism of discussing major events, doing practical things together, deciding important things together, discussing urgent things together, solving difficult things together, and led by grass-roots Party organizations, improve the mechanism of connecting Party members and cadres to serve the masses, gather the hearts and minds of the people in serving the people, enhance the sense of acquisition, happiness, honor and pride of Party members, and make grass-roots governance more warm.
Give full play to the vanguard role and unite the red forces.
Grassroots Party members and cadres are the cornerstone of grassroots governance.
Improving the governance ability at the grass-roots level focuses on improving the governance ability of Party members and cadres at the grass-roots level, giving full play to the exemplary and leading role of "red cells" in grass-roots governance, and consolidating red forces at the forefront of connecting and serving the masses.
We should take the improvement of governance ability as a compulsory course for Party members and cadres at the grass-roots level, constantly strengthen ideological hardening, professional training and practical training, carry forward the spirit of responsibility in their positions and in urgent and dangerous tasks, and consolidate the foundation and contribute to the modernization of the national governance system and governance ability.
The activities of "community whistleblowing and Party members reporting" should be widely carried out, and Party members should be involved in community construction, management and service by participating in thematic Party day activities, contacting people in need, identifying service projects, claiming small wishes, and making reasonable suggestions, so that Party members can play a role in community governance.
We should give full play to the role of rural unemployed Party members, set up vanguard posts of unemployed Party members and set up task forces of unemployed Party members, guide the majority of grass-roots Party members to take an active part in the work of poverty eradication, ecological construction, letter and visit maintenance and stability, and ban straw burning, so as to better integrate the red forces and serve the people.
The foundation is solid.
Grassroots Party organizations are the foundation of the ruling building.
Only by adhering to the focus of strengthening the relationship between the Party and its cadres and increasing the well-being of the people, and taking the leadership of Party building as the fundamental way to promote the innovative development of grass-roots governance, can we build a solid foundation, enable grass-roots Party organizations to pull out and stand up, enable grass-roots Party members and cadres to catch up and rush up, and promote grass-roots governance to be "spiritual," orderly, powerful and effective.

Ko Xili Tibetan antelope enters the migration season - Xinhua
Xining, Xinhua News Agency, July 25 (Reporter Wang Jinjin) The reporter learned from the Wudaoliang Protection Station of the Ko Xili Management Office of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration that the monitoring showed that the Tibetan antelope that had migrated to the Chunai Lake area in the hinterland of Ko Xili to give birth to their babies were gradually ending giving birth and returning to their original habitat with their babies.
Monitoring pictures near the Wudaoliang Protection Station show that on July 25, about 40 female Tibetan antelope led three young Tibetan antelope to cross the 3002 km of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway and the Wudaoliang North Bridge of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway. The Tibetan antelope has begun to move back.
Experts analyzed that in recent years, the number of young Tibetan antelope in the returning sheep accounted for one quarter to one fifth of the total number of Tibetan antelope.
Lien Xinming, associate researcher at the Northwest Plateau Institute of Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: "At the beginning of the migration, the Tibetan antelope faced a higher risk of being preyed on. Therefore, the number of young in the sheep would be relatively small, and there might even be no young."
According to the statistics of Ko Xili Management Office of Changjiangyuan Park of Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration, the overall number of Tibetan antelope relocations is increasing year by year. In 2019, the number of Tibetan antelope relocations was 4,860, an increase of 338 over 2018.
Lien Xinming said, "It is expected that the return migration of Tibetan antelope will end in early September this year. The number of returning Tibetan antelope is still expected to continue to increase."
Tibetan antelope is a national level protected animal.
At the end of May every year, Tibetan antelope from the source of the Three Rivers in Qinghai, Qiangtang in Tibet and Alshan in Xinjiang go to Zhuonai Lake, located in the hinterland of Koxili, to give birth to lambs.
Wu Xiaomin, an expert on the protection of Tibetan antelope in China and a researcher at the Institute of Zoology of Shaanxi Province (Northwest Institute of Endangered Animals), said, "The return migration of Tibetan antelope is the process by which the female Tibetan antelope returns to her habitat with her young after the end of childbirth. At first, the return migration group that leaves the nursery is relatively large, but then the Tibetan antelope will return to their respective habitats according to different geographical populations and along different paths."
In order to ensure the safe relocation of the Tibetan antelope herd, the reporter learned that the Ko Xili Management Office of the Changjiang Yuan Park of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration had arranged staff to carry out continuous video monitoring and district patrols in the main relocation areas.
If a herd of Tibetan antelope is found trying to cross the highway, the mountain patrol team will carry out temporary traffic control at the first time to allow the sheep to pass through the wildlife passage safely to ensure that they are not disturbed by humans on the way back.
So, how to relieve the heat in daily life?
Experts suggest that it is best not to walk or work in the hot sun around noon when going out in summer, because the sun is the strongest in this time and the possibility of heatstroke is higher.
If you have to go out at this time, you must do a good job of protection, such as taking a sunshade, wearing a sunshade hat and wearing sunglasses. It is best to apply sunscreen if you have conditions to prevent sunburn.
Try to choose light-colored cotton, hemp and silk with good air permeability, and wear less chemical fiber clothing to avoid not dissipating heat in time when sweating in large quantities, causing heatstroke.
In hot and sultry weather, you should prepare enough water to drink and drink it in time. Don't wait for thirst to drink water, because once you feel thirsty, the body is short of water. Control drinking water to 150 ml to 200 ml at a time. Drink warm boiled water, not ice water.
According to the temperature, the average staff drink 1.5 to 2 liters of water per day, while the high-temperature workers drink 3 to 5 liters of water per day.
When sweating more, you can appropriately supplement some salt water to make up for the loss of salt caused by sweating.
In addition, the human body is prone to lack of potassium in summer, which makes people feel tired and tired. Tea containing potassium is an excellent summer drink.
In summer, eat more fruits and vegetables with high water content, such as lettuce, cucumbers and tomatoes; fresh fruits, such as peaches, apricots, watermelons and melons, have a water content of 80% to 90%, which can be used to replenish water; dairy products can not only replenish water, but also meet the nutritional needs of the body.
In addition, people working in high temperature environment should properly supplement drinks containing potassium, magnesium and other elements.
The days and nights in summer are long, the temperature is high, the metabolism of the human body is exuberant, the consumption is also large, and it is easy to feel tired.
Adequate sleep can relax the brain and body systems, which is not only conducive to work and study, but also a measure to prevent heatstroke.
Experts say that the best bedtime is from 22: 00 to 23: 00 and the best wake-up time is from 5: 30 to 6: 30.
Be careful not to lie under the air conditioner outlet and electric fan during sleep in order to avoid air conditioning disease and hot cold.
Experts suggest that people engaged in outdoor activities or high-temperature work can carry with them heat-proof drugs such as ten drops of water, mandarin, patchouli gas or patchouli gas pills, or place them in a nearby workplace and use them at any time to prevent heatstroke.
I hope you can take some time to consider the very simple fact that so far, most of what we know about the universe comes from light.
We can see the stars with the naked eye when we stand on the earth and look up at the night sky.
The strong sunlight is so harsh,
We can see the light reflected back from the moon,
Since Galileo aimed his humble astronomical telescope at the celestial bodies in the universe, the universe as we know it is presented to us through light.
With the help of modern astronomical telescopes, we have been able to collect dazzling and silent images of the universe - a series of images dating back to the Big Bang.
However, the universe is not a silent drama, because the universe is not really silent.
I want to tell you that the universe has its own score, and the universe itself is constantly playing, because space can vibrate like a drum.
So when something important happens, it can make a series of sounds to the universe.
Now, we hope to match this magnificent visual work about the universe with sound.
Although we have never heard the sound from outer space, we should be able to turn up the volume and hear what happened there in the next few years.
Aiming at the ambitious goal of capturing the sound of the universe, we will focus on the black hole and the prospect it shows, because the black hole can impact space-time and make a very special sound like a drumstick hitting the surface of a drum. I am also very happy to play some of the sounds we predicted to you.
One day in the future, we may see a shadow. A black hole can leave a shadow on a very bright background, but it has not been observed yet.
Although black holes cannot be seen, they may be heard because they impact spacetime like drums.
The idea that the universe can make a drum sound comes from Albert Einstein. In fact, many of our ideas come from him.
Einstein realized that if the universe was empty, if the universe was empty, it would look like this picture, except for the auxiliary lines drawn on it.
But if we are in free fall in the universe, even without these auxiliary lines, our trajectory will draw these lines, because we will find that we move in a straight line and pass through the universe in a straight line that does not bend.
Einstein also realized that - this is really the most critical part (matter also means "matter") - if you put energy and matter into the universe, the universe will bend. Objects in free fall will be deflected along the curved path in space when passing through a celestial body like the sun.
This is Einstein's great theory of general relativity.
Even the path of light can be bent.
When the bend is large enough, it will revolve around the orbit of the sun, just like the earth revolves around the sun and the moon revolves around the earth.
This is the natural curve in the universe.
However, Einstein did not realize that if you compress the sun into a sphere with a diameter of 6 kilometers - that is, if you compress a mass of one million times the mass of the earth into a sphere with a diameter of 6 kilometers, you will create a black hole. The density of this object is so great that if the light is too close to it, it will not escape - leaving a huge shadow in the universe.
However, Einstein always believed that the black hole was only a mathematical singularity.
He did not believe in the existence of black holes.
He believed that nature would prevent the formation of black holes to protect us.
It took decades for people to use the term "black hole" and realize that black holes are real objects - in fact, they are the dead state of some massive stars after their catastrophic collapse at the end of their lives.
Our sun will not collapse to form a black hole.
Its quality is not really large enough.
However, if we do some thought experiments - which Einstein liked very much - we can imagine compressing the sun within a range of six kilometers after crushing, and then placing a small earth in the orbit around it, such as the orbit 30 kilometers away from the black hole sun.
The earth will shine by itself, because now the sun has disappeared and we have no other light source - therefore, our small earth will shine by itself.
You will find that you can even put the earth in an orbit 30 kilometers away from the black hole and let it orbit happily.
The black hole is actually only about the size of Manhattan.
Before it destroys the earth, it may swell to Hudson Street.
But basically that's what we're talking about.
We are talking about an object compressed to half the size of Manhattan.
So we moved the earth to a place close to the black hole - 30 kilometers - and we noticed that it followed a perfect orbit around the black hole.
There are some rumors that black holes will engulf everything in the universe, but in fact you have to be very close to fall in.
But impressively, from our perspective, we can always see the earth.
It cannot hide behind a black hole.
Some of the light emitted from the earth falls into the black hole, but some of it is bent by the black hole and seen by us.
So you can't hide anything behind a black hole.
If this is the story in Battlestar Galactica and you are fighting the Cylons, don't hide behind the black hole.
They can see you.
Our sun will not collapse into a black hole; it is not massive enough, but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
If one of them were engulfing the Milky Way, it would look like this.
We will see the shadow of a black hole cast on hundreds of billions of stars and dust belts illuminated by stars in the Milky Way.
If we fall to the black hole, we will see the light being refracted around the black hole, and we will not even feel some great changes happening quietly when we begin to enter the shadow.
If we try to start the rocket and leave there, the result will not be very good, because it is impossible for us to escape, not even light.
Although the black hole is dark from the outside, it is not so from the inside, because the light of all galaxies can fall into the black hole with us.
And even so, due to the time expansion effect of the theory of relativity, our clock seems to be slower than the time of the Milky Way, which looks as if the outer galaxy is accelerating, just before we are destroyed by a black hole.
It is like experiencing the feeling of dying. You see the light at the end of the tunnel, but it is a complete death experience.
(Laughter) You can't tell anyone that you see light at the end of the tunnel.
Up to now, we have never seen the shadow left by such a black hole, but black holes can be heard, even if they cannot be seen.
Imagine, in a real astronomical scene - imagine two black holes that have existed together for a long time.
Perhaps they collapsed into two black holes after being stars - each with a mass 10 times that of the sun.
Now we compress them to within 60 kilometers.
They can rotate hundreds of times per second.
At the end of life, they approach each other at the speed of light.
They can cross thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second. In the process, they will not only bend the space, but also cause the vibration of space in the wake, a real space-time wave.
When the black hole collides with the universe, the space is squeezed and stretched.
These vibrations travel through space at the speed of light.
The computer simulation was completed by NASA's Goddard Relativity Group.
It took nearly 30 years to solve this problem.
This is one of many groups.
It shows two black holes rotating around each other. These are imaginary curves.
As you can see - it may be a bit vague - you can see red waves being emitted, and these are gravitational waves.
They are real cosmic sounds that will travel outward from the black holes at the speed of light during their fusion until the two black holes merge into a quietly rotating black hole.
If you stand close enough, your ears will resonate with the squeezing and stretching of these spaces.
You can really hear these voices with your own ears.
Of course, you will helplessly find that your head is also squeezed and stretched, so you may not be able to understand what happened.
However, I would like to play our prediction for you.
This is the research result of my group - a relatively brief calculation model.
Imagine a less massive black hole falling into a more massive black hole.
The sound you hear comes from the collision of a small black hole with space as it approaches a massive black hole.
If they are far away, the sound will be very small.
But gradually the sound becomes like a drumstick beating the space, making the space vibrate like a drum.
We can predict what this voice will become.
We know that in the process of falling, the small-mass black hole will become faster and louder.
Eventually, we will hear that the small black hole completely falls into the big black hole.
I never thought the sound was so loud - it was actually amplified here.
When listening at home, I felt the voice was not strong.
It sounds like Ding, Ding, Ding.
This is another sound simulated by our research group.
I will not show you images here, because black holes will not leave any useful traces, and real space will not show you those virtual curves.
However, if you hear this sound while on holiday in the universe, I suggest you run quickly.
(Laughs) Better get away from the sound.
Both black holes are moving.
The two black holes are approaching each other.
In this case, they are shaking violently.
Then, they will be integrated.
That sharp sound is a sign of black hole fusion - a sharp sound will be made when the fusion is over.
This is our prediction of what we will see.
Fortunately, we are very safe in Long Beach, California.
There is no doubt that two black holes have merged somewhere in the universe.
There is also no doubt that the space around us can also feel these vibrations passing through a million light-years, or from a million years ago, which travel at the speed of light and eventually meet us.
But these voices are too small for us to hear.
Some experiments in the world require a lot of effort to build - including one called LIGO - which will be able to detect spatial vibrations less than one nucleus at a distance of every four kilometers.
This is a very bold attempt, and its sensitivity will not be exceeded in the next few years - it will be used to detect space vibration.
Another research project on the universe, called LISA, is expected to be launched in the next ten years.
LISA will be able to see supermassive black holes - those with millions or even billions of times the mass of the Sun.
From the images returned by Hubble telescope, we can see these two galaxies.
It looked like they hugged each other quietly.
There may be a massive superblack hole at their centers.
But they are not static; they are actually merging.
The two black holes will collide and their fusion will take billions of years.
Therefore, collecting the sounds they make is beyond the limits of our human perception.
However, LISA can see the final stage of two supermassive black holes that began to merge a long time ago, that is, 15 minutes before their fusion.
This kind of detection is not limited to black holes, but can also be used to detect any major disturbances in the universe, the largest of which is the "Big Bang."
When the term was coined, some people mocked and said, "Oh, who would believe in the Big Bang?"
This animated short film made by my friends in Proton Studios shows the scene of watching the Big Bang from the outside.
In fact, we will never really like this; we want to be inside the universe, because there is no such situation as being outside the universe.
So imagine being in the middle of a big explosion.
The universe is everywhere, everything in the world surrounds you, and space is swaying in disorder.
Fourteen billion years have passed, and the sound still haunts us.
Galaxies gradually form, and a batch of stars form in the galaxy. On a certain planet, there is at least one such planet, which is suitable for life.
Here, we frantically build experiments, do calculations and write computer code.
Imagine that a billion years ago, two black holes collided.
The sound has been traveling through space and time.
We didn't even show up here.
It is getting closer and closer - 40,000 years ago, we painted on the stone walls of the cave.
If the sound we want to obtain was made by the Big Bang, it would sound like this.
Strictly speaking, it is noise.
This is a kind of white noise, a kind of chaotic bell.
But it is everywhere around us, as long as it is not offset by certain other processes in the universe.
If we can detect these sounds, it will be like music to our ears, because the quiet echo comes from the moment we are created and from the universe we look up from a distance.
Therefore, in the next few years, we will be able to turn up the volume of these scores a little bit so that the universe can be presented to us in audio form.
However, if we can detect the earliest moments, it will also take us a step further from understanding the Big Bang and enable us to ask some of the most difficult and elusive questions.
If we play the history of the universe backwards, we can know that there was a big explosion in the past, and we can even hear its noisy sound. But is our big explosion the only big explosion in the universe?
I mean, we can't help asking, has there been a similar big explosion before that?
Will it happen again in the future?
I would like to say that if the significance of this question is raised to the level of rethinking advocated by TED, at least at the last minute, we can ask some questions, which we may indeed never answer.
But we cannot help but ask: will our universe be just an episode in a larger history?
Or are we just a branch of the multiverse - each branch has experienced its own Big Bang - perhaps some of them have buzzing black holes, perhaps some do not - perhaps some have conscious life, perhaps some do not - they do not belong to our past or exist in our future, but are linked to us in some way?
Therefore, we cannot help but guess that if there is a multiverse, is there life in other branches of this multiverse?
This is life in our multiverse.
Are there other life in the multiverse, and will they also guess our existence and think about their own origin?
If so, I can imagine that they, like us, do calculations, write computer code, build experimental instruments, try to detect the weak sounds from their origin, and doubt who else is there.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Graduate Art Exhibition Moved into Shopping Mall for Public Interest Exhibition - Xinhua
In the "cloud graduation" season of major colleges and universities, a rare offline graduate art exhibition opened warmly last weekend.
However, it is not in the art gallery or campus, but in the public space of Grand Hyatt City in Chaoyang. It is open to the public free of charge and will last until August 23.
The reporter learned that the 2020 graduate art exhibition collected 50 pieces / groups of works by 57 young artists from the Central Academy of Fine Arts, Communication University of China and Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts. The exhibition space was extended from the second floor to the sixth floor, and the light box in the building was used to display flat works to maximize the artistic atmosphere of the graduation season.
Under the epidemic, the significance of this exhibition is particularly special.
"We choose to bring the graduation exhibition to the" cloud "back to the offline space. We also hope to let more people see young people's exploration of themselves and understanding of the world, and to amplify the healing power of art to society and the heart," said Ge Ping, head of Chen Mei, Dayue City, Chaoyang.
She revealed that the works participating in the exhibition were collected from the graduates of several major art colleges, from which the works suitable for commercial space were selected, ranging from traditional shelf paintings and sculptures to new media installations, interactive animation and VR panoramas, with the largest volume and richness in the past year.
Among them, Li Yunshao expressed his feelings in the epidemic through a mix of mechanical and manual creative language in "The First Battle of 2020"; Liu Jiaying's work "Sound Money" through Ethereum blockchain explored the themes of "cryptocurrencies," "credit creation," "transactions," and so on; Zhang Jiaqi's "Cat Forest" and Qiu Darqiang's "Bohemian" both show animals that often accompany human beings, from which young artists can see their understanding of the relationship between human beings and animals; while Zhu Zhongyu's work "Winter of Faith - Gift" is a reminder to young people growing up that "when one day you have a successful career, don't forget your first heart, remember that simplicity and sincerity."
Among the few graduates who exhibited in person was Li Jingyin from the Department of Sculpture of Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts.
"I came to Beijing on July 7. I was actually a little worried about the epidemic. I also had a nucleic acid test three days in advance. I came to the exhibition with alcohol cotton and the test report."
His work Yesterday Is a Mystery has a complex structure and must be done by himself.
At the same time, he also took on the task of helping his classmates repair the broken works.
"The exhibition will be held at 4: 30 in the morning and then repaired. Time is so tight that I forgot to take a picture with the work, which is a bit of a pity."
He hopes that when the epidemic is more stable, he and his classmates will come to Beijing to see his work exhibition.

In the morning, the 65-year-old Bolsonaro tweeted a picture of him, wearing sneakers and no mask, sitting at a table with breakfast, smiling, thumbs up in one hand and a box of hydroxychloroquine in the other.
He wrote on the tweet: "Good morning everyone! New crown virus test result: negative."
However, Bosonaro did not say when the new crown virus was tested.
On July 5, Bosonaro developed symptoms of new crown pneumonia. On July 6, he was tested positive for the virus. On July 7, he announced on live television that he had been diagnosed with new crown pneumonia.
On the 14th and 21st, Bosonaro was tested for the new crown virus twice, and the results were still positive.
During the isolation, Bosonaro repeatedly showed the hydroxychloroquine drugs he took live through social media, and said that hydroxychloroquine had a good effect on neocrotal pneumonia, he felt good after taking it, and his good health was due to hydroxychloroquine, and advocated that Brazilian medical institutions use hydroxychloroquine drugs to treat neocrotal pneumonia.
According to Brazilian media, up to now, five cabinet ministers and 10 governors in Brazil have been diagnosed with the new crown pneumonia.
A small plane crashed in the Swiss Alps, killing all four people on board.
According to the report of the European Union News Agency quoted by the European Network on July 26, on July 25, local time, the Swiss police informed the media that a small plane crashed in the Swiss Alps on July 25.
Two Swiss and two Austrian were killed in the accident.
According to reports, police in the southern Swiss state of Wallis said that a small plane crashed at an altitude of more than 3,000 meters near the Alps mountain in Valais. Rescue workers rushed to the scene of the crash and confirmed that all four people on board the plane were killed.
Valais police said that the witness called the police at 12: 25 noon on the 25th to report that he witnessed a small plane falling from the sky.
A few minutes later, the witness informed the police again that thick smoke was billowing from the crash site.

Reward 50,000 Yuan Hubei Enshi Praises "First Person in Early Warning" of Sand Dam Landslide
Hubei Daily News (Reporter Lin Jing) On July 26, Enshi City issued a notice praising Chen Guangming, a geological disaster site monitor who had made important contributions to the early warning of sand dam landslide, and sent him a prize of 50,000 yuan.
At the same time, Party members and cadres in the whole city are called upon to learn from his spirit of due diligence, courage, initiative and dedication.
On July 21, a landslide occurred in the sand dam of Ma'er Village, Tunburg Township, Enshi City, resulting in the formation of a quake lake in the main stream of the Qingjiang River. Chen Guangming, 58, was the first person to warn of the landslide.
On the afternoon of July 17, Chen Guangming learned about the cracked wall of the villagers' home and immediately went to the scene to check it.
As soon as he walked out of his home for five or six hundred meters, he saw that the village road had split four or five centimeters and extended along the road to the cornfield, about 50 meters long.
Chen Guangming Thunsheng was alert and first sent the photos of the highway cracking to the "contact group of geological disaster monitors" in the township.
After on-site inspection and judgment by the relevant person-in-charge of Tunburg Township Natural Planning Office, the possibility of landslide was very high, and the decision to evacuate the people was made immediately.
Chen Guangming's timely warning won 36 hours of valuable time for the safe evacuation of 1,339 people from 315 households in the affected area.
There were no casualties in this major geological disaster.
Chen Guangming's conscientious and responsible dedication was praised by the masses.
Facing the praise, he said: "It is my responsibility to save no one."
A new drug developed by the University of Australia is expected to be used to treat vascular blockage caused by the new crown - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency Sydney, July 26 (Reporter Chen Yu) Researchers at Monash University in Australia are developing a new drug to help prevent heart disease and stroke and hope it can be used to treat vascular blockages caused by neocrovirus.
Researchers found that before a heart attack or stroke, an enzyme in platelets accelerates platelet clotting.
Therefore, they developed a drug that can temporarily inhibit the coagulation of platelets, thus avoiding blood vessel blockage and preventing heart disease and stroke.
Researchers said that the drug would only inhibit the coagulation effect of platelets when there were signs of heart disease or stroke.
Since some studies have shown that similar vascular blockage is one of the main causes of death of patients with severe neocrotal disease, researchers hope this drug can be used to treat such patients in the future.
At present, the drug has achieved good results in animal model experiments, and the researchers are ready to conduct human clinical trials in the next stage.
The research results have been published in the American journal Science and Transformative Medicine.
He became the first audience to enter the CBA League rematch after allowing the audience to watch the game live.
On the same day, during the second phase of the rematch of the 2019-2020 Chinese Men's Basketball Professional League (CBA) (Laoshan Competition Area) held in Qingdao, Shandong Province, medical staff, teachers and members of the public security front came to watch the match between the Shanghai Jiuzhi Team and the Shandong West Wang Team after completing the relevant procedures including nucleic acid testing through the official ticket purchase platform.
During the viewing period, the spectators should wear masks all the way, take seats against the sign and strictly keep one meter apart.
When leaving the venue, the audience should exit the venue in an orderly manner in the order of starting from behind and moving forward, first on both sides and then in the middle, maintaining the "one-meter line" social distance.
Clean energy for deep cultivation of "sunflower fields" in Xinjiang
2020-07-26 15: 43: 42 Source: China News Network Author: Chen Haifeng Responsibility Editor: Chen Haifeng
China News Agency, Hami, Xinjiang, July 26 Question: Xinjiang should cultivate "sunflower fields" deeply and use clean energy well
More than 6,000 pentagonal diurnal mirrors, each of 48 square meters, are neatly arranged in a circle, such as a silver "sunflower field," which rotates with the sun and reflects sunlight to the heat absorption tower more than 200 meters high in the center to generate electricity.
On the 25th, the reporter saw this scene at the Hami molten salt tower photothermal power plant of the China Electric Power Project in the town of Mangmaohu, Iwu County, Hami City, Xinjiang.
"The so-called molten salt tower photothermal power generation is the concentrated reflection of sunlight through the mirror to the heat absorption tower to form thermal energy, which is then converted into electrical energy through traditional power generation technology."
Zhang Yong, deputy general manager of CLP Hami Solar Thermal Power Generation Co., Ltd, introduced that its design principle is similar to that of solar stoves used in rural areas of northwest China, which gather sunlight.
The power plant started construction in October 2017 and was connected to the grid by the end of last year. It covers an area of 6,600 mu and plans to install a total of 14,500 diurnal mirrors.
"Compared with traditional solar power generation technology, its greatest advantage is that it can store the accumulated heat energy and generate electricity at night."
Zhang Yong said that the 13-hour heat storage system configured by the project can enable the generator set to maintain continuous and stable operation and not be affected by light changes, and can also quickly participate in the peak adjustment of the power grid according to the peak and valley demand of the power grid load.
When fully completed, the project will generate 198 million degrees of electricity per year, save more than 60,000 tons of standard coal per year, reduce emissions by more than 60 tons of sulfur dioxide, more than 60 tons of nitrogen oxides, about 20 tons of soot and more than 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide, and provide a continuous stream of clean energy for the local area.
In addition, there is another silver "sunflower field" in the Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park in Hami City.
The Hamifer Light Solar Photovoltaic Power Station covers an area of more than 2,300 mu. The 714 power generation equipment built also follows the rotation of the sun and always maintains a 90-degree right angle between the sun's light and the concentrated panel surface.
"We use two-axis tracking concentrated power generation technology. Through unified integrated control, all power generation equipment will adjust the angle according to the height of the sun to maintain the power generation efficiency."
Duan Mengqi, the station director of the power station, said that under good lighting weather conditions, the efficiency of the power generation technology could be improved by about 20% compared with that of traditional photovoltaic power generation.
In the first half of this year, the power station has generated more than 7 million degrees of electricity, supplementing the local electricity demand.
Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park is the largest single-unit photovoltaic industrial demonstration park with the most comprehensive types of photovoltaic components in Xinjiang, with 38 photovoltaic power generation projects with a total installed capacity of 820,000 kilowatts.
The electricity generation completed in the first half of this year exceeded 110 million degrees, an increase of 6% over the same period in 2019.
Hami is one of the regions with the best conditions for solar energy resources in China.
The average annual total solar radiation is more than 6,200 megajoules per square meter, and the annual sunshine hours are about 3,200 hours.
In recent years, the city has vigorously developed the photovoltaic industry and planted "sunflower fields."
A solar power generation scale of more than 2.5 million kilowatts has been built, and the photovoltaic power generation in the city exceeded 1.4 billion degrees in the first half of this year, an increase of about 14% year on year.
At present, Xinjiang has more than 330 grid-connected photovoltaic power stations with an installed capacity of more than 10 million kilowatts.
Photovoltaic power generation is expected to reach 15 billion degrees this year, which can replace more than 6 million tons of standard coal.
The police informed that the search and rescue work for the details of "female college students lost the connection to travel to Qinghai" continued - Xinhua
Xining, Xinhua News Agency, July 26 (Reporter Wang Jinjin Zhou Yin) Recently, "a female college student lost the connection after traveling to Germug, Qinghai" attracted the attention of netizens.
The Public Security Bureau of Germug City, Hexi Mongolian Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, reported on the 26th that Huang Mou, a student of a university in Nanjing, was still in a state of disconnection, and many police were going deep into the area of Huang Mou and actively looking for work.
On July 10, 2020, the Public Security Detachment of the Germug Public Security Bureau of Hainan Province received a notification from its superiors that Huang Mou, a student of a university in Nanjing, took the Z164 train from Nanjing to Germug on July 5. On July 9, his mobile phone was turned off and lost connection at the southwest area of Qingshuihe, Sonandajie Protection Station, Qumalai County, Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, and requested assistance in finding it.
According to the investigation of Germug Public Security Bureau, Huang entered the territory of Qinghai Province at 19: 54 on July 6 and arrived in Germug at 4: 00 on July 7.
At 8: 00 on the same day, Huang Mou, a missing person, took a taxi from the Yellow River Hotel in Germug City towards the G109 National Highway, and arrived at the Koxilisonandaje Protection Station at 12: 00. The taxi driver returned alone. Huang Mou went to the Qingshuihe area near the Dasonandaje Protection Station at 15: 00 on the 7th and turned off the plane in the area at about 18: 00 on the 9th.
During further investigation, the police found that Huang had passed the Najigou checkpoint at 17: 07 on July 13.
Najigou Checkpoint is a checkpoint set up by Naqu City, Tibet Autonomous Region, in Nanshankou, Germug City. Since there is no video surveillance at the checkpoint, it is not possible to determine the information of the person and the vehicle he is travelling in. The police can only search along the way by car. If Huang is found at all checkpoints along the way in Tibet, they will contact the Germug Public Security Bureau immediately.
According to the latest information, at 1 a.m. on July 26, the Germug Public Security Bureau organized rescue forces to carry rescue equipment to the Frozen Spring Protection Station and the Sonandar Protection Station along the Qinghai-Tibet Highway to search for them, and actively contacted the Sichuan Police, the Tibet Police and the Nanjing Police to carry out joint work. At present, the search and rescue work is still continuing.
The local police hope that if the majority of netizens and all sectors of society have relevant clues, they will provide them to the Germug police and the Nanjing Jiangning police in time to try to find the missing person Huang Mou at an early date.
At the same time, relevant experts suggested that tourists should be standardized, rational and civilized in outdoor activities, pay attention to roadside warning signs at any time, do not risk entering no-man's area, and promptly report to the police in case of emergencies.
The US media uncovered the truth that the US unjustifiably asked China to close the Consulate General in Houston.

The US media uncovered the truth that the US unjustifiably asked China to close the Consulate General in Houston.
On the 24th, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the US Embassy in China that China decided to revoke the establishment and operation license of the US Consulate General in Chengdu, and put forward specific requirements for the Consulate General to stop all business and activities, as a countermeasure to the US side's sudden request to close the Consulate General in Houston on the 21st.
This action of the US government has aroused many concerns, and its political motivation has been questioned by foreign media and scholars.
Why is China required to close the Consulate General?
Many foreign media said that it was not clear why the United States would choose the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, but for the purpose of this move, the foreign media said bluntly: for the general election.
CNN reported on the 23rd that the US asked China to close the Consulate General in Houston, causing the public to question its political motive.
The article said that the disastrous response of the US government to the new crown epidemic caused President Trump's low approval rating in the polls before the election.
White House officials said privately that the tough tactics against China were aimed at saving Trump's popularity and at shifting the blame for the White House's failure to respond to the epidemic.
The article believes that the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is a "politically driven and very cautious" target chosen by the United States, and that the US government chose it "to create a tough attitude and avoid the risk of causing major conflicts."
The BBC also believes that as the US election season approaches and the US economy is severely hit by the epidemic, Trump believes that "playing the 'China card' has a political advantage."
The current situation is "a spiraling and tit-for-tat struggle," which is partly driven by the US government from the perspective of domestic considerations and will only exacerbate the tension between China and the United States.
CBS reported that Trump's re-election prospects have been weighed down by the outbreak, and he has repeatedly blamed China for the outbreak.
Almost every day, the United States takes new action against Trump's absurd argument that "China exploits the United States."
"The Consulate General of Houston is very important in establishing ties between the two countries."
The Associated Press commented that the United States' request for China to close the Consulate General in Houston has increased the tension between the world's two largest economies.
If the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is closed, in addition to the diplomatic impact, Chinese citizens in the southern part of the United States face difficulties in obtaining consular services, as do American citizens seeking visas and other services.
A business group in Houston expressed regret that the US asked China to close the Consulate General in Houston, saying that the Consulate General has played an important role in establishing trade, investment and cultural ties between the two countries.
Associated Press believes that this reflects the importance of China's economy.
According to the website of Foreign Policy magazine, the US move is "part of a series of provocative measures, which will only worsen the US-China relationship."
Reuters quoted Jonathan Pollack, an expert on East Asia at the Brookings Institution, an American think tank, as saying that since the establishment of full diplomatic relations between the United States and China in 1979, he could not think of any action comparable to the US action against the Chinese Consulate General in Houston.
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported that the US move was unprecedented in the more than 40 years of diplomatic relations between China and the United States.
Analysts believe that this move may cause lasting damage.
The Chinese Consulate General in Houston, established in 1979, is the first consulate general opened by China in the United States.
Currently, China has one embassy and five consulates general in the United States.

After the outbreak, Tianshan District invested more than 1.05 million yuan in the first time and allocated it urgently to 23 directly affiliated grass-roots trade unions.
Zhao Xiangguo, deputy secretary of the party committee and chairman of the trade union of China Construction Industry One Construction in Xinjiang, took the initiative after receiving the company's notification on the prevention and control of the epidemic, and chose to stay at the unit on duty to protect the workers.
He sent cooking utensils, food and daily necessities to the new staff and workers living in the dormitory of the unit, and organized the staff to send them the necessary supplies every two days.
"From July 21, we will carry out a survey of the cadres and workers who adhere to the front line of the war 'epidemic', and first purchase epidemic prevention supplies and living materials for 704 front-line workers in Urumqi by means of online orders and door-to-door delivery."
The head of the Xinjiang Transport Trade Union told reporters that in the face of the outbreak, they made every effort to do a good job in providing services for the prevention and control of the epidemic, steadily promoting the development of transportation, and creating a strong atmosphere for fighting the "epidemic" together.
At present, it is hot in summer. Trade unions at all levels keep a close eye on front-line workers in key areas of epidemic prevention and control to "send cool" care and care.
On July 19, the General Trade Union of Urumqi County launched a "cool" sympathy campaign to the front-line workers of epidemic prevention and control. The county's police stations, checkpoints and health systems received drinks, fruits and other comforts.
"Trade union cadres should further enhance their political standing, strengthen their responsibilities, warm people with care and encourage their fighting spirit with actions.
We should give full play to the role of trade union organizations in uniting and uniting workers, do a good job in providing epidemic prevention and control services, actively safeguard the health rights and interests of workers, and send care to front-line workers. "
The head of the General Trade Union of the Autonomous Region said.

Spokesperson of the Embassy in Britain: The Chinese government is a staunch defender of cybersecurity.
China News Service, July 26 According to the website of the Chinese Embassy in the UK, on July 25, the spokesman of the Chinese Embassy in the UK answered questions about the wrong remarks about the cyber attack.
The spokesman stressed that the Chinese government is a staunch defender of cybersecurity and has always resolutely opposed and combated any form of cyberattacks and cyber crimes.
A reporter asked: According to the media, China-related hacking organizations once interfered with the network system of a British company, attacked Anglo-American technology companies with patent data, and invaded the government networks of EU countries.
The spokesman said that the Chinese government is a staunch defender of cybersecurity and has always resolutely opposed and combated any form of cyberattacks and cyber crimes.
Cyberspace has a strong virtuality, is difficult to trace to the source and has a variety of actors. When investigating and characterizing cyberincidents, sufficient evidence should be produced and no unreasonable speculation should be made.
The spokesman said that a series of events such as "Prism Gate" in the past proved that the United States has been carrying out the largest cyber theft operation in the world.
It is in the common interest of all countries to maintain peace and stability in cyberspace.
The spokesman pointed out that China's achievements in scientific and technological innovation were not stolen or stolen, but achieved through self-reliance and hard work.
In 2019, China submitted about 59,000 patent applications through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), with an annual growth rate of 10.6%, making it the country with the largest number of international patent applications.
China has become a big country in innovation and intellectual property.
Data from the Urumqi Central Branch of the People's Bank of China show that in the first half of the year, the new loans for agriculture-related and small and micro enterprises in Xinjiang exceeded the increase in 2019.
In the first half of this year, the Urumqi Central Branch of the People's Bank of China used various monetary policy instruments to guide the banking sector to continuously increase its loan investment, providing sufficient funds for the prevention and control of the epidemic and the resumption of work.
Urumqi free nucleic acid testing Most districts have basically completed secondary testing in high-risk areas
China News Service Urumqi, July 26 (reporter Sun Tingwen Zhao Yamin) Zhang Wei, director of Urumqi Health and Health Commission, said on July 26 when informing about the latest epidemic and nucleic acid testing in Urumqi, at present, free nucleic acid testing has been basically completed in most districts of Urumqi.
Experts from the State Council and experts from the autonomous region and Urumqi are further evaluating the development of the epidemic based on the results of nucleic acid testing and epidemiological investigation.
The Information Office of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region held a press conference on the 26th to inform about the epidemic and prevention and control in Xinjiang.
According to him, between 0000 and 2400 hours on July 25, there were 22 new confirmed cases of Xinguang Pneumonia in Urumqi (5 of which were asymptomatic patients transferred to confirmed cases) and 38 new asymptomatic infections.
As of 24: 00 on July 25, there were 135 confirmed cases and 147 asymptomatic infections in Urumqi.
The new asymptomatic infections on the 25th were basically screened through the city's free nucleic acid testing.
Zhang Wei, director of Urumqi Health Commission, said on the 26th that free nucleic acid testing has been basically completed in most districts of Urumqi.
He also said that from the experience of other regions in China, there are many factors that affect the results of nucleic acid testing, such as the sensitivity of the detection reagent, the time of infection and detoxification of the tested personnel, the cooperation of the tested persons when the samples are taken (the poor cooperation may lead to the samples not being taken in place), the testing environment and the operation proficiency of the inspectors.
For various reasons, there will also be false negative results in nucleic acid testing.
The so-called false negative means that the person tested is indeed infected, but the result of nucleic acid test is negative.
In addition, people who have been in close contact with confirmed and suspected cases usually need two nucleic acid tests to be excluded.
For people who have been to high-risk areas of the epidemic, if they have fever and respiratory symptoms, there is a possibility of false negatives in one Nucleic acid test, so two Nucleic acid tests are also needed to rule out.
He said that in view of the above, and for the sake of the health of people of all ethnic groups in the city, Urumqi will conduct a second free nucleic acid test in key areas such as Tianshan District and Shaybak District from today on, and carry out a "leak check."
It is reported that Tianshan District and Shaybak District are high-risk areas.

White House epidemic expert Fauci: cautiously optimistic that a vaccine will be developed in early 2021
Fauci made the above statement at an online video conference hosted by the International Leadership Foundation on the 25th.
He warned that it was not yet clear how the new crown epidemic would develop in autumn and winter, or what the final impact of the epidemic would be. "The only way to end this is for each of us to choose to be part of the solution."
According to data from Johns Hopkins University, by 21: 00 on the 25th, the number of confirmed cases in the United States had reached 4.176 million and 146,000 people had died.
Fauci said that some parts of the United States are struggling with the rebound of the epidemic.
Although epidemics vary from place to place and require tailored responses, diverse anti-epidemic strategies do not mean that regions are not closely linked.
Outbreaks in one region will eventually affect others.
"Now is not the time for complacency," Fauci said. "Our work is not finished. We must intensify our efforts and be alert to the uncertainty of the future."
He Daichi, a Chinese-American medical expert and founder of "cocktail therapy" for the treatment of AIDS, pointed out at the meeting that the new crown epidemic in the United States has not yet reached its peak.
"Each of us must do our part to slow the spread of this virus."
He called on the public to use their practical actions to buy time for scientists to step up the research and development of new therapeutic drugs and vaccines.
The International Leadership Foundation is a non-profit organization that aims to promote international exchanges between the United States and the Asia-Pacific region. It is committed to enhancing the status of Asian-Pacific Americans and fostering international young leaders.
On the same day, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao, U.S. Representative Meng Zhaowen and Dong Jiling, Founding President of the International Leadership Foundation, addressed the meeting.
They paid special tribute to the Asian-Pacific medical workers and volunteers fighting the epidemic on the front line, and called on the American public to continue to adhere to anti-epidemic guidelines such as "social distance" to curb the spread of the epidemic.

Brazilian study shows that hydroxychloroquine is ineffective in the treatment of mild neocrotal pneumonia.
Recently, a Brazilian study showed that hydroxychloroquine was not effective in patients with mild neocrown pneumonia.
The study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
Researchers in Pakistan divided 667 patients from 55 hospitals across the country into three groups and conducted clinical trials. They mainly compared the treatment effect of hydroxychloroquine alone or azithromycin combined with other antibiotics and analyzed whether it was helpful to improve the condition of mild and moderate patients with neocrotal pneumonia.
The results show that hydroxychloroquine not only has no therapeutic effect, but may have damaging side effects on organs.
The study was carried out jointly by several leading hospitals in Brazil, such as the Einstein Hospital, the Heart Hospital (HCor), the Hospital Sírio-Libanês in Syria, the Brazilian Institute of Clinical Research (BCRI) and the Brazilian Intensive Care Research Network (BRICNet).
On the 25th local time, Brazilian President Bolsonaro announced through social platforms that the results of the fourth nucleic acid test were negative.
During the infection, Bosonaro has been taking hydroxychloroquine and actively promoting it many times.

It is reported that this round of App governance work is carried out jointly by the National Network Information Office, the Ministry of Industry and Communications, the Ministry of Public Security and the State Administration of Market Supervision.
According to the report, the special governance working group composed of four departments accepted more than 12,000 information effectively reported by netizens last year, carried out verification of more than 2,300 apps, and took punishment measures such as public exposure, interview and removal of 260 apps with large users and outstanding problems.

Johns Hopkins University: More than 16 million confirmed cases of new crown worldwide - Xinhua
According to the statistics released by Johns Hopkins University on July 26, as of 2: 40 EST on July 26 (14: 40 Beijing time), the total number of confirmed cases of the new crown had reached 16,048,100 and the total number of deaths had reached 644,537.
Data shows that the United States is the most seriously affected country in the world, with a total of 417,027 confirmed cases and 146,460 deaths.
Brazil has 239,4513 confirmed cases and 86,449 deaths, second only to the United States.
In addition, India, Russia, South Africa, Mexico, Peru, Chile and the United Kingdom have more than 300,000 confirmed cases.
On the 25th, the 2020 Hunan Red Tourism and Culture Festival and the first Xiangtan Red Culture Industry Expo opened in Shaoshan.
In recent years, the demand for red tourism has gradually increased.
However, the development of red tourism industry also faces difficulties such as the small number of young people, the homogenization of tourism projects and the single commercial channel.
In particular, this year's outbreak has seriously frustrated the national tourism industry, and red tourist attractions are also facing serious challenges.
For example, the use of scientific and technological means such as drone photography and VR immersion experience can meet the tourist needs of "no one has arrived and the scenery has arrived"; the introduction of live webcasting means to promote the famous and special products of red scenic spots can directly enhance the economic benefits of red tourism; the introduction of "cloud" technology to create a boutique display with outstanding themes, bright orientation and rich connotation to fully display and enhance the propaganda and education function of red scenic spots; and the innovation of the dissemination of red culture to make revolutionary cultural relics "live," make red tourism popular, let the red gene pass on, and enhance the attractiveness of red scenic spots.
This cultural festival uses the popular method of "county and city (district) directors + professional anchors" to promote the special products of red cultural tourism, and uses 5G technology to provide services such as real-time view and smart city demonstration to promote red cultural tourism attractions, all of which are hard attempts to insert the wings of wisdom for red tourism, and it is expected that red tourism in Hunan will become more and more popular.
Representatives of US-China Trade Talks Report Meeting in August
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported on August 25, citing an anonymous person familiar with the matter, that Liu He, the head of the Chinese trade negotiation team and Vice Premier of the State Council, and Lai Haizhe, the co-leader of the US team and trade representative, are expected to hold formal talks in August to assess the implementation of the first phase of the Sino-US trade agreement.
The report said that although China has significantly increased its purchases of US agricultural products in the past few months, China's purchases are still some distance from those promised in the trade agreement due to the new crown virus epidemic and other factors.
Analysts say the recent closure of each other's consulates by the US and China, together with other disputes, may undermine any progress in trade between the two sides.
The first phase of the Sino-US trade agreement entered into force one month after it was signed on January 15. The agreement stipulates that the trade framework group composed of senior officials of the two sides shall hold talks every six months.
People familiar with the matter said that the meeting would be "an important turning point," allowing both sides to evaluate the progress of the agreement.
However, this person also said that if the tension between the US and China leads to a low willingness to talk at this time, the two sides may agree that the conference call between Lai Haizhe and Liu He on May 8 has met the clause of semi-annual talks in the trade agreement.
Since this year, China-US relations have deteriorated rapidly. The disputes between the two sides include a series of issues such as the origin of the new crown virus, trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the South China Sea and ideology.
Although US President Donald Trump boasted about his achievements in the first phase of the agreement at the beginning of the year, his attitude has changed recently.
He said at the White House press conference on the 23rd that although China has recently purchased a record amount of US corn and bought a lot of soybeans in a single day, "this trade agreement is not as meaningful to me as it was when it was reached."
An anonymous Beijing government adviser also believes that a new round of trade negotiations is unlikely due to the poor relationship between the US and China, and that "trade issues have lost weight in China-US relations."
However, he revealed that China's economic and trade related units met on the 23rd to discuss a series of issues, including how to increase the volume of imports from the United States. "We have tried our best to buy, so any additional purchases will be difficult."
Peng Jining, vice president of the US-China National Committee on Trade, said it was "more important than ever" to maintain the momentum of the first phase of the agreement, and said that China had made progress in further opening up its financial market to US companies this year.
"It is better to talk than not talk, although it may only be taken as a routine," said an analyst at Plenum, an independent research firm.
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 (Reporter Wei Yukun) The reporter learned from the Ministry of Emergency Management on July 26 that the State Prevention Office and the Ministry of Emergency Management, together with the State Food and Material Reserve Administration, once again urgently dispatched to Anhui six categories of central reserve flood prevention materials, including 1.35 million woven bags, 1.2 million square meters of woven cloth and 130,000 square meters of geotextile, to support the flood rescue and rescue work in Anhui Province.
According to the person in charge of the Ministry of Emergency Management, at present, the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Huaihe River basin maintain high water level fluctuations. The "No. 3 Flood of the Yangtze River in 2020" formed in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River on the 26th, increasing the risk in some areas.
The meteorological department predicts heavy rainfall in Chongqing, Guizhou and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in the next three days, and the flood prevention situation is still severe and complex.
According to the report, since the onset of the flood, the Ministry of Emergency Management has deployed national comprehensive fire rescue teams to pre-position professional rescue forces to key flood prevention areas, taking part in 10,364 flood rescue and rescue operations, sending more than 130,000 commanders, 17,778 fire trucks and 1,1887 boats to rescue 37,777 trapped people in distress and evacuate and transfer more than 107,000 trapped people.
Hao Yusheng, Chief Representative of NASDAQ China: Now is the best time for Chinese companies to IPO in the US - Economic Watch - professional financial news website
Zhang Bin, a reporter from the Economic Watch Network, said that because of the Ruisheng coffee counterfeiting incident, the US market has imposed stricter supervision on CICC shares, and the long-term pressure on valuation has put pressure on CICC shares listed in the US. Netease, JD.com and other CICC stocks have recently started their journey back to Hong Kong for listing.
Recently, companies such as Shell and Ideal Automobile have become enthusiastic about listing in the United States.
Is this the best time for Chinese companies to list in the United States under the epidemic and the China Stock Market crisis?
"As far as the recent IPO cases and the companies that are going to list in the United States are concerned, the IPO in the United States has not been affected in essence, but the market is very good now, and even this time is the best time for Chinese companies to IPO in the United States in the past 10 years."
Hao Yusheng, chief representative of the China region of the NASDAQ Stock Exchange, said at the "2020 Listed Companies Leaders Summit," hosted by Snowball.
In April this year, the Securities Regulatory Commission of the United States (SEC) and the Public Company Accounting Regulatory Board of the United States (PCAOB) issued the Statement on the Important Role of Audit Quality and Regulation in Obtaining Audit and Other International Information - A Discussion on the Challenges of Current Information Obtaining for US Listed Companies with Large Businesses in China.
The statement said that although the international cooperation and coordination have increased significantly in recent years, the US regulatory authorities still have problems in obtaining information, and the SEC and PCAOB still face legal and practical challenges. In contrast to the document, the PCAOB website details the list of listed companies and their audit institutions that have encountered audit obstacles, and a large number of Chinese companies are listed.
In addition, in May this year, the US Senate passed the Foreign Corporate Accountability Act, which introduced additional information disclosure requirements for foreign companies to list in the US.
According to Hao Yusheng, the crisis did not affect investors' appetite.
"When the news first came out, it caused everyone's panic. Everyone was asking whether they could go public in the United States in the future, but later we found that these questions were not a matter for investors. Investors might ask these questions at the road show of the IPO in the United States recently, and even become standardized questions, but this was not regarded by investors as an important factor for investing in or not investing in a Chinese company.
It is suggested that everyone try to take a normal view of the current situation.
Of course, this may appear to be the most serious situation in the past two years, but as far as investors' appetite is concerned, it has not been affected.
So the IPO boom in the US will continue from now until the end of this year or before the US election. "
On May 9 this year, Jinshan Cloud was officially listed on the US NASDAQ, becoming the first Chinese company to IPO in the US after the epidemic.
"The listing of Jinshan Cloud gives great confidence to the Chinese companies preparing for the IPO."
Hao Yusheng said.
According to the mid-stock data report released by Snowball for the first half of 2020, a total of 20 Chinese companies went to the United States for IPOs in the first half of this year, an increase of 17.6% over the same period last year. From the total initial fund-raising, 20 enterprises raised a total of 2.725 billion yuan, an increase of more than 52.4% compared with the same period last year. In terms of industry distribution, the number of IPOs in the health care industry in the first half of this year was outstanding, an increase of 100% over the same period last year.
According to Hao Yusheng, the Chinese companies that IPO in the United States in the first half of this year will be favored by investors for high-quality companies with strong fundamentals and growth.
In the short, medium and long term, Hao Yusheng continues to be optimistic about Ming China's IPO in the US.
"In the short term, the IPO boom in the US continues; in the medium term, Chinese companies have more choices, A-shares, Hong Kong shares and US shares, and people will take the US election and China-US relations as factors for market choice and timing; in the long run, everything will return to normal, and market fluctuations are cyclical, both politically and economically, and will eventually return to normal, and the stock market has always been volatile."
Hao Yusheng also said, "There are many uncertainties this year, but for high-quality companies, whether the market is good or bad, as long as they are solid and have growth that investors can see, other factors are relatively minor. Investors need to invest in excellent Chinese companies."

Then he came to the public space on the first floor of the National Grand Theatre and began a dialogue with Yang Yang, Zhang Haochen and the pianist of the National Grand Theatre in front of the three nine-foot pianos with stories. Gang Qiang discussed with them topics such as the maintenance and maintenance of the piano, the music of Rachmaninov, the normal life of the musicians and the preparation for the performance from the perspective of a senior piano enthusiast. At the end of the guided tour, Gang Qiang also collaborated with Zhang Haochen to "relay" Shuman's "Dream Song," which delighted the netizen audience.

Commentator of People's Daily: Concentrate on Doing Your Own Business and Build New Advantages for Future Development--On Learning and Implementing the Important Speech of General Secretary Xi Jinping at the Entrepreneurs' Symposium - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 25, People's Daily, July 26 Commentator article: Concentrate on doing your own business well and build new advantages for future development
At present, the global epidemic and the world economic situation are still severe and complex, and China's development is facing unprecedented challenges.
It is the key for us to cope with various risks and challenges to maintain strategic determination, enhance confidence in winning and concentrate on doing our own business well.
At the recent symposium of entrepreneurs, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed that under the current external environment of rising protectionism, depressed world economy and shrinking global market, we must concentrate on doing our own business well, give full play to the advantages of the domestic super-large market, gradually form a new development pattern with the domestic large cycle as the main body and the domestic and international cycles promoting each other, upgrade the level of modernization of the industrial chain supply chain, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation, accelerate the tackling of key technologies, and create new advantages for future development.
The watchdog is wise, the watchdog wins.
Under the external environment of the deepening development of economic globalization, markets and resources have played an important role in China's rapid development.
Now, the world under the impact of the epidemic is undergoing profound changes, facing more unstable and uncertain factors, and economic globalization is experiencing headwinds and backwaves.
An extremely important aspect is to take the expansion and satisfaction of domestic demand as the strategic basis for development, give full play to its own advantages, add impetus to China's economic development by thriving the domestic economy and smooth the domestic cycle, and drive the recovery of the world economy.
We should deeply realize that building a complete domestic demand system is related to China's long-term development and long-term stability.
The CPC Central Committee reviewed the current situation and clearly stated that it is necessary to firmly implement the strategy of expanding domestic demand to cope with the impact of the epidemic, to maintain the long-term sustained and healthy development of China's economy, and to meet the growing needs of the people for a better life.
The advantage of large economies is internal circulation.
With the world's most complete and largest industrial system, strong production capacity and perfect supporting capabilities, China has more than 100 million market players and more than 170 million people with higher education or various professional skills, as well as an ultra-large domestic demand market formed by 1.4 billion people, including more than 400 million middle-income groups, and is in the stage of rapid development of new industrialization, informatization, urbanization and agricultural modernization, with great potential for investment.
The socialist market economy and other basic socialist economic systems can not only stimulate the vitality of various market subjects, liberate and develop the social productive forces, but also promote efficiency, fairness and organic unity, and continuously realize common prosperity.
We should firmly grasp the strategic basis of expanding domestic demand, make production, distribution and circulation more dependent on the domestic market to achieve a virtuous circle, clarify the strategic direction of supply-side structural reform, and promote a dynamic balance between total supply and aggregate demand at a higher level.
We should accelerate the construction of a complete domestic demand system, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation and other innovations, accelerate the promotion of new and strategic industries such as the digital economy, intelligent manufacturing, life health and new materials, form more new growth points and poles, and gradually form a new development pattern with the domestic large cycle as the main body and the domestic and international double cycles promoting each other.
While openness brings progress, closure inevitably lags behind.
General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed many times that the door to China's opening will not be closed, but will only open wider and wider.
Taking the domestic cycle as the main body is not to operate behind closed doors, but to realize stronger and more sustainable development by giving full play to the potential of domestic demand, better connecting the domestic market with the international market, and making better use of the international and domestic markets and resources.
At the same time, there is no contradiction between expanding domestic demand and opening up. The smoother the domestic cycle, the more conducive it is to the construction of a new pattern of opening up and the formation of new advantages in participating in international cooperation and competition.
Although the international trend of protectionism is on the rise, we should stand on the right side of history, deepen reform, expand opening-up, strengthen open cooperation in the field of science and technology, promote the building of an open world economy and promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.
The Chinese nation has experienced many tribulations in its history, but it has never been crushed. Instead, it has become more and more depressed and brave, constantly growing and rising from the tribulations.
On the way forward, with the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, the significant advantages of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, the strong mobilization ability and strong comprehensive strength, and the unity and struggle of the whole Party, the army and the people of all ethnic groups in the country, we will surely overcome all difficulties and obstacles, maintain the sound momentum of China's economic and social development, build a moderately well-off society in an all-round way, and successfully start a new journey to build a modern socialist country in an all-round way!
Is it "retaliatory" to save money after "90 years" of declining income?
With the income of balance treasure falling, "after 90" not only did not escape balance treasure, but began to "retaliate" to save money?
According to the Report on Saving Money after 90 Years of Balance Treasure (2020 edition) released by the China Institute of New Economics and Alipay, in the first half of the year, "after 90 years" people prefer to save money: the amount of money saved per capita increased by nearly 40% compared with 2019.
Interestingly, "after 90 years," people tend to start with a small amount of money, with 60% saving less than 20 yuan on average...
Saving money with balance treasure has also become the saving habit of "after 90 years."
According to the data, 134 million of the 700 million balance treasure users are "after 90 years."
There are 174 million "post-90" in China, that is, about three out of every four "post-90" in the country are saving money with the balance.
At present, the seven-day annualized yield of money funds such as Balance Bank has fallen to about 1.5% from above 2% at the beginning of the year.
Even so, it did not affect the pace of saving money after "90."
Under the background of improving the "saving effect" of balance treasure, many young people who are used to using balance treasure are also directly transformed into "basic people."
Alipay data shows that as of July 13, the number of new "basic people" on Alipay has more than doubled year-on-year, and more and more young people have achieved "advanced" financial management on Alipay.
Some analysts believe that the flow of funds from the balance to the stock market is also an important reason for the clear decline in the share of the IMF in June.
The report also shows that after the "90s," girls tend to save more money, with an average of 20% higher than the amount of money saved by boys. Of the users who hold funds on Alipay platform, 60% are men, and women tend to choose a more prudent way of managing money than men.
After saving money, what is the plan after 90?
Alipay data shows that "after 90 years," users have the habit of saving money for the goal, with the most users taking travel as the goal.
Influenced by the epidemic, many "post-90" people saved money to prepare for travel after the epidemic. The resumption of cinemas also provided a new way to switch from saving money to consumption.
Let the bright Party flag fly high on the anti-flood embankment
Recently, the southern part of China has been affected by continuous rainfall, and the situation of flood prevention and control is very serious, causing disasters in 26 provinces (districts and cities), including Guizhou, Sichuan, Hunan, Guangxi, Guangdong and Hubei.
The disaster area is the order, the disaster area is the battlefield, and in the face of the disaster, the Party flag is the war flag. Party organizations at all levels, the vast majority of Party members, cadres and people's children and soldiers resolutely implement the important instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping on flood prevention and relief work, quickly join the first line of flood prevention, flood rescue and disaster relief, and become the backbone of the people in the disaster area and a vital force in the fight against floods.
The bright Party flag flying high on the anti-flood embankment is an expression of loyalty and a call of mission.
Before the disaster, a Party organization is a battle fort, and a Party member cadre is a flag.
On the anti-flood front in various places, Party organizations at all levels and the vast majority of Party members and cadres demonstrated a high degree of loyalty to the Party, obeyed the call of the Party Central Committee, and with the action of "look at me," the step of "follow me," and the courage of "I come first," they built iron and steel fortresses that could not be crushed and raised the backbone of China that could not be crushed.
The bright Party flag is flying high on the anti-flood embankment, which is the adherence of the position and the horn of the charge.
In the face of the flood disaster, Party organizations at all levels acted quickly, sounded the anti-flood "emergency trumpet" and planted the bright Party flag on the anti-flood embankment. The vast majority of Party members, cadres and people's children and soldiers stuck to the anti-flood position and used the will and action of "the Party flag is in the position" and "the flood will never retreat and never accept troops," thus becoming the most reassuring and trustworthy solid barrier for the people in the disaster area.
The bright Party flag flying high on the anti-flood embankment is selfless dedication and responsibility.
At a time of crisis, we should highlight the essence of Party members. At a time when the lives and property of the people are seriously threatened, Party members and cadres, people's children and soldiers leave their homes and care for everyone, give selfless dedication and dare to take responsibility, and take winning the hard battle of flood prevention, flood rescue and disaster relief as the main battlefield and parade ground for comprehensive inspection of ability, style and literacy. It is this spirit of selfless dedication and responsibility that greatly encourages the people in the disaster-stricken areas to overcome the disaster, and gathers up a strong spiritual force to win the flood prevention, flood rescue and disaster relief.
"People first, life first" is tested not only at ordinary times, but also at critical moments.
On the anti-flood embankment, the vast majority of Party members and cadres and the people's children and soldiers should let the people see the bright red Party flag, the figure of struggle and the voice of encouragement everywhere at any time, add color to the Party flag with the steel embankment that cannot be washed away by the flood, and let the bright Party flag fly high on the anti-flood embankment!

As he had contact with an infected PCOO employee, Andanar and 49 PCOO employees were tested for new crown pneumonia on the 24th.
The report released on the 25th showed that 10 employees tested positive.
Marvin Gatpayat, Deputy Minister of Administration and Legal Affairs of PCOO, said that the new administrative office building of the Ministry located in the presidential palace was scheduled to resume on the 27th, the day of President Duterte's fifth State of the Union address.
On the same day, Martin Andanal assured the public that PCOO would continue to perform its duties to the Filipino people, ensure the timely provision of important information to the public, and strengthen contact tracing and testing to avoid the further spread of the new crown pneumonia virus among PCOO staff.

France increases military investment in space - Xinhua News
French Defense Minister Florence Parly said on the 24th that France will increase its space defense budget by hundreds of millions of euros to develop military forces in space in order to prevent other countries from possible "unfriendly actions" in outer space.
Palley told Le Provence on the same day that between 2019 and 2025, the French space military project expenditure budget will increase from 3.6 billion euros (about 4.2 billion US dollars) to 4.3 billion euros (5 billion US dollars).
According to the French Military Planning Act 2019-2025 approved by the French Parliament in 2018, France is expected to upgrade its existing observation satellites and communications satellites, launch three electromagnetic listening satellites, and improve the modernization of space surveillance radar.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced last July that a military space command and an "aviation and space force" would be established within the French Air Force.
Palley said she would officially announce the establishment of the space force when she visited a military school in Salon, Provence.
Palley said that the space force belongs to the Air Force and will have 500 personnel by 2025.
She said: "The idea that space served the common interests of science is gone forever. Nowadays, space is the place where countries compete for global hegemony."
Palley reiterated Macron's previous statement that France has no intention of provoking an arms race.
"We are by no means engaged in an arms race. But it is my duty to fully understand the threats we may face."
Palley recalled the surveillance of a military satellite shared by France and Italy in 2017.
She said that the "voyeur" was a Russian satellite.
The Russian side denied this claim.
Palley said that France will soon have a small patrol satellite capable of detecting and locking "those behind unfriendly actions."
French media believe that France sought to establish a space force because US President Donald Trump asked the US Department of Defense to draft a bill to establish the Pacific Air Force last February.
Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act last December, approving the establishment of the Pacific Air Force, the sixth type of U.S. military.
Some experts worry that these US measures accelerate the pace of US space militarization and may trigger a new space arms race.

The report said that the shared accommodation market has been warming since March.
According to the "China Shared Accommodation Development Report 2020" (hereinafter referred to as the "Report") released by the Sharing Economic Research Center of the National Information Center, the transaction volume of China's shared accommodation market declined by 72.1% year on year in the first five months of 2020 due to the impact of the epidemic.
However, the shared accommodation market began to pick up since March, and the market turnover, order volume and reception number gradually recovered.
According to the Report, the sharp decline in the transaction volume of the shared accommodation market is due, on the one hand, to the sharp decline in the demand for travel and accommodation under the prevention and control of the epidemic, the sharp decrease in the number of orders, the total number of orders in the first five months decreased by 65% year-on-year and the number of receptions decreased by 63% year-on-year. On the other hand, the weak demand also led to a relatively obvious decline in overnight prices, with the average overnight price in the previous five months falling by 16% year-on-year.
However, in March, April and May, the volume of market transactions increased by 78%, 199% and 35% respectively; the number of orders increased by 141%, 152% and 50% respectively; and the number of receptions increased by 81%, 112% and 28% respectively.
The Report points out that the development of shared accommodation industry has been promising for a long time, but there are still many uncertainties in the near future.
In this regard, Yu Fengxia, deputy director of the Sharing Economic Research Center of the National Information Center, told the reporter of the Workers' Daily that the development of shared accommodation needs stronger policy support. On the one hand, we need to do a good job in the implementation of the policies already introduced in the previous period, further strengthen the policy advocacy and focus on creating a better business environment. On the other hand, we need to further strengthen policy guidance and support in many aspects, including stimulating consumer demand, enriching the supply of tourism accommodation services, innovating service methods and strengthening the cooperation between the government and platform enterprises.

Xiamen, July 26 (Yang Fushan Zhang Shushan Xu Jingyi) China's famous vascular surgery center, Shanghai Changhai Hospital of Naval Medical University, signed a contract with Zhongshan Hospital of Xiamen University on July 25 to set up a collaboration center to promote exchanges and cooperation in the field of vascular surgery, especially in the field of acute and severe aorta.
Zhongshan Hospital affiliated with Xiamen University said that after the vascular surgery of the two hospitals formally formed a collaborative unit, they will carry out remote consultation, make treatment plan with Changhai Hospital in real-time online consultation, select talents for further study and training, and jointly carry out weekly surgical technology exchange, teaching and room inspection. For complex cases, Changhai experts can be invited to the hospital to perform surgery according to the needs of patients, so that patients in southwest Fujian can enjoy the top medical resources in China without going to the province.
The two hospitals will also work together to carry out innovative scientific research on surgery, popularization of aortic diseases and early screening.
The special seminar on aorta sponsored by Beijing Health Promotion Association and hosted by Zhongshan Hospital affiliated with Xiamen University was held in Xiamen on the same day.
At the same time, the two well-known hospitals in Shanghai and Ha held the signing ceremony of the vascular surgery collaboration center and announced the formation of a collaborative unit to jointly improve the treatment of vascular surgery-related diseases in southwest Fujian.
Shanghai Changhai Hospital Vascular Surgery is the only Institute of Vascular Surgery in the army and the only clinical medical center for vascular system diseases in Shanghai. It is also the first national key discipline of vascular surgery. It leads the establishment of the Professional Committee of Intraperitoneal Vascular Sciences of the Chinese Physicians Association and is a well-established top team in the industry.
Professor Huang Xiaojin, director of vascular surgery at Zhongshan Hospital affiliated with Xiamen University, was interviewed by the media.
Vascular surgery of Zhongshan Hospital affiliated with Xiamen University is the first independent vascular surgery in Fujian Province. It has long been committed to the diagnosis and treatment of aortic and peripheral vascular diseases. In 2018, it was approved to build a provincial key clinical specialty.
In the treatment of aortic diseases, in addition to the treatment of dissection aneurysms and aortic aneurysms, he has extensive experience in emergency treatment of ruptured aortic aneurysms.
"Since the development of vascular surgery at Zhongshan Hospital affiliated with Xiamen University, the scope, difficulty and complexity of the operation are outstanding in this region. Therefore, this time we set up a coordination center to carry out in-depth cooperation in medicine, teaching and scientific research in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases such as lower extremity artery and carotid artery, in addition to the aorta."
Professor Feng Rui, deputy director of vascular surgery at Shanghai Changhai Hospital, said.
Zhongshan Hospital affiliated with Xiamen University and Shanghai Changhai Hospital signed a contract to set up the "Li Zhaoshen Famous Medical Studio" of Digestive Medicine in 2018.
Professor Huang Xiaojin, director of vascular surgery of the hospital, said in an interview with the China News Service that the vascular surgery of the hospital has also had a long history of communication with Changhai Hospital. This time, the two hospitals formally formed a collaborative unit, bringing the cooperation and exchange between the two sides to a new level.
He said that the hospital will regularly invite Shanghai experts to the building to carry out surgical technology exchange, teaching and room inspection, and discussion of difficult cases. At the same time, it will further carry out remote consultation, which is currently planned once a week. In addition, departments will select personnel for further study and exchange to strengthen the training and development of subject talents.
The reporter learned at the meeting that vascular disease is the leading cause of death in China and that the aorta, as the main artery of all human organs, flows from the heart to the whole body and plays an important role.
The occurrence of aortic diseases is often accompanied by high risk, high mortality rate and high difficulty of treatment. The diameter of the thickest section of the aorta is up to 4 cm. Once a hemangioma is formed, rupture occurs, or the rupture of the endometrium produces dissection, it will cause heavy bleeding, which is very dangerous.
In recent years, with the change of people's lifestyle and the acceleration of the pace of life, China has become the world's largest country of hypertension, and the number of aortic diseases has increased. Nowadays, with the development of surgical technology and industrial materials, the treatment of aortic diseases continues to develop in the direction of minimally invasive, rapid and efficient.
Doctors can "reroute" the blood flow properly by puncture from the thigh and placement of a stent in the aorta, so as to avoid the impact on aneurysms or ruptured dissections and achieve good treatment results. Some operations even require only local anesthesia.
The symposium invited more than ten domestic experts to discuss the new progress in the treatment of aortic diseases, and conducted cutting-edge technical training and difficult case discussion in the form of conference salon.
The reporter learned at the meeting that with the development of surgical technology and industrial materials, the treatment of aortic diseases continues to develop in the direction of minimally invasive, rapid and efficient.

It is necessary to pay continuous attention to the impact on the flood situation of the Yangtze and Huaihe rivers. The embankments in some areas of the Yangtze and Huaihe river basins have been soaked at high water level for a long time, and the risk of landslides, collapses and pipe surges is high.
After consultation and judgment, the State Defense Administration decided to continue to maintain the flood prevention level 2 response of the Yangtze River and Huai River.
On the 25th, the meeting of the Ministry of Water Resources stressed that the dry stream in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River maintained a high water level, and the flood peak of the dry stream of the Huai River passed through the Bengbu River section of Anhui Province. The water level of Taihu Lake has been exceeded for 28 days and 9 days. The current flood prevention situation is still serious. The flood prevention work cannot be relaxed at all. We should continue to do a solid job in all kinds of defense work.
At the same time, we should prevent heavy rainfall in southwest and north China.
The Ministry of Water Resources maintains the level 2 emergency response for water and drought disaster prevention.
At the request of the Jiangxi Provincial Prevention Office, the State Prevention Office and the Emergency Management Department urgently dispatched 20 sets of high-flow professional flood drainage vehicles from the general fire rescue teams of Shandong, Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and Fujian Longyan Overseas Dragon Emergency Equipment Co., Ltd. to help solve the serious disasters in Jiangxi caused by the heavy rainfall, such as urban flooding and farmland blisters.
On the 25th, all the equipment arrived at Jiangxi flood rescue line.
According to the unified dispatch of the local government, the Jiangxi Front Command of the Fire and Rescue Bureau of the Ministry of Emergency Management immediately arranged for the Jiangxi Fire and Rescue General Team and the reinforcement forces of the surrounding provinces to set up 20 professional flood drainage teams to carry out flood drainage and rescue tasks in Nanchang, Jiujiang and Shangrao, Jiangxi Province.

On July 24, Aiqi Art "Journey" also embarked on the journey of webcasting - Xinhua
The action adventure film "Journey," directed by Chen Dsen, produced by Zheng Bao Rui and starring Liu Xianhua, He Rundong, Lin Chenhan and Jiang Jiuxia, will be launched on July 24.
This is also the second large-scale film to choose webcasting after "Mom."
The Journey, based on the online game of the same name, tells the story of Dong Yilong, a young man from Qingyuan Village, and Chu Soul, a warrior of the Chu Family Army, who embarked on a journey to participate in the selection of the Grand Marshal of the State of Southern Zhao. On the way, they met little sister Kong, and the three completed their mission together.
This year marks the 15th anniversary of the game's "journey," and the launch of the film of the same name is undoubtedly also a tribute to the classic game.
At the same time as the announcement, the film "Journey" released the "National War" version poster and the "Live" pilot trailer.
The excellent picture quality presents the grand picture of the national war on the journey to the world, and portrays the profound brotherhood of the two main characters, Dong Yilong and Chu Soul.
The Journey chose the overhead era to build the story background.
In the fictional mainland of the Central Plains, of the ten countries, the State of Southern Zhao and the State of Northern Yan live side by side.
In order to defend against the increasingly powerful Beiyan, Nan Zhao held a martial arts conference to select talents.
The news reached the remote village of Qingyuan. Dong Yilong, a villager, wanted to become the flag bearer of the family and compete on behalf of the Qingyuan family, but the villagers questioned his qualifications. After some efforts, Yi Long finally embarked on the journey with the warrior Chu Soul.
The total investment of the film was nearly 300 million yuan, and the total special effects lens accounted for up to 80%.
It is conceivable that the special effects have become one of the biggest points of view of The Journey.
The later special effects production team was also quite successful. MORE VFX, the special effects team that created Wandering Earth, was responsible for restoring the "journey" world with imaginative visual art and top technology.
Some of the classic game scenes, such as Phoenix, Qingyuan Village and the Valley of the Beast King, will also appear in the film, and the game players should set off a wave of nostalgia.
In addition to the special effects team, behind-the-scenes production is also a group of accomplished figures in the industry.
Director Chen Dsen has directed "October Siege" and "Purple Rain Storm." Producer Zheng Bao Rui has filmed "Kill the Wolf 2" and "A Journey to the West with Three Dozens of White Bones." The action scenes are the responsibility of Dong Wei, the best action director at the Golden Picture Awards and the Golden Horse Awards. Art director Ma Guoqiang is also the winner of the two Golden Picture Awards for Best American Finger.

China Railway Chengdu Bureau Group Company
China News Service Chongqing July 26 (reporter Han Lu) The reporter learned from China Railway Chengdu Bureau Group Co., Ltd. on July 26 that the 18.9-kilometer-long Zhengwang High-speed Railway XiaoThree Gorges Tunnel was fully connected that day.
It is understood that the Little Three Gorges Tunnel is not only the longest high-speed rail tunnel in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, but also the longest single-hole double-track high-speed rail tunnel designed to reach an speed of 350 km / h in the project under construction in China.
The Zhengwang high-speed railway is located in the three provinces and cities of Henan, Hubei and Chongqing. It connects the Beijing-Canton and Xulan high-speed railway in Zhengzhou to the north, and the Yuwang high-speed railway in Wanzhou to Chongqing in the south. It is an important part of the "eight vertical and eight horizontal" high-speed railway network along the river and the Hainan Tong Road.
The XiaoThree Gorges Tunnel of Zhengwan High-speed Railway was fully opened on the 26th.
The picture shows the scene.
The Zhengwang high-speed railway starts in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, and runs southwest via Pingdingshan City, Nanyang City, Xiangyang City, Hubei Province, to Wanzhou District, Chongqing. The new line is about 818 kilometers long, with a design speed of 350 kilometers per hour, and about 184 kilometers in Chongqing.
Among them, the Zhengzhou to Xiangyang section has been opened for operation on December 1, 2019, and the Chongqing section is stepping up construction.
The XiaoThree Gorges Tunnel, which runs through the entire line on the 26th, is a control project for the entire line of Zhengwang high-speed railway. The project is located at the junction of Fengjie and Wushan counties in Chongqing, with a total length of 18.9 kilometers and a maximum buried depth of 890 meters.
The tunnel started construction in February 2017 and was fully connected on July 26, 2020.
According to Wang Jun, head of Zhengwang High-speed Railway Tunnel Design, China Railway Second Academy Engineering Group Co., Ltd., the survey and design party, the topography and geological conditions of the location of the Little Three Gorges Tunnel are very complex, facing risks such as karst, mud inrush and large deformation of soft rock. It is a Grade I high-risk tunnel, which is very difficult to design and construct.
"During the construction of the project, we used geological survey, geophysical exploration and advanced drilling to advance geological prediction, and adopted special design schemes for more than 30 caves of various types. For example, we designed and built a 24-meter-long bridge to cross a large cave with a longitudinal length of more than 10 meters and a depth of more than 55 meters in the tunnel to avoid tunnel settlement," said the Royal Army.
According to the China Railway Tunnel Bureau, the construction party, the tunnel is constructed by combining diversion and blocking, ensuring the orderly progress of the project and avoiding the damage of construction drainage to the water body of the Little Three Gorges Scenic Area through the construction of horizontal tunnel guidance, grouting to block water, strengthening the structural support of the tunnel and building a sewage treatment station. At the same time, it has successfully overcome the construction difficulties such as the large deformation of soft rock up to 7 kilometers long and the multi-mud inrush with a maximum daily inrush of 157,000 cubic meters.
When the full line of Zhengwang high-speed railway is completed and opened to traffic, it will become a new convenient and fast main passenger transport route from the southwest to the Central Plains, North China and Northeast China. It is of great significance to improve the capacity and quality of the northeast-bound railway passage in the southwest, improve the layout of the regional road network, accelerate the development of tourism resources and urbanization along the route, promote the coordinated development of the region, and promote the implementation of the western development strategy.
Experts say it is unconstitutional to collect immigration data through the U.S. Census for the allocation of seats in the House of Representatives
Some civil rights organizations and several US cities and counties have filed a lawsuit against the US federal government, claiming that the Trump administration's attempt to exclude undocumented immigrants from the US census is unworkable and unconstitutional.
The U.S. Census will determine the allocation of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Sarah Brannon, executive lawyer of the American Civil Rights and Freedom League, told VOA, "This is not feasible."
She went on to say that Trump's requirement to determine the citizenship of census takers in the census was difficult to achieve and "not very reliable."
Common Cause, another civil liberties group, filed a lawsuit Thursday challenging Trump's executive order.
Some cities in New Jersey and Georgia joined the lawsuit.
Arlington County in Virginia joined the lawsuit Friday.
Garvey, chairman of the management board of Arlington County, said, "The United States Constitution requires an accurate count of our population every 10 years. We must accurately count everyone living in Arlington County. We must not allow this illegal attempt to scare away people and reduce the number of our immigrant community to succeed."
Other organizations and individuals praised President Trump's executive order.
Alabama Attorney General Marshall called the executive order a "victory" for the state.
He said, "The allocation of seats in the House of Representatives and the Electoral College of each state must be based on the number of residents living in each state and the number of legal residents."
The U.S. Supreme Court last year blocked the Trump administration from including the citizenship issue in the 2020 census.
President Trump signed an executive order earlier this week directing Secretary of Commerce Ross, who oversees the U.S. Census Bureau, to submit data on the undocumented population from the census so that the administration can exclude these undocumented people from the state census figures, and thus determine whether each state increases or reduces or maintains seats in the House of Representatives.
Every 10 years, the United States redistributes seats in the House of Representatives according to demographic changes.
Rainstorm in 33 districts and counties in Chongqing Initiates Level 4 Emergency Response for Flood Prevention
Xinhua News Agency Chongqing, July 26 (Reporters Ke Gaoyang and Li Song) The reporters learned from the Chongqing Flood Prevention and Drought Control Command that Chongqing has experienced a new round of heavy rainfall since July 25. Heavy rainfall has fallen in 33 districts and counties, and four sub-small and medium-sized rivers have experienced floods above the warning level. The local flood prevention level 4 emergency response has been launched.
According to the monitoring of Chongqing Hydrological Monitoring Station, from 0800 hours on the 25th to 0800 hours on the 26th, heavy to heavy rainfall occurred in most parts of Chongqing, and heavy rainfall occurred in 33 districts and counties, including Jiangjin, Qijiang and Wulong, including 16 districts and counties, including Wanzhou, Yunyang and Nanchuan.
The maximum daily rainfall was 197.5 mm in Longshan Village, Jinshan Town, Nanchuan.
Under the influence of heavy rainfall, four sub-small and medium-sized rivers, Donkey Creek in Jiangjin District, Oil River in Fuling District, Yingyang River in Kaizhou District and Yuantan River in Yunyang County, experienced over-alert water level floods, and the water level is still rising.
The heavy rainfall also caused a landslide in Liujing Village, Land Township, Wulong District, which disrupted the passage of village roads and roads. The landslide slipped into the tributaries of the Wujiang River along the Cangjiang River, blocking the river to form a quake lake. The local people have been urgently organized to move downstream.
In response to the heavy rain, the Chongqing Flood Prevention and Drought Control Command issued a level III flood warning information at 13: 00 on the 26th, and launched a level IV emergency response for flood prevention, requiring relevant districts, counties and units to strengthen inspection and duty, promptly mobilize emergency rescue teams and materials, and evacuate and transfer people in the threatened areas.
Respond to the situation and promote the construction of industrial projects - view headline - Hunan Daily - Huazeng Online
In Hunan in the middle of summer, the heat wave surfaced.
The enthusiasm released by the promotion of the construction of industrial projects in the province overshadowed the heat of the three-volt day, and the clear guidance of "industrial strength and project hero" encouraged Sanxiang and Sishui.
The development of Hunan always depends on construction projects and cultivation industries.
Facing the very unusual first half of the year, under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the whole province persisted in a game of chess and made every effort to fight the two hard battles of epidemic prevention and flood prevention, taking industrial projects as the "first step" to implement the "Six Stability" and "Six Guarantees."
From a year-on-year decline of 1.9% in the first quarter to a year-on-year increase of 1.3% in the first half of the year, the difficulties and efforts during this period are self-evident.
On this precious report card, the construction of industrial projects is the key support for Hunan's accelerated economic recovery and stable development.
The potential is smooth and irreversible.
The construction of industrial projects should be placed in the overall situation and be good at building up, accumulating and seeking momentum, as well as understanding, seeking change and adapting.
Against the background of the current complex and severe international situation, in addition to working hard to attract investment, it is also necessary to study the new characteristics of the current new situation, better grasp the laws, be more scientific and accurate, and better integrate into the new development pattern with the domestic large cycle as the main body and the domestic and international cycles promoting each other.
Pay more attention to upgrading the basic capabilities of industry.
In the first half of the year, not only did a large number of heavyweight investment projects in new and emerging industries in our province break ground and start, sowing hope, but also enterprises in traditional advantageous industries accelerated and fell behind in the digital, intelligent and green industrial transformation.
The Yiyang Aoxconn Third Science Park project has transformed the existing production lines, and the intelligent production line of high-end printed circuit boards has taken the lead; the new factory area of Hunan Zhongfang Changde Cigarette Factory is committed to the process of intelligent transformation and the construction of a modern factory, which is also a vivid picture of "old trees and new buds"... Only by focusing on the major national strategy and "two new ones, one heavy" can we consolidate and upgrade the dominant industries, actively cultivate and develop new industries, and comprehensively increase the efforts of scientific and technological innovation and domestic substitution, can we continuously consolidate the basic conditions and save the momentum of transformation.
We should pay more attention to the cultivation and development of new economic patterns.
The sudden outbreak of the new crown brought the popularity of the "cloud economy," stimulated the potential of the digital economy and provided new opportunities for industrial transformation: in the first half of the year, the computer and office equipment manufacturing industry and the electronics and communication equipment manufacturing industry in our province increased by 12.6%, the online retail sales of wholesale and retail enterprises above the limit increased by 32.2% year on year, and the online meal fee income of catering enterprises increased by 35.6% year on year.
It is the general trend to cultivate new opportunities during the crisis, open new situations during the changing situation, actively promote digital industrialization and industry digitization, and guide the integration and development of the digital economy and the real economy.
Pay more attention to optimizing and stabilizing the industrial chain supply chain.
Construction machinery is the main force of Hunan industry, but two-thirds of the supporting enterprises are outside the province, and there is still space and potential in the supporting chain.
Strengthening industrial chain thinking and projects requires not only the continuous accumulation of head enterprises and the realization of technological breakthroughs in key links of the industrial chain, but also the dedicated cultivation of all regions to stimulate the "chain" lock response with strong chain reinforcement and chain extension, promote the coordinated layout of relevant supporting industries, and accelerate the construction of an independent, controllable, safe and reliable industrial chain supply chain.
Overcoming difficulties and supporting enterprises, Hunan is still a hot and happy place with a good business environment and emerging market opportunities.
In the process of recovering the losses caused by the epidemic, various "ways and means" are used to find the right short-term pain points and achieve the vivid story of turning the crisis into an opportunity.
Focusing on studying, cultivating and developing industries and optimizing the business environment will surely win the favor of more investors.
The wind and waves are still ahead, but taking advantage of the wind and waves has become the norm for the construction of industrial projects and the promotion of high-quality development throughout the province.
In this critical period, we must learn and implement the spirit of the series of important instructions and instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping, use the certainty of our own work to effectively address external uncertainties, consistently promote the construction of industrial projects, and share enthusiasm and sweat to ensure the successful completion of the 13th Five-Year Plan and the overall establishment of a moderately well-off society.

Cultivating new business patterns and opening up new space for employment
New forms of employment have emerged, opening up new space for employment, and a number of innovative service policies have been introduced to help new forms of employment thrive.
The latest data from the National Bureau of Statistics shows that the nationwide urban survey unemployment rate was 5.7% in June, down 0.2 percentage points from May.
This is also the two consecutive reductions in the national urban survey unemployment rate since April. Behind the monthly decline in the unemployment rate data is the new employment opportunities emerging from new business patterns.
The current salary of more than 5,000 per month, combined with the novelty of embracing information technology, has made Guo Mei more and more energetic.
In the innovation incubation base of Shanxi Transformation and Comprehensive Reform Demonstration Area, there are more than 2,300 data taggers.
Not only is it a data tagger, but since this year, the state has also defined 25 occupations such as nucleic acid testers and online learning service providers as new occupations, developed vocational skill standards and launched skills training programs to help practitioners develop.
Aiming at new employment modes and new entrepreneurial paths, the country is also innovating employment services.
Recently, the National Development and Reform Commission and 13 other departments jointly issued the "Opinions on Supporting the Healthy Development of New Business Patterns and New Models, Activating the Consumer Market and Driving the Expansion of Employment," providing diverse employment opportunities for workers.
Multi-departments will work together to cultivate new individuals in the market, further reduce the cost of online entrepreneurship and employment for self-employed people, make new industry workers more secure, and introduce policies such as rights protection and social security for flexible employment.

The overall stability of employment and prices highlights the "temperature" of the economy

The overall stability of employment and prices highlights the "temperature" of the economy
Economic Daily China Economic Network reporter Lin Fengcang
In the first half of this year, in the face of the impact of the new crown pneumonia epidemic, China coordinated efforts to promote the prevention and control of the epidemic and economic and social development. The situation of epidemic prevention and control continued to improve, the steady economic recovery trend was obvious, the employment and price performance closely related to people's livelihood were generally stable, and the Chinese economy handed over a warm economic performance report card.
The survey unemployment rate rose in the first two months of this year.
Especially in February, the production and operation activities of many enterprises were basically shut down, the demand for employment of enterprises decreased, recruitment was delayed or cancelled, and the surveyed unemployment rate in cities and towns rose.
As the situation of epidemic prevention and control gradually improved, the order of production and life of the whole society was constantly restored.
The CPC Central Committee adheres to the general tone of stability and progress, further strengthens macro-policy hedging, comprehensively strengthens employment priority policies, and actively promotes the work of helping enterprises stabilize and expand employment.
China has increased its policy of hedging stable jobs, played a combination of policies of "relief and deferred compensation," phased reduction and reduction of the contribution portion of three social insurance units, allowed deferred payment of social insurance premiums, expanded the benefits of stable return of unemployment insurance for small and medium-sized and micro-sized enterprises, and provided employment absorption subsidies and trainee subsidies to enterprises to absorb key groups.
With the implementation of various stable employment policies, the employment demand of enterprises has steadily recovered, the employment situation has gradually improved, and the surveyed unemployment rate in cities and towns has gradually decreased. In June, the surveyed unemployment rate was 5.7%.
Zhang Yi, director of the Population and Employment Statistics Department of the National Bureau of Statistics, said that in the second quarter, various employment policies continued to bear fruit, and the labor force who had withdrawn from the previous period due to the impact of the epidemic returned successively. The urban labor force participation rate in June increased by about 10 percentage points compared with February, which was close to the same period last year.
According to the data, the total number of urban employment in June increased by more than 19% compared with February, and most industries reached the pre-epidemic level; the average working week of employees in enterprises reached 46.8 hours, 6.6 hours higher than in February and 0.1 hours higher than in January.
Prices also affect families.
In January this year, the year-on-year increase in CPI was 5.4%, a new high in many years.
In February, although the year-on-year increase in CPI fell slightly, it was still in the "5 range."
The year-on-year increase in CPI was at a high level, driven by consumer demand before the Spring Festival, the wrong month of the Spring Festival and the low year-on-year base.
However, the impact of the new crown pneumonia epidemic on prices is particularly obvious.
Influenced by the epidemic prevention and control, in January and February, all parts of the country experienced delays in logistics, untimely supply of goods and materials, and increased transportation costs of materials. In addition, some citizens hoarded and rushed to buy, resulting in a marked increase in the prices of some necessities of life.
In order to cope with the disturbance caused by epidemic prevention and control to the price situation, the relevant departments have included important living materials in the scope of emergency transportation guarantee to ensure the smooth transportation of materials.
Under the influence of a series of policy measures, the market supply of vegetables, melons and fruits has been effectively guaranteed.
In order to cope with the rapid rise in pork prices at the beginning of this year, after the Central Government introduced the policy of ensuring supply and stabilizing prices, all regions and departments quickly implemented it, significantly improved the supply of pork reserves, orderly recovery of pig production capacity, and gradually normal production and marketing order.
Since March, pork prices have declined continuously, and the year-on-year increase in food prices fell to 10.6% in May. In June, pork prices rose slightly in the ring ratio due to factors such as the slowdown in the exit of pigs, the reduction of imports and the recovery of group consumption demand.
The seasonal variation of fresh vegetable prices is obvious, with an average increase of 3.4% in the first half of the year.
Influenced by the high comparison base in the same period last year, fresh fruit prices continued to decline year-on-year, with an average decline of 13.3% in the first half of the year.
The basic livelihood of the masses is effectively guaranteed, and the overall economic and social situation remains stable and orderly.
With the gradual recovery of transportation and logistics, all regions have increased their guarantee, and the market supply and demand situation has improved.
Since March, the CPI has declined for four consecutive months, and the year-on-year increase has also fallen from 4.3% in March to 2.5% in June, and the overall price level has returned to stability.
In the second half of the year, China's prices will continue to maintain a moderate level, with little overall inflationary pressure, but we should still promote the restoration of the order of production and life on the premise of normalizing epidemic prevention and control.
We should effectively deal with natural disasters such as floods and droughts in the main producing areas of grain, fruits and vegetables and other agricultural products, strengthen market supervision, and resolutely crack down on acts that disrupt market order such as hoarding and inflating prices.

The new book reveals that Prince Harry thought his brother was "snobbish and arrogant"
Britain's The Times and The Sunday Times have serialized a new book called Finding Freedom, which describes the royal life of Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle.
However, Reuters reported that Harry and Meghan had dissociated themselves from the book, saying they had not accepted the author's interview or provided any content.
The Sunday Times reported that the new book quoted sources saying that when Harry and Meghan dated before marriage, Prince William wanted to confirm whether Meghan, a former Hollywood actress, had ulterior motives for Harry.
According to the source, William once said to Harry, "Don't feel the need to rush (to marry Megan).
You can spend as much time as possible to get to know the girl. "
The report said that when Harry heard William use "this girl" to describe Megan, he felt arrogant and snobbish in his brother's tone, and he thought he no longer needed to be cared for and reminded.
Harry and Meghan announced in January this year that they plan to live a more independent life and will support themselves.
After they officially resigned as senior members of the royal family in March, they are now living in Los Angeles with their son Archie to pursue a new career.
Harry and Meghan got married in May 2018.
At that time, the marriage was seen as injecting the glitter of Hollywood and a new era into the British royal family, and the two became one of the most watched celebrity couples in the world.

Experts reminded that it was cloudy and rainy today and tomorrow, so it was necessary to bring raingear to go out, pay attention to lightning protection, avoid rain and traffic safety, avoid mountain activities and prevent geological disasters.

In the 1980s, under the mediation of Yin Ruocheng and others, Arthur Miller came to China to rehearse his work for Beijing Humanities.
The reading of the play was composed entirely of a class of young actors in Beijing humanities. Under the leadership of director Tang Ye, a rehearsal was conducted for two weeks. Everyone created character sketches in order to analyze the characters in depth, with a view to re-examining the realist drama after nearly 40 years.
Today, the opening ceremony of the 2020 Hunan Red Tourism and Culture Festival and the first Xiangtan Red Culture Industry Expo was held in Shaoshan.
Zhang Hongsen, member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Committee and Minister of Propaganda of the Provincial Committee, announced the opening of the Red Tourism and Culture Festival, and Vice Governor Wu Guiying spoke.
Hunan Red Tourism and Culture Festival has been successfully held for 16 sessions and is a well-known brand of red tourism in China.
The festival was co-sponsored by the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Committee, the Provincial Department of Culture and Tourism and the Xiangtan Municipal Committee and Municipal Government.
Wu Guiying said that the holding of this festival is of great significance to implement the important instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping to "make good use of red resources, carry forward the red tradition and pass on the red gene," further grasp the development of red tourism in our province, promote the revival of the culture and travel market, and unite the "red power" into a broad joint effort to build a rich, beautiful and happy new Hunan Province.
It will certainly play a more active role in promoting the red culture, inheriting the red spirit, stimulating tourism consumption and promoting the high-quality development of Hunan tourism.
At the opening ceremony, the two activities of "Red-moving Hunan and Jiangxi and Praising China" Red Dance Invitational Competition and "Returning to the Long March and Crossing the Side of Hunan and Jiangxi" were launched simultaneously.
During the festival, there will also be activities such as the promotion and signing ceremony of Xiangtan industrial projects, the Red Tourism Five Good Lecturers Forum and the Red Education and Training Seminar, the Red Smart Cultural Travel Experience Exhibition and the sharing of new technologies, and the Hunan Mountain Song Invitational Competition, such as "Hunan Water is Homologous and Culture is Homologous."
During the opening ceremony, Zhang Hongsen, Wu Guiying and other leaders and guests toured the site of the First Red Cultural Industry Expo in Xiangtan and watched the live performance of "China Made a Mao Zedong."
As an artist, connection is very important to me.
Through my works of art, I try to show that human beings are not separated from nature but that everything is interrelated.
I went to Antarctica for the first time about 10 years ago. I also saw the iceberg for the first time.
I was in awe.
My heart pounded quickly and my head was dizzy, trying to understand what was in front of me.
The iceberg beside me surfaced almost 200 feet above the water. I can only feel very strange that one snowflake covers another and forms year after year.
Icebergs are formed when they break off from glaciers or from ice shelves.
Each iceberg has its own unique personality.
They interact with their surroundings and situations in a distinct way.
Some icebergs refuse to compromise and stick to it, while others cannot bear to collapse under a sudden surge of fierce passion.
When you see icebergs, it is easy to think that they are all isolated. They are independent and integrated, more like what we humans sometimes think of ourselves.
But the reality goes far beyond that.
As the iceberg melts, I breathe its ancient smell.
As the iceberg melts, it releases fresh water rich in minerals, which nourishes everything.
I set out to take pictures of these icebergs as if I were taking pictures of my ancestors. I learned that at these individual moments, icebergs existed in that way but will never exist like that again.
When they melt, it is not death; nor is it an end, but a continuation of the road to life.
Some of the icebergs I photographed are very young -- thousands of years old.
Some ice is more than 100,000 years old.
The last picture I want to show you is an iceberg I took on Kekertsuatsiak in Greenland.
This is a very rare opportunity to actually witness an iceberg tumbling.
So this is just like the picture.
On the left you can see a small boat.
This is a boat of about 15 feet.
I want you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and its deformation on the surface of the water.
Here you saw it began to roll, the boat moved to the other side and a man was standing there.
This is an average size Greenland iceberg.
It surfaced about 120 feet or 40 meters high.
The video was shot in real time.
(Music) is like this iceberg. They show people different aspects of their personality.
Thank you.
(Applause)

Hainan, Qinghai, July 26, China News Service (CNS) Question: "Flower Sea Direct Sowing Room" by Lake Qinghai: "Sweet" brings goods to help farmers increase their incomes
Author Hu Guilong Pan Yujie
"In the middle of summer, Qinghai Lake is full of golden flowers and thousands of bees flying. It has a high altitude, a large temperature difference between day and night, and less air pollution. The strong light breeds the most tenacious and generous swarms, creating the characteristics of Qinghai royal jelly with high activity, high protein, high nutritional value, low sugar and low fat."
On the 26th, Zhang Jianxun, deputy director of the Industry and Information Administration of Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, said.
On the same day, the live carrying event of "Spring Pulp to Help Farmers" bee products was held on the banks of Qinghai Lake. The China Bee Products Association, representatives of entrepreneurs, bee farmers and other parties gathered to jointly promote Qinghai characteristic bee products. A total of nearly 10,000 bottles of royal jelly from Qinghai Plateau were sold online and offline, with a total carrying value of nearly 3.8 million yuan.
The picture shows bee farmers on-site display of bee products.
It is reported that this live carrying activity, with the help of Beijing Houde Beekeeping chain network, Quickhand, Taobao and other well-known domestic bee products retail enterprises, live broadcasting and e-commerce platforms, has promoted the exchange and cooperation of "enterprises + beekeepers + growers," and continued to issue "Qinghai Plateau Spring Pulp Consumer Coupons" to consumers through online and offline channels, with the total profits expected to be nearly 5.28 million yuan.
In this regard, Yan Na, president of Beijing Houdeli Bee Industry Co., Ltd. believes that "it is very worthwhile": "This move can expand the popularity of Qinghai bee products, attract more consumers to understand and like bee products without adding pure nature, and drive beekeepers to increase their incomes."
At present, the company has signed a production cooperation strategic agreement with Qinghai Cloud Bee Industry Co., Ltd. and Qinghai Huabao Bee Industry Co., Ltd. to jointly promote the development of the local bee industry in Qinghai.
The picture shows the rapeseed sea by the lake in Qinghai.
This spring, due to the need to set up road checkpoints for epidemic prevention and control, the road of beekeepers to "chase flowers for honey" was blocked. Many bees died because they missed the flowering period and lacked food, seriously affecting the income of beekeepers.
"Throughout the year, beekeepers travel long distances following the flowering period and move all the way north from Yunnan and Sichuan to northwest China. They live in the open, have no fixed place and work very hard.
As an enterprise, we have the responsibility to help them. "
<unk> said.
"Small bees are 'environmental scouts', and bees cannot live in areas with serious pollution," said Zhao Xiaochuan, executive vice president of the China Bee Products Association. Bee pollination is an important part of the ecological chain and plays an irreplaceable role in protecting plant diversity and improving the ecological environment.
At the same time, bee pollination can increase the yield and improve the quality of crops, especially in areas with widespread cultivation and poor management conditions, which is of greater significance.
Research data show that pollination can increase the production of rapeseed by about 15-30%.
The picture shows Zhao Xiaochuan (right), Executive Vice President of China Bee Products Association, introducing Qinghai bee products.
"The economic, ecological and social benefits created by bee pollination far outweigh the value of bee products themselves. The bee industry has great potential in human health, crop production, vegetation reproduction and ecological protection, which has always been poorly understood."
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
Nowadays, the number of beekeepers is less and less. In addition to the beekeepers, many poor households with limited mobility choose to take beehives into the cooperative.
"The state has financial support, and we contact technical personnel for guidance. Beekeepers lack understanding and judgment on the market environment. To open a market, they also need the help and coordination of the government, enterprises and industry associations."
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
"I hope you will pay more attention to and help beekeeping groups in the future," said Yina. "Our beekeeping products are also screened and controlled in strict accordance with national standards to ensure quality and protect the rights and interests of consumers while helping beekeepers."
Affected by the continuous rainfall, since July 22, the soil at the back of the Zhongbao landslide in Liujing Village, Zhongtai Formation, Land Township, Wulong District, Chongqing has cracked, and a large area of slip deformation has occurred, completely blocking the flow along the Canghe River, forming a weir plug with a water level of 13 meters in front of the dam and an estimated reservoir capacity of about 550,000 cubic meters.
In order to ensure the safety of navigation, the Chongqing Maritime Department decided to implement temporary traffic control in the waters from the boundary stone plate of the Yangtze River to Guanyin Beach.
According to the monitoring of the Chongqing Meteorological and Hydrological Department, since the 25th, moderate to heavy rainfall has been common in the central and northeastern regions of Chongqing, with heavy rainfall in some areas and local heavy rainfall.
Qijiang Xiaohe Dam Station will have the highest water level on the 26th night, and the highest water level is close to the warning level.
In order to ensure the safety of navigation, the Chongqing Maritime Department decided to implement temporary traffic control in the waters from the boundary stone plate of the Yangtze River to Guanyin Beach.
After an emergency consultation between the Chongqing Municipal Flood Prevention Office and the departments and units of meteorology, water conservancy and hydrology, the Chongqing Flood Prevention and Drought Control Command decided to issue level III early warning information for river floods and initiate level IV emergency response for flood prevention.
The Chongqing Flood Prevention and Drought Control Command requires that the districts and counties of Jiangbei, Shapingba, Tongnan, Wulong and the relevant member units of the Chongqing Flood Control Bureau should pay high attention to the rainwater situation, especially the changes of the rising water of the Yangtze, Jialing and Wujiang rivers, analyze and judge in advance, issue early warning, strengthen inspection and duty, resolutely and decisively evacuate and transfer the people in the threatened areas, promptly mobilize emergency rescue teams and materials, quickly and efficiently deal with the disaster (risk) situation, and avoid the occurrence of mass casualties.
Zheng Shixin, Minister Counsellor of the Vietnamese Embassy in Laos, representatives of the Buddhist Association of Vietnam in Laos, the General Association of Vietnamese in Laos, the Vientiane Provincial Government and the Lao Veterans Association attended the ceremony.
The ceremony was held in a solemn and solemn atmosphere. The delegates successively honored the heroes and remembered their great achievements and the special solidarity between them.
In his speech, Minister Counsellor Zheng Shixin said that this is an opportunity for the old Vietnamese and Lao people to jointly remember the revolutionary heroes of the two countries and express their gratitude for the heroes who died for the independence and freedom of the two countries. At the same time, it is also a good opportunity for the two peoples to recall that the two countries worked together to fight against common enemies, strive for national independence, national reunification, jointly build national development and consolidate bilateral relations.
On January 23, 1946, 74 years ago, 28 soldiers of the Lao-Vietnamese Combat League died bravely when attacking the Phonehe stronghold.
The victory of the attack became a historic victory for the two countries in the early stage of the revolutionary struggle for national liberation.
Ms. Zheng Shixin stressed that the two peoples will always remember the heroes who sacrificed for the cause of the national liberation struggle of the two countries. At the same time, she stressed that the young areas of the two countries will continue to carry forward the heroic and strong traditions of their predecessors and make due contributions to the continued flowering and fruitful relations between the two countries and the prosperity and development of the two countries.
A landmark leap!
Inter Milan Unlock 3000th Serie A Match - Chinatown
On the morning of July 26, Beijing time, the traditional Serie A giants Inter Milan ushered in a milestone battle.
According to Italian media statistics, the away game against Genoa was the 3,000th Serie A game in the history of Inter Milan, and the Nerazzurri was also the first team to unlock this milestone.
Since the league reform in 1929, Inter is the only team that has never been absent from Serie A and the only team that has never been relegated.
According to Italian media, the match between Inter and Genoa was the 3,000th match in the history of the Nerazzurri team.
In this landmark battle, Inter defeated Genoa with three goals away.
Lukaku scored twice and Sanchez, who played as a substitute, also contributed a goal.
The game entered the rhythm of Inter from the beginning, and the strong attack finally turned into a goal in the 34th minute.
In Bilagi's left pass, Lukaku scored a header in the middle.
In the 82nd minute, Inter did the same. Moses broke through the backpass on the right and Sánchez scored well in the middle. Before the end of the game, Lukaku scored twice and Brozovic sent a long-distance straight stopper in the counter-attack. Lukaku broke into the penalty area and swung past Romero and then pushed an empty goal to score, setting the score at 3: 0.

The statement said the drone crashed into Lebanese territory while the Israeli army was carrying out a mission near the "Blue Line" on the border between Israel and Lebanon.
The statement did not mention the cause of the drone crash.
Israeli media reported that the drone may have crashed due to malfunction.
According to reports, Israeli Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gantz said during a visit to northern Israel that afternoon that Israel would continue to take actions against Syria and Lebanon in order to ensure its security interests.
Israel has long regarded Hezbollah as a major security threat and accused Iran of sending weapons to Hezbollah through the Syrian land corridor. The situation near the Israeli-Lebanese border was tense at times.
Israel has repeatedly carried out air strikes against targets in Syria on the pretext of attacking the organization.
Liu Yunlong, an old face of spy drama, plays a stammering hero - Xinhua
Produced by Liu Yunlong, directed by Yin Fei, and starring Liu Yunlong, Su Qing, Liang Guanhua, Li Liqun and others, the large-scale spy drama "Chance of Winning" landed at the "Vibration Theatre" of Guangdong Television at 7: 30 p.m. on July 16.
The play tells the story of Tang Fei (Liu Yunlong), an underground member of the Communist Party of China lurking in the Japanese fake police station, joining forces with Soviet agents to assassinate the leader of the Japanese secret service and crush the Japanese army's shocking plot.
"Winning" is based on historical facts and the material is taken from the dusty Soviet military archives for many years.
During the defense of Moscow, the elite of the Soviet Red Army in the Far East advanced west to help. At this time, the "northward advance" of the Japanese Kandong Army thought it was an opportunity and wanted to send troops.
In order to solve the danger of the enemy, the Communist Party of China and the intelligence personnel of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union jointly implemented the "Mudanura" plan.
According to this historical background, well-known screenwriter Deng Yuan has been polishing several times to make the plot twists and turns burn his mind.
Liu Yunlong served as both producer and lead actor in "Winning."
In the play, he plays Tang Fei, the head of the criminal section of the Linhe Police Department. He is a very happy and even a little ruffian stuttering policeman. His real identity is a member of the underground Communist Party of China.
Cai Meng, the heroine opposite him, is the head of the Linhe Security Bureau, which is deeply appreciated by Japanese boss Fukuhara, and has an ambiguous and delicate relationship with Tang Fei.
Su Qing has tried many different types of characters in recent years, from Lu Ruowen in "We Were Young in Those Years" to Erqing in "The Enlightenment of the Jubilee," which impressed the audience and recognized his acting skills.
This time Su Qing and Liu Yunlong are partners for the first time. The setting of the stammering police chief with charming policewomen is quite new.
In addition to the two main characters, Liang Guanhua, Li Liqun, Qian Bo, Lei Han, Shen Junyi and many other powerful actors joined in "Chance of Winning." The old opera is also one of the points of the play.
It is understood that "Chance of Winning" is also very well produced, with the crew shooting nearly 2,000 kilometers across Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Liaoning provinces.
In order to restore the strange urban landscape of the Northeast Japan Period, the artistic props team of the production team worked day and night to carefully polish every detail of the scene construction and props, making the scenes in the play delicate and full of historical quality.
16 people killed by floods in two western provinces of Yemen
Xinhua News Agency, Kuwait City, July 26 (Reporter Nie Yunpeng Wang Wei) Sana'a News: According to the report of local Yemeni media on July 26, the provinces of Hodeida and Hajjah in western Yemen were hit by heavy rainfall. Floods have killed at least 16 people in the past 48 hours.
It is reported that 13 people were killed in the flood caused by the rainfall in Hodeida province, and three people were killed in the flood in nearby Hajj province.
In addition, dozens of houses in the northern part of Hodeida Province and the southern part of Hajjah Province were destroyed by the flood, and some roads and farmland were damaged to varying degrees.
Years of military conflict have resulted in the near collapse of Yemen's health system.
According to the statistics of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the number of people infected with cholera in Yemen has exceeded 1 million and the death toll has exceeded 2,000 since 2017.
Yemeni medical institutions are worried that the continued floods will lead to the spread of the cholera epidemic again.
"Strike of the Jedi" is released.
Directed by young director Gao Zhuang and starring Liao William, Dongyu, Yang Xinyi and Wang Yimbo, the online film Jedi Strike was officially released at Aichi Art.
The film tells the story of the fallen boxer Venus returning to the ring and fighting for dignity, and shows a hot-blooded dream-driven journey.
The film "Strike of the Jedi" takes Thailand as the main plot and takes "Thai boxing" as the starting point for the fallen boxer Venus to pursue his dream. The whole story is adapted from the traditional Chinese cultural values. Both Venus' determination to fight fake boxing for the sake of his master in the early stage and his efforts to fight for dignity with the support of his friends and loved ones in the later stage show the pursuit and great love of men for their families and dreams in the traditional Chinese culture.
Combined with the classic Hollywood sports film story model and the strong joint efforts of the professional teams of China and Thailand, Jedi Strike not only presents an international effect, but will also impress different types of audiences.
At the same time, "Strike of the Jedi" shows a lot of Thai boxing fighting and training, the intensity and blood of the scene.
In the film, the game designer Zhang Xiaoliang, played by Dongyu, helps Venus, played by William Liao, return to the ring and take off the laurel crown through the fighting game, combining novel and interesting high-tech with hot-blooded competitive competition, and also shows the brotherhood between Zhang Xiaoliang and Venus, which seem to be "different ways" and have the same goals.
In addition, the long-running love between Venus and Jingjing is also very touching. Jingjing's silent support to Venus and Venus' firm commitment to Jingjing have made the audience see the "iron tenderness" of Venus and added a lot of human feelings to the fallen boxing king.

Greenfield Launches a New Round of Mixed Reform of Shanghai State Capital to Transfer 17.5% Shares - Economic Watch - Professional Financial News Website
Economic Watch reporter Rao Xianjun On July 26, Greenfield Holdings (600606.SH) issued the "Indicative Notice on the Proposed Transfer and Relicensing of Some Shares of the Company by State-owned Shareholders through Public Collection of Transferees."
According to the announcement, in order to further deepen the reform of state-owned enterprises, optimize the structural adjustment of the layout of state-owned enterprises and improve the ownership structure of green space, Shanghai Real Estate (Group) Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Shanghai Real Estate") and Shanghai CIC (Group) Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Shanghai CIC") intend to transfer some of the company's shares by agreement through public solicitation of transferees, and the total proportion of shares to be transferred shall not exceed 17.5% of the total share capital of green space.
The price of the shares to be transferred is not lower than the higher of the following: the arithmetic average of the daily weighted average price for the 30 trading days before the indicative announcement day (July 27, 2020); and the audited net asset value per share of the company in the most recent fiscal year.
At present, there is still uncertainty about the new strategic investors of Greenfield. According to the public announcement, it is estimated that the new strategic investors will need to pay about 14 billion yuan to acquire the 17.5% equity transferred in the mixed reform of Greenfield.
It is worth noting that after the completion of the share transfer, Greenfield is still expected to have no controlling shareholders or actual controllers, but the control structure may change considerably.
Since its establishment, Greenfield Holdings has carried out a number of institutional reforms: from 1992 to 1997, it operated under the purely state-owned system in accordance with market-oriented rules; from 1997 to 2013, it established and continuously improved the joint-stock system of state-owned holdings and employee shareholding; from 2013 to 2015, it introduced strategic investors to form a mixed ownership system of cross-shareholding and integration of state-owned and non-public capital; from 2015 to date, it has been listed as a whole and has become a public company.
Greenfield's current mixed reform plan is similar to that of Gree. In December 2019, Zhuhai Mingjun, the leader of high-level capital, took over the 15% stake of Gree Electric Appliance (000651.SZ) for 41.662 billion yuan. Gree Group retired as a minority shareholder. After completing the mixed reform, Gree Electric implemented modern enterprise management methods such as executive incentive plan and unreal controller structure.
Shanghai Real Estate and Shanghai City Investment are state-owned enterprise groups wholly owned by the Shanghai State Administration Commission. Zhang Yuliang, chairman and president of Greenfield Holdings, said that Greenfield's move is an important measure for Shanghai to promote the comprehensive reform of state-owned state-owned enterprises and accelerate the reform of state-owned state-owned enterprises in the new stage in accordance with the requirements of the Party Central Committee. It fully demonstrates the new reform ideas adapted to local conditions and tailored to local conditions, and supports enterprises to further improve the degree of marketization, enhance the freedom of operation and management, and accelerate the full release of the reform vitality by introducing new excellent strategic shareholders to listed companies.

"I have been stuck at home for a long time. As soon as I saw a group tour, I immediately shared the news with my friends to register together. I have never been to Lanxi before and I am very much looking forward to this trip," said Aunt Sun.
It is understood that in September last year, Lanxi City and Shanghai Railway International Tourism (Group) Co., Ltd. signed a strategic cooperation agreement for the project "Travel to Lanxi by high-speed rail," planning to start 12 special high-speed rail tours to Lanxi from four places in Zhejiang, Shanghai and Anhui within one year.

US White House adviser "bites" states to resume work too soon
US White House adviser "bites" states to resume work too soon
On July 23, local time, the number of confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia in the United States exceeded 4 million, accounting for 30% of global cases.
For several months, US President Donald Trump repeatedly asked all states to return to work and study. Only recently did he change his attitude and take the initiative to wear masks in public. His advisers "bitterly" said that some state governments returned to work too early.
On the 22nd, White House presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway said at a press conference that some state governments did not comply with the standards for returning to work and reopened bars and other places prematurely.
Conway also mentioned that the previous statement that the president had "absolute power" to decide on the resumption of work in the states was a misrumor.
"The president is a federalist. He believes that all states have autonomy."
She defended Trump.
However, the "rumor" in Conway's mouth was said by Trump himself at the White House briefing on the epidemic on April 13.
The self-facing operation was ridiculed by netizens as "rewriting history."
Kellyanne Conway wants to rewrite history. She is a liar.
Trump called Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer a dictator because she followed medical guidelines and insisted on stopping work.
Trump wants to push for a return to work so he can hold rallies.
This is not the first time Kellyanne Conway has been controversial.
On April 15, Conway blurted out in an interview with Fox News: "This is COVID-19, not COVID-1, friends!"
She seemed to understand "19" as a version number and was ridiculed by netizens: read newspapers without common sense!
Recently, we have seen the impact of cyber attacks on the business world.
Data breaches by companies such as JPMorgan Chase, Yahoo, Home Depot and Target have resulted in losses of hundreds of millions of dollars, even billions of dollars.
A few more such attacks would collapse the entire world economy.
The public sphere is not immune.
From 2012 to 2014, the US Office of Personnel Management experienced a very serious data breach.
Security clearance and fingerprint information were stolen, affecting 22 million employees.
You may also have heard that some government-funded hackers try to influence the election results of some countries with stolen data.
The two most recent ones are the large-scale data theft of the German Bundestag and the e-mail theft of the Democratic National Committee of the United States.
Cyber threats have affected our democratic process.
And there is a growing trend.
The more developed the computer technology, the more fragile the means we use to protect the data.
In particular, a new computer technology, called quantum computer, uses natural microparticles to greatly increase the computing power of computers.
Its computing power is powerful enough to crack many of the encryption systems we use today.
So are we hopeless?
Should we start packing up the electronic survival equipment to meet the coming data doom?
I don't think we have reached that point yet.
Quantum computers only exist in the laboratory, and it will take several years before they are actually applied.
More importantly, there have been many major breakthroughs in the field of encryption.
To me, this is a very exciting era in the history of secure communications.
About 15 years ago, I learned that we had unlocked new skills to create quantum effects that did not exist in nature. I was very excited.
The idea of using the basic laws of physics to promote the development of encryption technology excited me.
Today, some selected companies and laboratories, including mine, have advanced this technology to the stage of practical application.
That's right.
We intend to use quantum to fight quantum.
How to achieve it?
First, let's quickly understand the world of encryption.
You need a briefcase. You have some important documents to give to your good friend, James Bond. Lock it up to ensure safety.
Because these materials are top secret, we will use a super advanced briefcase.
It is equipped with a special password lock. Once locked, the contents of the file will be converted into random numbers.
So you just put the file in and lock it. By this time, the file has been converted into a random number. You give this briefcase to James.
When the briefcase was not delivered, you called and told him the password.
Once he got the briefcase, entered the password and the document was deciphered, it was perfect. You successfully passed an encrypted message to James Bond.
(Laughter) An interesting example, but it illustrates three key points of encryption.
Password - we call it the encryption key.
You can think of it as a password.
The call that told James the code.
We call it secret key transfer.
This ensures that we can safely deliver the secret key to the designated place.
and the lock used to encrypt and decrypt files.
We call it an encryption algorithm.
Through the secret key, it converts the contents of the file into random numbers.
A good algorithm can do this. It is difficult to crack the password without the secret key.
The importance of the algorithm is that if someone gets the briefcase and opens it, they cannot read the contents of the document without the secret key and without knowing the encryption algorithm.
All we got was some random numbers.
Most security systems rely on the secure key delivery method to pass the key to the right place.
However, the rapidly growing computing power endangers many of the secret key delivery methods we currently use.
As an example, we now have a very widely used system, RSA.
When it was invented in 1977, it took about 4 trillion years to crack a 426-bit RSA secret key.
In 1994, only 17 years later, the code was cracked.
As the computer becomes more powerful, we need longer and longer passwords.
Nowadays, we often use 2048 or 4096-bit passwords.
As you can see, the battle between the encrypter and the decryptor is going on, and both want to defeat each other.
In the next 10 to 15 years, the arrival of quantum computers will crack complex mathematical algorithms faster, which are the basis of the encryption system we use today.
In fact, quantum computers will turn our security castle into a one-touch-down house of cards.
We should try to protect our castle.
In recent years, many research institutions have emerged to study how to use quantum effects to enhance encryption.
People have made some exciting breakthroughs.
Remember the three key points of encryption: high-quality secret keys, secure secret key delivery and strong algorithms.
However, advances in science and engineering have jeopardized two of these priorities.
The first is the secret key.
Random numbers are the basis of the secret key.
But today, they are no longer truly random.
At present, we generate the secret key by software based on the frequency of random numbers, which we call pseudo-random numbers.
There will always be some, perhaps less obvious, rules in the numbers generated by programs or mathematical methods.
The lower the randomness of these numbers, or in terminology, the lower the inclusion, the easier they will be to predict.
Recently, some casinos have been attacked in creative ways.
They shot at the slot machine for a period of time and then analyzed it.
Cybercriminals use reverse engineering to create a pseudo-random digital generator behind the turntable.
In this way, they have a great chance to predict the rotation of the turntable and make a lot of money.
The secret key is equally insecure.
Having a real random number generator is very important for generating secure passwords.
For several years, researchers have been trying to create real random number generators.
But most designs are either not random enough, not fast enough, or difficult to reuse.
But the quantum world is truly random.
It is very important to take advantage of this true randomness.
Devices capable of measuring quantum effects can generate continuous random digital flows very quickly.
The casino crime just mentioned is no longer possible.
Several universities and companies from all over the world are concentrating on making real random digital generators.
In my company, our Quantum Random Digital Generator was born from an optical table 2 meters long and 1 meter wide.
Then we reduced it to a box size.
Today, it can be installed on a PCI card and plugged into an ordinary computer.
This is the fastest and truly random digital generator in the world.
It can generate 1 billion random numbers per second by measuring quantum effects.
Today, it has been widely used around the world to improve the security of cloud service providers, banks, and government agencies.
(Applause) However, even with real random digital generators, we still face the second major cybersecurity threat: the safe transmission of secret keys.
The current secret key transmission technology cannot fight quantum computers.
The quantum solution to this problem is called quantum secret key distribution, or QKD, which takes advantage of the counterintuitive properties of a foundation of quantum mechanics.
Observing the behavior of microparticles will change the particle.
Let me give an example to illustrate.
Let's think back and give the code to James Bond.
But this time, instead of calling him, we used the quantum effect to carry the code with a laser beam and pass it to James through ordinary optical fiber.
Let's assume that Dr. No wants to get the code.
Fortunately, Dr. No will leave an electronic fingerprint when trying to intercept the quantum secret key, which both James and you can detect.
The intercepted secret key will be invalidated.
The secret key left behind can provide powerful protection for the data.
Because this security mechanism is based on the basic principles of physics, it is impossible for a quantum computer, or any future supercomputer, to crack it.
My team and I are working with many top universities and defense departments to improve this exciting technology and develop the next generation of safety products.
The Internet of Things heralds a highly interconnected era, with 25-30 billion devices expected to be connected to the Internet by 2020.
Trust in these interconnected device systems is essential if our society is to function properly in the IoT world.
We believe that quantum technology will be very important to build this trust. It will ensure that we fully enjoy these magical innovations and enjoy these innovations that can enrich our lives.
Thank you.

Is it reasonable for a 3-year-old to sue the university after being smashed in the playground?
2020-07-26 05: 01: 11 Source: Legal Daily Author: Wang Siyu Responsible Editor: Wang Siyu
When the playground was smashed, the child got compensation and then sued the school.
- Zhao Yifan, correspondent of this newspaper
While playing in the playground of a university, 3-year-old Xiao Wen was accidentally hit in the head by Chen Mou of the softball team while throwing a ball.
After Chen made compensation, Xiao Wen's father, Mr. Wen, as Xiao Wen's legal representative, sued the school to the court, requesting the school where the playground was located to make an apology and pay a total of 20,000 yuan for medical expenses and moral damages.
Recently, after hearing the case, the Haidian District People's Court of Beijing held that the school had fulfilled its obligation of proper safety and security by setting up a protective net in the playground at the time of the incident, and that Chen had paid compensation. According to the judgment, the plaintiff's claim was rejected.
Mr. Wen complained that during the summer vacation of 2019, he took Xiao Wen to play in the school playground while the softball team was training in the playground.
In order to avoid the risks, Xiao Wen, Mr. Wen and many other children and parents moved in the safe area designated by the softball team.
However, Chen Mou, a member of the softball team, broke off while throwing the ball, causing the softball to fly over the net to the above-mentioned safe area and hit Xiao Wen in the back of the head.
Mr. Wen immediately took Xiao Wen to the hospital for treatment and was diagnosed with head trauma.
Mr. Wen believed that the facilities of the school stadium did not meet the relevant safety regulations and did not effectively manage the team and related facilities.
The negligence of the school led to the above-mentioned incident, which caused Xiao Wen to suffer great physical and mental pain, as well as great pain to his family, for which the school should bear legal responsibility.
In this regard, the school argued that the school had set up a protective net in the playground, posted management regulations and training notices, told the school to keep a safe distance from the training venue and reminded itself of its own safety. The plaintiff could not prove that the school had "failed to fulfill its safety and security obligations" and therefore did not agree to compensation.
After hearing the case, the court held that the venue of the incident was a venue open to the public free of charge by the university involved. Although the school had safety and security obligations for the management of the playground, such safety and security obligations only needed to meet the general duty of care.
At the time of the incident, the school set up a protective net in the playground, which had fulfilled the obligation of proper safety and security, and Chen also compensated Xiao Wen more than 2,000 yuan for medical expenses, transportation expenses and other losses in accordance with the compensation agreement previously reached. The two sides agreed to settle the dispute once.
Later, Xiao Wen's parents again claimed the school compensation, which was unfounded in the law, and the court decided to reject all the plaintiff's claims.
After the judgment, neither party appealed and the judgment has now entered into force.
According to Article 37 of China's Tort Liability Law, schools, as managers of public places, have the obligation of safety and security; if the actions of a third party cause damage to others, the third party shall bear the liability of infringement, while the managers of public places who fail to fulfill the obligation of safety and security shall bear the corresponding supplementary liability.
The judge said that because the manager of a public place is the most likely to know the actual situation of the whole place, anticipate the possible dangers and damage, and thus the most likely to take necessary measures to prevent the loss or mitigate the extent of the damage, and the cost of avoiding and mitigating the damage is the lowest, the law stipulates that he should bear the corresponding guarantee obligation to engage in social activities.
In this case, for the non-specific entrants in the playground open to the public free of charge, the safety and security obligations of the school should be appropriate to the social activities it engages in. Specifically, it should mainly take basic safety measures and be obliged to inform about hidden dangers.
In judicial practice, it is not appropriate to impose excessive safety and security obligations on public place managers.
If the school has taken measures to set up a protective net and fulfilled its obligation to inform, it can be concluded that the school is not at fault and should not bear legal liability.
In addition, for infringement by a third party, even if the administrators of public places such as schools fail to fulfill their safety and security obligations, their liability is also used as a supplement to damages. According to the newly promulgated Civil Code, after assuming the supplementary liability, the administrators can also recover compensation from the third party.
Therefore, in this kind of accident, the victim should not expand the scope of claim after receiving the compensation from the direct infringer.
Today I want to show you how we make things in the future.
I believe that soon our buildings and machines will be able to self-assemble, self-replicate and self-repair.
So I would like to show you what I think is the current state of manufacturing and then compare it with some natural systems.
So in the current manufacturing industry, we have skyscrapers - between 500,000 and millions of parts over a period of two and a half years, which are very complex and use new technologies in steel, concrete and glass.
We have exciting machines that can take us into space - 2.5 million parts in five years.
On the other hand, if we look at natural systems, we have two million types of proteins that can be folded up in 10,000 nanoseconds, and we can replicate DNA with three billion base pairs in about an hour.
This is the complexity of our natural systems, but they are very efficient, more efficient than anything we can build and more complex than anything we can build.
They are more efficient in energy.
They rarely make mistakes.
They can repair themselves and maintain a long life.
There is a very interesting thing about natural systems.
If we can transform it into our built environment, the way we construct things will have great potential.
I think the key is self-assembly.
If we want to use self-assembly in our own physical environment, I think there are four key factors.
The first is that we need to decode all the complexity of what we want to build - that is, our buildings and machines.
We need to decode them into simple sequences - basically the DNA of the operation of our buildings.
Then we need a programmable part that can accept the sequence and be used for folding or remodeling.
We need some energy to activate so that our parts can be folded up according to the program.
We need some types of error-correcting redundancy to ensure that what we successfully build is what we want.
Therefore, I would like to show you some projects that my colleagues and I are working on to realize this self-assembly future.
The first two projects are MacroBot and DeciBot.
These projects are large-scale reconfigurable robots - 8-foot-long and 12-foot-long proteins.
They are embedded in electromechanical devices, sensors.
You need to decode the way you want to fold into a series of angles - negative 120 degrees, negative 120 degrees, 0 degrees, 0 degrees, 120 degrees, negative 120 degrees, and so on; a series of angles, or turns, can be transmitted by wire.
Each unit gets its own message - such as negative 120. It rotates, checks whether the rotation is in place and passes the sequence to its neighbors.
There are many outstanding scientists, engineers and designers working for this project.
I think this project really reveals: is this really scalable?
I mean, many people spent thousands of dollars to build this eight-foot robot.
Can we really expand it? Can we really embed robots in every part?
The next problem is to look at passivity or passively try to make reorganization programmable.
But it goes a step further by trying to make actual calculations.
Basically, it has embedded the basic construction module of most calculations, the digital logic gate, directly into each part.
This is different.
Each door to be used for calculation has a tetrahedron with two input tetrahedra.
One of them is input from users, like you are building bricks.
The other is the input of a brick placed before coming.
Then it will give the output of three-dimensional space.
This means that users build bricks the way they want.
It calculates according to what you have done before and your instructions.
Now it begins to move in three-dimensional space - up or down.
On the left, the input of [1,1] is equal to the output of 0, indicating downward.
On the right, the input of [0,0] is 1 output, indicating up.
So the real implication is that our structure now contains the blueprint we want to build.
So the information about what you want to build is all embedded in it.
This means that we have some form of self-reproduction.
In this case, I call it self-directed replication because your structure contains a precise blueprint.
If you encounter a mistake, you can replace one part.
All the local information is embedded and tells you how to fix it.
So you have something to climb and can read it and output it one by one.
It is directly embedded; there is no external instruction input.
The last project I want to show is called eccentric chain, which is probably the most exciting example of the passive self-assembly system we see now.
Its reconfigurability and programmability make it a completely passive system.
Basically, you have a series of elements.
Every element is identical, and they are eccentric.
Each chain, or each element, wants to turn right or left.
If you want to assemble the chain, you need to program it.
Tell each unit whether to turn left or right.
When you shake the chain, it folds up to program any structure you encode for it - so in this case, a helix, in the case of fire, two connected cubes.
Basically, you can program in three-dimensional space - either one-dimensional or two-dimensional - and the chain is completely passive.
What kind of future does this portend for us?
I think this tells us about the possibility of self-assembly, self-reproduction and self-repair in our body structures, our buildings and machines.
There is new programmability in these sections.
From this, you can gain new possibilities of calculation.
We will have space to calculate.
Imagine our buildings, bridges, machines, all bricks can be actually calculated.
What amazing parallel and distributed computing capabilities and new design possibilities.
This is an exciting potential.
I think the projects I present to you are only a small step towards the future, if we implement these new technologies for a new self-assembly world.
Thank you.
(Applause)
With epidemic prevention and control becoming normal, people's enthusiasm for exercise and fitness is high.
With the gradual liberalization of cross-provincial tourism business, the tourism market is about to recover.
Fujian Province resumed cross-provincial tourism business from July 21. On the first weekend after opening up, Xiamen, a popular tourist destination, ushered in the peak passenger flow.
As a popular tourist destination city, many tourists arrive in Xiamen on weekends.
Xiamen Railway Station is expected to send 3.7 million passengers during the summer transport, while the airport passenger flow is dominated by students, tourists and family visits.
The tourism market has gradually recovered. In July, Xiamen Airport operated 440 flights per day, and domestic flights have recovered to 80% of the pre-epidemic level.
Airlines encrypted the air express lines from Xiamen to Shanghai, Beijing, Kunming, Xi'an and other major cities to seize the post-recovery tourism market.
At present, many travel agencies in Xiamen have launched a number of domestic and cross-provincial tourism products in the summer, and the team itinerary is mainly based on outdoor attractions.
In response to the peak of summer passenger transport at railway stations and airports, the relevant units have increased the number of personnel in check-in counters, security channels and other areas where people are easy to gather to guide them. Fujian has also optimized and upgraded the "Eight Min Health Code" to realize the sharing of health data and mutual recognition with 31 provinces, thus promoting the orderly recovery of the tourism market.
Can Andy Lau and Liu Qingyun "tear down" the new spark - Xinhua
"Bomb Dismantling Expert 2" was recently announced to be released on December 24, becoming the first film scheduled for the Lunar New Year.
The second part is still directed by Qiu Litao, produced by and starring Andy Lau, with a brand new story.
It is reported that the addition of the "nuclear bomb" element in the second part also makes the challenge faced by the bomb disposal experts more difficult. Several startling scenes in the preview have made people's hearts hanging. The mushroom cloud of the big explosion and the airport engulfed by fire are quite shocking.
Three years ago, "Bomb Dismantling Expert," produced by the original team, won the box office title of May 1 and won seven nominations at the Hong Kong Film Awards. Qiu Litao × Andy Lau also became the gold medal partner in the eyes of the audience.
This "Bomb Dismantling Expert 2" also makes people look forward to whether this pair of trump cards can shine a new spark.
"Bomb Dismantling Expert 2" tells a brand new story: Pan Jiefeng (Andy Lau), a former bomb disposal expert, fainted at the scene of the bombing and was listed as a suspect by the police.
In order to find the truth, he has to turn to his friend Dong Zhuowen (Liu Qingyun), who is also a bomb disposal expert, for help.
Pang Ling (Nini), a female inspector eager to solve the case and Pan's ex-girlfriend, is also involved.
He is still a bomb disposal expert, but he can feel the complexity of Andy Lau's new role from the preview: he broke a leg and put on a prosthetic limb. While being chased by Liu Qingyun, who is also a bomb disposal expert, he was directed by his ex-girlfriend Nini.
What is the relationship between the three, what exactly Andy Lau did in the Fragrant Island Hotel, what kind of cases he was involved in, and what ups and downs his career as a bomb disposal expert has experienced, make people curious.
It is understood that the film focuses on the field filming of world landmarks in Hong Kong, which, together with the top special effects production team, brings a shocking and realistic visual impact.

On July 26, China News Service reported that the Russian Navy Day was celebrated on July 26. The main military parade to celebrate the Navy Day was held in St. Petersburg and Kronstadt.
Russian President and Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin arrived in Kronstadt to participate in the celebration, where 15 ships and submarines were inspected.
On July 28, 2019 local time, St. Petersburg, Russia, held a grand military parade to celebrate the Naval Festival.
It is reported that Putin congratulated the naval officers and soldiers on the Navy Day and took a small boat to pass the ships that will take part in the naval parade in the Gulf of Finland, and then reviewed the troops at the main observation deck.
Putin said that the Russian naval fleet is equipped with the latest type of ships and special equipment, and the level of equipment is constantly improving.
Putin said at the Russian Navy Day parade: "The Russian naval fleet has warships equipped with high-precision weapons, strategic diving cruisers and multi-purpose submarines, the latest aircraft and other aircraft, unique weapons and special equipment."
On June 24, local time, the Red Square military parade to commemorate the 75th anniversary of Russia's victory in the Patriotic War was held.
He also said that the Russian naval fleet would gain unique advantages through digitization and effective defense means.
According to the report, the main naval parade to celebrate the Russian Navy Day was held in St. Petersburg and Kronstadt. A total of 46 ships participated, including the frigate "Admiral Kasatonov," the large anti-submarine ship "Vice Admiral Kurakov," as well as large landing ships, small missile ships, frigates and submarines.
Among them, the series of ships carried out a static display next to the Winter Palace Bridge in St. Petersburg, the most remarkable of which was the replica of the first Russian battleship "Poltava" in the early 18th century.
To avoid the spread of the new crown virus, only local residents and special guests can enter Kronstadt during this year's naval parade.
The last Sunday of July every year is Russian Navy Day.
Yang Hongnian, founder of Beijing Philharmonic Choir, died at the age of 86.
Beijing News (Reporter Liu Zheng) On July 26, the Beijing Philharmonic Choir published an obituary. Yang Hongnian, founder of the Beijing Philharmonic Choir, a famous Chinese conductor, music educator, lifelong academic member of the Central Conservatory of Music and professor of the Department of Command, died in Beijing at 13: 55 on July 26, 2020, aged 86, due to ineffective medical treatment.
The picture is from the official website of Beijing Philharmonic Choir.
Born in 1934, Yang Hongnian is a native of Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, and has loved music since childhood.
He was the conductor of the choir of Nanjing People's Radio Station in 1951. In the autumn of 1951, he was admitted to the Department of Music of Shanghai East China Normal University. He studied conducting under Professor Yang Jiaren and German conductor Hitzman, and studied style and polyphony with former Soviet expert Alzamanov.
In 1958, he was appointed to teach in the Department of Music of Beijing Art Normal College, and in 1973, he was transferred to teach in the Department of Composing and Command of the Central Conservatory of Music.
Yang Hongnian founded the Beijing Philharmonic Choir in 1983.
Over the past 30 years, adhering to the tenet of "love and dedication," he has led this choir to sing all over the world and won dozens of awards in important competitions at home and abroad.
He conducted the performances of more than 30 groups, including the choir of the Central Orchestra, the Central National Song and Dance Troupe, the Oriental Song and Dance Troupe and the Shanghai Choir, and held many symphonic and choral concerts.
His books include "Band Training," "Chorus Training," "Two Songs Writing," "Children's Songs Collection" (top and bottom volumes), and his papers "On Choral Phonetics," "On the Sound Layout of Orchestra," as well as his translations of "Choral Accessories" and "Debussy's Harmonic Language."
Do you know how many flowering plants there are?
There are 250,000 species - at least as many as we know - of flowering plants.
And flowers are a nuisance.
It is really difficult for plants to breed.
It takes a lot of experience and many resources.
Why is it so troubling?
Of course, the answer is, like many other things in the world, gender.
I know what you think when you look at these pictures.
The reason why sexual reproduction is so important is that plants can reproduce in many other ways.
It can use cuttings; it can reproduce both sexes with the same plant; it can pollinate with the same plant.
But they do need to spread their genes and mix with other genes so that they can create an ecological environment.
This is how evolution works.
Now plants transmit this information through pollen.
Some of you may have seen these pictures before.
As I said, every family should have a scanning electron microscope that can see these.
There are as many different types of pollen as there are flowering plants.
This is actually quite useful for forensic science and so on.
Most of the pollen that causes hay fever comes from plants that use the wind to spread pollen. This is a very inefficient process, which is why pollen always runs into our noses.
Because most of them have been abandoned, it is hoped that the germ cells contained in the pollen, male germ cells, will fall on another flower by chance.
All grasses, which means all grains, and most trees spread pollen by the wind.
But most species actually use insects to accomplish this process. To some extent, this is smarter because it does not require too much pollen.
Insects and other species can carry pollen and transfer it directly to where they need it.
Obviously, we notice the relationship between insects and plants.
This is a symbiotic relationship. Whether birds or bees, they can get rewards, usually nectar.
Sometimes this symbiosis will lead to wonderful adaptive changes - the red-skirt moth is a beautiful adaptive change.
Plants also harvest, and Tianyang spreads pollen elsewhere.
Plants have evolved to create landing runways everywhere, and bees may be lost in them.
Some plants look like the marks of other insects.
These are the pollen sacs of lilies, which are very ingenious. Therefore, when uninformed insects fall on them, the pollen sacs turn over and hit the insects on the back with a lot of pollen, so that they can follow the insects to other plants.
There is an orchid that looks like it has a jaw. To some extent, it does; it forces insects to crawl over, get stuck with pollen, and carry pollen elsewhere.
Orchid: There are at least 20,000 species of orchids - an amazing variety.
They have all kinds of tricks.
They must try and attract pollinators to help them complete the process.
This orchid is called Darwin's orchid because it was studied by Darwin and he gave a wonderful prediction when he saw this orchid. It can be seen that there is a long nectar tube hanging from the orchid.
Basically, what the insect has to do is prickle - we come to the middle of the flower prickle - it pierces the mouthpiece into the middle part and goes all the way down to know the nectar tube to get the nectar.
Darwin said, looking at the flower, "I guess some things have evolved with it."
There is no doubt that it is insects.
When I mean, it is usually rolled up, but when it is straightened, it looks like this.
It is now conceivable that if nectar, such a valuable thing, is costly for plants to produce and attracts many pollinators, then, as in human sexuality, people may begin to deceive each other.
They may say, "I have some nectar. Would you like to get some?"
This is a plant.
This plant is popular with insects in South Africa. They have evolved long mouthparts to get nectar at the bottom.
This is an imitator.
This plant is imitating the previous one.
A fly with a long mouthpiece didn't get any nectar from the impostor. Because the impostor didn't give it any nectar. It thought it could.
Therefore, not only did the flies not get nectar from the fake plants, but also - if you look very close to the top of the head, you will see some pollen there, which will be spread to other plants, if no botanist comes to stick it to a blue card.
(Laughter) Such lies spread throughout the plant kingdom.
This flower with black spots: They may look like black spots to us, but I tell you, to the male insects of the right species, they look like two very, very sexy females.
(Laughter) When the insect arrives and lands on it, it will immerse itself in the pollen. Of course, the pollen will be taken by it to other plants. If you look at the scanning electron microscope image that every family should have, you can see that there are actually some patterns there, three-dimensional patterns.
It can even make insects feel comfortable and looks good.
These electron microscope images - this is an orchid disguised as an insect - you can see that for our eyes, different parts of the structure have different colors and different textures, and insects may be able to perceive very, very different textures.
This orchid has evolved to mimic the metallic surface seen in some beetles.
You can see this surface under the scanning electron microscope - it is very different from other surfaces we have seen.
Sometimes the whole plant will imitate an insect, even if it looks like an insect to us.
I mean, I think it looks like some kind of flying animal or wild animal.
It is a wonderful and magical thing.
This is its cleverness. It is called obsidian.
I think it is sometimes cunning.
For a suitable species of bee, this looks like another very aggressive bee. It will fly over and hit it with its head many times to try to drive it away. Of course, this will expose it to pollen.
Another thing it does is to imitate this plant into another kind of orchid which is rich in the favorite food of insects.
But actually nothing.
So it cheats on two levels - unbelievable.
(Laughter) What we saw was Yilan, the part with strong fragrance.
Actually, I smelled it before.
Actually, these flowers need not be so showy.
They emit wonderful fragrance to attract any interested insects.
This flower doesn't smell very good.
This flower actually smells very bad. Again, it is an evolution. It looks like carrion.
So flies like it.
Flies fly in and help them pollinate.
This is the white star sea potato, also known as the dead horse sea potato.
I don't know what a dead horse smells like, but this flower may smell very similar.
It was terrible.
The green-headed fly cannot help it.
Fly into it, all the way into it.
When laying eggs on it, I thought it was a good piece of carrion. I didn't realize there was no egg food here. These eggs would die here, but at the same time, the plant would benefit because the fly with loose hair disappeared and pollinated to another flower - it was wonderful.
This is the sea japonica plant, the European sea japonica, the variegated Arroma, which is called Yenyao in this country.
I filmed this in Dorset last week.
This guy's heating is about 15 degrees higher than the ambient temperature - incredible.
If you look inside it, behind the ear of meat is something like a dam. Flies are attracted by the heat - this is a boiling volatile chemical, small insects - and they are trapped under this container.
They drink the sweet nectar and become a little sticky.
At night, they were covered with pollen and sprayed from them, and then the hard hairs we saw on them withered and allowed these pollen-covered insects to escape - it was incredible.
If you think it is incredible, this one is my favorite.
This is the spring plume.
Everyone here from Brazil should know about this plant.
This is the most magical thing.
Its stamens are about one foot long.
It has an ability that no other plant I know of has. When it is in full bloom - this is the middle ear of meat - in about two days, it produces some metabolic changes similar to those of mammals.
It does not have starch. It is a plant food. It has something very similar to brown fat. It burns it and metabolizes it at the rate of burning fat, about the speed of a kitten.
According to the weight ratio, it is twice the energy output of hummingbird - absolutely amazing.
It also did something unusual.
Not only will it warm up to 155 degrees Fahrenheit, 43 or 44 degrees Celsius for two days, but it will also maintain a constant temperature.
A temperature regulation mechanism is used to maintain a constant temperature.
Why? I heard you ask.
As you don't know, some beetles like to mate at this temperature.
They went in and were covered with pollen.
(Laughter) Plants sprinkle pollen on them and let them leave to pollinate.
What a wonderful thing this is.
Now we think that most pollinators are insects, but actually in the tropics, many birds and butterflies also carry out pollinators.
Many tropical flowers are red because butterflies and birds are similar to us. We think we can see red very well.
But if you look at the spectrum, birds and us, we see the spectrum in red, green and blue.
Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet light. They can see all kinds of bright and dark ultraviolet light.
There is some color behind this.
"Wouldn't it be good if we could see those colors," I heard you ask.
Yes, we can see.
So what do insects see?
Last week, I took pictures of these desert lotus, a half-day flower, in Dorset.
As we can see, these are little yellow flowers, which are everywhere.
It looks like this in visible light.
If the red color is removed, it looks like this.
Most bees cannot sense red.
Then I put an ultraviolet filter in front of my lens for a long exposure at a specific frequency of ultraviolet light and got the picture.
This is like a real and wonderful target.
Now we do not know what the bees actually see. When I call it red, you know what I am looking at.
We can't know what happened, whether in the brains of insects or other human beings.
But the contrast probably looks like this, highlighted from the background.
This is another small flower - located in different ultraviolet frequency ranges, with different filters to match different pollinators.
It looks like this.
In order to avoid thinking that all yellow flowers have this property - no damage to the flowers during the shooting; just stick it to the tripod and don't pick it off - look at this under ultraviolet light.
This can be used as the basis of sunscreen, which works by absorbing ultraviolet light.
Therefore, some chemicals may be useful.
Finally, this is a nocturnal fragrance sent to me by Bjorn Rorslett of Norway - a wonderful hidden pattern.
I like this hidden way.
I think this is very poetic. These photos are taken with an ultraviolet filter, the main use of which is used by astronomers to photograph the clouds on Venus - in fact, the clouds on Venus.
This is the main use of this kind of filter.
Of course, Venus is the god of love and fertility, which is the word of flowers.
Just as flowers spend so much energy trying to attract pollinators to accept their invitations, somehow they also succeed in convincing us that they contain rich connotations. We send flowers to each other at birth and death, especially at weddings. When you think of it, genetic material is transferred from one organism to another at this moment.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
China News Service Chongqing, July 26 (reporter Liu Xian) The Chongqing Development and Reform Commission released information on July 26 that the city has retired 4,404 fishermen so far, accounting for 42.54% of all fishermen involved.
Li Daiguo, 53 years old, said in an interview with China News Service that his grandfathers had been fishing in the Longxi River. Since he was 11 years old, he followed his father fishing and rocked his boat along the Longxi River, going up to Liangping, Chongqing, and living a long life. Each time he left home, he spent ten days and a half months fishing to support his family.
However, since 1997, as the rural population gradually poured into the town, there were more and more residents in the town, and the environmental pollution was becoming more and more serious.
Paper mills, chemical factories and fish farms have been built along the Longxi River, which also pollutes the river.
By 2007 and 2008, the Longxi River had become a stink ditch.
"The fish scales caught are all black, and the inside is also black when cut open."
Li Daiguo said it was more and more difficult to fish after the river was polluted.
The local government began to make great efforts to control the pollution of Longxi River, including clear floating, river patrol, and the management and protection of aquatic resources.
Li Daiguo also retired from fishing to production and became a member of the river patrol team to protect aquatic resources.
From January 1, 2020, the Chongqing Aquatic Biological Reserve and the relevant waters of the main urban area have been completely banned from fishing.
According to the data of Chongqing Development and Reform Commission, up to now, Chongqing has a total of 3,403 fishing vessels and 4,643 fishing vessels that have signed withdrawal agreements, accounting for 63.3% and 86.3% of the total tasks for three years, respectively.
There were 4,404 fishermen retired, accounting for 42.54% of all fishermen involved.
Of the 4,404 retired fishermen, 4,267 were employed, accounting for 96.89%.
Old-age insurance covers 2,691 people, accounting for 61.10% of the retired fishermen.
Next, Chongqing will carry out in-depth special remediation actions, accelerate the clean-up and remediation of the utilization project of the Yangtze River dry stream shoreline, complete a new round of survey of sewage outlets into the Yangtze River and carry out corresponding remediation actions, basically complete the remediation task of "tri-phosphorus" (referring to phosphate ore, phosphorus chemical industry and phosphogypsum reservoir), clean up and rectification of small hydropower, promote the special action of afforestation on both sides of the Yangtze River, strengthen the construction of green mines, consolidate the achievements of the special remediation of illegal docks and illegal sand mining in the Yangtze River dry stream, and further promote the prohibition of fishing and fishing in the Yangtze River basin.
Israel strengthens prevention and control of repeated outbreaks - China New Zealand

Israel strengthens prevention and control of repeated outbreaks
At the beginning of the outbreak of new crown pneumonia, Israel's preventive and control measures were effective.
However, with the gradual lifting of prevention and control measures, the number of people diagnosed with new crown pneumonia in Israel has increased significantly recently, and the Israeli government has taken urgent measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On February 28, the first case of new crown pneumonia was confirmed in Israel, which quickly took measures to close all entry and exit ports, suspend non-essential industries, switch schools to online teaching, restrict public transport and non-essential social activities, block cities with severe epidemics, and jointly maintain prevention and control measures.
This series of measures soon achieved positive results. By mid-May, the number of new confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia in Israel fell to single digits.
With the outbreak under control and all prevention and control measures in Israel fully unsealed, the number of newly diagnosed pneumonia has gradually rebounded since June.
Especially in July, the spread of the epidemic has been accelerating.
In recent days, the daily number of new cases in Israel has been more than 1,500 for eight days, and as of July 25, the number of new cases on that day had reached 916.
As of July 25, Israel had 59745 confirmed cases and 448 deaths.
Facing the rapid rebound of the epidemic, the Israeli government has repeatedly taken urgent measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On July 6, after the number of confirmed cases exceeded 30,000, the Israeli government closed public entertainment venues such as gyms, swimming pools, bars and nightclubs, and introduced a policy of restricting public transport, stipulating that the maximum number of passengers per bus should not exceed 20.
On the 17th, the Israeli government announced a series of new restrictions, including the implementation of "city closure" on weekends, stipulating that "city closure" should be implemented from 17: 00 every Friday to 5: 00 every Sunday.
During this period, people can go out, but places such as shops, shopping centers, barber shops, beauty salons, libraries, zoos, museums, exhibition halls, swimming pools and tourist attractions will be closed, while basic service places such as supermarkets and pharmacies will remain open.
At the same time, gatherings of more than 10 people will be prohibited on all dates and time periods, gyms, studios and other places will be closed, restaurants and cafes will be prohibited from eating and only take-out services will be allowed.
At the same time, the Israeli people did not pay enough attention to the seriousness of the epidemic and failed to form a joint effort with the government to combat it.
After repeated outbreaks in Israel, many people took to the streets to protest because the government's preventive and control measures affected their own economic interests.
On July 11, tens of thousands of people demonstrated in Tel Aviv, believing that the anti-epidemic policy affected the economy.
On the evening of the 21st, thousands more protesters gathered in front of Prime Minister Netanyahu's official residence in Jerusalem to protest against Prime Minister Netanyahu's ban on restaurants, cafes and other preventive and control measures without giving corresponding compensation.
In addition, many people do not abide by the rules of wearing masks and keeping a safe social distance of two meters during outdoor activities. To avoid being fined by the police for not wearing masks, many people only wear masks on their chin or hang them on their wrists.
During the repeated outbreaks, the school was a major disaster area for the spread of the new crown virus. According to the reporter's recent visit to the kindergarten, it was found that the teachers and students of the kindergarten did not wear masks as required by the government, nor did they maintain a safe social distance of two meters from each other, laying hidden dangers for a large number of teachers and students infected with the virus.
Professor Eli Waxman, a member of the expert advisory panel of Israel's National Security Council to combat the epidemic, believed that Israel was moving towards a "dangerous situation" and pointed out that the current measures taken by Israel to prevent and control the epidemic were not enough. All places of leisure and recreational activities and summer schools should be closed to control the further spread of the epidemic.
Waxman said that Israel lacks an overall plan to combat the epidemic. The parliament and government departments should abandon their respective interests as soon as possible, reach an agreement on combating the epidemic and formulate clear steps including relevant restrictions in different sectors.
Tel Aviv, July 25, Our correspondent in Tel Aviv Wang Chung
Wu Fengfang, a farmer in Guyuan, Ningxia, couldn't help his old companion Dai Tianfu. The two men drove from their home 20 miles away to Liang Yun Cultural Compound.
Although his legs and feet have been inconvenient for the past two years, 77-year-old Dai Tianfu still hopes to "come here every other time and become addicted to opera."
This is a modest courtyard in Yuanzhou District of Guyuan City. Unlike ordinary farmhouses, there are often melodious Qin cavity in the courtyard, as well as colorful shadow plays, embroidery works, traditional Qin cavity and eyebrow Hu opera.
The owner of the compound is Liang Yun, who was a carpenter.
More than 10 years ago, he, who loved shadow and singing, began planning to build a cultural compound.
With Liang Yun Cultural Compound, the cultural life of the villagers has become colorful.
Before the reporter entered the Liang Yun Cultural Compound, the tunes of Qin cavity had been passed on.
Bai Lixiang, a villager from a neighboring village, is singing the Qinqian selection for the villagers.
She has loved Qinqian since she was a child. Now she has a small reputation in the local area. As long as she has free time, she will come to the cultural compound to perform programs for the villagers.
Recently, Parisian also played webcasting.
Berry said, "It is a very happy thing to have a stage for more people to see their performances."
On the stage, the singers play one song at a time and the players play one song at a time. Although they are amateurs, their enthusiasm does not decrease at all.
Just like the rustic style of the farmhouse, outside the Qin cavity, the "grass-roots" art and non-heritage culture in the Liang Yun Cultural Garden are everywhere.
The compound also has a collection of more than 300 agricultural utensils from different ages, traditional and handmade tiles, paper-cutting, embroidery, shadow and other physical objects.
Liang Yun led the reporter into the showroom in the courtyard, which showed his collection of old objects, such as old wine jugs, tri-strings, spinning wheels, etc.
Why does an ordinary farmer build a cultural compound?
"Shadow opera is my family craft. I have been learning this craft since I was 15."
Liang Yun Cultural Compound was established in 2012, becoming the first rural "intangible cultural heritage exhibition hall" in Ningxia and a demonstration compound for the protection of intangible cultural heritage in Guyuan.
In addition to Liang Yun Cultural Compound, more than 120 cultural compounds and 79 folk performance groups have emerged in the Huanzhou District of Guyuan City. Among them, there are more than 50 cultural compounds of a certain scale, such as Shenjiahe Cultural Compound, Wang Yonghong Cultural Compound and Yang Lang Cultural Compound, covering all towns and streets in the Huanzhou District, with more than 5,000 participants.
These grass-roots entertainers are active in the fields, enriching the cultural life of the masses and satisfying their spiritual needs.
"As life gets better and better, traditional culture cannot just be left behind."
"Liu's Impossible War Drama" returns to "Winning Odds" to watch Liu Yunlong Li Liqun's rival "Drama" - Xinhua News
The 40-episode drama "Winning" will be released on Beijing TV from July 16.
"Winning Odds" is based on real historical facts and is based on the dusty Soviet military archives, which have been published for the first time in many years.
Actor Liu Yunlong, known to the audience as "spy drama," broke through in the play and challenged a very happy "stuttering agent."
In recent years, the popularity of dramas such as "The Pretenders," "The Mask," and "The Kite" have proved the vigorous vitality of spy drama.
Unlike previous spy works, "Chance of Winning" looks at the world and extends the story background to the Soviet Far East battlefield.
Set in the final stage of the Anti-Japanese War in 1944, it tells the story of Tang Fei (Liu Yunlong), a secret intelligence worker of the Communist Party of China, who, under the leadership of the secretary of the Linhe Provincial Committee of the Chinese Underground Party and the director of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Service, carried out the "Mudanula" strategy of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Service.
In many spy dramas, the hero, as a senior spy, is a perfect image of handsome, high intelligence and mature.
However, in Liu Yunlong's view, such a person is not suitable to be a spy. "A spy should be the kind of person who can't be found in the pile of people. If he is the kind of person who pretends to be handsome, I wish everyone would pay attention to you. Can he still lurk? There is a line in" Kite, "'If you don't catch me, I forget that I am a Kuomintang', and the spy should be de-elite."
Therefore, in "Chance of Winning," Liu Yunlong ingeniously designed his hero Tang Fei as a "stuttering agent" with joy.
Fukuhara, a Japanese played by Liang Guanhua, and Fang Shibao, the director of the National Police Agency, played by Li Liqun, worked together to support the other camp in Winning.
One South and one North are two powerful actors, adding to the whole play the perspective of many master tricks.
Director Yin Fei used the term "racing drama" to describe the confrontation between Li Liqun and Liu Yunlong in the play. "It is definitely racing drama. The two of them have a special tacit understanding, and the tacit understanding between them has a great impact on me. Many times their plays are 'hanging'. For example, we only wrote the length of half a page of paper, and if I don't stop filming, they can continue to perform."
The master does not steal the play, nor does the director disturb the play. When the actors are in the roles and ensure their character state, they can not only shape the characters from the perspective of the characters, but also bring more viewing possibilities to the audience. Yin Fei said such a play is brilliant enough.
In the play, you can also see many familiar faces in the "Liu Impossible War Drama." The famous and majestic "Mountain City F4" in "Kite" also gathered three people in "Winning."
Hou Xian and Liu Mingyang, who once played Song Xiaoan and Zhao Janzhi, once again played Tang Fei's right arm.
Director Yin Fei introduced, "There is no evil in these two people. They just drifted with the current in that era and environment."
Liu Yunlong also offered, "We should have a human feeling. This human feeling means that the people around me must have good and bad people, and the bad people are enemies, but we should also develop them and strengthen our team."
The ending of the two men in the play was also carefully designed by Liu Yunlong, who believed that he would give a satisfactory answer to the audience.

Four students drowned in Arong Banner, Inner Mongolia. Official: The incident is a wake-up call.
China News Service Hulunbel, July 26 (Reporter Li Aiping) On the evening of July 25, the reporter learned from the Arong Banner government of Hulunbel, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, that four local students died of drowning.
At 15: 50 on July 24, Arong Banner Public Security Bureau 110 received a report that six local junior high school students had drowned.
After receiving the police, the local police rushed to the scene at the first time and rescued two students on the spot. Subsequently, the local emergency bureau, water conservancy bureau and other units arrived at the scene and participated in the rescue.
According to the report, more than 80 people, including public security police, forest police, fire control and medical care, were sent to the rescue site, three rubber boats were sent to continuously salvage the surrounding waters, and professional rescue teams were hired to arrive at the scene to conduct underwater search through sonar detection.
The reporter learned that the local rescue workers found the first student killed at 6: 40 on July 25, the second student killed at 11: 30 on July 25, the third student killed at 12: 40 on July 25, and the last student killed at 13: 34 on July 25. After being salvaged, the above four people were identified by the local 120 emergency center as having no vital signs.
Officials said the drowning was a wake-up call to the whole society.
At present, the relevant departments of the local government are collating some knowledge on the prevention of drowning in the hope that the tragedy will not happen again.
Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 25 - Xu Zhengyu, Secretary for Financial Affairs and the Treasury of the Hong Kong SAR Government, said that Hong Kong's financial market remained active and orderly.
He expressed optimism about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
Speaking at the webinar jointly organized by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Toronto and the Hong Kong-Canada Chamber of Commerce (Canadian Federation) on the 24th (Toronto time), Xu Zhengyu said that Hong Kong was experiencing a difficult situation due to the "tropical storm" and the new crown pneumonia epidemic.
The exchange rate of Hong Kong dollar is stable and favors the strong exchange guarantee level.
There are no obvious signs of capital outflows from the banking system; on the contrary, more than $11 billion has been imported since June.
The total deposits of banks have also continued to increase in the past few months. There have been a series of public equity fund-raising activities in the stock market, and market transactions have risen frequently.
Xu Zhengyu said that the new crown pneumonia epidemic has put pressure on the global economy and financial markets, but Hong Kong's basic advantages remain unchanged.
Hong Kong's many advantages, including geography, the rule of law, high-speed communications, the free flow of information and capital, and a simple and low tax system, have made Hong Kong a leading international financial centre.
Xu Zhengyu pointed out that the HKSAR Government had set aside HK $6 billion in the Anti-epidemic Fund to create about 30,000 time-bound jobs in the public and private sectors in the next two years, covering people with different skills and educational qualifications.
To support the development of financial technology, the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has also launched the "1,000 Project" to subsidize local financial technology companies, start-ups and other enterprises with financial technology-related businesses in order to create 1,000 new jobs, employ local talents and enrich Hong Kong's financial technology talent pool.
Looking ahead, Xu Zhengyu expressed optimism about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
He encouraged Canadian enterprises to make good use of Hong Kong's advantages and its position as an international financial center, an international asset and wealth management center and a global offshore RMB business hub to develop and invest in Guangdong, Hong Kong, Macau, the Greater Bay Area and nearby areas.
The Lancet praises China's anti-epidemic efforts and encourages countries to learn from experience.
According to the article in the 25th issue of Lancet magazine, China, as a country with a population of 1.4 billion and a scale similar to that of Europe or the United States, has effectively controlled the new crown epidemic at this stage, but there has been no widespread spread, and has controlled the domestic epidemic to a large extent.
The article said that in the past ten years, China has invested heavily in domestic research and public health construction, which makes China much more prepared for the new crown than for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
The authors said that when SARS broke out in 2002, China was not well prepared at first, especially the pathogen could not be identified.
When the new crown virus was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists were soon able to identify the virus species and shared the genome sequencing data with the international community on January 11, 2020.
By the end of January, doctors from mainland China and Hong Kong had clarified the clinical characteristics of the virus and warned the world of the threat of the new crown virus through research papers published in The Lancet.
China has also been at the forefront of vaccine research. When the country declared a state of emergency, such research was carried out very quickly and strictly through close cooperation at home. The results of the progress made in the early trials of the new crown vaccine developed by China were published in The Lancet in May and July respectively.
China's experience shows that it is very important to invest in the national health and research system to effectively improve laboratory capacity.
This is the basis for a rapid and effective national response to health emergencies and global health security.
Other countries, especially low- and middle-income countries, are well worth learning from.
In addition, China's experience has proved that, on the basis of strong research, strong high-level officials must decisively make correct decisions based on scientific evidence in order to effectively control the new crown epidemic.
The article emphasizes that the government and its leaders must respect science, understand its value, and act on it in the most beneficial way to society.
At the beginning of the outbreak, the National Health and Construction Commission of China sent three groups of infectious disease experts to Wuhan to investigate the risk and spread of the new crown virus. Their suggestions provided a basis for Wuhan's decision to "seal the city" on January 23. When experts put forward the necessity and urgency of building a square cabin hospital, the government made a decision and implemented it quickly. At the same time, the broad participation of the community and the masses also enabled the epidemic to be controlled quickly and effectively.
Finally, the article emphasizes that countries need to strengthen global cooperation and jointly respond to the global health emergency.

Director Dapeng's "Ruyi" was nominated for the Golden Viscount Award - Xinhua
On July 18, the 23rd Shanghai International Film Festival announced the official list of films selected for the Golden Viscount Award.
The first realistic film directed by Dapeng, Ruyi, was successfully nominated for the Golden Viscount Award at the last film festival, and the first poster was officially released.
Poster
The film "Ruyi" is the first realistic theme work directed by Dapeng and his second marriage with the Golden Viscount Award.
The film tells such a story: a comedy film director came back to his hometown in rural Northeast China on a whim, hoping to turn his family's New Year into a literary film. As a result, he encountered a series of accidents.
The family members gathered for the film finished the last party.
In the film poster released today, a member of the family, "third uncle" Wang Jixiang, is sitting in the middle of the picture smoking a cigarette. In the background is the black land of Northeast China clothed in silver, and in the foreground is the red lantern that Chinese must hang on the New Year's Day.
The red lantern, which symbolizes happiness and reunion, forms a great contrast with the lonely figure of Wang auspicious, which also seems to reveal the complexity and entanglement in the relationship between this large family.
It is reported that in the film, except that the daughter of "third uncle" Wang Jixiang is played by actor Liu Lu, the rest of the scenes are completed by the real director's family. The experimental audio-visual style of the film breaks the boundary between drama and reality and brings the audience a new immersive viewing experience.
According to director Dapeng, the creation of Ruyi originated from "a providence." A series of sudden changes in the family during the filming period forced the original shooting plan to be changed. Life without a script was finally recorded as a film, but the tension beyond the design was released.
How exactly does director Dapeng face this "providence" and how should he continue to meet the changes brought about by this providence?
There is no doubt that Ruyi is full of experiments. The almost universal lineup and innovative audio-visual style turn the life in front of the camera into a film. Under the real image, the audience will also find the shadow of themselves and their families in the family presented in the film, which will arouse a series of thoughts with the end of the family party in the film.

Platoon commander Yu Wang and a soldier stood guard at the Zhuokang outpost in Banao.
In this place, where the average annual temperature is more than 10 degrees below zero, a row of simple barracks stands at the mountain pass. A national flag is flying in the wind not far from the barracks. The soldiers are on duty and stand guard in the wind every day. At the same time, they have to patrol at higher elevations regularly.
The soldiers needed hands and feet to climb the steep slope of rocks.
It was late July, when flowers and plants were abundant in low-altitude areas, and in Banang Zhuokang, only the mountain trench behind the barracks had relatively dense green.
Gao Peng, a soldier who had been stationed at the outpost for six years, pointed to the mountain ditch and said that it was their back garden. Only in July and August of each year could the grass grow slowly. Soon, it turned yellow and covered with snow.
It may take about 9 hours to patrol on foot.
Under the harsh plateau environment, the soldiers stationed here are always accompanied by snowy mountains and glaciers, and they also regularly patrol the mountain passes at higher altitudes.
A few days ago, a patrol composed of eight soldiers, led by instructor Liang Yicheng, went on the patrol road again.
Each soldier was carrying about 30 pounds and headed for the target in the early morning.
On the way, a soldier rebelled and his comrades rushed to rescue him.
In addition to patrol tasks, the soldiers at the Batang Zhuokang outpost have to carry out tactical and physical training every day.
The passage of time, the rising altitude, the lower and lower oxygen content and the constant overdraft of physical strength test the will of the patrol members.
They clenched their teeth and insisted on crossing several landslide points and several dangerous beaches.
At about 16: 00, it was the lunch time for the patrol members. They took out their own dry grain and sat on the ground at an altitude of more than 5,700 meters. With the rain and snow, they supplemented their strength with food.
The soldiers at the Batang Zhuokang outpost conducted tactical and physical training.
During the break, they will play cards together, and the losers will do push-ups, which can both entertain and exercise physical fitness.
After a short rest in the cold wind, they climbed to the target position of the patrol, took out the national flag on the mountain pass and made a solemn oath.
Behind them are snow-covered mountains, and in front of them are no-man's land tens of kilometers away. They are the safest guardians of the country.
Beijing Consumer Season Restarts - Xinhua
According to the principle of "all-round restart, key planning, orderly promotion and strict organization," Beijing will restart the activities of the Beijing consumption season.
On July 26, 1.5 million government and enterprise vouchers were issued, including 1 million offline food and beverage vouchers and 500,000 smart product vouchers, which consumers can collect at the Jingdong APP.
Liu Meying, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce, said at the media briefing held on the 25th that the consumption season after the restart would further reduce the allocation of capital by enterprises on the basis of maintaining the existing preferential subsidies for consumer coupons and packages.
From the beginning of August, the current 1: 1 allocation of government and enterprise capital contribution will be adjusted to 2: 1. For example, consumers can enjoy a discount of 120 yuan after receiving a card bag to spend in the store, including 60 yuan for government subsidy and 60 yuan for enterprises; 80 yuan for government subsidy and 40 yuan for enterprises after adjustment.
During the consumption season, the three major operators will subsidize traffic and terminals around 5G consumption to further promote Beijing's new 5G infrastructure and 5G consumption.
Chen Maobo said that Hong Kong's economy has been hit by the outbreak of the epidemic again.
China News Service, Hong Kong, July 26 - The Financial Secretary of the Hong Kong SAR Government, Chen Maobo, said on July 26 that Hong Kong was facing the impact of a new wave of pneumonia, and that business exchanges and economic activities that had seen a slight recovery had also been hit.
The Hong Kong SAR Government once again calls on major small owners to reduce their rent and share the difficult times with retailers, restaurants and small and medium-sized enterprises.
On the same day, Chen Maobo published an article entitled "The Rugged Road to Recovery" on the Internet.
He said that the recent high number of confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia in Hong Kong was a serious situation, which affected people's livelihood and troubled the economy.
When the epidemic is repeated, the first thing is to strictly prevent imported cases and deal with and interrupt the transmission chain of the virus as quickly as possible. When the epidemic is under control, economic activities should be resumed in time and accordingly.
He pointed out that in the face of the impact of the new epidemic, business exchanges and economic activities, which had seen a slight recovery, had also been hit.
In addition to the spirit of contract, social responsibility is equally important to the business community, especially those groups that have received large government subsidies under the Employment Guarantee Scheme.
He mentioned that Hong Kong's economic situation was still very severe in the second quarter of this year, but the contraction seemed to slow down slightly.
In terms of exports, he believed that the external situation of Hong Kong was still serious.
Chen Maobo said that the development history of Hong Kong over the past few decades shows that every crisis hides new opportunities and every difficulty hides the key to future development.
One winter morning several years ago, in Johannesburg, South Africa, when I drove to work, I found the city shrouded in haze.
I drive there almost every day, but this time is very unusual. I have never seen such a sight before.
Johannesburg is famous for its unique and beautiful skyline, but it could hardly be seen that morning.
Soon I realized that what I saw was the severe haze caused by air pollution.
The contrast between the beautiful environment I used to know and the foggy skyline surged in my heart.
I fear that the once colorful sunset will be swallowed up by the dark haze.
At that moment, I felt a strong impulse to do something, but I didn't know what to do.
All I know is that I cannot just stand by.
The biggest challenge is that I do not understand environmental science, air quality management, or atmospheric chemistry.
I am a computer engineer, and I am quite sure that I cannot solve the problem of air pollution by coding.
(Laughter) In what capacity will I solve this problem?
I am just a small citizen.
In the next few years, I learned a very important lesson that we should all bear in mind if we want to realize a better future.
Even if you are not an expert in a particular field, your professional skills may contain solutions to problems in that field.
Sometimes, your unique perspective can stimulate unconventional thinking and influence the situation, but you need to be bold to try.
Only then can you know the result.
What I knew then was that if I wanted to try to change, I had to know enough about pollution, so I became a student again.
I did some basic research and soon learned that air pollution is the biggest environmental health risk in the world.
According to the World Health Organization, in 2012, almost 14% of deaths worldwide were caused by air pollution in and around homes, especially in low- and middle-income countries.
The annual death rate caused by air pollution is higher than that caused by malaria and AIDS.
In Africa, premature deaths caused by unsafe sanitation, or deaths caused by child malnutrition, are powerless in the face of air pollution, and it also carries huge economic costs: according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, spending exceeded $400 billion in 2013.
In my work, I explore the scientific and technological frontier achievements of artificial intelligence, including the symbiotic relationship between human beings and machines, to find a useful foothold and help us make better decisions.
When I think of the problem of air pollution again, it becomes clear how to control it. We need to find better ways to make better decisions. Considering the magnitude of the problem, cooperation is very necessary.
So I decided to meet some people working in this field.
I began to talk with officials in Johannesburg and other surrounding cities. I also joined the local science community. I also made some phone calls to completely strangers but related people.
These experiences that I began to intervene helped me to understand the problem more deeply.
It also helped me avoid the trap that people in my profession sometimes fall into when trying to innovate: to adopt a technology quickly before they really master the problem.
I began to think, what can I do to improve the situation?
I began to ask myself how to effectively integrate my knowledge and skills in software engineering and artificial intelligence and the professional skills of the people I contacted.
I want to create an online air quality management platform to reveal future pollution trends and make relevant forecasts to judge the possible results.
I am sure my idea can become a realistic solution, but in the face of uncertainty, I cannot guarantee its success.
All I have is a specific set of engineer skills, skills gained from my work. (Laughter) Of course, for people who have been working in the field of air pollution for many years, my skills are completely new.
I have come to realize that sometimes a novel perspective, a new skill set, can lead to something outstanding.
Our willpower and imagination are an indicator light that shows us to overcome obstacles and open a new chapter.
After I had a deeper understanding of the problem of air pollution and found the air pollution data of the past ten years, as well as the meteorological data of Johannesburg and its surroundings, I created the Air Quality Resolution Support System with my colleagues from South Africa and China and uploaded it to the cloud.
This software can analyze historical and real-time data to reveal the changing trend of pollution with time and space.
We then used the new machine learning technology to predict future pollution several days in advance.
This means that residents can make better decisions about their daily itinerary and where to settle with their families.
We can predict adverse pollution events in advance, define serious sources of pollution, and enable relevant authorities to issue instructions to adjust their business activities.
By supporting scenario planning, urban planners can also make better decisions on how to expand infrastructure work, such as residential resettlement in industrial areas.
We have established a pilot of the technology, which has been in operation for 120 days, covering the whole of South Africa.
Our expected results were verified, and the predicted data we showed showed showed a close correlation with the data we collected in the field.
Through our management, we introduced the world's leading cutting-edge instruments to predict air quality with unprecedented resolution and accuracy, benefiting the city I drove into on a recent winter morning. At that time, I said to myself, "Something is wrong, I have to find a way to do something."
Therefore, the point is: what if I didn't deeply investigate the problem of air pollution?
What if instead of paying attention to the environmental situation of the country, I hope that some places and others will take care of these things?
What I learned from it is that it is very important to focus on the possibility of success and consider the consequences of inaction when making every effort to advance a cause that we all believe in.
We should not be distracted by opposition and resistance. It should inspire us to go further.
So no matter where you are in the world, the next time you find that your natural curiosity is aroused and it is about what you want, you have some crazy or brave ideas. Even if this is not your field of expertise, ask yourself: Why not try?
Why not go ahead and solve problems? Do your best, in your own way?
You may get unexpected joy.
Thank you.

The largest earthquake in Taiwan occurred in the eastern waters of Taiwan this year.
China News Service, Taipei, July 26 (Reuters) - An earthquake measuring 6.1 on the Richter scale occurred in the eastern waters of Taiwan at 20: 52 on July 26, with a maximum magnitude of 4. The earthquake was felt across Taiwan, making it the largest earthquake in Taiwan this year.
According to the reports of the Central News Agency, China Time Electronic News, ETtoday News Cloud and other Taiwan media, the Taiwan Meteorological Department measured and reported that the epicenter of the earthquake was located 86.5 kilometers southeast of Yilan County Government, that is, the eastern sea area of Taiwan, with a source depth of 53 kilometers.
China Earthquake Network measured the magnitude of the earthquake to be 5.5.
The largest earthquakes in all parts of Taiwan were: 4 in Hualien County, 3 in Yilan, Taidong, Nantou and Yunlin counties, and 1 to 2 in other counties and cities.
The meteorological department of Taiwan pointed out that the earthquake was the largest in Taiwan this year and belonged to the subduction zone type earthquake at the boundary of the plate. The epicenter of the earthquake often occurred in the past and has been relatively active since this year.
In the coming week, it is still not ruled out that there will be aftershocks above magnitude 4.
Many people think that driving is something that only those who can see can do.
Until now, it was considered an impossible task for blind people to drive a car alone and safely.
Hello, my name is Dennis Hong. We have built a car designed for people with visual impairment for the freedom and independence of blind people.
Before I talk about the car for the blind, let me briefly talk about another project I have done called the Urban Challenge of the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the United States Department of Defense.
This is about building a self-driving mechanical vehicle.
If you press the start button and stop touching anything, it can reach its destination completely automatically.
In the 2007 Challenge, our team won $500,000 to win the third place of the competition.
At about that time, the National Association for the Blind, or the Blind Association, challenged the design team about who could design a car that blind people could drive independently and safely.
We think we should give it a try, because we think, well, where is this difficult?
We already have an automatic car.
As long as we let the blind drive inside, it won't be over, will it?
(Laughter) But we were wrong.
What the Blind Association wants is not a car that can carry the blind around, but a car that the blind can make choices and control.
So we have to give up all our original things and start from scratch.
To test this crazy idea, we designed a prototype of a small sand truck to test its feasibility.
In the summer of 2009, we invited many blind young people across the country and gave them a chance to take a ride in this car.
It was definitely a cool experience.
But the problem with this car is that its design can only allow blind people to drive in a very limited environment, like a closed parking lot - even on a path made of red traffic cones.
So with this success, we decided to take an important next step to build a real car that can drive on a real road.
So how does it work?
Well, this is a relatively complex system, but let me explain it to simplify it.
We have three stages.
We have induction stage, calculation stage and non-visual interface.
The driver is obviously invisible, so the system must be able to sense the surrounding environment and collect data for the driver.
At this point, we use the initial measuring element.
It measures acceleration, angular acceleration - just like the human ear, the inner ear.
I combined this information with GPS to predict the location of the vehicle.
We also use two cameras to detect the driving path.
We also use three laser rangefinders.
The laser scans the environment to detect obstacles - vehicles passing in front and behind also have any obstacles that break into the road, any obstacles around the vehicle.
All the massive information is then aggregated into the computer, which will do two things.
First of all, one thing is to process information to understand the surrounding environment - which are driving paths and which are obstacles - and transform this information to the driver.
The system is also very intelligent to calculate the safest driving path.
We can also issue instructions on how to operate the vehicle's operating procedures.
But the question is: how can we transmit information and instructions to the blind person quickly and accurately enough to ensure that he can drive?
To this end, we have designed many different non-visual user interface technologies.
The original three-dimensional flat sound system included vibration vests, sound-controlled gears, leg straps, and even shoes that put pressure on the feet.
But today we are talking about three non-visual user interface technologies.
The first interface is called the driving handle.
This is a pair of gloves with vibration elements at the knuckles so that you can transmit instructions on how to drive - direction and amplitude.
Another device is called the velocity shock zone.
This car chair - in fact, it is a massage chair.
We take it apart, and we reorganize the vibration components in different modes. We let them transmit the speed information, as well as instructions on how to use the throttle and brake.
Here, you can see how the computer understands the surrounding environment. Because you can't see the vibration, we actually installed a red light-emitting diode on the driver, so he can see what is happening.
This is the sensing data, which is transmitted from the sensor to the computer.
So these two kinds of equipment, driving handle and speed shock belt, are very effective.
But the problem is that these are instruction hinting devices.
So it's not really freedom, is it?
The computer tells you how to drive - turn left, turn right, speed up, brake.
I call this the co-driver problem.
Therefore, we are avoiding instruction hinting devices and paying more attention to information devices.
A typical example of this non-visual information interface is called an empty graph.
Think of this as a monitor for the blind.
This is a small desktop with many holes in it and compressed air is removed from it, so it can be described as a picture.
So even if you are blind and you put your hand on it, you can sense the behavior route and obstacles.
In fact, you can also change the frequency and possibly the temperature of the air.
This is actually a multi-dimensional user interface.
Here, you can see how the cameras on the left and right and the computer parse and transmit this information to the air map.
In this way, we are showing a simulation program. A blind man is driving with a space map.
This program is very helpful for training blind drivers and quickly testing different theories based on different kinds of non-visual user interfaces.
This is basically how it works.
But this car is a model car, and it will not go on the road unless it is proved to be as safe to drive as today's cars, or safer.
I truly believe it will happen.
But can societies accept this radical idea?
How will we handle the insurance?
How will we issue a driver's license?
There are many different obstacles behind the technological challenge that we need to address before it becomes a reality.
Of course, the main purpose of this project is to design a car driven by blind people.
But potentially more important than this is the enormous value of the by-products of the project.
A sensor that can be used to view darkness, rain and fog.
As well as these new types of interfaces, we can use these technologies to provide safer vehicles for the visual crowd.
Or for the blind, daily living on household devices - educational facilities, office facilities application services.
Imagine the teacher writing notes on the blackboard in class. Blind students can also use these non-visual interfaces to understand and read what the teacher wrote.
This is extremely precious.
What I show you today is just the beginning.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Marinichev said the change in value was affected by the devaluation of the ruble and the epidemic.
He said, "The cost of services is increasing.
Because of the epidemic, people began to spend more time on the Internet. "
Marinichev does not rule out that the annual Internet price will rise seriously, believing that operators can provide customers with higher speed and more services to offset people's dissatisfaction with the price increase.
"Doctor of China" to pay tribute to anti-epidemic heroes - Xinhua News
Recently, with the respect of the heroes of Chinese filmmakers fighting the epidemic, the chairman of Bona Pictures Group and director Liu Weiqiang (left) held a discussion and exchange with Academician Zhong Nanshan in Guangzhou on the filming and production of the anti-epidemic film Doctor of China.
Bona Films hopes to use Doctor of China to pay tribute to all the medical and epidemic prevention workers fighting on the front line of epidemic prevention and control!
In 2021, the film will be released nationwide as a gift film to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.
At present, under the arrangement and deployment of the Ministry of Propaganda of China and the National Film Bureau, and with the support of the Guangdong Film Bureau and the Hubei Film Bureau, Bona Films is organizing the original team of the film Captain of China to prepare the film Doctor of China, which is a film that reflects the unity of the people of the whole country in fighting the new crown pneumonia epidemic under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee.
Focusing on the anti-epidemic front line in Wuhan, the film will show the moving stories of Chinese medical personnel full of dedication and sacrifice on the anti-epidemic front line from the perspective of human nature, using unique narrative and powerful lens language.
It is understood that on the first day of the unsealed Wuhan, Boehner Company overcame many difficulties and sent a photography team to go deep into the front line of the epidemic, exchange face-to-face understanding with hundreds of medical workers and collect information. At present, it has interviewed the white angels at the forefront of the anti-epidemic front, including Academician Zhong Nanshan himself, the first person in Guangzhou to help Wuhan, the Guangdong medical team to help Austria, as well as Wuhan Yintan Hospital, Wuhan Association Hospital, Wuhan University Central Hospital and Wuhan Central Hospital, and taken a large number of valuable first-hand video materials.
Academician Zhong Nanshan also raised expectations and hopes for the filming of the film at the symposium: "I am looking forward to it. I hope you will not only visit some experts who have made more appearances, but also interview more medical personnel working hard on the front line, who are the majority."
He said that he had seen "Me and My Motherland" and "Chinese Captain" before, and thought it was a good way to tell large-scale stories from the perspective of ordinary people.
"Now some foreign friends still have some misunderstandings about China."
When talking about the spread of the film, Academician Zhong Nanshan said that at present, some people in foreign countries like to label the virus as politicized. He hoped that the film would impress the audience from the perspective of human nature: "In addition to being shown in China, it is best to show the film abroad. We should impress the audience with the true humanistic spirit in a way that the audience at home and abroad can understand."
Academician Zhong Nanshan also affectionately recalled the film "Middle-aged People" in the 1980s. "After so many years, what impressed me most about the film after the reform and opening up was" Middle-aged People. "At that time, my friends of doctors abroad cried. If" Chinese Doctors "could play such a role, it would be great."
Academician Zhong Nanshan said that if Doctor of China can resonate with foreign audiences, it will be very successful.
During the discussion and exchange, Academician Zhong Nanshan also shared his opinions and suggestions on the current international epidemic prevention and control. "I believe people will always be smarter than viruses."
Academician Zhong Nanshan said that although the virus is difficult to predict, since the primitive society, human beings have passed through many difficulties and risks. Now that modern society has developed medical science and technology and social management measures, and medical personnel and even the common people all over the world have a basic understanding of the scientific response to the new crown pneumonia epidemic, people will no longer be as passive as before. "Next, we should pay attention to two aspects of work, one is to study how the world can strengthen cooperation, the other is to pay attention to soothe people's hearts."

Chinese Travel "Red Fruit" Gathered in Shaoshan-Xiangtan First Red Expo - Today's Highlights - Hunan Daily - Huazeng Online
Hunan Daily New Hunan Client Journalist Jiang Rui Correspondent Xiao Yan
Jiaxing Red Boat Mold, Shaoshan Bronze Statue of Mao Zedong, Yanan Flower Crafts, Xiangxi Yongshun Bacon... July 25, 2020 Hunan Red Tourism and Culture Festival opens in Shaoshan.
As one of the main activities, the first Xiangtan Red Cultural Industry Expo was held in Shaoshan Tourism Consulting Center.
The exhibition area is full of red creative products and local products from old revolutionary areas, which attract tourists from all over the world to buy.
"The Red Expo is not only a display of the achievements of the national red culture industry, but also an important platform for exhibitors and enterprises to exchange experiences and explore development paths."
According to the relevant person in charge of the Executive Committee of the First Xiangtan Red Expo, the theme of the Red Expo is "Promoting the Red Culture and Promoting the Heating of Cultural Travel." The total area of the exhibition is nearly 3,000 square meters, with an atmosphere-building area, a scenic area for display and exhibition, and an online shopping experience area for red cultural travel.
Eight foreign provinces and cities, including Jiaxing in Zhejiang, Zunyi in Guizhou and Yanan in Shaanxi, as well as 137 enterprises and units in Changsha, Zhuzhou, Yueyang and Chenzhou in our province, were invited to participate in the exhibition. A total of 768 kinds of exhibits were displayed, including red cultural relics, handicrafts, food specialties, tourism routes, red training courses, red creative products, etc.
The exhibition area will be on display until July 29.
As the host of the Red Expo, the Xiangtan Exhibition Area has bright spots.
According to the person in charge of the exhibition area, the Xiangtan exhibition area is divided into two parts: the development of red industry and red cultural industry.
The Red Industry Exhibition Area displays 31 exhibits from 6 enterprises, including Hualing Xianggang, Hualing Cable and Hunan Electric Power, and the Red Cultural Industry Development Exhibition Area displays nearly 200 products from 27 units, including red series books, red series foods and red series creative products.
In the Yenan exhibition area, many tourists are attracted by the display of cloth pile flower handicrafts and paper-cut works of art.
Ma Dongpo, director of Yenan Culture and Tourism Bureau, said that the exhibition carefully selected Yenan's excellent red creative products in the past two years, 16 of which were excellent works of 2019 national red creative products.
At the same time, they invited the inheritors of the national-level intangible cultural heritage protection projects "Anse Paper Cut," "North Shaanxi Folk Song" and the provincial-level intangible cultural heritage project Yanchuan Dui Painting to highlight the special products of Yanan folklore, and took the opportunity to communicate with other enterprises in the exhibition area to promote cross-regional cooperation.
The total number of confirmed cases in Japan exceeded 30,000 - Xinhua
According to statistics, there were 239 new confirmed cases in Tokyo on the 26th, and more than 200 new cases in a single day for six consecutive days, totaling 11214.
In addition, there were 141 new confirmed cases in Osaka Prefecture, 90 in Fukuoka Prefecture and 80 in Aichi Prefecture.
Telecom network fraud crime rose by 70% in the first half of the year.
According to the Supreme Inspection website, in the first half of this year, procuratorial organs across the country prosecuted a total of 5,8101 people for fraud crimes, up 35% year on year.
In particular, the number of fraud crimes prosecuted by procuratorial organs accounted for 43.4% of the total number of crimes against epidemic prevention and control.
The Supreme People's Procuratorate has carried out targeted guidance. Of the 10 typical cases related to epidemic prevention and control that have been issued, a total of 9 involve the crime of fraud.
Judging from the cases handled by the procuratorial organs in the first half of the year, there are a wide range of fraud-related crimes, ranging from the national macro-policy to the people's food, clothing and housing, including epidemic-related fraud, "medical care" fraud, "health products" fraud, "enrollment agency" fraud, "arbitrage loan" fraud, "state subsidy fraud, national assets unfreezing fraud, etc., which are constantly" new "and cover many fields, including education, medical care, employment, old age, social security, land requisition and demolition, accurate poverty alleviation, and financial credit, which not only cause economic losses to the victims, but also seriously affect economic and social development.
In particular, some telecommunications network frauds break through the restrictions of national boundaries, regions and personnel, and have the characteristics of stakeholders, cross-border, remote and electronic payment. There are many victims and great harm.
For example, some have set up special companies, rented high-grade office buildings, set up multiple departments or posts, used legal network platforms to publicize and recruit, trained and evaluated recruiters, and adopted enterprise operation mode management, wearing the cloak of "legality" and becoming more attractive.
It is incumbent upon the procuratorial organs to punish and prevent crimes according to law and issue timely early warning to the public and relevant departments.
In judicial cases, the procuratorial organs conscientiously perform their duties, not only maintaining a high-pressure posture against fraud crimes, but also refining various law enforcement measures in a targeted manner, and promoting social governance through the production and issuance of procuratorial suggestions.
The procuratorial organs strictly regard the facts, evidence, procedure and application of the law in mass arrest and prosecution of fraud cases, take the facts as the basis and the law as the criterion, and do their utmost.
Especially for the crime of telecom network fraud, we pay attention to the central role of electronic data in fact determination, and strive to build a chain of evidence between electronic data, verbal evidence and documentary evidence.
For example, in response to an epidemic-related fraud case handled by the Yinzhou District Public Prosecutor's Office of Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, the procuratorial organ intervened in advance at the first time. It took only five days from the occurrence of the case to its conclusion, reflecting the attitude and determination to handle the case quickly and strictly and maintain the overall social stability.
In the examination of arrest and prosecution, attention should be paid to the prosecution of missing offenders, the omission of 733 persons by the public security organs and the omission of 1,113 co-offenders by the public security organs.
In the first half of the year, procuratorial organs across the country issued 298 procuratorial proposals for fraud crimes, promoting joint efforts to prevent fraud crimes and promote in-depth governance.
For example, in view of the loopholes found in the supervision of telecommunications networks by communications enterprises, banks and intermediary organizations in the handling of cases, the Guangzhou Public Prosecutor's Office and the Dongguan Public Prosecutor's Office of Guangdong Province put forward timely procuratorial suggestions, urging the relevant units to strengthen supervision and improve the mechanism to help promote the construction of a long-term system.
Fourth, make every effort to do a good job in the recovery of spoils and losses.
Procuratorial organs all over the country seize the important links such as intervening in the investigation, guiding the taking of evidence, examining and prosecuting, urge the investigation organs to actively recover the stolen funds, cooperate with the relevant departments to do a good job in the recovery of spoils and damages, and strive to minimize the economic losses caused to the people by the crime of fraud.
For example, the Lin-certain arbitrage loan case handled by the Beijing Public Prosecutor's Office involved 22 properties waiting to be sealed up. In the case that the property may be disposed of first by other cases, the first company issued a "Letter of Suspension of Execution" and served it to the relevant court in time. It suggested that the previously sealed-up court suspend the execution of the property involved and deal with it uniformly until the facts of the crime are found out, so as to make its best efforts to recover the property involved and recover the losses of the victims.
The procurator reminded everyone to be very alert to the crime of fraud. Don't expect "pie in the sky," and don't believe it cheaply and keep your "money bag."
Yuna Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province: Shorter apple trees widen the way out of poverty
2020-07-26 11: 42: 58 Source: China Economic Network Author: Zhu Yanjing Responsibility Editor: Zhu Yanjing
In the heat, the reporter of Economic Daily-China Economic Network walked into Zhonghai Village, Jina Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province.
In the hot sun, Li Yuanzhong, a villager, was weeding grass in the base. Although his face was red, his mouth hummed a few songs from time to time.
Weining County, where Yuna Town is located, is well known in the surrounding areas because of its low latitude, high altitude, abundant light, large temperature difference between day and night, high sugar content and good taste of apples, but also because of its small size and many spots, it has not been able to sell at a good price and has not formed an industrial scale.
Yuna Town was once a poor town with "Baogu potato for spring and autumn." Ten years ago, the local poverty incidence rate was as high as 25.8%.
It is urgent to change the traditional planting habits, adjust the industrial structure and increase farmers' income during the critical period when the fight against poverty eradication enters a decisive battle.
After many visits, Chen Chao, secretary of the Party Committee of Yuna Town, and a team of people in the town believed that the industrial development could no longer follow the old path.
To this end, Yuna Town introduced leading enterprises to grow apples in a modern way.
Hou Jianwen, deputy general manager of Weining Beyond Agriculture Co., Ltd. came to Jina Town from Shaanxi Province in 2015 to investigate. He saw the local planting conditions at a glance and began to plant apple trees there in 2016.
At first, the village mobilized Li Yuanzhong to transfer the land to plant apple trees. Li Yuanzhong and his wife murmured in their hearts, "After planting apples for so many years, they didn't see who in the village made a fortune by planting apples."
"All the apples grown are dwarf apples and will not make the tree grow too tall."
What Li Yuanzhong did not expect was that a new method was used for apple planting. Irrigation pipes were spread under each apple tree, and water and fertilizer were poured to the roots. When the fruit was harvested in autumn, the tractor drove directly into the orchard and the fruit could be picked standing.
At present, Apple base has gradually entered a period of high production, and the market is as expected by Hou Jianwen. Apple does not worry about selling and is loved by consumers in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other cities.
The growing apple industry has brought new changes to Li Yuanzhong's life. Although he is still planting land, he has a new source of income.
Li Yuanzhong's family transferred more than 9 acres of land to the Apple base. In addition to the guaranteed land transfer fee, there are profit dividends after hanging fruit every year. The couple usually work in the base. "One person gets 80 yuan a day and has work all year round."
Li Yuanzhong told the reporter that the profit dividend earned more than 2,800 yuan last year. Combined with the land transfer fee and the husband and wife's work income, the family earned more than 80,000 yuan. "We can't worry about food and clothing, and we have a well-off life."
"At present, it has begun to show results. The annual output value of an acre of apples exceeds 15,000 yuan, about 10 times that of corn."
Chen Chao told the reporter that at present, 20,000 mu of apples have been planted in the whole town of Qena, and there are 6,000 mu in Zhonghai Village alone, covering 4,056 rural households and 17,200 people, including 656 poor households and 2,952 people with built-up cards, with a salary of more than 6 million yuan a year.
With increasingly bulging pockets, Li Yuanzhong also began to realize his "wish."
This Lunar New Year, Li Yuanzhong bought a Land Cruiser and now drives his car to and from work every day. "There are still more than ten acres of land in his home. When the next step is to expand the scale of the Apple base and transfer it all to them, the income will be more."

Our reporter Shang Rui reported: Recently, the atmospheric environment and bioenergy team of Tianjin University made significant progress in "capturing carbon dioxide by membrane separation," and successfully developed a new hybrid matrix membrane preparation technology to greatly improve the carbon dioxide capture performance of membrane materials.
The relevant results have been published as the cover article of the international journal Greenhouse Gases: Science and Technology.
The "greenhouse effect" is a major environmental problem perplexing human development, and carbon dioxide emissions are the culprit of the "greenhouse effect."
How to efficiently capture and utilize the carbon dioxide emitted by human beings is the focus of scientists.
"Membrane separation method" is a new carbon dioxide capture technology. It separates carbon dioxide gas with the help of membrane material, which has the characteristics of high efficiency, energy saving and simple operation.
How to make membrane materials "breathe deeply" and improve the efficiency of gas separation is the bottleneck and difficulty of capturing carbon dioxide by membrane separation method.
The research team of Tianjin University has innovative ideas to explore the influence of different solvents on the separation performance of membrane gas through repeated experiments.
The experimental results show that using N-methylpyrrolidone as the preparation solvent, the carbon nanotubes in the film material are more evenly distributed and "more breathable," effectively improving the gas separation efficiency and rate of the film material.
The carbon dioxide separation performance of hybrid matrix films prepared by this new technology is close to the upper limit of theoretical separation of such membrane materials.
"The new technology provides a new idea for capturing carbon dioxide by membrane separation."
Li Run, a member of the atmospheric environment and bioenergy team of Tianjin University, said, "We hope this technology can provide strong support for the treatment of flue gas by coal-fired power plants and chemical enterprises in the future and play an important role in controlling greenhouse gas emissions."
Understand what professional grade difference is before filing a voluntary report.

Understand what professional grade difference is before filing
Every year, some students or parents do not understand the nouns involved in the voluntary filing, which affects the voluntary filing.
This year, five colleges and universities of Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing University of Science and Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing Forestry University and Beijing Chemical University jointly issued the admission policy for 2020, eliminating professional grade difference.
What is the meaning of professional grade difference and what is the significance in the voluntary filing?
There are three ways of professional assignment rules
Experts reminded that before volunteering, one must read the Admission Charter of the desired school in detail and understand the admission rules of colleges and universities, including the transfer ratio and the rules of professional allocation.
The rules of professional assignment mean that after the transfer of colleges and universities, there are three main ways for professional admission: professional priority, score priority and professional grade difference.
The specific method used by colleges and universities will be specified in the Admission Charter.
However, the admission principle of some colleges and universities is that the total score is preferred, and there is no grade difference between majors.
That is, the candidates in the admission range will be queued according to the total score. When the score does not reach the voluntary admission score of the first major, it will depend on whether the voluntary admission score of the second major has been reached, and so on until the admission to the last professional volunteer, there is no grade difference between the professional volunteers.
The so-called "professional grade difference" means that when institutions arrange candidates for majors, they determine the admission majors of volunteer candidates for different majors according to one or more scores published in the admission rules. This score value is "professional grade difference."
That is, the difference in the scores between the first professional volunteer and the non-first professional volunteer, and the difference in the scores between the volunteers in each major, such as 3, 2 and 1.
For example.
It is assumed that Xiao Ming, a student, applied for the examination of A University and received 560 points. His professional volunteers are: computer, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering and e-commerce. The method of professional grade difference is implemented for the admission of A University. The grade difference is divided into 2, 1, 1 and 0.
In the professional assignment, if Xiaoming's first major volunteer meets the professional admission requirements and the major has a planned balance, Xiaoming will be admitted to the "Computer" major; if the computer is not admitted, his score will be subtracted by 2 points, and the results of 558 points will be ranked with the candidates who volunteer to apply for the "International Trade" examination of the first major to determine whether they meet the professional admission conditions; if they are still not satisfied, the score will be subtracted by 1 point (i.e. 557 points) for the voluntary "automated" admission of the third major; if they are still not satisfied, the score will be subtracted by 1 point (i.e. 556 points) for the admission of the fourth major, and if the follow-up major is still unable to meet its professional volunteers, the score will not be subtracted, and so on.
Different professional grade differences in different universities
With the popularization of parallel volunteering, many colleges and universities have eliminated professional grade differences, but some colleges and universities have retained this method this year. According to the Admission Charter published by each school, more than 20 universities have set professional grade differences this year.
For example, Sichuan Agricultural University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Jiangxi Normal University, Chengdu Medical College, Northeast Electric Power University, Jimei University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing University of Technology, Ningxia University, Shandong University of Technology, China Civil Aviation Flight Academy, etc.
In these colleges and universities, the professional grade difference set by each university is different.
Some colleges and universities have grade differences in each major, such as Ningxia University. The candidates whose files have been submitted to this university will be admitted according to the order in which the candidates fill in the professional volunteers by decreasing by one point and then by the grade.
Some universities set different professional grade differences between different majors.
For example, in Jimei University, the total score difference between professional volunteers is 4 points, that is, the difference between the first professional volunteers and other professional volunteers is 3 points, there is no difference between other professional volunteers, which is regarded as parallel volunteers, and the difference between other professional volunteers and adjustment professional volunteers is 1 point.
When volunteering, candidates and their parents must carefully read the admission policy of the reported school to see if there is any professional grade difference and what the form of grade difference is. While giving full consideration to the scores, they should also make a reasonable analysis of the schools and majors to be selected. If the institution explicitly adopts the method of grade difference in the admission charter, candidates should pay attention to the gradient between the majors and improve the admission probability.

This year's first Atlantic hurricane made landfall in pandemic-hit Texas
The National Hurricane Center announced in the morning that Hurricane Hanna reached 145 kilometers per hour and was expected to bring heavy rainfall to southern Texas and northeastern Mexico until next Monday, which in turn would cause rapid flooding.
At present, with the gradual advance to land, the custom has weakened. Although some areas have power outages, there are no statistical reports of casualties for the time being.
Some local officials in Texas are preparing for a possible tornado along the coast.
President Trump said via Twitter that his office was closely monitoring the dynamics of Hurricane Hanna and Hurricane Douglas in Hawaii, and called on the public to listen to the emergency management information of the local government and protect families and property.
At the same time, the new crown epidemic in Texas is rapidly worsening, with the number of infections soaring, with more than 390,000 confirmed infections and more than 5,000 deaths.
When this hurricane strikes, the government will face the dual challenge of accommodating the homeless and preventing the epidemic from worsening again.

Belgian 3-year-old girl dies of new crown virus infection - Xinhua
Belgium's health department said on the 24th that a 3-year-old girl died of the new crown virus infection, the country's youngest new crown patient.
Belgian health department spokesman Boudwin Katri said the girl had other serious diseases before she was infected with the new crown virus; in addition to the girl, an 18-year-old recently died of the new crown virus infection.
Katri said that 85% of newly diagnosed patients in Belgium last week were under 60 years old.
He reminded the healthy and young people not to take it lightly.
"Although it is rare for young people to die from new crown virus infection, no one is now immune."
Last week, the number of new confirmed cases in Belgium increased by 89% compared with the previous week, and the daily average of 2.9 people died of new crown virus infection, higher than the daily average of 1.7 in the previous week.
During the peak of the epidemic in Europe, the proportion of Belgium's population infected with the new crown virus was "among the highest" in Europe.
Belgium has more than 11 million people.
The latest data show that 64,847 people in Belgium have been infected with the new crown virus.
Katri warned earlier this week that people must take action before the snowball rolls larger and larger, eventually causing an "avalanche."
In order to curb the rebound of the epidemic, Belgian Prime Minister Sophie Wilmes announced on the 23rd that the rules on wearing masks in public places would be stricter, and the implementation of the plan to further lift the restrictive measures in August would be suspended.

Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 25 - Qiu Tenghua, Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development of the Hong Kong SAR Government, said on July 25 that all APEC member economies should act in concert to jointly fight the epidemic and promote economic recovery, and should avoid establishing unnecessary trade barriers in accordance with the rights and obligations stipulated by the World Trade Organization.
Qiu Tenghua made the above statement when participating in the video conference of trade ministers to combat the new crown pneumonia epidemic held by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) on the 25th.
At the meeting, the ministers exchanged views on practical solutions that APEC could take to deal with the impact of the new crown pneumonia epidemic and promote economic recovery in the region.
Qiu Tenghua said that the public health and economic crisis triggered by the epidemic had an unprecedented and far-reaching impact on society and economy.
"We are in a double battle. We must defeat the epidemic before we can save the economy.
We must have a clear goal. The virus is our common enemy. Only cooperation can win, and vice versa will fail. "
Qiu Tenghua said a series of trade restrictions triggered by the new crown pneumonia outbreak could not help control the epidemic.
Trade is the key solution to the current problem and should not be regarded as the problem.
He condemned all discriminatory and divisive policy measures, and urged all economies to keep their borders open, maintain the smooth operation of supply chains, and avoid establishing trade barriers or adopting irrational trade policies at this critical time.

Chengdu people gathered around the US consulate and police stopped people from "looking too happy"
In response to the closure of the US Consulate General in Houston, China announced the closure of the US Consulate General in Chengdu on Friday.
On Saturday, the badge of the US consulate was removed. On Sunday, a dark glass car drove away from the consulate amid the boos of passers-by.
On Sunday, many people in Chengdu piled up in front of the US consulate to take pictures. People who had not come also came to see it driven by curiosity about current events.
The reporter from Chengdu Station of AFP also went to the vicinity of the US Consulate in Chengdu to observe. It was reported that there was a steady stream of visitors, and many parents came for a walk with their children to watch the Consulate, take pictures of the building, or take pictures of themselves.
The consulate was surrounded by guards. From time to time, the police "corrected" the behavior of the people. They did not seem to allow any unusual behavior: a woman was stopped just as she was about to sing a red song, and another guard confiscated a banner.
However, residents of a nearby residential building successfully pulled up a giant Chinese flag on their balcony and shouted slogans in support of China.
The US Consulate in Chengdu was opened in 1985, covering all US consular-related affairs in southwest China, especially the Tibet Autonomous Region.
Agence France-Presse Chengdu Station reporter said that the Chinese government's response to the United States was relatively restrained: many Chinese online asked the government to close the US Consulate in Hong Kong, but the official only said that "the closure of the US Consulate in Chengdu is a necessary and legal response to the unreasonable behavior of the United States."
At present, in addition to Chengdu, the United States also has consulates in Guangdong, Shanghai, Shenyang, Wuhan and Hong Kong.
Large-scale media integration action "Go to the Village Live to See Poverty Alleviation" - Today's Highlights - Hunan Daily - Huazeng Online
Hunan Daily, New Hunan Client, July 25 (Reporter of this newspaper) On July 25, two caravans carrying 5G new media mobile cloud broadcasting system slowly drove out of the scene of the large-scale media integration action "Go to the Village Live to See Poverty Alleviation" sponsored by the Financial Program Center of the Central Radio and Television Station from Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province.
General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out, "2020 is a landmark year. We will build a well-off society in an all-round way and achieve the first century goal. 2020 is also the year of decisive victory in the fight against poverty eradication."
The large-scale media integration action "Going to the Village Live to Watch Poverty Alleviation" is an important measure of the Financial Program Center of the Central Radio and Television Station to promote poverty eradication in line with this important theme.
The action will enter poverty-stricken villages in more than 20 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government, dig fresh stories of poverty-stricken villages, directly address the dramatic changes in the appearance of villages and villages, and show how villagers have broken through the difficulties of survival and development and moved towards the road of becoming rich.
The operation will last for more than three months.
The reporter started from Xuzhou. Bing took the southwest line one way, passing through Anhui, Hubei, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, Chongqing, Yunnan, Tibet and other places; and the northwest line the other way, passing through Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Hebei and other places, traveling more than 10,000 kilometers.
In the form of reporting, "Going to the Village Live to See Poverty Alleviation" is a bold integration.
The economic development of the villages visited by the caravan will be broadcast through the CCTV Finance and Economic Channel of the Central Radio and Television Station, CCTV Economic Voice, China Traffic Radio and CCTV Finance New Media.
Among them, the live TV broadcast will mainly be completed on the CCTV Financial and Economic Channel's midday news program "World Finance" (premiere time: 12: 00-13: 00 from Monday to Sunday), and the CCTV Financial and Economic Channel's prime news program "Economic Information Network" will set up a poverty eradication report column (premiere time: 20: 30-21: 30 from Monday to Sunday).
At the same time, each village visited by the caravan will be broadcast live for up to one hour on the CCTV Finance client. By downloading the CCTV Finance APP, the audience can watch the live broadcast and participate in the lottery activities.
In terms of technology application and studio design, "Going to the Village Live to See Poverty Alleviation" has made a breakthrough and pioneered the "Outfield New Media Caravan."
The vehicle is equipped with a 5G new media mobile cloud broadcasting system, which uses 5G + 4K / 8K + AI technology to realize the organic combination of online and offline, large and small screens, and television broadcasting.
It is equipped with a three-message broadcast area, which is converted from a container with a length of 12 meters, a width of 2.55 meters and a height of 3.98 meters. The box body adopts a hydraulic automatic expansion structure and can be turned up by up to 120 degrees.
The broadcast area can also be expanded automatically and extended to an external platform with an area of more than 50 square meters, which can meet the scene requirements of most programs.
At present, Dongchuan District of Kunming City is hot in summer, and what is hotter than the weather is the poverty-relief workshop next to the relocation site.
Lu Ling, an employee of Kunming Esford Electronic Technology Company, said, "Now, when you leave your home, you can enter the factory and make money for your family. Thanks to the free vocational skills training of the trade union organization."
Walking into the poverty-relief workshop of electronic components processing in Tongdu Street, Dongchuan District, a busy and hot scene came into sight.
Over 40-year-old Lu Ling is a single mother, taking care of her elderly parents while taking care of her children.
When she was in the most difficult time, the General Trade Union of Dongchuan District helped to come up with ideas and ways to "send carbon in the snow" after running.
Since 2018, Lu Ling has enjoyed support policies such as housing, schooling, social security and employment, as well as assistance funds granted by trade unions at all levels.
This year, her child has successfully graduated and found employment. She also got a job and income after taking part in skills training and got out of poverty at the end of April.
It is reported that the special skills training project of the General Organization of Dongchuan District to help fight poverty eradication is a part of the skills training work of the General Trade Union of Yunnan Province.
Taking into account the characteristics of the poor workers in the poverty-relief relocation and resettlement sites in the district, the district general manager made an in-depth investigation to understand the training needs and determine the types of training, and recently planned to train a total of 450 electricians, welders, facemakers, etc.
Recently, Li Yi, an employee of the Yunnan Menglian County branch of Agricultural Bank, wrote a sincere thank-you letter to the county general trade union.
In her letter, she sincerely thanked the trade union for the financial aid from August 2013 to January 2017 to help her complete her studies.
In 2004, Li Yi's father died in a car accident, and her mother was included in the files of workers in difficulty. Since then, she has been enjoying the care of the construction card policy.
With the help of the local trade union, Li Yi successfully completed her studies.
Since 2016, 3,809 households have been released from poverty through system guarantee and precise help.
The successful relief of Lu Ling's family and Li Yi is an epitome of the Yunnan trade union's work to promote the relief of workers in difficulty.
According to Duan Kaiyuan, a staff member of the Legal and Human Rights Protection Work Department of the General Trade Union of Yunnan Province, the General Administration of Yunnan Province will strengthen the dynamic management of the files of workers in difficulty, promote the normalization of the filing work, and promptly integrate the workers in difficulty who meet the conditions for filing into the assistance system; broaden the application channels for workers in difficulty, and use WeChat to open an online filing service platform for workers in difficulty to facilitate the workers in difficulty to make timely and voluntary declarations.
During the epidemic period, it was difficult to work outside the home. In order to help the hard-working workers relieve the living pressure, Yunnan Province arranged a total of more than 13 million yuan in warm-up funds. According to the standards of 2,000 yuan per household of hard-working workers at the national level and 1,500 yuan per household of hard-working workers at the provincial level, special warm-up and sympathy activities were carried out for more than 6,000 families at the national level and more than 1,000 families at the provincial level.
At the same time, the Provincial General Administration docked with various Internet recruitment platforms such as the Department of People's Society and the Recruitment Association of Intelligence, pushed the recruitment information to the workers in difficulty, and provided employment consultation, employment guidance and other services.
