Xinhua Review: Turning outstanding returning migrant workers into a fresh force for rural revitalization - Xinhua
Talent is the key to the revitalization of the countryside.
Where do you find talent?
The outstanding group of returning migrant workers is an indispensable fresh force.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 26, by wire: To turn outstanding returning migrant workers into a fresh force for rural revitalization
Zhang Xiongjia, 34, is in Orchard Village, Meishan City, Sichuan Province. In 2010, he quit his job in Beijing, which earned tens of thousands of dollars a month, and returned home to start a business.
After several years of hard work, the grape growing family farm he runs now has an annual income of more than one million yuan, making him a little famous leader in getting rich. He has also been selected to enter the village "two committees" team.
In recent years, inspired by a series of policies to support agriculture and benefit farmers, such as the national fight against poverty and rural revitalization, more and more outstanding migrant workers like Zhang Xiong have chosen to return home to start their own businesses, activating a pool of spring water in the countryside.
Sichuan, a populous province in western China and a large labor export province, has implemented the "Outstanding Migrant Workers Return Training Project" in the light of the situation. In 2019 alone, more than 8,000 village party branch secretaries will be produced from the outstanding migrant workers brought back, 61,000 village reserve forces will be nurtured and more than 20,000 Party members will be developed, providing a strong guarantee for winning the battle against poverty and implementing the rural revitalization strategy.
If a well-off society is not a well-off society, the key depends on the townsfolk.
Since the reform and opening up, a large number of young and middle-aged laborers in rural areas of China have gone out to work to increase their income, and some have set up their own enterprises through hard work.
However, objectively, it has also led to the emergence of "hollowing out" in rural areas to varying degrees, especially the weakening of grass-roots organizations in rural areas. Both the secretaries of village party branches and the ranks of party members have shown the characteristics of "one old and one low", that is, old age, low education, weak ranks of leaders of village party organizations and prominent problems of green and yellow.
If rural talents and other elements have been flowing to the city in one direction, and the countryside has been in a state of "blood loss" and "anemia" for a long time, revitalization is an empty word.
Attract back migrant workers who are capable, conscious and interested in serving their hometown, guide them to return home and start businesses to become leaders in becoming rich, train them to become Party members and village cadres on the basis of merit, and enrich the ranks of cadres at the grass-roots level. This is a solution to the root causes of the lack of access of rural Party members and grass-roots Party organizations.
Outstanding migrant workers can be brought back, and they must be allowed to stay and do a good job.
In recent years, Sichuan has started by focusing on the Party building of migrant workers. On the basis of strict selection criteria, it has established institutional mechanisms such as targeted return, service guarantee, training and energy enhancement, selection and use of outstanding migrant workers, so that they can improve their abilities, have job security and have hope in their lives. They can truly take root in rural areas and have a sense of achievement in starting their own businesses.
This year is the closing year of the decisive battle against poverty. Talent is the key factor in making a good connection between the fight against poverty and the revitalization of the countryside.
Party committees and governments at all levels should attach great importance to the group of outstanding returning migrant workers, and, through comprehensive measures, turn them into a task force and fresh force that can stay, fight and take them away, so as to provide strong organizational guarantee and talent support for rural poverty eradication and well-off development and revitalization.
Because of the epidemic, this year's college graduates are a very special one. On the evening of July 11, the bilibili Summer Graduation Song Club brought a special live online performance to the graduates. Musicians such as Lao Wolf, Park Shu, Li Yuchun and Mao Yi sent songs and blessings to the recent graduates.
SealWu Wu Yifan, a well-known up owner, also brought a "Wild GraSS", a rap style song he wrote based on Lu Xun 's prose and poetry collection of the same name, which is extremely popular among young people.
Due to the epidemic, many graduates failed to appreciate the sense of ceremony of dialing ears and awarding degree certificates on the spot, so they transferred the sense of ceremony to the line.
The data showed that the popularity of the 2.5-hour song party peaked at more than 35 million.
"Follow your heart, seize the opportunity and ignore the consequences. Sometimes there will be unexpected gains."
Although it is a graduation song party, many songs also moved non-recent graduates.
"The whole scene really wants to cry. Whose youth is full of beauty and regret, but it is worth remembering. We must go on bravely."
Beijing's natural ecology continues to improve to attract more than 500 species of wildlife cities to "settle" -- ScienceDaily

The natural ecology of the capital continues to improve to attract wildlife cities to "settle down"
There are more than 500 species of wild animals in Beijing.
This newspaper (reporter Wang Bin) A reporter from Beijing Youth Daily learned from the Municipal Landscape and Greening Bureau that in recent years, with the continuous improvement of the natural ecological environment of the capital, the species and number of wildlife have also continued to increase.
At present, the number of terrestrial spinal wildlife living in Beijing has increased to more than 500 species, including state-level protected animals such as brown horse chicken and black stork, as well as state-level protected animals such as wildebeest, swan, gray crane and mandarin duck.
Whether it is urban forests planted everywhere within the Second Ring or small and micro wetlands embedded between buildings, it not only brings the wild interest of nature to the citizens of the capital, but also attracts wild animals to "settle" in the city.
In the height of summer, the Songshan National Nature Reserve, located in the Yanshan Mountains in the northwest of Yanqing District, is vibrant.
One was playing leisurely by the mountain stream, while two dogs and badgers fought with each other.
In retrospect, a wild boar could not resist the "scratching" on his body and was rubbing hard against the bark of the tree. Hu Qiaoli, director of the Songshan National Nature Reserve Administration, said that by the end of 2019, 178 species of wild animals, including golden eagles, state-level protected animals, spoon chickens and gazelle, lived in this green sea with a total area of more than 6,200 hectares. Nearly one third of the wildlife species in the city could be seen here.
"In Matsuyama, wild animals are the true 'owners', and our staff can only be regarded as the 'bodyguards' of others at best."
Hu Qiaoli said that in order to understand the wildlife situation in the reserve on the ground, more than 30 professional rangers patrol along 16 carefully formulated protection routes every day. There will also be a "big circle" every month, spending a whole day traveling almost all over the reserve.
"During the inspection, it is necessary not only to check and record biodiversity, but also to check the installation of artificial nests, rescue injured wild animals, install field infrared cameras and so on."
More than 200 infrared cameras have been installed in the Songshan National Nature Reserve to record the living conditions of wildlife in the forest.
Hu Qiaoli said that with the continuous enrichment of biodiversity in protected areas in recent years, more and more wild animals have appeared in the camera. Leopard cats, roebuck and pig badgers have become "resident guests", and the "mirror appearance rate" of gazelle, a second-class national protected animal, has become higher and higher.
Zhang Zhiming, Director of Wildlife and Wetland Protection of the Beijing Landscape and Greening Bureau, said that the number of terrestrial spinal wildlife in Beijing has increased from 461 in 1994 to more than 500 now. The species and number of wildlife in Beijing have continued to increase in recent years.
The figure of wildlife in cities is becoming more and more common, which is closely related to the continuous upgrading of urban greening in the capital in recent years.
In particular, the new round of million-acre afforestation construction, which began in 2018, proposed to reshape the urban ecological environment, enhance the ecological function of woodland green space, and highlight the concept of "near nature".
The planning strives to achieve interconnection and interaction with the surrounding green areas, so as to facilitate wildlife to "visit relatives and friends". The trees planted are also honey and food source plants popular with animals.
I am committed to assisting in the communication between computers and the world around us.
There are many ways to do this, and I like to focus on assisting computers to talk about what they see and understand.
In view of such a scenario, a modern computer vision algorithm can tell you that there is a woman and a dog.
It can tell you that the woman is smiling.
It can even tell you that the dog is very cute.
I deal with this issue and think about how human beings understand and live with the world.
Those thoughts, memories and stories may arouse human attention in such scenes.
The interconnection of all related situations.
Perhaps you have seen such a dog before, or you have spent time running on such a beach and further evoking the memories and thoughts of past holidays. When you went to the beach before, you spent time running around with other dogs.
One of my guiding principles is that by helping computers understand what kind of experience this is, so as to understand the common points of what we believe and feel, then we have the ability to begin to continuously develop computer technology in a way that complements our experience.
Therefore, digging deep into this, I began to work a few years ago to help computers produce human-like stories, from image sequences.
So, one day, while I was working on my computer, I asked it for its opinion on the trip to Australia.
It looked at the picture and saw a Koala.
It didn't know what a Koala was, but the computer said it thought it looked like an interesting creature.
Then I shared a series of images with the computer about houses burning down.
The computer looked at the picture and said, "This is an amazing landscape! This is spectacular!"
It chills my spine.
The computer saw a terrible, life-changing and life-destroying event and thought it was a positive thing.
I realised the computer recognised the contrast between red and yellow and thought it was something to be positive about.
That's partly because most of the images I type into my computer are positive.
That is because people tend to share positive images when they talk about their experiences.
When was the last time you saw a selfie at a funeral?
I realized that in the process of improving artificial intelligence, it is the task that belongs to the task and the data set that belongs to the data set, creating huge gaps, defects and blind spots in the understanding of computers.
In doing so, I'm coding for all sorts of biases.
Prejudice reflects limited views and stems from a data set - which reflects the same human beings, such as stereotypes and stereotypes.
I think back to the development of technology that led me to the situation I found myself in that day - the first colored image was calibrated for the skin color of a white woman, which meant that color photography was biased against blackface.
And with the same deviation, that blind spot continued to enter the 1990s.
Even today, the same blind spot still exists in how to recognize the faces of different characters in the application of facial recognition technology.
In today's research, I think of the most advanced technologies, all of which tend to limit our ideas to one data set and one problem.
And in doing so, we are creating more blind spots and biases that will be further magnified when using artificial intelligence.
At that time, I realized that we must ponder how we will be regarded in five to ten years' time when we invent and create technology today.
In the interaction between human beings and the environment, human beings take time to correct problems, so evolution is slow.
Artificial intelligence, by contrast, is developing at an incredible rate.
This means that it is really important, and we should think carefully about this now - reflect on our blind spots, as well as our biases, and consider how these biases affect the technologies we create now, and discuss today's technology and what it means for the future.
The CEO and scientists have weighed their ideas on the future development of artificial intelligence.
Stephen Hawking warns: "Artificial intelligence will destroy mankind"
Elon Musk warned that this is an existing risk and one of the biggest risks we face as a civilized society.
Bill Gates pointed out, "I do not understand why people are not more worried about artificial intelligence."
But these points of view - are only part of the story.
Mathematics, models, these basic components of artificial intelligence, are something we can all obtain and use.
We have source code tools open to the general public to learn machines and make our own contributions at the same time.
In addition, we can also share our experiences.
We can share what makes us happy when it comes to technology and how it relates to us.
We can discuss what we love.
We can communicate with the foreseeable future. On the technical side, this may be more beneficial, or with the passage of time, more problems may arise.
If we all focus on opening up the discussion about artificial intelligence to the future, this will help create a regular conversation and awareness about what artificial intelligence is? What can it become? And all the things we need to do to achieve the results that best suit us.
We have seen and understood this in the technology used today.
We use smartphones, digital assistants and automatic vacuum cleaners.
Are they evil?
Maybe sometimes it is.
Are they beneficial?
Yes, so do they.
They are not identical.
There you have seen the light of the future.
The future will continue to start with what we have built and created now.
We initiated the domino effect, which opened up the evolutionary channel of artificial intelligence.
In our time, it has shaped the artificial intelligence of tomorrow.
It allows us to immerse ourselves in augmented reality technology and resurrect the world of the past,
When people have difficulty communicating, technology helps them share each other's experiences.
Technology based on online visual media can be used in self-driving cars.
Technology produces language based on the understanding of images, which can evolve into technology to assist visually impaired people and help them better have the visual world.
We have also seen how technology has led to some problems.
We have technology today to analyse the physical characteristics of our birth - such as the colour of our skin or the expressions on our faces to determine whether we are criminals or terrorists.
We have the technology to process data, to process data about gender or race to see if we can get a loan.
All the things we see now are just snapshots in the evolution of artificial intelligence.
Because where we are now, it is a moment in evolution.
This means that what we do now will affect the future development of things and extend to the future world.
If we want artificial intelligence to assist in the evolution of human ways, we need to determine strategies and goals and open up that path immediately.
What I want to see is the direction of development of culture and environment suitable for human beings.
Technology can help us cure patients with neurological diseases or other disabilities, so that they can make life equally challenging like everyone.
The operation of technology does not take into account your characteristics or skin color.
My focus today is on technology tomorrow and ten years from now.
Artificial intelligence can appear in many different ways.
But in this case, it's not a driverless car without any destination.
This is a car we can drive and control at the same time.
We choose when to accelerate and when to slow down.
We choose whether we need to turn or not.
We choose what the artificial intelligence of the future will be.
There will be a vast arena that allows AI to be everything.
It's going to turn into a lot of different things.
It is now up to us to figure out what needs to be implemented to ensure that the results of artificial intelligence will be better for all humans.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Black land "planted" agricultural modernization - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 26, by wire: Black land "planted" agricultural modernization
In the height of summer, two pharmaceutical spraying aircraft skimmed the 10,000-acre high-yield demonstration field at the second operation station of the Fifth Management Area of Friendship Farm, forming two white lines. The large letters "the first field in the world" planted with black rice seedlings in the green field stood out.
Kong Lingqiang, the station manager of the operation station, said that the aircraft can spray medicine on more than 6,000 mu of arable land a day, which is about eight times more efficient than drones and hundreds of times more manual.
This farm is located in Friendship County, Heilongjiang Province, the largest grain producing province in China. From the sound of "Shua Shua" rice cutting in the past to the sound of "rumble" today, traditional Chinese farming and farms have achieved metamorphosis in this black soil belt.
In addition to aircraft, satellites are also used in the modern agricultural production of Friendship Farm.
Kong Lingqiang introduced that on the one hand, they use satellite remote sensing technology to achieve precise fertilization, reduce agricultural inputs and reduce pollution. On the other hand, satellite navigation technology can improve the level of standardized operation of agricultural machinery in the field.
In the process of rice production this year, the farm expanded the operating area of satellite navigation unmanned transplanting technology from 3,000 mu last year to 30,000 mu.
This technology makes seedling planting more uniform, maximizes the utilization of sunlight and cultivated land resources, and saves 16 yuan in labor costs per acre.
Farms have tried new technologies such as informatization and intelligentization in agricultural production, forming the largest agricultural machinery group in China from the ground to the sky.
According to statistics, at present, the total number of agricultural machinery on farms is 49,000 units (pieces), and the comprehensive mechanization rate in the fields has reached 99.8%.
Agricultural machinery operations achieve 100% GPS satellite navigation, 100% precision sowing in dry fields and 100% high-powered locomotives in dry fields.
"Green agriculture, smart agriculture and digital agriculture are the exploration direction of agricultural modernization."
Liu Hualian, director of Friendship Farm, said.
The key to agricultural modernization lies in scientific and technological progress.
In recent years, Heilongjiang Agricultural Reclamation, represented by farms, has played a demonstration and leading role in the demonstration and leading role of modern large agricultural "aircraft carriers", and has initially established a modern agricultural industry system led by large-scale planting, standardized production and industrial management.
On the outskirts of Friendship County, there is an agricultural machinery Expo Park covering an area of 350,000 square meters.
Here, more than 140 agricultural machinery and equipment introduced and used by Heilongjiang Agricultural Reclamation over the years are on display.
These agricultural machinery and farms have witnessed the development of agricultural modernization in China.
Xie Xiaojia for everyone - People of different ethnic groups in Jiangkou River Union, Hefei, Anhui Province, transfer direct attack - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Xie Xiaojia for everyone - People of all ethnic groups in the Jiangkou River Union of Hefei, Anhui Province, have transferred direct attacks
Xinhua News Agency reporters Chen Shangying, Wang Liwu, Liu Xia Cun
On July 25, at about 4 p.m., Fu Kunbao, wearing muddy rubber shoes, went from the front house to the back room and went back and forth with his wife, Zhou Yan, busy packing up their things.
"When I received a phone call from village cadres to transfer, I was still cutting grass in the field."
Fu Kunbao said that he transferred more than 60 acres of land and grew rice, which is now growing well. "He also took medicine yesterday, and his tools and everything have not been cleaned up."
Fu Kunbao pointed to the pesticide sprayer placed in the corner. "No one wants their home to be flooded. Give up their small home for everyone."
In order to cope with the persistent high water level pressure and possible heavy rainfall in Chaohu Lake, the city of Hefei, Anhui Province, is ready to open the flood diversion water storage of Jiangkou River Union County, where Fu Kunbaojia is located, on the 26th.
Jiangkou River Lianwei is located in Feixi County, next to Chaohu levee.
There are thousands of villagers involved in Yan Dian Township and Sanhe Township who need to be transferred.
As of 1600 hours on the 25th, the water level of Chaohu Lake, the fifth largest freshwater lake in China, remained at a high of 13.2 meters, 0.7 meters above the guaranteed water level.
The kitchen of Fu Kunbao 's house is clean. There is a pot of pumpkin head vegetables on the table. There are also eggs and some brine vegetables in the fridge.
"I didn 't expect to move. The water of the Jiangkou River is looking good at present."
Zhou Yan said that the home is a bungalow, and some large objects have not yet been put where for the time being.
"Pack up the valuable items first. Refrigerators and televisions, which are large pieces, can be put in the homes of neighbors or relatives on high ground for the time being."
Wang Li, a village cadre, gave Fu Kunbao advice.
Wang Lizheng is responsible for the transfer and resettlement of 13 villagers, and one family notifies each family to confirm the resettlement plan for each person.
The closest settlement to Fu Kunbao 's family is Su Xiaoxue, Yan Dian Township, about 2 kilometers away.
In addition to large pieces, Fu Kunbao and his wife also have a headache of more than 1,000 jin of grain and some newly bought furniture in the family.
"The grain is ready to be dragged to relatives' homes. There is no way to move the furniture."
As soon as the couple discussed, they put a stool under the newly bought bed and raised the bed by about half a meter.
At 6 p.m., Fu Kunbao began to use a tricycle to transport things to relatives' homes, and Zhou Yan continued to clean up at home.
More than 11 p.m., the couple looked at it before and after at home, pulled on the electric gate and prepared to go to the settlement.
"I hope the water will return early."
Fu Kunbao said.
On July 26, at 9.30am, the reporter saw at the scene of Jiangkou River Union County that the local area had made all preparations before flood diversion.
Zhang Ji Colin small house team to support muscular teenagers - Xinhua
Sports Youth Hot Blood Athletic Show "Sports Bar Teenager" officially landed on Hunan TV on July 11.
Sports leader Zhang Jike and sports assistant Lin Xiaojia shared the stage across the border. Lindane and Fu Yuanhui commented on their own styles, while the hardcore of the "behemoth" power pull device made the program "burn" full of power.
In the first episode, 11 sports teenagers appeared on the power track. While the appearance stunned the live audience, the "strong conflict", "strong confrontation" and "strong heart" on the competitive stage also received attention.
Among them, the "strong conflict" came from Qiao Wenyi, a Super A sports student. Before the competition, he openly provoked Xu Zhibin, known as the "beautiful man" on the same track. He choked that Xu Zhibin should sing and dance the program in his appearance, and even let out the harsh words "Don 't cry and spend your makeup if you lose".
Some remarks made the teenagers and sports leaders on the field gasp.
And "strong confrontation" is more like a fairy fight. Sun Jian Qi, known as the "Great Devil", met Zhang Xindong, who was also strong, and staged a strong matchup.
And their identity is also unexpected. Sun Jianqi is an actor who loves fitness, while Zhang Xindong is a retired special warfare member and three-time recipient of the Warrior Medal.
At the beginning of the competition, the two teenagers made every effort to quickly pull out the small pole. The lasting confrontation on the large pole made the live audience sweat for them.
Under the tense conditions of the competition, Zhang Jike, as one of the leaders of the "Sports Bar Teenager" sports team, also watched the war carefully.
In the comment session, he was also very careful, patiently encouraging the young man who lost the game and helping every mistake point in the process of resuming the game.
Lin Xiaojia, a sports assistant, is a fancy assist. She has made no secret of her appreciation for the teenagers online with face value strength.
When we learn about the overloaded daily training of sports teenagers, we are even more impressed.
Lindane and Fu Yuanhui, who are also sports leaders, have their own styles. One is a calm "prophet" and the other is a "flood girl" who dispels the tense atmosphere with a smile.
In addition, Ji Ke Junyi and Liu Ye, as sports assistants, have also created a lot of explosive topics around sports teenagers.
Church fire in Nantes, France: Parish volunteers admit to arson and are usually kind and taciturn - CNN
On July 26, according to foreign media, on July 18, the famous Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul, a gem of religious history in Nantes, France, was severely damaged in a fire, and the large organ was completely destroyed.
On the 26th local time, the Nantes prosecutor announced that a parish volunteer who was responsible for the security of the cathedral had been charged with "arson and destruction".
He has admitted that he set the fire in the church himself.
According to the report, local prosecutor Senas said that the 39-year-old parish volunteer from Rwanda admitted that he set fire to three places in the cathedral at night.
The man's lawyer said that the arsonist now regrets doing such a thing.
A few years ago, this person entered France through the means of asylum. He was sheltered in the diocese where the fire occurred and taken in in the church.
The prosecution pointed out that recently, he tried to renew his visa and was in the process of talking and communicating with the police station about it.
However, the church said it still could not believe that the usually very kind, smiling, but not very talkative believer would destroy the church he loved so much.
On the day of the fire on July 18, the volunteer had already been questioned and investigated by the police because of illogical problems in his account, but he was later released.
The picture shows firefighters carrying out rescue efforts at the scene.
On the evening of the 25th, the man was arraigned again because the professional engineers of the laboratory of the Central Police Department in Paris obtained new evidence.
This time, the man admitted to setting the fire himself.
It is reported that if convicted of intentional arson and destruction, the suspect may face 10 years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros.
According to the report, the fire caused serious damage to the Cathedral of St. Pierre and St. Paul. The organ in the church was completely destroyed and the stained glass window behind the organ was also badly damaged.
According to Brunet, the chief architect of French historical conservation buildings, it is conservatively estimated that the restoration of Nantes Cathedral will take at least three years.
Comprehensive news: American unilateralism undermines bilateral relations. International public opinion supports China's countermeasure against the United States - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 (Xinhua) -- On the morning of July 24, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the US Embassy in China that China had decided to revoke the establishment and operation license of the US Consulate General in Chengdu and put forward specific requirements for the Consulate General to stop all business and activities.
International public opinion believes that the unilateralist measures taken by the United States have caused serious distress to the bilateral relations between China and the United States. China has responded to the unreasonable provocations of the United States side, and it is legitimate and necessary to take countermeasures.
Andres Borks, director of the Center for Chinese Studies at the Institute of International Studies at the University of Chile, said that the unilateralist measures of the United States have destroyed the bridge of understanding between the Chinese and American peoples and caused a crisis in the relations between the two great powers.
China informed the United States that the closure of its Consulate General in Chengdu is a countermeasure to the unilateral measures of the United States and is in line with diplomatic practice.
Patricio Justo, a professor at the Argentine Catholic University and director of the Arab-China Research Center, believes that China's above decision is a legitimate and necessary countermeasure to the previous provocations of the United States and is not aimed at ordinary American people.
The United States is trying to divert the attention of the American people by pressuring China to cover up its poor response to the new crown epidemic.
Bambang Suryono, chairman of the Asian Innovation Research Center, an Indonesian think tank, said that the provocative diplomatic posture adopted by the United States has caused serious distress to the bilateral relations between China and the United States, which are facing serious challenges.
China's notification to the United States that the closure of its Consulate General in Chengdu is a normal countermeasure, in line with diplomatic practice, and reflects not only China's principled position of resolutely safeguarding its own interests, but also the rational and beneficial nature of China's diplomacy.
Tanzanian current affairs commentator Francis Semwenza said that China's above decision is a legitimate and necessary response to the provocation of the United States.
In order for China-US relations to return to normal, the US side should take the initiative to improve its relations with China and stop interfering in China's internal affairs.
The United States should focus on how to achieve win-win results with China economically and politically, and how to benefit the two peoples and the international community as a whole.
Ali Youssef, Executive Director of the Sudan-based Federation of Arab Indigenous Chinese Friendship Associations, said that the countermeasures forced by China are a legitimate and necessary response to the unreasonable behavior of the United States side, in line with international law and the basic norms of international relations, as well as diplomatic practices.
Previously, the United States called for the closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, which seriously violated international law and the basic norms of international relations.
It is hoped that the United States will revoke the previous relevant decisions and create the necessary conditions for the return of bilateral relations to normal.
Singapore's Lianhe Zaobao newspaper published an editorial saying that the greater strategic intention of the United States is to encircle China and prevent its continued rise.
In the face of the pressing of the United States, although China is very reluctant to see China-US relations continue to deteriorate, it has to take countermeasures.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 26 (Xinhua) -- A reporter learned from the Guangdong Maritime Police Bureau that recently, the Bureau, in conjunction with the Guangzhou Customs and Public Security Department, knocked out a huge refined oil smuggling gang. It was preliminarily verified that the gang had smuggled about 120,000 tons of refined oil products since 2019, with a case value of about 800 million yuan and tax evasion of about 240 million yuan.
The Guangdong Maritime Police Bureau and the customs anti-smuggling department jointly gradually mapped out the personnel division and organizational structure of the gang.
On July 8, the maritime police, customs and public security departments carried out unified network collection operations in Guangzhou, Foshan and other places, as well as in the waters of the Pearl River Estuary, respectively. Four suspected smuggling ships were seized at the scene, a total of 4,700 tons of refined oil products were seized at the ships and oil depots involved, and a number of fund accounts were frozen.
It is understood that a total of eight ships and two helicopters were deployed in the joint operation, divided into a number of action teams to work together to carry out a full-chain crackdown on smuggling at sea and illegal operations on land. All 35 major criminal suspects arrived at the case.
At present, the case is under further investigation and handling.
The relevant person in charge of the Guangdong Maritime Police Bureau said that in the future, he will continue to maintain a high-pressure situation, crack down on all kinds of smuggling illegal and criminal activities at sea, and maintain good order in the sea areas under his jurisdiction.
Hurricane Hannah made landfall in Texas or triggered river surges and flash floods -- ScienceDaily
On July 26, CNN comprehensive foreign media reported that at 5 p.m. local time on July 25, Hurricane Hannah made landfall in Texas, United States, which will bring strong winds and heavy rain, surging rivers and possibly life-threatening flash floods to Texas.
The National Hurricane Center said Hurricane Hannah is expected to carry heavy rain and sweep through parts of southern and northeastern Texas. The rain may cause some streams to surge and life-threatening flash floods.
According to the report, the most severely affected by Hurricane Hannah is the area south of Corpus Christi to the mouth of the Rio Grande River, while widespread flash floods may erupt in the Rio Grande Valley.
"Any hurricane is a huge challenge," Texas Governor Abbott said on the 25th.
Thirty-two counties in the state are under a disaster emergency because of the hurricane.
Corpus Christi, a city with a population of more than 320,000, has closed its libraries and museums, and residents are bracing for it.
Abbott also said that at a time when Texas is being hit hard by the new crown epidemic, the hurricane can no longer be allowed to bring more casualties to Texas.
It is reported that precipitation in southern Texas is expected to reach 6 to 12 inches on the night of the 26th, while northern Texas and coastal areas of Louisiana will also see 3 to 5 inches of rain.
Due to global warming and other factors, the formation of "Hannah" predates the previous Atlantic hurricane season.
In general, the first hurricane in the Atlantic doesn't usually form until mid-August.
Poland to withdraw from European treaty to prevent violence against women
The Polish Ministry of Justice said on Saturday that Poland will take steps next week to withdraw from the European Treaty on the Prevention of Violence against Women.
Poland's right-wing government cabinet said that the treaty requires schools to teach students topics related to gender issues, trampling on the rights of students' parents.
Polish Justice Minister Giobello held a press conference and said that his Ministry of Justice will make a request to the Ministry of Labour and Family on Monday to begin withdrawing from the treaty.
That treaty is also known as the Istanbul Convention.
"The treaty contains elements of what we consider to be harmful morphological nature," Giobello said.
Poland's ruling Law and Justice Party and its ruling coalition partners have a close alliance with the Roman Catholic Church and promote a conservative social agenda.
Polish President Duda made hostility to gay rights one of the main issues during his successful re-election campaign this month.
On Friday, tens of thousands of Poles, most of them women, protested against the withdrawal from the convention in Warsaw and a number of other cities.
Lemat, one of the organizers of the protest, said at the protest march held in Warsaw that "the purpose of withdrawing from the treaty is to legalize domestic violence".
Some protesters carried banners that read, "The Law and Justice Party is a hell for women."
The Law and Justice Party has long complained about the Istanbul Convention.
Poland's previous centrist government ratified the convention in 2015.
The PiS government says the treaty does not respect religion and requires liberal social policies to be taught in schools.
However, up to now, the party has not decided to withdraw from the convention.

Brazilian President 's New Crown Virus Test Results Turn Yin - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Brasilia, July 25 (reporter Zhou Xingzhu) Brazilian President Bolsonaro announced on his personal social media account on July 25 that his latest test for the new crown virus was negative.
In addition to publishing the latest test results, Bolsonaro also posted a picture of himself holding a hydroxychloroquine medicine box on social media.
Bolsonaro has always insisted that this drug can effectively treat the infection of the new crown virus and has repeatedly shown himself taking the drug live through social media.
According to Brazilian media reports, Bolsonaro drove his motorcycle to Brasilia, the capital, after announcing the virus test results on the same day, and also met with a member of Congress.
Previously, Bolsonaro had been working in isolation at the presidential residence.
Bolsonaro announced in a joint live broadcast by a number of local media on the 7th of this month that he himself tested positive for the new crown virus on the 6th, and conducted two more tests on the 14th and 21st, both of which tested positive.
Jiangxi opens up a "green channel" for young people on the front line of flood control to enlist in the army - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, July 26 (Guo Dongming, Xiong Liang) The conscription office of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government recently made it clear that priority shall be given to individuals or their children who have performed outstanding in this flood rescue and relief task who meet the conditions for conscription and have passed both medical and political examinations.
"After the registration of the conscripts, we will give priority to the appointment of soldiers after verification by the community where the conscripts are located, the Street Armed Forces Department and the Shuyang District Conscription Office."
Wang Hui, Vice Minister of the Ministry of People 's Armed Forces of Shuyang District of Jiujiang City, said that affected by the flood, they concentrated on organizing medical examinations for young applicants for three days starting on the 25th.
Zhou Jingfan, a young conscript in Shuyang District of Jiujiang City, is a 22-year-old college graduate. His mother is a community worker and his father is a veteran of a department of the Air Force. Zhou Jingfan 's parents have been on duty on the front line of flood control and flood fighting for ten days.
"These days, I see in the news that the people's soldiers are desperate to defend their hometown on the front line of flood control. I also want to be like them."
Zhou Jingfan said that he had a dream of joining the army since he was a child, and through this flood fighting, he strengthened his determination to join the military camp.
Jiujiang City also regards flood rescue and rescue as a "living textbook" for conscription publicity. Taking the community as the unit, they called on young conscripts to voluntarily participate in the tasks of patrolling and checking embankments and guarding duty. They now understand the nature and purpose of the people's army and strengthen their confidence in joining the army and reporting to the country.
Luo Jiuyu, commissar of the Ministry of People 's Armed Forces of Shuyang District of Jiujiang City, said that by giving priority to the appointment of soldiers, he hoped to inspire more young conscripts and create a good social atmosphere in which it is honorable to participate in the task and honorable to join the army.
According to the Vietnam News Agency, Grivoli believes that Vietnam has made great contributions to the development of ASEAN over the past 25 years.
Vietnam is not only a responsible member of ASEAN, but also the locomotive of ASEAN.
Grivori said that Russia and even the Asia-Europe Economic Union believe that Vietnam has contributed to ASEAN enhancing its status and promoting its image abroad.
He stressed that "ASEAN should therefore thank Vietnam."
Grivori said that analysts have given recognition to the peace initiative put forward by Vietnam.
Vietnam is willing to share its experience with ASEAN countries and propose constructive and peaceful measures on the issues facing the Asia-Pacific region, including the East China Sea issue.
With regard to the cooperation between Vietnam and Russia under the framework of ASEAN, Grivori believes that Vietnam provides support for the cooperative relationship between Russia and ASEAN and helps Russia gain benefits under this framework of cooperation.
The Asia-Europe Economic Union, including Russia, will be able to enter the ASEAN market after signing the FTA with Vietnam.
Grivori proposed to maximize the free trade area between the Asia-Europe Economic Union and ASEAN countries, thus creating a platform for economic and security stability.
At the same time, Grigori believes that Russia, Vietnam and ASEAN are on the right track and will achieve their goals.
From now until the end of 2020, Beijiang Province will have the necessary conditions, especially in the areas of infrastructure, human resources and land, in order to actively welcome the inflow of foreign capital, especially multinational groups with value chains and the transfer of advanced technologies.
In addition, Beijiang Province will handle the proposal submitted to the Prime Minister of the Government to decide on investment in infrastructure construction and operation projects in the Vietnam and South Korea Industrial Zone and approve the addition of the two industrial-city-service areas of Anshan-Beilong and Anyuan in the province to the overall plan for the development of the Vietnam Industrial Zone by 2020.
At the same time, Beijiang Province has made great efforts to accelerate the progress of various projects, especially infrastructure construction and operation projects in industrial park clusters such as Hefu, Gwangju and Shuangxi - Neihuang, so as to form a land fund for attracting investment.
In 2020, the Beijiang Provincial Bureau of Industry and Trade will make suggestions and suggestions on the planning of industrial zones and industrial clusters to be incorporated into the provincial plan.

Upgraded version of Russian helicopter gunship card - 52M first out of factory at the end of the year - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency Moscow, July 25 (Xinhua) -- According to the plan of the Russian Ministry of Defense, the Ka-52M, an upgraded version of the Russian helicopter gunship (hereinafter referred to as Wuzhi) Ka-52, will be completed and replaced for the first time in December this year. The model will be greatly improved in reconnaissance, communications and weapons performance.
According to a recent report in Russia's Yediot newspaper, Wuzhika-52M is called the "Super Alligator". Its development contract was signed by the Russian military and military industrial units in April last year. At present, the first two upgraded Wuzhi are undergoing renovation and replacement at the Far East Helicopter Manufacturing Plant of the Russian "Progress" Aerospace Group Corporation. Its state-level testing and improvement finishing work will be completed by October 2022.
According to Russian experts with knowledge of the above upgrade work, the Wuzhika-52, the "predecessor" of the "super alligator", was officially installed in November 2011. The model exposed some weaknesses in its use. This upgrade is precisely for the purpose of "filling the short board".
The report said that compared with the Ka-52, the Ka-52M will be partially equipped with new protective materials that do not add weight. Its pilot cockpit will be strengthened and equipped with new equipment to withstand missile attacks, thus increasing the probability of battlefield survival. It will be equipped with more powerful generators in order to power more complex airborne electronic equipment. The photoelectric system will be upgraded to be able to detect and identify battlefield targets further apart. The new light multi-purpose missile, which mainly attacks armored combat vehicles and reinforced concrete fortifications, will have a range of up to 20 kilometers.
In addition, the Ka-52M will have more advanced electronic guidance systems, weapons targeting systems and navigation equipment.
Russian experts also said that it is worth noting that the Ka-52M will be equipped with communication equipment to communicate with drones, so as to obtain information transmitted by nearby drones in real time in the air, such as displaying images taken by drones on the cockpit screen of the helicopter.
It is planned that the pilots of the Ka-52M can directly control the drones with which they cooperate, thus improving the pilots' grasp of the battlefield situation and guidance of long-range missiles.
According to Russian media reports, Russian Deputy Minister of Defense Klitschko said in December last year that the Russian Ministry of Defense plans to purchase more than 110 Vuzhika-52M by 2027.
The new decree stipulates that masks must be worn in indoor public places in the Campania region with immediate effect, and violators may be fined up to 1,000 euros.
On June 1, local time, the Colosseum reopened in Rome, the capital of Italy.
It is reported that according to the latest epidemic prevention decree issued by the regional government, people in Campania region must wear masks in accordance with the epidemic prevention requirements when travelling on all public transport, as well as entering and leaving indoor public places such as shops, bars, supermarkets and pavilions.
Those who violate this provision may be fined up to 1,000 euros.
At the same time, the decree stipulates that all passengers from non-Schengen countries entering the Campania region must be quarantined.
The regional government will authorize health institutions to coordinate the arrangement of specific hotels to isolate positive and asymptomatic persons.
The decree entered into force on July 25.
In less than an hour, three customers who entered the supermarket have accepted the fine.
Hebei has rehydrated 1.75 billion cubic meters of rivers and lakes ecologically since the beginning of this year -- ScienceDaily
Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, July 26 (Reporter Wang Kun) A reporter learned from the Hebei Provincial Water Resources Department that since the beginning of this year, Hebei Province has made overall use of the diversion of river water and local reservoir water, and has successively implemented ecological water recharge to 28 rivers, including Hutuo River, Tanghe River and Yuma River, as well as Baiyangdian, completing a total of 1.75 billion cubic meters of ecological water recharge to rivers and lakes.
Hebei Province has seized the favorable opportunity of the South-to-North Water diversion Central Line project to increase the flow and transmission of water, and has implemented ecological water recharge by using the diversion of river water to rivers such as the Tanghe, Shahe and Shilong rivers.
At the same time, nine large and medium-sized reservoirs, including the Western Ocean and Dongwushi, as well as Baiyangdian, have been used to implement ecological water recharge to Shuyang River and Qinglong River, with a cumulative surface area of more than 90 square kilometers.
In order to do a good job in ecological water recharge, the Hebei Provincial Water Resources Department has actively organized and carried out the work of detecting, rectifying and strengthening hidden dangers of water recharge rivers and cleaning river channels, refining practical measures and strengthening inspection, management and protection.
Through supervision and inspection and centralized unannounced visits, all kinds of problems are solved in a timely manner, ensuring the safety and order of river water recharge.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Hebei Provincial Water Resources Department, the orderly implementation of ecological water recharge in rivers and lakes has effectively repaired the ecological environment of rivers and lakes in Hebei Province, promoted the recharge and conservation of groundwater along the coast, greatly improved the living environment and economic development environment along the route, and is of great significance for achieving the goal of "clear water, green shore, smooth river and beautiful scenery" management and protection of rivers and lakes.
You should all know the facts I am going to tell.
I believe that this intuition that inequality can cause social division and corruption existed before the French Revolution.
The difference is that we can now find evidence. We can understand the impact of inequality by comparing societies with different degrees of equality.
I will show you some data and explain why those data are indeed related.
But first of all, come and see how hard our lives are.
(Laughter) I want to start my speech with a contradiction.
This graph shows the relationship between our average life expectancy relative to gross national income - the latter measures the average affluence of the country.
You can look at the countries on the right, such as Norway and the United States, which are twice as rich as the countries on the left, such as Israel, Greece and Portugal.
However, this has not affected the average life expectancy of their citizens.
There is no sign of interconnection.
However, if we understand within society, we can find that there are great differences in health conditions within their society as a whole.
This picture shows that the average life expectancy is still.
These are small towns in England and Wales - the poorest on the right and the richest on the left.
There is a big difference between the poor and everyone else.
Even those who happen to be just below the top are in worse health than those at the top.
Therefore, income means a lot in our society, but the comparison between different societies does not make sense.
The contradictory explanation is that in our society, we look at relative income or social status and identity - that is, our mutual relationship and the size of the gap between people.
Once you have that idea, you should immediately think: What happens if the gap widens? What if the gap is narrowed? What happens if the income gap is widened or reduced?
That's what I'm going to tell you right away.
I didn't use any hypothetical data.
My data comes from the United Nations - like the data of the World Bank - on the income gap between these rich, developed market democracies.
The method we use, which is simple and easy to understand, and can be downloaded by you, is to compare the income gap between the top 20% and the bottom 20% in each country.
You can see that the countries on the left are all relatively equal - Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden - and their top 20% are about 3.5 to four times richer than the bottom 20%.
However, on the other side of the relative inequality - the United Kingdom, Portugal, the United States, Singapore - the income gap is twice as large.
According to this way of comparison, the level of inequality in our country (the United Kingdom) is twice that of some other equally successful democratic markets.
Next, I will show what impact this has on our society.
We have collected data on the problems arising from differences within society, which are more common at the bottom of society.
Data that can be compared internationally include average life expectancy, children's math and language scores, infant mortality rate, suicide rate, prison population ratio, teenage early pregnancy rate, degree of mutual trust, obesity, mental illness - all of which meet the standard diagnostic classification, including drug and alcohol addiction - as well as social mobility rate.
We put all of this into one coefficient.
They are all weighted evenly.
The score of a country is obtained on average by these factors.
You can see that these scores are related to the inequality comparisons that I've shown just now, and I'm going to show that data over and over again.
The more unequal countries are, the worse they will perform on various social issues.
The correlation is very strong.
But if you look at the same health and social problems compared with the per capita national income and the index of gross national income, you will find nothing. There is no correlation any more.
We have a little concern that people may think that we are picking specific issues to cater to our theories and then artificially creating evidence. So we also published a paper on the UNICEF Child Welfare Index in the British Medical Journal.
It contains 40 different parts, summed up by others.
It includes whether children can talk to their parents, whether they have books at home, how much immunisation rates are, and whether there is bullying in schools.
All included.
This is how the index relates to the same level of inequality.
The more unequal a society is, the worse children do.
The relationship and its implications.
But once again, if you look at the relationship between child benefit and national income per head, you will get nothing. There is no sign of a correlation.
All the data I'm showing you at the moment is revealing the same thing.
The average welfare of our society no longer depends on national income and economic growth.
They are very important in poorer countries, but not in rich developed countries.
And the differences between us and our position relative to others seem to be very important today.
Below, I will show you some of the divisions of our index.
This is the mutual trust index.
It refers to the proportion of people who agree that most people are credible.
This is data from the "World Values Survey".
It can be seen that on the more unequal side, about 15% of people feel that they can trust others.
But in more equal societies it rises to 60 or 65 per cent.
If you look at the participation of community activities or the assessment of social capital, there are very similar associations closely related to inequality.
I would say that we repeated this work twice.
The first was aimed at these rich and developed countries. We later changed the test subjects and repeated the test with 50 states in the United States - investigating the same question: Do the more unequal the states do, the worse they do on all these assessments?
This is the relationship between mutual trust and inequality reached by the federal government in a general social survey.
Very similar scattered points are distributed in a similar range of trust levels.
The same thing continues.
Basically, we found that almost all the factors related to mutual trust reflected in international surveys are also reflected in the 50 states we surveyed separately.
This is no coincidence.
This picture is a mental illness.
The World Health Organization collects data through random sampling using the same diagnostic interview method, which allows us to compare the rate of mental illness in each society.
This is the proportion of the population suffering from any kind of mental illness in the previous year.
It ranges from 8% to more than 24% - indicating that the proportion of the whole society suffering from mental illness is three times higher than that of other societies.
Again, these are closely linked to inequality.
This picture shows the crime rate.
Red dots denote the states of the United States and the Blue Triangle denotes the provinces of Canada.
But look at the difference in their numbers.
Murder rates range from 15 to 150 per million.
That's the ratio of prison inmates.
This is a gap of 10 times, and the exponential function will amplify this gap.
However, the range of changes in the number of prisoners is from 40 to 400.
Crime is not the main reason for this relationship.
In some places, crime can explain part of the reason.
But it is more a severe trial, or a more harsh trial.
The more unequal society is, the more inclined it is to retain the death penalty.
This picture shows the status of children dropping out of high school.
Again, the gap is wide.
If we discuss the selection of social talents, we will find that the harm of this gap is very serious.
This map shows the social mobility rate.
In fact, it is based on the turnover rate of income.
Basically, what it asks is: Is there a rich father with a rich child with a poor father with a poor child, or is there no relationship between the two?
On the more unequal side, dad's income is more important - for example, the United Kingdom and the United States.
And in northern Europe, dad's income is less important.
There's more social class mobility there.
As we always say - and I know there's a lot of American listeners here - if Americans want to live their "American dream," they should go to Denmark.
(Laughter) (Applause) What I have already shown is marked in italics here.
There are a few other issues that I can show.
Those problems are more widespread at the bottom of the social gradient.
But there are endless problems with the social gradient, which appear worse in unequal countries - not just a little bad, but everything is as bad as two times and 10 times worse.
Think about the cost, the human cost.
I would like to go back to this picture that has been shown before. We have combined everything to illustrate two points.
First, through chart after chart, we found that the countries that performed less well, no matter what, seemed to be those that were more unequal, but those that performed well seemed to be northern Europe and Japan.
So what we see is the relationship between general social disorder and inequality.
It wasn't just one or two things that went wrong, it was just about everything.
Another very important point I would like to point out on this map is that if you look at the bottom, Switzerland and Japan, they show that they are very different countries in all respects.
The status of women and their adherence to small families are at two extremes in rich and developed countries.
But another important difference is how they achieve greater equality.
Sweden has big differences in income, but it closes the gap with taxes, state benefits, generous handouts and so on.
Japan is quite different.
First of all, the pre-tax wage gap in Japan is relatively small.
It has lower taxes.
It also has relatively few benefits.
In the study of the states of the United States, we found a sharp contrast.
Some states do well through redistribution, while others do well because of the small pre-tax income gap.
Therefore, we concluded that it is not important to achieve greater equality, but to achieve such equality.
I am not talking about complete equality. What I am talking about is that it does exist in rich developed market democracies.
Another unexpected thing about this map is that it is not only the poor who will be affected by inequality.
The words of John Dorn (the English poet) seem to have some truth: "No man is an island."
Through a series of studies, we can compare the behavior of people of each social class in different countries with more or less equality.
This is just one example.
This picture shows the infant mortality rate.
According to the general social and economic classification records of the United Kingdom, some Swedes have very kindly classified many infant deaths.
This is an anachronistic classification based on the position of father, so single mothers form their own set of data.
But we look at the so-called "lower class of society", which is manual work that does not require technology.
In the middle is manual work that requires technology, to advanced non-manual work, all the way up to professional work - doctors, lawyers, managers of large companies.
It can be seen here that Sweden is doing better than the UK and is doing better in every social class.
The biggest differences occur at the bottom of society.
But even at the top, living in a more equal society has some advantages.
We showed five different sets of data that included educational outcomes and health conditions in the United States and internationally.
It seems that in general - the more equal society shows the most obvious differences at the bottom of society, but it will also have some advantages at the top of society.
I should explain what is going on.
I think I'm showing and discussing the psychological impact of inequality on society.
It is more about paying attention to the sense of superiority and inferiority, being valued and looked down upon, being respected and belittled.
Of course, those feelings arising from the competition for identity status have promoted the progress of social consumerism.
But it also leads to the insecurity of status.
We are more worried about how others judge and view us, whether we appear attractive, smart, or such.
The social value evaluation enhances the fear of these social value evaluation.
Interestingly, some similar work is going on in the field of social psychology: Some people looked at 208 different studies. In the study, volunteers were invited to a psychological test center and then tested their stress levels and their reactions when performing stress tasks.
In this observation, scientists were interested in which kind of pressure best raised the level of cortisol and, most importantly, Holmon in the body.
The result is precisely those tasks that include social evaluation threats - tasks that threaten self-esteem and social status - in which others can negatively evaluate your performance.
These pressures have a very special effect on the physiology of stress.
At present, we have accepted the criticism.
Of course, some people do not like this, while others find this very unexpected.
However, I should still tell you that when people criticize us for picking and choosing data, we have never done so.
We have an unconditional provision that if our data sources contain data from the countries observed, then we include it in the analysis.
Our data sources determine whether the data is valid or not, not us.
Otherwise, there will be deviations.
What about other countries?
Of the journals reviewed by academic peers, 200 studies were on the relationship between health and income and equality.
This is not limited to these countries here, and there is a very simple proof hidden.
The same countries have the same inequality measurement method, one problem after another.
Why don 't we control other factors?
I have shown you that per capita national income has not had any impact.
Of course, others have applied more complex methods in the literature to exclude poverty, education and other factors in the experiment.
What is the cause-and-effect relationship?
The correlation itself does not prove the causal link.
It took us a fair amount of time.
Indeed, people have a good understanding of the causal link between our results.
The biggest change in our understanding of the drivers of long-term health in rich developed countries is how important long-term stress from society is to the impact of long-term stress on immunity and the cardiovascular system.
Or, for example, the reason that violence has become more and more common in less equal countries is because people are very sensitive to being looked down upon.
I would say that in order to solve this problem, we should solve a series of problems after tax as well as before tax.
We should limit income and curb the bonus income culture at the top.
I think we must do everything in our power to make our leaders accountable to our employees.
The last thing I would like to conclude is that we can improve our real quality of life by reducing our income gap.
In this way, we will find that we have suddenly solved the social mental health problems of the whole society, which is really wonderful.
Thank you.

(Deutsche Welle) In the past two weeks, the number of new crown cases in Spain has picked up sharply, with thousands of new cases in many days.
The British government temporarily decided on the evening of Saturday (July 25) to remove Spain from the safe travel list from 0: 00 local time on July 26. Those entering the UK from Spain must be quarantined for 14 days.
British tourists who are vacationing in Spain expressed surprise, concern and even anger at the decision, as the news came suddenly and caught off guard.
It is reported that British Transport Secretary Grant Shapps is also currently on holiday in Spain.
Before the UK issued the isolation measures, Norway had also announced that those returning to Norway from Spain would be quarantined for a period of 10 days.
France and Belgium advised their residents to abandon their holiday plans in Barcelona and surrounding areas.
Beaches in these areas are overcrowded and social distance cannot be maintained between people. At one point, the police needed to take measures to reduce the number of beachgoers.
Tourism is an important pillar industry in Spain.
Spain: It's safe here
In response to the decision made by the UK, the Spanish Foreign Ministry said on Sunday that the outbreak in the country was under control.
Spanish Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya stressed to the media: "Spain is safe, not only for Spaniards, but also for tourists."
The Spanish government will try to persuade the British government to exclude the Balearic Islands and Canary Islands from the isolation measures.
The reason is that the infection rate of these two tourist resorts is much lower than that of the UK mainland.
In order to prevent the spread of the epidemic, the Catalonia region of Spain has also restarted the "foot ban".
Tourism is an important pillar industry in Spain, which is one of the most popular resorts for British tourists.
This decision by the UK is expected to greatly affect the tourism industry in Spain.

First day of the middle volt: Beijing takes a break from the heat and heat to open the rainfall mode - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 (reporter Ni Yuanjin) July 26 is the first day of this year 's "Zhongfu".
The windy, showers and convective weather in the early hours of the 26th dispelled the heat and heat that had enveloped the Beijing area for days. A new round of rainfall weather will continue for several days.
The Beijing Meteorological Observatory announced at 11: 00 on the 26th that there were scattered showers (accompanied by weak thunder and lightning) in Beijing on the 26th, with a daily maximum temperature of only 27 ° C. It was cloudy with light to moderate rain (accompanied by weak thunder and lightning) at night, and the minimum temperature at night was 23 ° C.
From the previous 24 to 25, the whole city of Beijing was in a high temperature blue warning, with the daily maximum temperature in most areas around 37 ° C and local high temperatures exceeding 40 ° C.
Fu Tian is the highest temperature, wet and sweltering day of the year. There are "three volts" a year, and the hottest is in the middle volt. This is when the Chinese people call it "bitter summer".
When they fall into the ambush, their families fill the barn, and there is a folk saying of "one volt of dumplings and two volts of noodles".
According to the current forecast, there will be more rainy weather in Beijing in the next three days.
The meteorological department reminded the public to minimize play in mountainous areas and guard against geological disasters.
It is understood that this year's "medium volt" has 20 days, starting on July 26 and ending on August 14.
After entering the "middle volt", people will feel weak and loss of appetite.
In the diet, you can choose green beans, coix and other foods that have the effect of clearing heat and relieving heat, strengthening spleen and appetizing, as well as bitter foods such as bitter vegetables and bitter gourd, which can help enhance appetite and remove heat.
Engines may stall FAA urgently orders inspection of 2,000 Boeing airliners - Xinhua
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an emergency airworthiness order on the 24th, requiring emergency inspection of about 2,000 Boeing 737NG and 737Classic airliners registered in the United States. The reason is that the air check valve of the above-mentioned airliners may cause the engine to stop in the air after corrosion.
The FAA said that so far, it has received four reports of air parking of the engines of 737NG and 737Classic passenger aircraft, so it has made an emergency inspection request. The inspection is aimed at passenger aircraft that have been parked continuously for seven days or more and passenger aircraft that have flown less than 11 times so far after being put back into flight.
The FAA warned that if the stage 5 check valve of all two engines of the airliner is corroded, it may get stuck in the open position, causing the airliner to completely lose power and be unable to restart the engine.
The aviation regulator ordered that once the check valve is found to be corroded, air operators must replace this key component before the airliner is put into service again.
Boeing responded later in the day that the outbreak of the new crown outbreak led to a reduction in travel demand, which led to the mothballing or less use of many passenger aircraft, making "check valves more vulnerable to corrosion".
At the same time, Boeing said that air operators have been advised to inspect the airliners involved in the instructions. If problems are found, Boeing will provide assistance in repairing and replacing check valves.
The Associated Press reported that airliners owned by major US air operators usually fly multiple times in a day, but a large number of airliners were grounded after the outbreak of the new crown outbreak. With the recent slow growth of passenger travel demand, some airliners have been put back into operation.
The FAA did not release details of the four air parking reports.
Alaska Airlines disclosed one of the incidents later on the 24th.
In a statement, the air operator said that one of its airliners was flying from Seattle, Washington, to Austin, Texas, on July 15 when an engine suddenly stalled and the airliner eventually made a successful emergency landing at Austin Airport.
Alaska Airlines said that the engine of the airliner has been replaced and the engines of the six airliners have been inspected in accordance with the instructions of the Federal Aviation Administration.
American Airlines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines said separately on the 24th that their airliners did not experience engine stalling related to air check valves.
Four jets owned by American Airlines will be inspected, while 28 jets owned by United Airlines will be inspected.
Delta Air Lines said it would inspect 20 of its airliners, but did not say whether there had been engine stalls.
A number of media reports said that the FAA emergency airworthiness directive is another shock to Boeing.
One Boeing 737 MAX each from Indonesia's Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashed in October 2018 and March 2019, respectively, killing a total of 346 people.
This series of passenger aircraft was subsequently grounded worldwide, stopped production in January this year and resumed production in May this year.
FaA Administrator Steve Dixon admitted in June that the FAA "made a mistake" in regulating Boeing with regard to the 737 MAX airliner.
"Ding Dong on the Line! Good Teacher" will go live next week Xue Zhaofeng will lead the "Knowledge Sponsor - Xinhuanet
There is a new variety online again.
The interactive knowledge sharing program "Ding Dong Online! Good Teacher" will be broadcast on Hunan TV from July 20.
It is understood that the program will create a new all-age youth classroom, and a group of teachers with face and talent will take part in the battle to challenge the export of interesting knowledge.
Unlike the serious impression of the group of teachers in the hearts of the public in the past, "Ding Dong Online! Good Teachers" gathers a group of knowledge representatives with both face value and talent.
They are not only young knowledge role models from all disciplines, but also a group of all-round "paragraph hands" who can shake baggage and are good at teaching and fun.
In the program, this group of outstanding young knowledge role models, as "knowledge sharing officers", will challenge interesting knowledge classes.
They need to impress the audience present by showing the most interesting side of their discipline through the export of knowledge with attitude.
The "Taoist Ask Group", composed of all-age viewers, will ask a variety of questions live, making it more difficult for the "Knowledge Sharing Officer" to teach, and adding a little exciting atmosphere to the program.
It was revealed that the "knowledge sharing officer" included outstanding young teachers such as Li Yongle, a physics teacher at the secondary school attached to Renmin University of China, Zhang Xuefeng, a famous examination and research instructor, and Wang Lei, a history teacher with ten years of professional experience. They will show the "hardcore" knowledge of various disciplines to the live audience in an unexpected way.
In addition, the program also invited Xue Zhaofeng, an economics professor, to serve as the "knowledge initiator" of the program, joining Du Haitao and Jin Mengjia, "Ding Dong teaching assistants", to talk about youth with the audience and create an "open course for youth for all".
Chief Secretary for Administration of the HKSAR Government: The situation is serious and we are making every effort to fight the epidemic - CNN
Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The Chief Secretary for Administration of the Hong Kong SAR Government, Zhang Jianzong, said on July 26 that the situation of the Xinguan pneumonia epidemic in Hong Kong continues to be serious. If the epidemic worsens, the SAR Government will resolutely take stricter control measures to further restrict the business of business premises and reduce the space for citizens to go out.

He said that this wave of epidemic is the most severe in half a year, and the next two weeks will be very critical. We should make every effort to prevent the further spread of the virus in the community.
In addition to the necessary measures taken by the SAR Government, it is also very important for the public to self-discipline and cooperate.
He urged members of the public to stay at home as far as possible, reduce social contact and eat out.
Members of the public should cooperate with the compulsory measures of wearing masks to protect themselves and others, and pay attention to personal and environmental hygiene and wash their hands frequently. They should also suspend non-essential gatherings or dinners of relatives and friends and reduce their visits to markets.
He said that the Central Committee has always been very concerned about the changes in the epidemic in Hong Kong and supported the work of the SAR Government in preventing and fighting the epidemic. It has responded positively to the latest request of the Chief Executive and provided assistance in increasing the testing capacity and retrofitting the Asia International Expo Pavilion as a similar "square cabin hospital".

The "Nutritional Agent" of Always Supplementing the History of the Party and the History of New China -- ScienceDaily

Recently, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed during his visit to the Siping Battle Memorial Hall: "We should enable 1.4 billion people and more than 90 million Party members, especially leading cadres at all levels, to study the history of the Communist Party of China and the history of New China well."
Carefully studying the history of the Party and the history of New China is a compulsory course for Party members and cadres to remember their first thoughts and mission. They should draw rich nourishment from it, cultivate the feelings of their family and country, and take the long journey of a new era.
A magnificent history of the Party and the history of New China records the hard work and glorious course of the Communist Party of China since its birth, and shows the faith and loyalty forged by the Communists with their lives and blood, as well as the initial heart and mission of the Communists to adhere to forever.
History is the best textbook. For Party members and cadres, the history of the Party and the history of New China are the most brilliant chapters in this textbook.
Every Party member and cadre should continuously strengthen the historical thinking of taking history as a mirror and moving towards the future, base on the new journey and new mission, pick up the "baton" of the times and follow the long journey of the present generation.
Cast the soul with history and adhere to the mission of the original heart in studying the history of the Party and the history of New China.
Turning to the history of the Party and the history of New China, it is full of the immutable initial mission and rock-solid belief of the Chinese Communists, demonstrating the simple feeling of the Communists to always be with the people.
To understand the history of the Party, the important events, important meetings and important figures in the history of New China up close is not only an intuitive shock to the heart and a baptism of thought, but also to understand the connotation of the original faith from the depths of the soul and to know the weight of the mission.
For Party members and cadres, in order to continuously strengthen the mission of the original heart and maintain the advanced essence, it is necessary to find the origin and fulcrum of our first heart from the history of the Party and the history of New China, maintain a clear understanding and firm position, stir up the strength to work hard for the country and the people, and ensure that the red rivers and mountains laid down by the revolutionary forebears with blood and life are passed down from generation to generation.
It is wise to study history and pass on the noble spirit in studying the history of the Party and the history of New China.
Since the founding of the Communist Party of China, it has successively shaped a series of great spirits such as the spirit of the Red Ship, the spirit of Jinggangshan, the spirit of the Long March, the spirit of Yan 'an, the spirit of the War of Resistance, the spirit of Xibaipo, the spirit of "two bullets and one star" and the spirit of spaceflight.
The great spirit precipitated by these histories provides a strong spiritual incentive for our Party to overcome all kinds of risks and challenges on the way forward. It is a valuable spiritual asset that cannot be broken, broken up or robbed.
The process of studying the history of the Party and the history of China is a process of revisiting these spirits and shaping the self-spirit. We should consciously take the noble spirit of the revolutionary forebears as a mirror, adhere to the spiritual home of the Communists, build a solid spiritual foundation for advancing the great cause and realizing the great dream, and inherit and carry forward these spirits to radiate a new light of the times.
Read history introspectively and constantly correct and remove evil spirits in studying the history of the Party and the history of New China.
For Party members and cadres, there has never been any history that can bring more profound warnings, enlightenment and reference than the history of the Party and the history of New China.
In the history of the Party and the history of New China, we can not only see the great deeds of the old revolutionaries who aspired to devote themselves to their faith and persevere in striving to achieve their stated goals, but also see the profound lessons of some characters who have come to the opposite side of the revolution because of their ideals and beliefs. We can enlighten and warn us to never stagnate or slacken with firm determination and will, always maintain a full and tenacious spirit of struggle, constantly purify the Party spirit and cultivate ourselves.
In order to truly become a firm believer and loyal practitioner of the lofty ideals of communism, it is necessary to brush away the "dust" of thought and strictly prevent the "dirt" from being stained. The history of the Party and the history of New China should become the basis for every Party member and cadre to examine themselves and warn themselves.
To know the history is inspirational and to shoulder the heavy responsibilities of the times in studying the history of the Party and the history of New China.
General Secretary Xi Jinping once pointed out: "Studying the history of the Party and the history of the country is a compulsory course for upholding and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics and continuing to push forward various undertakings of the Party and the state."
Looking back at history and asking questions about the first heart, in order to continue the glory and move towards the future.
Every Party member and cadre should take the study of the history of the Party and the history of New China as a lifelong pursuit, constantly correct the course of life in their study, and shoulder the historical mission, dare to take responsibility and act proactively in their respective jobs.
We will continue to take the advanced deeds of the old revolutionaries as a reference and guide, constantly polish the political essence of the Communists, maintain the posture of striving for the day and striving for success and the spirit of fighting more and more difficult and moving forward, and write our own brilliant stroke in the vast journey of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
"The South of the Yangtze River" Pursues the Poetic "Dream of the Yellow River" -- ScienceDaily
(China's Poverty Alleviation Story) Pursuing the Poetic "Yellow River Dream" by "Stuffing the South of the Yangtze River"
Yinchuan, China News Agency, July 26 (Yang Di) "Jiuqu Yellow River wanli Sha, the waves from the horizon."
The Yellow River, which aroused the pride of countless literati Akako wanzhang, gave birth to the beautiful and rich Ningxia Plain. Today, Ningxia, which has the nickname "plug the south of the Yangtze River", is adhering to the concept of "ecological priority and green development" and pursuing the poetic "Yellow River Dream".
The "Bibo Dream" of River Qingshui Show
"The world Yellow River is rich in Ningxia", and the Yellow River flows 397 kilometers through Ningxia, making it a "mother river" for raising one side.
However, with the rapid progress of industrialization and urbanization, the development, utilization and management and protection of rivers and lakes are unbalanced, and chaos such as excessive sewage discharge, land construction around lakes and encroachment on waters have come to the fore, leading to black odor of water bodies, excessive water quality, messy environment and ecological degradation.
Now, Ningxia is promoting the restoration of water ecological diversity and striving to return the Yellow River to Xiuhe Qing.
Water control should be carried out from the source.
In Yinchuan, Ningxia, the local area adopted the method of "raising standards + controlling pollution + strictly controlling". All sewage in industrial parks has been centrally treated, all urban sewage treatment plants have achieved Grade I A standard discharge, and black and smelly water bodies in urban built-up areas have been basically eliminated. The third batch of Chinese black and smelly water demonstration cities have been successfully declared.
In addition, Ningxia fully implemented the river and lake long system in 2017. Today, it has achieved full coverage of the five-level river and lake long system responsibility system in districts, cities and counties, and river and lake long river cruises have become the norm.
Gu Jincheng, 64, lives in a village along the Yellow River. He has witnessed the changes of the Yellow River: "There is a stench in the water before, and the stench is gone after remediation."
Gu Jincheng said that the ecological environment is good and his life is more comfortable. Now he often goes for a walk along the Yellow River with his family to feel the blue water and blue sky.
The "Wetland Dream" of Sha Ji Xiangji
Flying birds, green trees, trestles, blue water... The beautiful scenery of Fan Zhongyan 's "sand and sand collection" has become a reality in the Yellow River Wetland Park in Yinchuan, Ningxia.
The Yellow River flows through Ningxia, and along the way, a variety of wetlands, such as river wetlands, lake wetlands and marsh wetlands, have been formed, which play an important role in promoting the rational utilization of water resources and the balance of water ecology. At the same time, it has also become an important international bird migration channel.
Since 2009, the relevant departments in Ningxia have invested a total of about 3.45 billion yuan in wetland protection projects. At present, Yinchuan wetland area is 192,000 hectares, with a wetland protection rate of 78.5%, nearly 200 natural lakes and marsh wetlands, five national wetland parks, one national urban wetland park, six autonomous region wetland parks and eight municipal parks.
Lu Jinhu, deputy director of Yinchuan Wetland Conservation Center, told reporters that wetland conservation has increased biodiversity, which is particularly evident in birds. "The remaining gull is an endangered bird, with only more than 20,000 in the world, of which Yinchuan Wetland is home to more than 2,000."
At the same time, Ningxia has demarcated a red line between 500 meters of wetland protection areas on both sides of the Yinchuan section of the Yellow River in accordance with the law, stipulating that no unit or individual may carry out development, construction and business activities within the scope of protection except for public welfare projects.
Zhao Shaoyong, deputy director of Yinchuan Water Conservancy Service Center, said that through the treatment of pollution sources, the comprehensive improvement of river and lake ecology and the construction of terminal wetlands, the water quality of the nine main yellow drains in Ningxia has now reached 100 percent of the Class IV standard. "Now the water is clear, the fish are swimming and the flowers are blooming."
The "Drinking Dream" of Pu Huimin Sheng
Yinchuan City, Ningxia, once had an "awkward" title: The only city along the Yellow River that "keeps the Yellow River short of water and drinks".
Since 2010, Yinchuan has been facing the problem of water shortage during the persistent peak summer period. The "pain of water shortage" in the past decade has become a painful summer experience for many high-floor residents. However, under the current situation that major water sources are at the limit of overexploitation and large groundwater overexploitation funnel areas have been formed underground in urban areas, water shortage has become a difficult problem for Yinchuan.
Thanks to the improvement of the water quality of the Yellow River, drinking the purified Yellow River has become a good solution to the drinking water problem of local residents.
Ding Ming, deputy director of Yinchuan Municipal Water Bureau, said that in order to improve the water demand of Yinchuan urban and rural residents for domestic production, Ningxia duly launched the water supply project on the urban and rural western route of Yinchuan metropolitan area, replacing the original underground water source with high-quality Yellow River.
"On December 29, 2019, the water supply project officially opened water to the three districts of Yinchuan City. In 2020, residents of Minning Town and Helan County also drank the Yellow River."
Ding Ming said that the Yinchuan water conservancy department will take into account the transformation of the integration of rural drinking water and urban water supply in the region in an integrated manner. "Next, we will integrate all the scattered rural water supply points into the Western Route water supply project. It is expected that by the end of this year, the integrated urban and rural water supply in Yinchuan region will be basically realized."
Compacting responsible departments to strengthen flood prevention and relief work -- ScienceDaily
Compacting the responsible departments to strengthen flood prevention and relief work
CCTV News (newscast): According to the Ministry of Water Resources, at 12: 00 today (July 25), the river below Wangjiaba, the main stream of the Huai River, exceeded the warning level by 0.64 to 3.31 meters, while the river below Sha City, the main stream in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and the two lakes exceeded the warning level by 0.05 to 2.02 meters.
Taihu Lake has lasted 28 days since it exceeded the warning level on June 28.
At 12: 00 today, the average water level of Taihu Lake was 4.67 meters, 0.02 meters above the guaranteed water level.
Today, after consultation and judgment, the State General Administration of Prevention decided to continue to maintain the flood control level II response of the Yangtze and Huai rivers, and requested all localities to compacting their responsibilities and further implement all flood control and relief work.
Today, the State Prevention Office and the Ministry of Emergency Management urgently deployed professional drainage vehicles from Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Fujian to help Jiangxi solve local urban waterlogging problems caused by heavy rainfall.
For the first time, the United States launched a countervailing investigation against China for "undervaluation of the renminbi exchange rate"
In response to the recent announcement by the US Department of Commerce, it has decided to launch an anti-dumping countervailing investigation against strap (strap) products originating in China and launch an investigation on the "undervaluation of the RMB exchange rate" project.
China's Ministry of Commerce pointed out that this is the first time that the United States has opened a case to investigate the so-called "undervaluation of the RMB exchange rate" project in a countervailing case, which China firmly opposes.
China's Ministry of Commerce issued a special press release in this regard on the evening of the 23rd, saying that China implements a managed floating exchange rate system based on market supply and demand, adjusted with reference to a basket of currencies, and that the market plays a decisive role in the formation of the exchange rate.
The press release stressed that, in general, the RMB exchange rate is at a reasonable equilibrium level and is not undervalued.
Since 2005, the RMB has appreciated cumulatively against the US dollar by more than 17%.
According to the data released by the Bank for International Settlements, from the beginning of 2005 to May 2020, the effective exchange rate of the renminbi name appreciated by 38% and the real effective exchange rate appreciated by 49%, making it the strongest currency in the G20 economy and one of the largest currencies in the world.
The Ministry of Commerce pointed out that the exchange rate issue exceeds the authority of members to conduct countervailing investigations in accordance with the rules of the World Trade Organization.
In February this year, the United States amended its regulations to conduct countervailing investigations against the exchange rates of other countries. It has been suspected of violating the WTO rules and has been opposed by many parties.
According to the press release, even in accordance with US regulations, there are a large number of errors in the content of the applicant 's complaint, which does not have the necessary countervailing elements such as financial assistance, benefit granting and exclusivity.
China urges the United States to abide by existing international rules and stop conducting countervailing investigations into the so-called "undervaluation of the RMB exchange rate".
Affected by the further rise in tensions between China and the United States, the offshore and onshore RMB exchange rates against the US dollar fell sharply during the session on the 22nd, both falling below the 7.0 yuan mark against the US dollar.
It is worth paying attention to whether the US Department of Commerce 's move is intended to force up the renminbi.
The spot exchange rate of the Chinese yuan against the US dollar rose above the 7.0 mark on the 23rd to close at 6.9961.
The midpoint of the officially regulated RMB exchange rate against the US dollar was cut by 17 basic points to 6.9938 on the 24th.

The "Best Actor and Actor" award has always been one of the focuses of outside attention. This year, the competition is also particularly fierce. The shortlisted actors and actresses are powerful and good dramatists. Chen Baoguo, Huang Lei, Lei Jiayin, Sun Honglei and Zhang Ruoxuan will compete for "Best Actor".
Chen Baoguo, Huang Lei and Sun Honglei are all highly qualified Mesozoic actors. Lei Jiayin, 37, is also a powerful actor. Zhang Ruoxuan, 32, is the youngest finalist.
In 2016, Hu Ge, 34, won the Magnolia Award for Best Actor for "Langya List", becoming the youngest TV emperor in the award. This year, if Zhang Ruoxuan can beat several other predecessors, he will set this record.
The competition for Best Actress was also finally fixed among the actresses of Haiqing, Ma Yili, Qin Hailu, Sun Li and Yan Ni, the mainstay of the film and television industry. None of the flow flowers were shortlisted.
It is worth mentioning that Sun Li was shortlisted for the role of "Make a Home". This is the sixth time that she has been nominated for the award. In 2014 and 2016, she won the "Best Actress" twice for "The True Story of the Hot Mom" and "The Biography of the Moon" respectively.

Venezuelan foreign minister accuses the United States of fabricating lies to attack China unprovoked - Xinhua
Areasa said that the US government has recently continuously pressured China in political, diplomatic, economic and public opinion, which is a baseless attack on a sovereign state.
Arreasa retweeted the tweet posted by Li Baorong, the Chinese ambassador to Venezuela, on his personal account earlier in the day and made the above comments.
Li Baorong said in his tweet that China strongly condemns the forced entry of the United States into the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, which is a serious violation of the Vienna Convention on consular Relations and the Sino-US consular Treaty, and China will make a legitimate and necessary response to this.
Venezuelan Vice President Rodriguez, Deputy Foreign Minister for North American Affairs Carlos Long and other government officials, prominent social figures and mainstream media journalists also retweeted Li Baorong 's tweets, condemning the actions of the United States as a serious violation of international law.
On the 26th, the day before Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte delivered his fifth State of the Union address (SONA) during his term of office, more than 80,000 cases of newly crowned pneumonia were confirmed in the Philippines on the same day, of which the number of confirmed cases by the staff of the Department of Public Information of the Presidential Palace (PCOO) and its directly affiliated agencies increased to 25.
To this end, PCOO has specially prepared a working group that has not contacted the diagnosed staff to cooperate with President Duterte in the press release of SONA.
In an interview with DZBB radio on the 26th, PCOO Minister Martin Andanar said that two sets of proposals have been prepared for President Duterte to issue the SONA approach.
According to Plan A, Duterte will deliver SONA at the Batasang Pambansa building of the Philippine Congress in Quezon City on the afternoon of the 27th.
Because of the epidemic, only 50 seats were arranged for some government cabinet members and legislators at the scene, and a special video conference room was set up for other cabinet members, local government officials, etc., to watch.
All participants passed rapid testing to enter the Capitol building on the same day.
Once one of the participants tests positive, Plan B is initiated, in which President Duterte delivers SONA at the Maracanang Palace of the presidential palace, and fewer seats are arranged for the hearing at the scene.
As is customary, SONA will be broadcast live to the whole of the Philippines in real time.
At the time of writing, the Philippine presidential palace has not confirmed whether Duterte's family will attend SONA.
Andanar said that President Duterte's SONA will highlight how the government will lead the Philippines in responding to the new crown pneumonia epidemic and restoring social and economic life. It will also mention his commitment to fight government corruption, combat illegal drugs and reduce poverty when he took office.
Duterte will also explain other plans of the current government, including creating more jobs, revitalizing the economy, promoting education, and helping overseas Filipino workers suffering in the epidemic.
Yinchuan: Classified policies to support the stabilization of the teaching force in kindergartens - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, July 26 (reporter Ai Fumei) Affected by the epidemic, Yinchuan Kindergartens in Ningxia have not yet resumed their gardens. In particular, the financial pressure of private kindergartens has increased, which has a certain impact on the stability of the kindergarten teaching force and the sustainable development in the future.
In response, Yinchuan has adopted a number of measures, such as pre-allocating subsidy funds for inclusive private kindergartens, providing job stabilization subsidies for non-inclusive private kindergartens, and waiving and waiving the rent of private kindergartens, to support these kindergartens in stabilizing the teaching force.
According to the relevant policies of Yinchuan City, if the organizers of inclusive private kindergartens (including those that have been transformed into inclusive kindergartens after the management of supporting kindergartens in urban areas) pay no less than 1,660 yuan per month for basic living expenses to each teaching staff with reference to the minimum wage standard of the three districts during the epidemic period, the municipal finance will pre-allocate six months of subsidy funds to solve teachers' salaries and social insurance expenses in accordance with the standard of 1,000 yuan per student per year for inclusive private kindergarten students.
For non-inclusive private kindergartens that also give teachers and staff basic living expenses of not less than 1,660 yuan per month, Yinchuan will arrange six-month subsidy funds as stable post subsidy funds for preschool teachers in accordance with the average annual subsidy standard of 500 yuan per student.
At the same time, for private kindergartens that lease state-owned assets type of operating housing, Yinchuan will reduce and waive the rent of houses for three months during the period of epidemic prevention and control, and encourage developers and other types of rental subjects to assume social responsibility, reduce and waive the rent of kindergartens, and reduce the relevant taxes and fees for more than three months in accordance with the policy provisions.
The Ministry of Water Resources refined practical response measures for the formation of flood No. 3 of the Yangtze River in 2020 -- ScienceDaily
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 (reporter Hu Lu) On July 26, the 3rd flood of the Yangtze River of 2020 formed.
When presiding over the meeting on the 26th, the Minister of Water Resources, Huo Jingping, requested that the Three Gorges Reservoir be carefully dispatched, the water coming from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and Dongting Lake be taken into account in an integrated manner, staggered peak dispatch be carried out, sufficient reservoir capacity be retained to prepare for possible major floods, and the flood control safety of the middle and lower reaches of the main stream and the important embankment of Dongting Lake be ensured.
It is forecast that heavy to heavy rain will occur in parts of the eastern southwest, southern Jianghuai, western northern Jiangnan and southern eastern Hubei and central Guangxi in the next three days, including heavy rain in northern Hunan and southwestern Jiangsu, and moderate to heavy rain in central and western North China, including heavy rain in central Hebei.
The Ministry of Water Resources expects that under its influence, the flow of the Three Gorges Reservoir in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River may reach about 60,000 cubic meters per second before and after 28 days. The water level of the Lotus Tong River section and Dongting Lake, the main stream in the middle reaches of the Huai River, will rise again and exceed the guarantee by about 0.20 meters. The water level of the main stream in the middle reaches of the Huai River will generally recede slowly and the water level of Hongze Lake will continue to rise slowly.
Huo Jingping proposed that the Huaihe River Basin should further strengthen flood discharge, reduce the water level of Hongze Lake as soon as possible, and prepare to face major floods that may still occur.
We should fully do a good job in responding to rainstorms and floods in the Yishu Surabaya system.
He said that the Taihu Lake Basin should continue to increase flood discharge efforts, reduce the water level of Taihu Lake and the surrounding river network as soon as possible, and reduce the risk of high water level and typhoons in Taihu Lake.
In addition, he stressed that floods in Inner Mongolia, Hebei and other northern regions rise and fall steeply, and the warning time is short, which can easily cause flash floods and mudslides, making it difficult to prevent them. The number of small and medium-sized reservoirs and silt dams is large, and there are safety hazards.
58 APPs that infringe on users' rights and interests have been exposed involving more than a dozen listed companies - CNN
The Ministry of Industry and Communications informed that, in accordance with the Cybersecurity Law, the Telecommunications Regulations, the Regulations on the Protection of Personal Information of Telecommunications and Internet Users and other laws and regulations, third-party testing agencies have recently been organized to inspect mobile phone application software and urge enterprises with problems to carry out rectification.

For example, "Fangduo" is a product owned by Fangduo, a US-listed company. There are five major problems: Collecting personal information privately, collecting personal information beyond the scope, sharing it privately to third parties, forcing users to use targeted push functions, and frequently applying for permissions.
According to public information, more houses landed on Nasdaq in November 2019, making them "the first real estate agency in China to industry the Internet SaaS (software service) model", providing online solutions to a large number of intermediary merchants.
In response to the difficulty of cancelling the APP account of "Where to Go" pointed out in the circular, according to Beijing News, Where to Go responded that in order to prevent black production from using frequent registration and cancellation for benefits, it has set up a one-month interval between registration and cancellation on the basis of autonomous cancellation.
Taking into account the convenience of cancellation and account security in a comprehensive manner, the cancellation has been changed to take effect immediately and is currently awaiting review.
A network security expert, who did not want to be named, told Zhongxin Jingwei clients that the Ministry of Industry and Communications has issued three APP notices for infringing on users' rights and interests like this this this year.
Among them, the private collection of personal information, excessive request for permissions and the difficulty of cancelling account numbers have been repeatedly "managed".
From the circular, it can also be found that at present, the invasion of privacy by APP has attracted more and more attention.
On July 24, on the day of the notification of 58 APPs that infringe on users' rights and interests, the Ministry of Industry and Communications said that it had recently issued a notice to deploy and carry out special remedial actions to promote the infringement of users' rights and interests by APPs in depth.
The special rectification will strengthen supervision and inspection in accordance with regulations, urge relevant enterprises to strengthen the protection of APP personal information, promptly rectify and eliminate outstanding problems such as illegal collection, use of users' personal information and harassment of users, deceiving and misleading users, and inadequate implementation of the management responsibilities of application distribution platforms, so as to purify the APP application space.
Lewis family: John Lewis was a warrior "fighting for the weakest"
John Lewis, a member of the United States Congress and a civil rights fighter, was remembered as a warrior who "fought for the weakest" at a memorial service held for him on Saturday (July 25).
Lewis' public memorial service has been held in Alabama since Saturday.
There were two memorial services on the first day.
At the public memorial service at Troy University in Alabama on Saturday, Lewis' five siblings and one grandson spoke of him as a loving, afraid man who put his family first.
"He devoted his life to helping others," Henry "Grant" Lewis, Lewis's youngest brother, said during the meeting.
Samuel Lewis said his mother had warned John "not to get into trouble, not to go and get into trouble."
He added that John did not heed his mother's warning, saying, "We all know that John will always get into trouble and always get into trouble, but that is because he insists on the right thing, which is good trouble."
Lewis' brothers and sisters reminded the people at the memorial service that John 's most famous argument is to create "good trouble", that is, as long as it is for the sake of justice, he is not shy about stirring up trouble.
John once applied to Troy University, located in Troy, Alabama, his birthplace, but Troy University, which was then an all-white school, rejected his application for admission.
The John Lewis man, who preached the gospel to chickens on his farm as a child, went on to earn a degree in religion and philosophy from Fisk University.
Many years later, the University of Troy awarded Lewis an honorary doctorate.
Doug Jones, a congressional senator from Alabama, said that the current protesters "are protesting peacefully and nonviolently," just as Lewis did in the civil rights movement.
Jones said, "Even if President Trump turned over the boat and described all the protesters as thugs, he was wrong.
The protesters are patriots who want America to move toward a more equal country, "he said.
A six-day series of events in Lewis' honor will culminate this week at a funeral in Georgia.
On Saturday, Lewis' coffin was parked at a public memorial service at the University of Troy. People came to pay their respects to the civil rights pioneer.
Later on Saturday, a private service paid tribute to him in a chapel in Selma, Alabama, followed by a public tribute.
On Sunday, Lewis's body will pass the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma.
In 1965, he and the demonstrators demanding the right of blacks to vote were beaten by the Alabama police in front of the bridge. The police also fired tear gas at the demonstrators.
Lewis was nearly killed at the time.
After that day, it was known as "Bloody Sunday".
Lewis' body will be transported to Montgomery, the capital of Alabama.
Mayor Steven Reed encouraged people to line up on the sidewalk to join Lewis for this final ride.
At the same time, officials asked the public to wear masks and maintain social distance when participating in the event.
Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey ordered flags to be flown at half-staff on Saturday and Sunday in honor of Lewis.
During the nearly week-long commemoration, Lewis' body will be placed at the Alabama State Capitol in Montgomery, the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta, and the United States Capitol in Washington for the public to pay their respects.
Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the US House of Representatives, and Mitch McConnell, the majority leader of the Senate, announced last week that people can visit the US Capitol on Monday and Tuesday this year to pay their respects to Lewis.
Public tributes to Lewis will be held outdoors due to the coronavirus outbreak.
Shenzhen for public consultation on the introduction of health regulations - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Shenzhen, July 26 (Reporters Mao Siqian and Bai Yu) encouraged residents to do medical examinations frequently and detect problems early; prohibited the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors; established an online game health examination system; employers should be equipped with full-time and part-time health managers... Recently, the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone Health Regulations (Exposure Draft) were officially released, and Shenzhen residents will have their own "health law".
In order to encourage residents to do medical examinations frequently and detect problems early, the above-mentioned consultation draft proposes that the health department should formulate a basic catalogue of health examination items according to different ages, occupations and other factors.
The cost of health examination that falls within the scope of the basic catalogue of health examination items shall be paid by the Social Medical Insurance Co-ordination Fund in accordance with the standard of once per person per year.
The consultation draft makes it clear that the employing unit shall rationally allocate human resources, arrange the bedtime of its employees, implement a rotation leave system for employees with heavy mental and manual labor loads, avoid excessive loss of human functions or physical and mental health injuries to the health of its employees, and strictly implement the paid leave system for its employees.
In addition, the employing unit shall provide full-time and part-time health managers and organize and carry out regular employee health check-ups.
In terms of the physical and mental health of minors, the consultation draft proposed that the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors should be prohibited, and that the location of the sale of alcoholic beverages should be restricted. Those who violate the regulations will be ordered by the market supervision and administration department to make corrections and fined 30,000 yuan.
In addition to "Prohibition of Alcohol", minors should also "exercise more".
According to the requirements of the consultation draft, the school should arrange more than one hour of physical activity for students every day.
For online games, the departments of public security, culture, radio, television, tourism and sports, network supervision, health and other departments should improve the health supervision system of Internet Internet service business premises, establish a health examination system for online games, and create a good communication space and communication culture for promoting the healthy growth of young people.
In addition, the consultation draft also proposed that influenza patients must wear masks when entering and leaving public places, and that medical and health institutions should be fined 20,000 yuan for divulging patients' privacy without consent.
It is worth noting that, in addition to the physical and mental health of residents, the consultation draft also requires that all departments in Shenzhen should assess the impact of the implementation of public policies on the health of the population before formulating plans and normative documents related to urban spatial planning and construction, industrial park planning and construction, resource exploitation and utilization and ecological environmental protection, the development of the biomedical industry, as well as approving major construction projects and implementing major public service projects.
If it has not been evaluated or will have a more serious adverse impact on urban public health or residents' health after evaluation, it shall not be formulated and promulgated or approved for implementation.

During his recent visit to Jilin Province, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed the need to strengthen the Party 's leadership, promote the extension of Party organizations to the most basic level, improve the work system of grass-roots Party organizations, and provide strong guarantees for the governance of urban and rural communities.
Adhering to Party building as the lead and implementing the Party 's leadership into all aspects of grass-roots governance is a fundamental requirement for doing a good job in grass-roots governance.
To raise the level of governance at the grass-roots level, we must adhere to the leadership of Party building, promote the transformation of the Party 's political advantages, organizational advantages and mass work advantages into governance advantages by strengthening political leadership, building battle forts and coalescing red forces, and pass on the Party' s strength and ideas to the "nerve endings" and the "last kilometer".
We should pay attention to calcium supplementation to cast the soul and strengthen political leadership.
To strengthen the political leadership of grass-roots governance, it is necessary to implement the project of "calcium supplementation and soul casting" well.
We should make it a top priority to deeply understand Xi Jinping's thought of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, take "never forget your first heart and remember your mission" as the eternal subject of the Party 's construction and the lifelong subject of Party members and cadres, strengthen the understanding of the principles of reading the original constitutional law, and continuously promote the Party' s innovative theoretical armed forces to become practical through special training, batch training, discussions and exchanges, and holding lecture halls, so as to push Party members and cadres to further enhance the "four consciousness", firmly achieve the "two maintenance" and better perform their duties.
Through a combination of online and offline learning methods, we will broaden the channels of learning and education, and guide grass-roots Party organizations and Party members and cadres to truly integrate learning and education into their daily lives and grasp it on a regular basis.
We should pay attention to practical exercise, and in the process of resolving key and difficult issues in the field of grass-roots governance, we should solve the worries and worries of the masses, and hammer out the Party spirit and ability.
We should strengthen the norms and build a battle fortress.
Grassroots Party organizations are not only an important part of the grass-roots governance system, but also an important carrier for the demonstration of governance ability.
To promote the standardization of grass-roots Party organizations, we should start with the regulations on the work of Party branches, focus on the weakening and falsification of the leadership of Party organizations, and strengthen the foundation, fill the shortcoming and promote development by establishing a linkage mechanism between the upper and lower levels, innovating the form of branch establishment, normalizing the rectification of weakness and laxity, establishing and improving the decision-making and deliberation mechanism and serving the masses.
In rural areas, we will strengthen the standardization of village-level Party organizations, standardize organizational forms, study activities and management mechanisms in accordance with the standardized construction standards of Party branches, and earnestly promote the detailed implementation of the "three meetings and one lesson" and thematic Party day activities.
In cities, pay attention to street communities, explore innovative forms of branch setting, focus on weak areas, "blocking points" and "pain points", actively build urban party building alliances, so that the work of the Party can achieve effective coverage.
At the same time, we will establish and improve the governance system at the grass-roots level, improve the decision-making and deliberation mechanism for discussing major issues, doing practical things together, deciding on urgent matters together, solving difficult matters together and leading grass-roots Party organizations, improve the mechanism for Party members and cadres to contact and serve the masses, gather the hearts and minds of the people in serving the people, enhance the sense of access, happiness, honor and pride of the Party members and the masses, and make grass-roots governance more temperate.
Give full play to the pioneering role and coalesce the red power.
Grassroots Party members and cadres are the cornerstone of grass-roots governance.
To enhance the governance capacity at the grass-roots level, emphasis is placed on enhancing the governance capacity of Party members and cadres at the grass-roots level, giving full play to the exemplary and leading role of "red cells" in grass-roots governance, and rallying red forces at the forefront of connecting and serving the masses.
It is necessary to make the enhancement of governance ability a compulsory course for Party members and cadres at the grass-roots level, continuously strengthen ideological hardening, professional training and practical training, carry forward the spirit of responsibility in their posts and in urgent and dangerous tasks, and strengthen the foundation and contribute to the modernization of the national governance system and governance capabilities.
It is necessary to carry out a wide range of "community whistling and Party members reporting" activities, and participate in community construction, management and services by participating in thematic Party day activities, contacting the needy, determining service projects, claiming micro-aspirations and making reasonable suggestions, so that Party members can play a role in community governance.
We should give full play to the role of unemployed Party members in rural areas, guide the vast number of grassroots Party members to actively participate in the work of fighting poverty, ecological construction, maintaining stability in complaint reporting and banning the burning of straw by setting up vanguard posts for unemployed Party members and setting up task forces for unemployed Party members, so as to better integrate the red forces and serve the people.
The foundation is solid and the building is strong.
Grassroots Party organizations are the foundation of the ruling building.
Only by insisting on strengthening the relationship between the Party and the masses and increasing the well-being of the people as the focus, and taking the leadership of Party building as the fundamental way to promote the innovative development of governance at the grass-roots level, can we build a solid foundation so that grass-roots Party organizations can pull out and stand up to it, and grass-roots Party members and cadres can catch up with and rush up, so as to promote grass-roots governance with a "soul", order, strength and effectiveness.

Kokoxiri Tibetan antelope enters relocation season - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 25 (Reporter Wang Jinjin) A reporter learned from the Wudaoliang Protection Station of the Kokoxiri Administration Office of the Yangtze River Source Park of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration that monitoring showed that the Tibetan antelope that had previously migrated to the Zhuonai Lake area of the Kokoxiri hinterland to give birth to their children was ending their birth and began to return to their original habitat with their children.
Surveillance footage near the Wudaoliang Protection Station showed that on July 25, about 40 female Tibetan antelope led three Tibetan antelope cubs through the 3002 km Qinghai-Tibet Highway and the Wudaoliangbei Bridge of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway. The Tibetan antelope had begun to move back.
Experts have analyzed that in recent years, the number of Tibetan antelope cubs in the returning sheep accounted for one-quarter to one-fifth of the total number of Tibetan antelope groups.
Lien Xinming, an associate researcher at the Northwest Plateau Institute of Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: "In the early days of the relocation, Tibetan antelope faced a high risk of predation, so the number of cubs in the sheep will be relatively small, and there may even be no cubs."
According to the statistics of the Kokoxiri Administration Office of the Yangtze River Source Park of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration, the number of Tibetan antelope relocated is generally increasing year by year. In 2019, the number of Tibetan antelope relocated was 4,860, an increase of 338 over 2018.
Lien Xinming said, "It is expected that the relocation of Tibetan antelope will end at the beginning of September this year, and the number of Tibetan antelope relocated is still expected to continue to increase."
The Tibetan antelope is a protected animal at the national level.
At the end of May each year, Tibetan antelopes from Sanjiangyuan in Qinghai, Qiangtang in Tibet and Alshan Mountain in Xinjiang go to Zhuonai Lake, located in the hinterland of Kokoxiri, to lay lambs.
Wu Xiaomin, an expert in the protection of Tibetan antelope in China and a researcher at the Shaanxi Provincial Institute of Zoology (Northwest Institute of Endangered Animals), said, "The return of Tibetan antelope is the process by which female Tibetan antelope returns to their habitat with their cubs after they have finished giving birth. At first, the return groups that leave the place where they give birth are relatively large, but then the Tibetan antelope will return to their respective habitats according to different geographical populations and along different paths."
In order to ensure the safe relocation of Tibetan antelope groups, the reporter learned that the Kokoxiri Administration Office of the Yangtze River Source Park of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration has recently arranged for staff to continuously carry out video monitoring and district patrols in the main relocation areas.
If a Tibetan antelope herd is found trying to cross the highway, the mountain rangers will carry out temporary traffic control at the first time to allow the sheep to safely pass through the wildlife passageway and ensure that they are as little disturbed by humans as possible on the way back.
So, how on earth should we relieve the heat in our daily life?
Experts suggest that when you go out in summer, you try to avoid the hot period. It is best not to walk or work in the hot sun around noon, because the sun is strongest during this period and the likelihood of heatstroke is higher.
If you must go out at this time, you must do a good job of protection, such as parasols, visors and sunglasses. If you can, it is best to apply sunscreen to protect against sunburn.
Try to choose cotton, hemp and silk textures with light colors and good breathability, and wear less chemical fiber clothing, so as not to be able to dissipate heat in time when sweating a lot, causing heatstroke.
In hot and sweltering weather, prepare adequate water to drink, drink in time, and do not wait for thirst to drink water, because once you feel thirst, the body is already short of water, drink water at a time to be limited to 150ml to 200ml, drink warm water and do not drink ice water.
According to the temperature, the average person drinks 1.5 to 2 litres of water per day, while high-temperature workers drink 3 to 5 litres of water per day.
When sweating more, some salt water can be properly replenished to make up for the salt lost by sweating in the human body.
In addition, the human body is prone to potassium deficiency in summer, which makes people feel tired and tired. Potassium tea is an excellent summer drink.
In summer, eat more fruits and vegetables with high water content, such as lettuce, cucumber and tomatoes. Fresh fruits, such as peaches, apricots, watermelon and melon, have a water content of 80 to 90, which can be used to hydrate. Dairy products can not only hydrate, but also meet the nutritional needs of the body.
In addition, people working in high temperature environments should properly supplement drinks containing potassium, magnesium and other elements.
In summer, the days and nights are short, the temperature is high, the human body has exuberant metabolism and large consumption, making it easy to feel tired.
Adequate sleep can relax all systems of the brain and body, which is conducive to work and study, as well as a measure to prevent heatstroke.
According to experts, the best bedtime is between 22: 00 and 23: 00, and the best time to get up is between 5: 30 and 6: 30.
Be careful not to lie under air conditioning vents and electric fans during sleep, so as not to suffer from air conditioning diseases and hot colds.
Experts suggest that people who carry out outdoor activities or high-temperature work can carry ten drops of water, human Dan, patchouli positive gas water or patchouli positive gas pills with them, or place them in the nearest workplace and use them at any time to prevent heatstroke.
I hope you can take some time to consider the very simple fact that so far, most of our knowledge of the universe comes from light.
We stand on the earth and look up at the night sky. We can see the stars in the sky with the naked eye.
The strong sun is so harsh,
We can see the light reflected back from the moon,
Since Galileo aimed his rudimentary astronomical telescope at celestial bodies in the universe, to this day, the universe we know is presented before our eyes through light.
With the help of modern astronomical telescopes, we have been able to collect dazzling and silent images of the universe - a series of images that can be traced back to the Big Bang.
However, the universe is not a mime, because the universe is not really silent.
I would like to tell you that the universe has its own soundtrack, and the universe itself is constantly playing. Because space can vibrate like a drum.
So when something major happens, it can make a series of sounds to the universe.
Today, we hope to be able to match this magnificent visual work about the universe with sound.
Although we have never heard a sound from outer space, we should be able to turn up the volume and listen to what is going on there in the next few years.
In response to the ambitious goal of capturing the sound of the universe, we have focused on the black hole and the prospect it presents, because the black hole is able to make a very special sound when it hits space-time like a drumstick hits the drum surface. I am also very happy to play you some of the sounds we predicted.
One day in the future, we may be able to see a shadow and a black hole can leave a shadow on a very bright background, but it has not yet been observed.
Although black holes are not visible, they are likely to be heard because they hit space-time like drums.
The idea that the universe can make a drumlike sound came from Albert Einstein. In fact, many of our ideas came from him.
Einstein realized that if the universe was empty, if the universe was empty, it would look like this photo, except for the auxiliary lines painted on it.
But if we are in free fall in the universe, even without these auxiliary lines, our trajectory will draw these lines, because we will find that we move in a straight line and pass through the universe in a straight line that does not bend.
Einstein also realized that this is really the most critical part (matter also means "matter") - if you put energy and matter in the universe, the universe will bend. Objects in free fall will be deflected and move along the curved path in space when they pass towards objects like the sun.
This is Einstein's great theory of general relativity.
Even the path of light will be bent.
When the bend is large to a certain extent, it will revolve around the orbit of the sun, just as the earth orbits the sun and the moon orbits the earth.
It's a natural curve in the universe.
However, Einstein did not realize that if you compress the sun into a ball with a diameter of 6 kilometers - that is, if you compress matter equivalent to one million times the mass of the Earth into a ball with a diameter of 6 kilometers, you will create a black hole. The density of this object is so great that if the light is too close to it, it will not be able to escape. It will leave a huge dark shadow in the universe.
However, Einstein always believed that black holes were only a mathematical singularity.
He did not believe that there was really a black hole.
He believes nature will stop black holes from forming to protect us.
It was decades before people began to use the term "black hole" and realized that black holes are real objects - in fact, they are the death state of some extremely massive stars after the catastrophic collapse at the end of their lives.
Our sun will not collapse to form a black hole.
It's not really big enough quality.
However, if we do some thought experiments - Einstein liked to do this very much - we can imagine crushing the sun and compressing it within six kilometers, and then putting a small Earth in orbit around it, for example, 30 kilometers away from the black hole sun.
The earth will shine on itself, because now that the sun is gone, we have no other light source - so our little earth will have to shine on its own.
You will find that you can even put the Earth in orbit 30 kilometers away from the black hole and let it orbit happily.
This black hole is actually only about the size of Manhattan.
It could swell into Hudson Street before it destroys the planet.
But basically that's what we're talking about.
We're talking about an object that has been compressed to the size of half Manhattan.
So we moved this Earth close to the black hole - 30 kilometers away - and we noticed that it followed a perfect orbit around the black hole.
There are some rumors that black holes will devour everything in the universe, but in fact you have to be very close before you really fall in.
But what is impressive is that from our point of view, we can always see the earth.
It can't hide behind a black hole.
Some of the light emitted from the Earth falls into the black hole, but some of it is seen by us after being bent by the black hole.
So you can't hide anything behind a black hole.
If this is the plot in Battlestar Galactica and you are fighting the Cylons, do not hide behind the black hole.
They can see you.
Our sun does not collapse into a black hole; it is not massive enough, but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our Milky Way galaxy.
If one of them is devouring the Milky Way, it will look like this.
We will see the shadow of a black hole cast on hundreds of billions of stars in the Milky Way and the dust belt illuminated by stars.
If we fall into this black hole, we will see that light is refracted around the black hole. We will not even feel that some huge changes are quietly taking place at all when we begin to enter this shadow.
If we tried to start the rocket and get out of there, it wouldn't have worked out very well because we couldn't have fled, not even light.
Although the black hole looks dark from the outside, it does not look so inside, because the light of all galaxies can fall into the black hole with us.
And even so, due to the time-expansion effect of relativity, our clocks seem to be slower than the time of the Milky Way, which looks as if the galaxy outside is changing at an accelerated pace, just before we ourselves are destroyed by the black hole.
This is like experiencing the feeling of near death. You see the light at the end of the tunnel, but this is a complete death experience.
(Laughter) There is no way you can tell anyone that you see the light at the end of the tunnel.
So far, we have never seen the shadow left by such a black hole, but black holes can be heard, even if they cannot be seen.
Imagine, in a real astronomical scene - imagine two black holes that have existed together for a long time.
Perhaps they were stars before collapsing into two black holes - each 10 times the mass of the sun.
Now we compress them to within 60 kilometers.
They can rotate hundreds of times a second.
At the end of their lives, they approach each other at the speed of light.
In a fraction of a second, they can travel thousands of kilometers. In the process, they will not only bend the space, but also cause the vibration of the space in the wake behind them, a real space-time wave.
When a black hole collides with the universe, it squeezes and stretches space.
These vibrations travel through space at the speed of light.
This computer simulation was completed by the Goddard Relativity Group of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
It took nearly 30 years before and after solving this problem.
This is one of many groups.
It shows two black holes circling each other, and these are imaginary curves.
As you can see - it may be a little vague - you can see that red waves are emitted. These are gravitational waves.
They are the sounds of the real universe, which will travel outwards from these black holes at the speed of light as they fuse with each other until the two black holes merge into a quietly rotating black hole.
If you stand close enough, your ears resonate with the squeezing and stretching of these spaces.
You can really hear these voices in person.
Of course, you will find helplessly that your head has also been squeezed and stretched, so you may not be able to understand what is going on.
But I would like to play the sound of our prediction for you.
This is the research result of my group - a relatively brief computational model.
Imagine a smaller black hole falling into a larger black hole.
The sounds you hear come from small massive black holes colliding with space as they get closer to massive black holes.
If they are very far away, the sound will be very small.
But gradually the sound becomes like a drumstick beating on the space, making the space vibrate like a drum.
We can predict what this voice will become.
We know that in the process of falling, small massive black holes will get faster and faster and make louder sounds.
In the end, we will hear that the small black hole has completely fallen into the large black hole.
I have never felt that the sound is so loud - it is actually magnified here.
When listening at home, I felt that the voice was a little weak.
It sounds like, Ding, Ding, Ding.
This is another sound simulated by our team.
I will not show you images here, because black holes will not leave any useful traces, and real space will not show you those virtual curves.
However, if you hear this sound while vacationing in the universe, I suggest that you run quickly.
(Laughs) It 's best to stay away from this sound quickly.
Both black holes are moving.
Two black holes are approaching each other.
In this case, they're all shaking violently.
Then, they will integrate.
That sharp sound is a sign of the fusion of black holes - a sharp noise will be made at the end of the fusion.
That's our prediction of what we're going to see.
Luckily we are very safe in Long Beach, California.
There is no doubt that two black holes have merged somewhere in the universe.
There is also no doubt that the space around us can also feel these vibrations that cross a million light-years, or come from a million years ago. They travel at the speed of light and eventually meet us.
But the sounds were so small that we couldn't hear them at all.
Some experiments in the world require a lot of effort to build - among them, an experiment called LIGO will be able to detect space vibrations smaller than the range of an atomic nucleus every four kilometers.
This is a very bold attempt, and its sensitivity will not be surpassed in the next few years - it will be used to detect space vibrations.
Another research project on the universe is expected to be launched within the next decade. This project is called LISA.
LisA will be able to see supermassive black holes - those with millions or even billions of times the mass of the sun.
In the images sent back from Hubble, we see these two galaxies.
It looks like they are still hugging each other.
There may be a massive superblack hole at their center.
But they're not standing still, they're actually merging.
The two black holes will collide, and their fusion will take billions of years.
Therefore, collecting the sounds they make has exceeded the limits of our human perception.
However, LISA can see the final phase of two supermassive black holes that began to merge a long time ago, that is, 15 minutes before they merged.
This detection is not limited to black holes, it can also be used to detect any major disturbances in the universe - the largest of which is the "Big Bang".
When the term was coined, some people laughed and said, "Oh, who would believe in the Big Bang?"
This animated short film, made by my friends at Proton Studios, shows watching the Big Bang from the outside.
In fact, we will never want to be like this; we want to be inside the universe, because there is no such thing as being outside the universe.
So imagine you're in the middle of a big explosion.
The universe is ubiquitous, all things in the world surround you, and space is swinging in a disorderly manner.
14 billion years have passed, and this voice still haunts us.
Galaxies gradually form, and a number of stars form in galaxies. On a certain planet, there is at least one such planet, suitable for life.
Here, we frantically build experiments, do calculations and write computer code.
Imagine, a billion years ago, two black holes collided.
This sound has always shuttled through time and air.
We weren't even here.
It's getting closer - 40,000 years ago we were still painting on the stone walls of the cave.
If the sound we are trying to obtain is made by the Big Bang, it will sound like this.
Strictly speaking, it is noise.
This is a kind of white noise, a kind of chaotic ringtone.
But it is ubiquitous around us, as long as it is not offset by certain other processes in the universe.
If we can detect these sounds, it will be like music to our ears, because this quiet echo comes from the moment we are created and from the universe we look up at from afar.
Therefore, in the coming years, we will be able to turn up the volume of these soundtracks a little bit, so that the universe can be presented to us in the form of audio.
However, if we can detect those earliest moments, it will also take us further away from understanding the Big Bang and enable us to ask some of the most difficult and ethereal questions at the same time.
If we play the course of the universe upside down, we can know that there was a Big Bang in the past. We can even hear its noisy sound. But is our Big Bang the only Big Bang in the universe?
I mean, we can 't help but wonder, has there been a similar big explosion before that?
Will it happen again in the future?
I would like to say that if the significance of this question is raised to the level advocated by TED to trigger people to rethink, at least in this last minute, we can ask some questions, those questions that we may indeed never be able to answer.
But we can 't help but wonder: Will my universe be just an episode in a grander history?
Or, will we be just a branch of the multiverse - each branch has experienced its own Big Bang - perhaps some of them have buzzing black holes, perhaps some do not - perhaps some exist conscious life, perhaps some do not exist - they do not belong to our past or exist in our future, but are connected to us in some way?
Therefore, we cannot help but speculate that if there is a multiverse, is there life in other branches of this multiverse?
This is life in our multiverse.
Is there any other life in the multiverse, and will they also be speculating about our existence and thinking about their own origin?
If so, I can imagine that they, like us, do calculations, write computer code, build experimental instruments, try to detect the faint sounds that come from their origin, and wonder who else is there.
Thank you. Thank you all.
(Applause)
Graduates' art exhibition moves into shopping malls for public welfare exhibition - Xinhua
In the "cloud graduation" season of major institutions, a rare offline graduate art exhibition opened warm last weekend.
However, it is neither in the art gallery nor on campus, but has appeared in the public space of Chaoyang Grand Hyatt City and is open to the public free of charge. It will continue until August 23.
Reporters learned that this 2020 graduate art exhibition collected 50 works / groups of 57 young artists from the Central Academy of Fine Arts, the Communication University of China and the Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts. The exhibition space extended from the second floor to the sixth floor, and made full use of the light box in the building for the display of graphic works to maximize the artistic atmosphere of the graduation season.
Under the epidemic, the significance of this exhibition is particularly special.
Ge Ping, head of Chaoyang Grand Yue Chengmei Chen, said: "We have chosen to bring the graduation exhibition, which is moving towards the 'cloud', back to the offline space. We also hope to let more people see the exploration of themselves and the understanding of the world by young people, and amplify the healing power of art for society and the mind."
She revealed that the works in this exhibition were collected from graduates of several art colleges and selected from them suitable for commercial space display. The forms of the works range from traditional easel paintings and sculptures to new media installations, interactive animation and VR panoramas. The volume and richness are the highest in the past year.
Among them, Li Yunxiao expressed his feelings in the epidemic through a mix of mechanical and manual creative language in "The First Battle of 2020". Liu Jiaying explored the themes of "cryptocurrency", "credit creation" and "transaction" through "Sound Money", a work created by Ethereum blockchain. Zhang Jiaqi 's "Cat Lin" and Qiu Daqiang' s "Bohemia" show animals that often accompany humans. From this, he can see the understanding of the relationship between people and animals when he grows up.
Among the few graduates who personally arranged the exhibition was Li Jingyin from the Department of Sculpture of Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts.
"I came to Beijing on July 7. At that time, I was actually a little worried about the epidemic. I also had a nucleic acid test three days in advance. I came to the exhibition with alcohol cotton and test report."
His work "Yesterday as a Mystery" is complex in structure and must be done by himself.
At the same time, he is also responsible for the task of helping his classmates repair broken works.
"The cloth exhibition until 4: 30 a.m. and then make repairs. Time is very tight. I forgot to take a picture with the work. It is also a bit of a pity."
He hopes that when the epidemic is more stable, he will come to Beijing with his classmates to see an exhibition of his works.

Reward 50,000 yuan Hubei Enshi praises sand dam landslide as' first person to warn '-- ScienceDaily
Hubei Daily News (reporter Lin Jing) On July 26, Enshi City announced that it praised Chen Guangming, a geological disaster point monitor who made important contributions to the early warning of landslides in sand dams, and sent him a 50,000 yuan bonus.
At the same time, Party members and cadres throughout the city are called upon to learn from his spirit of due diligence, daring to take responsibility, taking the initiative and being willing to give.
On July 21, a landslide occurred at the sand dam in Ma Shi Village, Tunpu Township, Enshi City, resulting in the formation of a quake lake in the main stream channel of the Qingjiang River. Chen Guangming, 58, was the first person to warn of the landslide.
On the afternoon of July 17, Chen Guangming learned of the cracking of the walls in the villagers' homes and immediately went to the scene to check them out.
As soon as he walked five or six hundred meters out of his home, he saw that the village group road cracked four or five centimeters and extended along the road to the cornfield, about 50 meters long.
Chen Guangdonsheng was alert and sent the photo of the cracked highway to the township "Geological Disaster Monitor Contact Group" at the first time.
After on-site inspection and judgment by the relevant person in charge of Tunpu Township Nature Planning Institute, the possibility of landslide is very high, and the decision to evacuate the masses was made immediately.
Chen Guangming 's timely warning provided 36 hours of valuable time for the safe evacuation of 315 families and 1,339 people in the affected area.
In this major geological disaster, no one was killed or injured.
Chen Guangming 's conscientious and responsible professionalism was praised by the masses.
In the face of praise, he said, "There is no one who saved. This is my responsibility."
The development of new drugs by Australian universities is expected to be used to treat blood vessel blockage caused by the new crown - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Sydney, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Researchers at Monash University in Australia are developing a new drug that can help prevent heart disease and stroke and hope that the drug can be used to treat blood vessel blockage caused by the new crown virus.
Researchers found that an enzyme in platelets accelerates the clotting of platelets before a heart attack or stroke.
From this, they developed a drug that can temporarily inhibit platelet coagulation, thus avoiding blood vessel blockage and playing a preventive role in heart disease and stroke.
According to the researchers, this drug will only inhibit the clotting effect of platelets when there are signs of heart disease or stroke.
Since studies have shown that similar blood vessel blockage is one of the main causes of death in patients with new crown severe illness, the researchers hope that this drug can be used in the treatment of such patients with severe illness in the future.
At present, the drug has achieved good results in animal model experiments, and the researchers are ready to conduct the next phase of human clinical trials.
The research results have recently been published in the American journal Science Translational Medicine.
He became the first spectator to enter the CBA League rematch after spectators were allowed to watch the game live.
On the same day, during the second phase of the 2019-2020 Chinese Men's Basketball Professional League (CBA) rematch (Laoshan Division) held in Qingdao, Shandong Province, medical staff, teachers and public security front personnel entered the field to watch the Shanghai Jiushi team take on Shandong Xiwang team after completing the relevant procedures, including nucleic acid testing, through the official ticket purchase platform.
During the viewing period, spectators are required to wear masks throughout the competition, take their seats in pairs and strictly keep their seats one meter apart.
When exiting, the audience should maintain the "one-meter line" social distance to exit in an orderly manner in the order of moving forward from the back, first on both sides and then in the middle.
Xinjiang deeply ploughs "sunflower fields" to make good use of clean energy -- ScienceDaily

China News Agency, Xinjiang Hami, July 26, by wire: Xinjiang deeply ploughs "sunflower fields" to make good use of clean energy
More than 6,000 Pentagonal sun-setting mirrors, each 48 square meters, are neatly arranged in a circle, such as a silver "sunflower field", which turns with the sun and reflects sunlight to the heat absorption tower more than 200 meters high in the center to generate electricity.
Reporters saw this scene at the Hami Melted Salt Tower photothermal power plant of the CLP Project in Mu Maohu Town, Iwu County, Hami City, Xinjiang, on the 25th.
"The so-called molten salt tower photothermal power generation means that sunlight is reflected centrally through the mirror to the heat absorption tower to form heat energy, which is then converted into electricity through traditional power generation technology."
Zhang Yong, deputy general manager of CLP Hami Solar Thermal Power Co., Ltd, said that its design principle is similar to that of solar stoves used in rural areas of northwest China, and all sunlight should be gathered together.
Construction of the power plant began in October 2017 and was connected to the grid at the end of last year. It covers an area of 6,600 mu. A total of 14,500 fixed day mirrors are planned to be installed.
"Compared with traditional solar power generation technology, its greatest advantage is that the accumulated heat energy can be stored and generated at night."
Zhang Yong said that the 13-hour heat storage system equipped with the project can enable the generating units to maintain continuous and stable operation without being affected by light changes. It can also quickly participate in the peak adjustment of the power grid according to the demand of the load peaks and valleys of the power grid.
When fully completed, the project will generate 198 million degrees of electricity per year, save more than 60,000 tons of standard coal per year, reduce emissions by more than 60 tons of sulfur dioxide, more than 60 tons of nitrogen oxides, about 20 tons of soot and more than 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide, and provide a steady stream of clean energy to the local area.
In addition, there is another silver "sunflower field" in the Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park in Hami City.
The Hamiver Optical Solar Photovoltaic Power Station covers an area of more than 2,300 mu. The 714 power generation equipment that has been built also follows the rotation of the sun, always keeping the sun's light at a 90-degree right angle to the concentrated plate surface.
"We adopt dual-axis tracking concentrated light power generation technology. Through unified integrated control, all power generation equipment will adjust its angle according to the height of the sun to maintain power generation efficiency."
Duan Mengqi, the station manager of the power station, said that under good weather conditions, the power generation technology can improve the efficiency of photovoltaic power generation by about 20% compared with traditional photovoltaic power generation.
In the first half of this year, the power station has achieved more than 7 million degrees of electricity generation, supplementing local electricity demand.
Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park is currently the largest single scale and the most comprehensive photovoltaic component type in Xinjiang. It is located in 38 photovoltaic power generation projects with a total installed capacity of 820,000 kilowatts.
In the first half of this year, more than 110 million degrees of electricity were generated, an increase of 6% over the same period in 2019.
Hami is one of the regions with the best solar energy resources in China.
The average total annual solar radiation is more than 6,200 megajoules per square meter, with about 3,200 hours of sunshine throughout the year.
In recent years, the city has vigorously developed the photovoltaic industry and planted "sunflower fields".
More than 2.5 million kilowatts of solar power have been built and installed. In the first half of this year, the photovoltaic power generation in the city exceeded 1.4 billion degrees, an increase of about 14% year-on-year.
At present, there are more than 330 grid-connected photovoltaic power stations in Xinjiang, with an installed capacity of more than 10 million kilowatts.
It is expected that the volume of photovoltaic power generation will reach 15 billion degrees for the whole of this year, which can replace more than 6 million tons of standard coal.
Police informed of the details of "female college students lost travel to Qinghai" and the search and rescue work is continuing - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 26 (reporter Wang Jinjin Zhou Zhe) Recently, the incident of "a female college student lost contact after traveling to Germu, Qinghai" aroused the concern of netizens.
The Public Security Bureau of Germu City, Haixi Mongol Tibetan Autonomous prefecture, Qinghai Province, informed on the 26th that Huang Mou, a student at a university in Nanjing, is still in a state of disconnection. Many police forces are going deep into the route of Huang Mou 's disconnection and actively carrying out the search work.
On July 10, 2020, the security detachment of the Public Security Bureau of Germu City, Hessee, received a notice from its superiors that Huang Mou, a student at a university in Nanjing, took the Z164 train from Nanjing to Germu on July 5. On July 9, he turned off his mobile phone and lost contact at the southwest area of Qingshuihe at the Sonandajie Protection Station of Qumalai County, Yushu Tibetan Autonomous prefecture, Qinghai Province, and asked for assistance in finding it.
According to the investigation of the Germu Public Security Bureau, Huang entered the territory of Qinghai Province at 19: 54 on July 6 and arrived in Germu City at 4: 00 on July 7.
At 8: 00 on the same day, Huang Mou, the lost person, set off by taxi from the Yellow River Hotel in Germu City towards State Route G109 and arrived at the Kokoxiri Sonandaj Protection Station at 12: 00. The taxi driver returned alone. Huang Mou went to the Qingshui River area near the Dasonandaj Protection Station at 15: 00 on the 7th until he shut down his plane in the area at about 18: 00 on the 9th.
In further investigation, the police found that Huang had passed the Naijigou checkpoint at 17: 07 on July 13.
The Naijigou Checkpoint is a checkpoint set up by Nachu City of the Tibet Autonomous Region at the Nanshan Pass of Germu City. As the checkpoint does not have video surveillance, it is not possible to determine the information of myself and the vehicle in which he is travelling. The police can only drive along the way to find Huang. If the checkpoints along the route in Tibet find Huang, they immediately contact the Germu Public Security Bureau.
According to the latest situation, at 1 a.m. on July 26, the Germu Public Security Bureau organized rescue forces to carry rescue equipment to the Frozen Spring Protection Station and the Sonandaj Protection Station along the Qinghai-Tibet Highway to carry out a search, and actively contacted the Sichuan police, the Tibetan police and the Nanjing police to jointly carry out the work. At present, the search and rescue work is continuing.
The local police hope that if the vast number of netizens and all sectors of society have relevant clues, they will provide them to the Germu police and the Nanjing Jiangning police in a timely manner, so as to find the lost person Huang Mou at an early date.
At the same time, relevant experts suggested that tourists should be standardized, rational and civilized in outdoor activities, keep an eye on roadside warning signs at all times, do not risk entering no man 's land, and promptly call the police in case of unexpected situations.
The US media unraveled the truth that the US side unjustifiably asked China to close the Consulate General in Houston - CNN

The US media unraveled the truth that the US side unjustifiably asked China to close the Consulate General in Houston.
On the 24th, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the US Embassy in China that China had decided to revoke the establishment and operation license of the US Consulate General in Chengdu, and made specific requirements for the Consulate General to stop all business and activities, as a countermeasure to the sudden request of the US side to close the Chinese Consulate General in Houston on the 21st.
This behavior of the US government has aroused many concerns, and its political motivation has been questioned by foreign media and scholars.
Why is China required to close the Consulate General?
According to a number of foreign media, it is not clear why the United States selected the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, but as for the purpose of this move, the foreign media said bluntly: For the general election.
CNN reported on the 23rd that the move by the United States to ask China to close the Consulate General in Houston raised questions about its political motives.
According to the article, the disastrous response of the US government to the new crown epidemic has resulted in a relatively low poll approval rating for President Donald Trump before the election.
White House officials privately said that the tough strategy adopted against China is to save Trump's approval rating, but also to deflect responsibility for the failure of the White House response to the epidemic.
According to the article, the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is a "politically driven and very cautious" target chosen by the United States, and the United States government chose it "to create a tough attitude while avoiding the risk of causing major conflicts."
The BBC also believes that at a time when the US election season is approaching and the US economy is severely hit by the epidemic, Trump believes that "playing the 'China card' has a political advantage".
The current situation is "a spiraling and tit-for-tat struggle", which is driven to a certain extent by the US government from the point of view of domestic considerations, and will only worsen the tension between China and the United States.
According to CBS News, Trump's re-election prospects have been pressured by the outbreak, and he has repeatedly blamed China for the outbreak.
Almost every day, the United States has new actions against Trump's absurd argument that "China exploits the United States".
"The Consulate General of Houston is very important in establishing ties between the two countries"
The Associated Press commented that the request of the United States for China to close its Consulate General in Houston has exacerbated tensions between the two largest economies in the world.
If the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is closed, in addition to the diplomatic impact, Chinese citizens located in the southern part of the United States face difficulties in obtaining consular services, as do American citizens seeking visas and other services.
A Houston business group expressed regret at the request of the United States that China close the Consulate General in Houston, saying that the Consulate General has played an important role in establishing trade, investment and cultural ties between the two countries.
According to the Associated Press, this reflects the importance of China's economy.
According to the website of US Foreign Policy magazine, this move by the US side "is part of a series of provocative initiatives, which will only worsen U.S.-China relations".
Reuters quoted Jonathan Pollack, an expert on East Asia at the Brookings Institution, an American think tank, as saying that since the United States and China established full diplomatic relations in 1979, he could not think of any move comparable to the United States action against the Chinese Consulate General in Houston.
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported that this move by the United States is unprecedented in more than 40 years of diplomatic relations between China and the United States.
Analysts believe that this move may cause lasting damage.
The Chinese Consulate General in Houston was built in 1979 and is the first Chinese Consulate General to open in the United States.
At present, China has an embassy and five consulates general in the United States.

In 1696, Tsar Peter the Great set out to form a maritime fleet, ushering in the history of the Russian navy.
The last Sunday of July each year is the Russian Naval Festival.
In response to the new changes in the prevention and control of the epidemic, since July 17, trade unions at all levels in Xinjiang have responded to the call of the General Trade Union of the Autonomous Region and actively participated in the prevention and control of the epidemic.
Trade union cadres, workers and model workers from the north and south of Tianshan have entered street communities and the masses of residents to carry out activities such as delivering food and medicine, disinfecting and sterilizing, and publicizing knowledge of epidemic prevention, so as to serve the working masses and demonstrate the "hard nuclear force" of trade unions with practical actions.
Recently, the comfort group of the Urumqi Tianshan District General Trade Union sent a batch of urgently needed epidemic prevention and control living materials to the staff of 12 isolation sites.
After the outbreak of the epidemic, Tianshan District invested more than 1.05 million yuan in the first place, and urgently allocated 23 directly affiliated grass-roots trade unions.
After receiving the notice of the company on the prevention and control of the epidemic, Zhao Xiangguo, deputy secretary of the Party Committee of China Construction Xinjiang Construction Industry and President of the Trade Union, volunteered and chose to stay on duty at the unit to protect the staff and workers.
He sent cooking utensils, food and household goods to the workers living in the dormitory of the unit and the new entrants, and organized personnel to send them essential materials for life every two days.
"From July 21, the cadres and staff who adhere to the front line of the war 'epidemic' will be mapped out, and the method of online orders and door-to-door delivery by merchants will be adopted to supplement the purchase of epidemic prevention supplies and living materials for 704 frontline workers and people in Urumqi area."
The head of the Xinjiang Transport Trade Union told reporters that in the face of the outbreak, they made every effort to do a good job in ensuring the prevention and control of the epidemic, steadily promoting the development of transportation, and creating a strong atmosphere of fighting the "epidemic" in unison.
At present, it is the summer heat, and trade unions at all levels are keeping a close eye on the frontline workers in key areas of epidemic prevention and control, and putting the "cool delivery" care and care into practice.
On July 19, the Urumqi County General Trade Union launched a condolence campaign to "send cool" to frontline workers in epidemic prevention and control. Police stations, card points and health systems throughout the county received drinks, fruit and other comforts.
"Trade union cadres should further improve their political position, strengthen their responsibility, warm the hearts of the people with care, and boost their fighting spirit with their actions.
We should give full play to the role of trade union organizations in rallying and uniting workers, do a good job in safeguarding epidemic prevention and control services, actively safeguard the health rights and interests of the broad masses of workers, and send care to frontline workers. "
The relevant person in charge of the Autonomous Region General Trade Union said.
The work of directly recruiting non-commissioned officers will be fully launched in 2020 - Xinhua

The expert group of the State Council and experts from the autonomous region and Urumqi are making a further assessment of the development of the epidemic based on the results of nucleic acid testing and epidemiological investigation.
The press office of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region held a press conference on the 26th to inform Xinjiang of the epidemic situation and prevention and control.
According to him, between 0: 00 and 24: 00 on July 25, there were 22 new confirmed cases of Xinguan pneumonia in Urumqi (of which 5 were transferred confirmed cases of asymptomatic infected persons) and 38 new asymptomatic infected persons.
As of 2400 hours on July 25, there were 135 confirmed cases and 147 asymptomatic infected persons in Urumqi.
On the 25th, the new asymptomatic infected persons were also basically screened through free nucleic acid testing and active screening throughout the city.
Zhang Wei, director of the Urumqi Municipal Health Committee, said on the 26th that the free nucleic acid testing work in most districts of Urumqi has been basically completed.
He also said that from the experience of other regions in the country, there are many factors affecting the nucleic acid test results, such as the sensitivity of the test reagent, the infection time and detoxification time of the tested person, the cooperation of the tested person when the specimen is taken (poor cooperation may lead to the specimen not being taken in place), as well as the testing environment and the operational proficiency of the inspectors.
For various reasons, false negative results will also appear in nucleic acid testing.
The so-called false negative means that the person tested is indeed infected, but the nucleic acid test result is negative.
In addition, for persons who have had close contact with confirmed and suspected cases, two nucleic acid tests are usually needed to rule them out.
For those who have been to high-risk areas in the epidemic, if they experience fever and respiratory symptoms, there is a false negative possibility for a negative nucleic acid test, so two nucleic acid tests are also needed to rule it out.
He said that in view of the above situation, for the health of people of all ethnic groups in the city, starting today, Urumqi will conduct secondary free nucleic acid testing in key areas such as Tianshan District and Shaybak District, while carrying out "checking and filling leaks".
It is reported that Tianshan District and Shaybak District are high-risk areas for the epidemic.

The offline streamlining of "on the cloud" is enthusiastic, and the Shanghai International Film Festival reveals unusual industrial confidence.
This newspaper (chief reporter Wang Yan) yesterday, the 2020 Shanghai International Film and Television Festival, held in the context of strict epidemic prevention measures, opened the 23rd Shanghai International Film Festival with an industrial summit forum on "striving for a well-off society in an all-round way and building a new era of dreams".
As the first international film and television festival held since the continued spread of the global epidemic and the normalization of epidemic prevention and control in China, this year's Shanghai International Film Festival is of great significance.
On the basis of doing a good job in normalizing the prevention and control of the epidemic, holding the Shanghai International Film and Television Festival is not only a sign of confidence, but also a declaration of determination - our confidence and determination to overcome the epidemic remains unchanged, our confidence and determination to run the People's Festival well remains unchanged, and our confidence and determination to build a global film and television creation center and launch the "Shanghai Culture" brand remains unchanged.
Every year, the Shanghai International Film Festival, with a constantly innovative and enterprising attitude, is a new start and a new beginning.
Therefore, it is necessary to take every step to serve the spiritual life of the people and the high-quality development of the film and television industry.
This year is even more so.
In order to cherish the hard-won situation of epidemic prevention and control, the Shanghai International Film Festival, on the one hand, strictly adheres to the requirements of epidemic prevention and control and details the implementation of epidemic prevention and control measures. On the other hand, it has launched multi-sector activities online and offline with the vision of gathering wisdom for Chinese film creation and meeting the viewing needs of fans.
On the first day of the opening, from offline viewing to industry forums, the relevant epidemic prevention policies were strictly implemented in the relevant activities of the festival.
Forum activities are limited to 50 people, and each viewing session is separated from each other and the attendance rate is strictly controlled within 30%.
As the organizing committee of the festival adheres to, in any case, "putting the safety and health of the people first" is the general premise.
Offline activities have been greatly streamlined, and "on the cloud" has become a lot of lively.
In order to implement the important concept of "People build cities for the people and people build cities for the people", and as a festival for the people, this year's Shanghai International Film Festival is trying to innovate and seek transformation, using initiatives such as online "cloud exhibition" and master class "cloud sharing" to meet the diverse needs of fans.
On the first day of the opening, the official partners of the festival, Mi Kuo Video and Oriental Pearl Blockbuster, respectively, will "put a number of" Belt and Road "films on the cloud" to give back to fans.
In the evening, the Jinjue Opening Forum and Jia Zhangke Master Class also went live on a number of platforms, including Central Video, Learning Powerhouse and Wenhui App, so that people can pay attention to the latest trends of Chinese films without leaving their homes.
At the opening forum yesterday, Yan Xiaoming, member of the Party Group and Deputy Director of the Central Radio and Television General Station, delivered a speech and opened the festival. Zhou Huilin, member of the Standing Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Committee and Minister of Propaganda, delivered a speech. Vice Mayor Zong Ming attended.
White House epidemic expert Fauci: Cautiously optimistic about the development of a vaccine in early 2021
Fauci made the remarks at an online video conference hosted by the International Leadership Foundation on the 25th.
He reminded that it is not yet clear how the new crown epidemic will develop in autumn and winter, nor what the ultimate impact of the epidemic will be. "And the only way to end all this is for each of us to choose to be part of the solution."
According to data from Johns Hopkins University in the United States, as of 2100 hours on the 25th, the number of confirmed cases and 146,000 deaths in the new crown in the United States had reached 4.176 million.
Fauci said that some parts of the United States are currently struggling to combat the rebounding epidemic.
Although the epidemic situation varies from place to place and requires response plans adapted to local conditions, diversified anti-epidemic strategies do not mean that there is no close connection between regions.
An outbreak in one region will eventually affect other regions.
"This is not a time for complacency," Fauci said. "Our work is not done, and we must step up our efforts. We must also be vigilant against the uncertainty of the future."
He Daichi, a Chinese-American medical expert and founder of "cocktail therapy" for the treatment of AIDS, pointed out at the meeting that the new crown epidemic in the United States has not yet reached its peak.
"Each of us must do our part to slow the spread of this virus."
He Daichi called on the public to use their practical actions to buy time for scientists to step up the development of new crown therapeutic drugs and vaccines.
The International Leadership Foundation is a non-profit organization with the aim of promoting international exchange activities between the United States and the Asia-Pacific region. It is committed to enhancing the status of Asia-Pacific people in the United States and cultivating international young leaders.
On the same day, US Secretary of Transportation Xiaolan Zhao, US Federal Rep. Meng Zhaowen and Dong Jiling, Founding President of the International Leadership Foundation, addressed the meeting.
In particular, they paid tribute to the medical workers and volunteers of Asia-Pacific descent who fought the epidemic on the front line, and called on the American public to continue to adhere to the epidemic prevention guidelines such as "social distance" to curb the spread of the epidemic.

Brazilian study shows that hydroxychloroquine is ineffective in the treatment of mild to moderate new crown pneumonia -- ScienceDaily
Recently, a Brazilian study showed that hydroxychloroquine is not effective in patients with mild to moderate new crown pneumonia.
The study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
Pakistani researchers divided 667 patients from 55 hospitals across the country into three groups and conducted clinical trials. They mainly compared the treatment effect of hydroxychloroquine alone or combined with other antibiotic azithromycin to analyze whether it would help improve the condition of patients with mild and moderate new crown pneumonia.
The results showed that hydroxychloroquine not only has no therapeutic effect, but may have damaging side effects on viscera.
This study was jointly completed by a number of leading Brazilian hospitals such as Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Cardiology Hospital (HB), Hospital Srio-Libanes and others, together with the Brazilian Clinical Research Institute (BCRI) and the Brazilian Intensive Care Research Network (BRICNet).
On the 25th local time, Brazilian President Bolsonaro announced through the social platform that the fourth nucleic acid test result was negative.
During the infection period, Bolsonaro has been taking hydroxychloroquine and has actively promoted it many times.

Four departments launch a new round of App governance to protect personal information security - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 25 (Reporters Yu Junjie, Chen Aiping) Reporters learned from the National Networking Office on July 25 that the management of the illegal and illegal collection and use of personal information by App in 2020 was officially launched recently, focusing on cracking down on issues such as the private uploading of personal information in the background of App and other issues strongly reflected by the masses.
It is reported that this round of App governance was carried out jointly by four departments, the State Networking Office, the Ministry of Industry and Communications, the Ministry of Public Security and the State Administration of Market Supervision.
According to the report, a special governance working group composed of four departments accepted more than 12,000 effective reports from netizens last year, carried out verification of more than 2,300 Apps, and adopted penalties such as public exposure, interviews and removal from shelves for 260 Apps with large user sizes and outstanding problems.
According to the relevant person in charge of the National Networking Office, the current number of Apps has exceeded 5 million, and the problem of illegal and illegal collection and use of personal information has not been fundamentally solved.
In 2020, the governance work will be further strengthened to further expand the scope of governance to SDK (software development kit) and small programs on the basis of App verification.
It is reported that the working group will conduct special studies and in-depth tests on issues such as irregular collection and use of personal biometric information and abuse of sensitive permissions by App, focusing on the abuse of back-office permissions such as recording and taking photos.
According to the circumstances of the problem and the severity of the consequences, the working group will impose penalties such as interviews, warnings, removal from shelves and fines in accordance with the law and regulations, so as to effectively deter illegal and illegal acts.
It is understood that the working group plans to formulate and issue guidelines for the audit and management of App stores for the collection and use of personal information by App, and guide and urge app stores to earnestly do a good job in the pre-App audit before App goes online, so as to strictly enter the customs.
In addition, the working group will also issue free technical tools to guide small and medium-sized enterprises in carrying out self-testing and evaluation, and enhance the legal compliance of the personal information collection and use activities of small and medium-sized enterprises.
Johns Hopkins University: More than 16 million new crown diagnoses have been confirmed worldwide - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, New York, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Statistics on the new crown epidemic released by Johns Hopkins University in the United States on July 26 showed that as of 2: 40 EST (14: 40 BST) on July 26, the cumulative number of confirmed cases of the new crown worldwide had reached 16,048,100 and the cumulative number of deaths had reached 644,537.
The data showed that the United States is the country with the most serious epidemic in the world, with a cumulative total of 417,8027 confirmed cases and 146,460 cumulative deaths.
Brazil has a cumulative total of 239,4513 confirmed cases and 86,449 cumulative deaths, both of which are second only to the United States.
In addition, India, Russia, South Africa, Mexico, Peru, Chile and the United Kingdom have accumulated more than 300,000 confirmed cases.
On the 25th, the 2020 Hunan Red Tourism and Culture Festival and the first Xiangtan Red Cultural Industry Expo opened in Shaoshan.
In recent years, the demand for red tourism has gradually increased.
However, the development of the red tourism industry is also faced with difficulties such as the small number of young groups, the homogenization of tour projects and the single commercialization channel.
In particular, this year's epidemic raid has seriously frustrated the national cultural and tourism industry, and red tourist attractions are also facing serious challenges.
For example, using scientific and technological means such as drone shooting and VR immersion experience can meet the tourist needs of "people have not arrived and scenery has arrived"; introducing webcasting means to promote the famous and excellent products of red scenic spots can directly enhance the economic benefits of red tourism; introducing "cloud" technology to create boutique displays with outstanding themes, distinct orientations and rich connotations to fully display and enhance the educational functions of red scenic spots; innovating the communication methods of red culture to make revolutionary cultural relics "live", make red tourism popular and enhance the attractiveness of red scenic spots.
This cultural festival uses the popular "county (district) chief + professional anchor special promotion" method to promote the special products of red cultural tourism, and uses 5G technology to provide real-time viewing and smart city demonstration services to promote red cultural tourism attractions. All are efforts to plant smart wings for red tourism. It is expected that Hunan red tourism will become more and more popular.
Representatives of the U.S.-China Trade Talks rumored to meet in August
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post quoted an anonymous person familiar with the matter as reporting on August 25 that Liu He, head of the Chinese trade negotiation team and Vice Premier of the State Council, and Lai Haizhe, co-leader of the US team and trade representative, are expected to hold formal talks in August to assess the implementation of the first phase of the China-US trade agreement between the two sides.
The report said that although China has significantly increased the amount of American agricultural products purchased in the past few months, due to factors such as the new crown virus epidemic, the amount of Chinese purchases is still some way from the amount promised in the trade agreement.
Analysts said that the recent closure of each other's consulates by the United States and China, together with other disputes, may undermine any progress on trade between the two sides.
The first phase of the trade agreement between China and the United States entered into force one month after it was signed on January 15. The agreement stipulates that the trade framework group composed of senior officials from both sides shall hold semi-annual talks.
According to people familiar with the matter, the meeting will be "an important turning point", allowing both sides to assess the progress of the agreement.
However, this person also said that if the tension between the United States and China leads to a low willingness to talk at this time, the two sides may agree that the conference call between Lai Haizhe and Liu He on May 8 has met the semi-annual terms of the trade agreement.
Since the beginning of this year, China-US relations have deteriorated rapidly. Disputes between the two sides include a series of issues such as the origin of the new crown virus, trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the South China Sea and ideology.
Although US President Donald Trump boasted about his achievements in the first phase of the agreement at the beginning of the year, his attitude has changed recently.
He said at a White House press conference on the 23rd that although China has recently purchased a record amount of American corn on a single day and has also bought a lot of soybeans, "this trade deal is not as significant to me now as it was when it was reached".
An anonymous Beijing government adviser agreed that due to the poor relations between the United States and China, a new round of trade negotiations is unlikely to take place and that "trade issues have lost weight in China-U.S. relations".
However, he revealed that Chinese economic and trade related units still met on the 23rd to discuss a series of issues, including how to increase the volume of imports from the United States. "We have tried our best to buy them, so any additional purchases will be difficult."
Peng Jining, Vice President of the U.S.-China National Committee on Trade, said that maintaining the momentum of the first phase of the agreement is "more important than ever" and pointed out that China has made progress in further opening up its financial markets to American enterprises this year.
"It is better to talk than not, although it may only be regarded as routine," said analysts at Plenum, an independent research company.
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Reporters Wei Yukun learned from the Ministry of Emergency Management on July 26 that the State Prevention Office and the Ministry of Emergency Management, together with the State Food and Material Reserve Bureau, have once again urgently transferred 1.35 million woven bags, 1.2 million square meters of woven cloth and 130,000 square meters of geotextile to Anhui to support the flood rescue and rescue work of Anhui Province.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Ministry of Emergency Management, at present, the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Huaihe River basin maintain high water level fluctuations. The "Yangtze River Flood No. 3 of 2020" formed in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River on the 26th, increasing local risks.
The meteorological department expects heavy rainfall in Chongqing, Guizhou and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in the next three days, and the flood control situation remains serious and complex.
According to the report, since the beginning of the flood, the Ministry of Emergency Management has deployed the national integrated fire and rescue team to pre-position professional rescue forces in key flood control areas. A total of 10,364 flood rescue and rescue cases of various kinds have been participated. More than 130,000 commanders, 17,778 fire engines and 11,887 boat boats have been deployed to rescue 37,777 people trapped in distress and evacuate and transfer more than 107,000 people trapped.
Hao Yusheng, Chief Representative of Nasdaq China: Now is the best time node for Chinese companies to go to the United States for IPOs - Economic Watch? Professional Financial News Website
Zhang Bin, a reporter for the Economic Watch Network, has implemented stricter supervision over Chinese shares in the US market because of the Ruixin coffee fraud incident. Combined with the long-term pressure on valuation, Chinese shares listed in the US are under pressure. Netease, Jingdong and other Chinese shares have recently begun their journey back to Hong Kong for listing.
Recently, Shell, Ideal Automobile and other companies have been enthusiastic about listing in the United States.
Under the epidemic and the Chinese stock crisis, is this the best time for Chinese companies to list in the United States?
"As far as the recent IPO cases and the situation of the companies that will list in the United States next are concerned, the IPO in the United States has not been affected in essence. On the contrary, the market is now very good. Even now this point in time is the best time node for Chinese companies to IPO in the United States in the past 10 years."
Hao Yusheng, chief representative of the Nasdaq Stock Exchange's China region, said at the "China Stock Branch of the 2020 Leaders Summit of Listed Companies" hosted by Snowball.
In April this year, the Securities and Futures Commission (SEC) and the American Public Company Accounting Regulatory Commission (PCAOB) issued the "Statement on the Important Role of Audit Quality and Regulatory Access to Audit and Other International Information - A Discussion on the Current Challenges of Information Access for American Listed Companies with Large Business in China".
The statement said that although international cooperation and coordination have increased significantly in recent years, the problems of the US regulatory authorities in obtaining information still exist, and the SEC and PCAOB still face legal and practical challenges. Corresponding to the document, the PCAOB website details the list of listed companies and their audit institutions that have encountered audit obstacles, with a large number of Chinese stock companies listed.
In addition, in May this year, the Senate of the United States Congress passed the Foreign Company Accountability Act, which imposes additional information disclosure requirements for foreign companies to list in the United States.
In Hao Yusheng 's view, the Chinese stock crisis has not affected investors' appetites.
"When this news first came out, it caused panic among everyone. Everyone was asking if they could still list in the United States in the future. However, later, we found that these questions were not a matter for investors. Investors may ask these questions during the recent roadshow of IPOs in the United States, or even become standardized questions, but this has not been regarded by investors as an important factor for investing in and not investing in a Chinese company.
It is suggested that we should try to view the current situation with a normal heart.
Of course, this may appear to be the most serious situation in the past two years, but as far as investors' appetites are concerned, they have not been affected in any way.
So between now and the end of this year or before the US election, the boom in IPOs in the US will continue. "
On May 9 this year, Jinshan Yun was officially listed on Nasdaq in the United States, becoming the first Chinese company to IPO in the United States after the outbreak.
"The listing of Jinshan Cloud gives great confidence to the Chinese companies preparing for IPOs later."
Hao Yusheng said.
The Chinese stock data report for the first half of 2020 released by Snowball showed that in the first half of this year, a total of 20 Chinese companies went to the United States for IPOs, an increase of 17.6% over the same period last year. In terms of total initial capital raising, 20 enterprises raised a total of 2.725 billion, a recovery from the same period last year, up more than 52.4%. In terms of industry distribution, the number of IPOs in the health care industry in the first half of this year was outstanding, an increase of 100% over the same period last year.
According to Hao Yusheng, the quality of Chinese companies that went to the United States for IPOs in the first half of this year is high, and high-quality companies with excellent fundamentals and growth will be more favored by investors.
In the short, medium and long term, Hao Yusheng continues to be optimistic about the IPO of Ming China Company in the United States.
"In the short term, the boom in IPOs to the United States continues. In the medium term, Chinese companies have more choices. A shares, Hong Kong stocks and US stocks. People will take the US election and China-US relations as considerations for market choice and time choice. In the long term, everything will return to normal. Market fluctuations are cycles, both political and economic cycles, and eventually will return to normal stages. The stock market has always been volatile."
At the same time, Hao Yusheng said, "There are many uncertainties this year, but for quality companies, whether the market is good or bad, as long as they are solid and have growth that investors can see, other factors are relatively secondary. Investors need to invest in excellent Chinese companies."

With his deep and condensed understanding, Zhang Haochen played the first theme of his work, which is full of sorrow and entanglements. Under the command of Yang Yang, the orchestra and the piano created continuous auditory enjoyment in the undulating competition and compromise.
After experiencing the "quiet like water" of the second movement and the "grand carnival" of the third movement, more than 100 spectators burst into warm applause when they were moved to return to the scene. The online audience also expressed their sincere admiration by playing the screen and commenting.
Then Zhang Haochen gave back to the audience with a return encore of Chopin 's legacy, "Nocturne in C Minor".
After a brief stage adjustment, Yang Yang conducted the National Theatre Orchestra to play "Symphonic Dance", the last large-scale orchestra work written by Rakhmaninov. In this work, the composer presented a more introspective emotion and incorporated his new inspiration and memory of his past creation and native land.
In Yang Yang 's calm and calm treatment, the melancholy temperament and grand atmosphere of this work are revealed, and the orchestra also performed Rakhmaninov' s "last spark" in a gorgeous and dazzling manner.
The performance forerunner of this concert once again brought unexpected surprises to the audience.
Gang Qiang, the anchor of CCTV "News Network", came to the backstage dressing-room of the National Theatre and revealed the "stronghold" of musicians such as Tejeev and Lang Lang before taking the stage. Then he went to the public space on the first floor of the National Theatre and began a dialogue with Yang Yang, Zhang Haochen and the violinist of the National Theatre in front of three nine-foot pianos with stories. Gang Qiang discussed with them the maintenance and maintenance of the piano, the music of Rakhmaninov and the audience.
That night, at the Taihu Amphitheatre of the National Theatre, the military song was loud and clear - the military choral song concert kicked off with the melodious and beautiful "Never Forget the First Heart".
This is the first performance of the "Taihu Lake Week Concert" of the National Theatre since the fight against the epidemic.
It is reported that on August 1, conductor Zheng Jian will also continue to bring "Warriors and the Motherland" - the National Theatre Choral Concert to Celebrate the August 1 Army Day with the National Theatre Choir. As a series of online performances, it will be broadcast live simultaneously through the Internet to pay tribute to the soldiers who defended the motherland in classic songs.

At present, the global epidemic and the world economic situation are still serious and complex, and the challenges facing China 's development are unprecedented.
Maintaining strategic determination, enhancing confidence in victory and concentrating on doing our own thing well are the key for us to meet various risks and challenges.
At the recent Entrepreneur Symposium, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed that in the current external environment of rising protectionism, depressed world economy and shrinking global market, we must concentrate our efforts on doing our own thing well, give full play to the advantages of the domestic mega-market, gradually form a new development pattern with the domestic and international cycles as the main body and the domestic and international double cycles promoting each other, upgrade the level of modernization of the supply chain of the industrial chain, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation, accelerate key core technologies and build new advantages for future development.
He who detects the situation is wise, and he who dominates the situation wins.
Under the external environment of the in-depth development of economic globalization, the "two ends outside" of the market and resources have played an important role in the rapid development of our country.
Now, the world under the impact of the epidemic is undergoing profound changes, facing more unstable and uncertain factors, and economic globalization is encountering headwinds and backwaves.
We will make ideological and working preparations to deal with changes in the external environment for a longer period of time, and push our economy to ride the waves and make steady progress. An extremely important aspect is to take expanding and meeting domestic demand as the strategic basis for development, give full play to our own advantages, add impetus to our economic development through flourishing the domestic economy and unblocking the domestic cycle, and drive the recovery of the world economy.
We should deeply realize that building a complete domestic demand system is related to the long-term development and long-term stability of our country.
The Central Committee of the Party reviewed the situation and clearly stated that it is necessary to firmly implement the strategy of expanding domestic demand, which is the need to deal with the impact of the epidemic, to maintain the long-term sustained and healthy development of our economy, and to meet the growing needs of the people for a better life.
The advantage of the economy of a large country is that it can be recycled internally.
China has the most complete and largest industrial system, strong production capacity and perfect supporting capabilities in the world. It has more than 100 million market players and more than 170 million highly educated or professional skills. There is also a super-large domestic demand market formed by 1.4 billion people, including more than 400 million middle-income groups. It is in the stage of rapid development of new industrialization, informatization, urbanization and agricultural modernization, with great potential for investment demand.
Public ownership is the main body and the economy of various forms of ownership develops together, distribution according to work is the main body and various distribution methods coexist. The socialist market economic system and other basic socialist economic systems can not only stimulate the vitality, liberate and develop social productive forces of all types of market subjects, but also promote the organic unity of efficiency and fairness and continuously achieve common prosperity.
We should firmly grasp the strategic basis of expanding domestic demand, make all links of production, distribution and circulation rely more on the domestic market to achieve a virtuous circle, clarify the strategic direction of supply-side structural reform, and promote the dynamic balance between aggregate supply and aggregate demand at a higher level.
It is necessary to accelerate the construction of a complete domestic demand system, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation and other innovations, accelerate the promotion of strategic emerging industries such as the digital economy, intelligent manufacturing, life health and new materials, form more new growth points and poles, and gradually form a new development pattern with the domestic and international cycles as the main body and the domestic and international double cycles promoting each other.
Opening up brings progress, and closure is bound to lag behind.
General Secretary Xi Jinping has repeatedly stressed that the door to China's opening will not be closed, but will only be opened wider and wider.
Taking the domestic cycle as the main body is not to close the operation behind closed doors, but to make the domestic and international markets better connected by giving full play to the potential of domestic demand, make better use of both international and domestic markets and resources, and achieve stronger and more sustainable development.
At the same time, there is no contradiction between expanding domestic demand and expanding opening up. The smoother the domestic cycle, the more conducive it is to building a new pattern of opening up, and the more conducive it is to forming new advantages in participating in international cooperation and competition.
Although the trend of protectionist thought is now on the rise in the world, we should stand on the correct side of history, adhere to deepening reform, expanding opening up, strengthening open cooperation in the field of science and technology, promote the building of an open world economy and promote the building of a community of a shared future for mankind.
The Chinese nation has experienced many tribulations in its history, but it has never been crushed. Instead, it has become more and more brave, constantly growing up in tribulations and rising up from them.
On the way forward, there is the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, the significant advantages of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, strong mobilization capacity and strong comprehensive strength, and the unity and struggle of the whole Party, the army and the people of all ethnic groups in the country. We will surely be able to overcome all difficulties and obstacles, maintain the momentum of sound economic and social development in our country, build a well-off society in an all-round way, and successfully start a new journey of building a socialist modern country in an all-round way!
Balance Bao income down "after 90" but "retaliatory" to save money?
With the decline of balance treasure income, "after 90" not only did not escape balance treasure, but began to "retaliate" to save money?
The "Saving Money After 90 Balance Bao" (2020 edition) recently released by the China New Economic Research Institute in conjunction with Alipay shows that in the first half of the year, the "post-90" became more fond of saving money: The amount of money saved per capita increased by nearly 40% over 2019.
Interestingly, "after 90" is more inclined to save from a "small amount of money", with 60% of the average amount of money saved is less than 20 yuan per sum...
Saving money with balance treasure has also become a saving habit in the "90s".
The data showed that of the 700 million balance treasure users, 134 million users are "after 90".
There are 174 million "after 90" in China, that is to say, about three out of every four "after 90" in the country are saving money with balance treasure.
At present, the seven-day annualized yield of money funds such as Balance Bao has slipped to about 1.5% from above 2% at the beginning of the year.
Even so, it did not affect the pace of saving money after the "90".
In the context of the improvement of the "saving effect" of balance treasure, many young people who are used to using balance treasure have also been directly transformed into "basic people".
Alipay data showed that as of July 13, the number of new "base people" on Alipay has more than doubled year-on-year in the past month, and more and more young people have achieved "advanced" financial management on Alipay.
Some analysts believe that the flow of funds from balance treasure into the stock market is also an important reason for the clear decline in the share of the IMF in June.
The report also showed that girls in the "90s" are more likely to save more money, on average 20% higher than boys. Of the users who hold funds on Alipay platform, 60% are men, and women tend to choose more robust financial management methods than men.
After saving money, what are the plans for the "90"?
Alipay data showed that "after 90" has the habit of saving money for the goal, with the largest number of users taking travel as the goal of saving money.
Affected by the epidemic, many "after 90" saved money to prepare for travel after the epidemic. The resumption of business in cinemas also provided a new way to shift from saving money to spending.

The bright party flag flies high on the flood control levee, which is the holding of the position and the trumpet of the charge.
In the face of flood disasters, Party organizations at all levels have acted quickly to blow the "stormtrooper" against floods and plant bright party flags on the levee against floods. The broad masses of Party cadres and people 's soldiers have clung to the position of fighting floods. With the will and actions of "the party flag is in the position" and "the flood will not retreat and will never accept troops", they have become the most reassuring and trustworthy barrier for the people in the disaster areas.
The bright party flag flies high on the flood fighting levee, which is selfless dedication and responsibility.
In times of crisis, the true character of Party members is demonstrated. In times of serious threat to the lives and property of the people, Party members, cadres and soldiers of the people give up their small families and take care of everyone, selfless dedication and dare to take responsibility. They take winning the hard battle of flood control, flood rescue and relief as the main battleground and parade ground for comprehensive inspection ability, style and literacy. It is this spirit of selfless dedication and responsibility that greatly inspires the confidence and determination of the people in the disaster areas to overcome the disaster situation.
"The supremacy of the people and the supremacy of life" are tested not only in peacetime, but also at critical moments.

Malaysia agreed to hold the relevant APEC meeting in the form of a video, but did not rule out the possibility of arranging the physical meeting when the APEC leaders met informally at the end of the year.
A total of 13 people tested positive in the Ministry of Public Information of the presidential palace of the Philippines -- ScienceDaily
(Fight against Xincrown Pneumonia) A total of 13 people from the Department of Public Information of the Philippine Presidential Palace tested positive
ManILA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The Department of Public Information (PCOO) of the Presidential Palace of the Philippines issued a notice on July 25 that the Minister of the Ministry, Martin Andanar, tested negative for Xincrown Pneumonia on July 24.
As of the afternoon of the same day, a total of 13 staff members of PCOO had tested positive. Previously, three positive people, one dead and two still receiving treatment.
As a result of contact with an infected staff member of PCOO, Andanar tested for new crown pneumonia with 49 PCOO staff on the 24th.
The report released on the 25th showed that 10 of the staff members tested positive.
Marvin Gatpayat, Deputy Minister of Administration and Legal Affairs of PCOO, said that the new administrative office building of the Ministry, located at the presidential palace, was scheduled to resume office on the day of President Duterte's fifth State of the Union address on the 27th.
On the same day, Martin Andanar assured the public that PCOO will continue to fulfill its duties to the Filipino people and ensure that important information is provided to the public in a timely manner, while strengthening contact tracing and testing to avoid further spread of the new crown pneumonia virus among PCOO staff. He prayed for the rapid recovery of staff who tested positive.
The Ministry of Health of the Philippines informed that 2019 new cases were confirmed in the country on the same day, with a cumulative total of 78,412 cases, of which 50,763 were still suffering from the disease, nearly 90% were mild, 9% were asymptomatic, and less than 1% were seriously ill and critical cases.
France increases military investment in space - Xinhua
French Defense Minister Florence Pali said on the 24th that France will add hundreds of millions of euros to the space defense budget and develop space military forces to guard against "unfriendly moves" that other countries may carry out in outer space.
Pali told the Provence newspaper on the same day that between 2019 and 2025, the expenditure budget for French space military projects will increase from 3.6 billion euros (about 4.2 billion U.S. dollars) previously proposed to 4.3 billion euros (5 billion U.S. dollars).
According to the French Military Planning Act 2019 to 2025 approved by the French Parliament in 2018, France is expected to update its existing observation satellites and communications satellites in the future, launch three electromagnetic listening satellites and raise the level of modernization of space surveillance radars.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced last July that a space military command and an "aviation and space force" will be established within the French Air Force.
Pali said that she will officially announce the establishment of the space force when she visits a military school in Salon, Provence region, later.
The space force, which is part of the Air Force, will have 500 personnel by 2025, Paley said.
"The idea that space used to serve the common good of science is gone. Today, space is a place for countries to compete for global hegemony," she said.
Pali reiterated Macron's previous statement, saying that France has no intention of provoking an arms race.
"We are by no means engaged in an arms race. But it is my responsibility to thoroughly recognize the threats we may face."
Pali recalled the surveillance of a military satellite shared by France and Italy in 2017.
The "sneak peek," she said, was a Russian satellite.
The Russian side denied this claim.
France will "soon" have small patrol satellites capable of detecting and locking down "the black hands behind those unfriendly moves," Paley said.
French media believe that France sought to establish a space force because US President Donald Trump asked the US Department of Defense to draft a bill to establish the Pacific Air Force last February.
Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act last December, approving the establishment of the Pacific Air Force, the sixth military type of the United States.
Some experts are concerned that these US initiatives have accelerated the pace of US space militarization and may trigger a new round of space arms race.

Report says the shared accommodation market has picked up since March - CNN
This newspaper (reporter Yang Zhaokui) The "China Shared Accommodation Development Report 2020" (hereinafter referred to as the "Report") recently released by the Sharing Economic Research Center of the State Information Center shows that the transaction value of China's shared accommodation market fell 72.1% year-on-year in the first five months of 2020 due to the impact of the epidemic.
However, the shared accommodation market has recovered since March, and the market transaction value, order volume and reception number have gradually recovered.
The Report shows that the volume of transactions in the shared accommodation market has fallen sharply. On the one hand, it is due to the sharp decline in the demand for travel accommodation under the prevention and control of the epidemic, and the sharp decrease in the volume of orders. The total number of orders in the first five months fell by 65% year-on-year and the number of receptions fell by 63% year-on-year. On the other hand, the weakness of demand has also led to a more pronounced decline in overnight prices, with the average overnight price falling by 16% year-on-year in the first five months.
However, in March, April and May, the volume of market transactions increased by 78%, 199% and 35%, respectively. The number of orders increased by 141%, 152% and 50%, respectively. The number of visitors increased by 81%, 11% and 28%, respectively.
The Report pointed out that the development of the shared accommodation industry has been positive for a long time, but there are still many uncertainties in the near future.
In response, Yu Fengxia, deputy director of the Sharing Economy Research Center of the State Information Center, told the Workers' Daily that the development of shared accommodation needs stronger policy support. On the one hand, it is necessary to do a good job in the implementation of policies already in place in the previous period, further strengthen policy advocacy and pay attention to creating a better business environment. On the other hand, it is necessary to further strengthen policy guidance and support in terms of stimulating consumer demand, enriching the supply of tourism and residential services, innovating service methods and strengthening cooperation between the government and platform enterprises.
According to Reuters, ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steel manufacturer, has experienced a new crown outbreak at a factory in Lhasa Luo Cardenas, Mexico. So far, 21 people have died.

Solorio said 21 people have died at the plant since April, nine of them union members.
Due to the strict hygiene measures adopted by the factory, it is possible that the worker contracted the virus outside the factory.
The plant employs more than 7,000 people, according to the union.
As of July 25, Mexico has a cumulative total of more than 385,000 confirmed cases and more than 40,000 deaths. Mexico is the fourth highest number of new crown deaths in the world.
Xiamen, July 26 (Yang Fushan Zhang Shushan Xu Jingyi) Vascular Surgery at Shanghai Changhai Hospital of Naval Military Medical University, the Famous Vascular Surgery Center of China, signed a contract with Zhongshan Hospital, affiliated with Xiamen University, on July 25 to jointly set up a collaborative center to promote exchanges and cooperation between the two sides in the field of vascular surgery, especially aortic acute and severe cases.
According to Zhongshan Hospital, affiliated with Xiamen University, after the vascular surgery of the two hospitals is formally formed into a collaborative unit, remote consultations will be carried out, treatment plans will be formulated for real-time online consultations with Changhai Hospital, talents will be selected for further education and training, and surgical technology exchanges, teaching and room inspections will be jointly carried out every week. For complex cases, Changhai experts can be invited to the hospital to perform surgery according to the needs of patients, thus realizing that patients in southwest Fujian can enjoy the top medical resources in the country without the province.
The two hospitals will also work together to carry out innovative scientific research on surgery, popularization of aortic diseases and early screening, among other things.
Sponsored by the Beijing Health Promotion Association and hosted by Zhongshan Hospital, affiliated with Xiamen University, a special aorta seminar was held in Xiamen on the same day.
At the same time at the meeting, the two well-known hospitals in Shanghai and Ha held the signing ceremony of the Vascular Surgery Collaborative Center and announced the formation of a collaborative unit to jointly improve the level of treatment of vascular surgery-related diseases in southwest Fujian.
Shanghai Changhai Hospital Vascular Surgery is the only Institute of Vascular Surgery in the army and the only clinical medical center for vascular system diseases in Shanghai. It is also the first national key discipline in vascular surgery. It has led the establishment of the Intracavity Vascular Science Professional Committee of the Chinese Medical Association and is a top team with deep accumulation in the industry.
Professor Huang Xiaojin, Director of Vascular Surgery, Zhongshan Hospital, affiliated with Xiamen University, gave an interview to the media.
Vascular surgery at Zhongshan Hospital, affiliated with Xiamen University, is the first independent vascular surgery in Fujian Province. It has long been committed to the diagnosis and treatment of aortic and peripheral blood tube diseases. In 2018, it was approved to build key clinical specialties at the provincial level.
In the treatment of aortic diseases, in addition to the treatment of dissection aneurysms and aortic aneurysms, he is experienced in emergency rupture of aortic aneurysms.
"Vascular surgery at Zhongshan Hospital, affiliated with Xiamen University, is outstanding in the region in terms of the history of development and the breadth, difficulty and complexity of surgery. Therefore, this time, we have set up a collaborative center. In addition to the aorta, we can also carry out all-round deep cooperation in medicine, teaching and scientific research in the diagnosis and treatment of lower limb arteries, carotid arteries and other diseases."
Professor Feng Rui, Deputy Director of Vascular Surgery at Shanghai Changhai Hospital, said.
Zhongshan Hospital, affiliated with Xiamen University, and Shanghai Changhai Hospital signed a contract in 2018 to set up the "Li Zhaoshen Famous Medical Studio" in the Department of Digestive Medicine.
Professor Huang Xiaojin, Director of Vascular Surgery at the hospital, told CNN that the hospital has also had a long history of exchanges with Changhai Hospital. This time, the two hospitals have officially formed a cooperative unit, bringing the cooperation and exchange between the two sides to a new level.
He said that the hospital will regularly invite Shanghai experts to the building to carry out surgical technology exchanges, teaching room inspections and difficult case discussions, while further carrying out remote consultations. At present, it plans to conduct remote consultations once a week. In addition, the department will select personnel for further study and exchange to strengthen the training and development of the subject talent team.
Reporters learned at the meeting that vascular disease is the number one cause of death in China, and the aorta, as the main route of all organs of the human body, flows from the heart to the whole body and plays an important role.
The occurrence of aortic diseases is often accompanied by high risk, high mortality rate and high difficulty of treatment. The thickest section of the aorta is 4cm in diameter. Once a hemangioma is formed, rupture occurs, or the endovascular rupture produces dissection, it will lead to heavy bleeding, which is very dangerous.
In recent years, with the change of people's lifestyle and the acceleration of the pace of life, China has become the largest country in the world for hypertension, and aortic diseases have also increased. Today, with the development of surgical technology and industrial materials, the treatment of aortic diseases has continued to develop in a minimally invasive, rapid and efficient direction.
Doctors can properly "change the channel" for blood flow by puncture from the thigh and placing a stent in the aorta, thus avoiding the impact on aneurysms or ruptured dissection and achieving good therapeutic results. Some operations even require only local anesthesia.
This academic seminar invited more than a dozen domestic experts to attend the meeting to discuss new advances in the treatment of aortic diseases, and to conduct cutting-edge technical training and difficult case discussions in the form of conference salons.
Reporters learned at the meeting that with the development of surgical technology and industrial materials, the current treatment of aortic diseases continues to develop in the direction of minimally invasive, rapid and efficient.

The State General Administration of Prevention continues to maintain the flood control level II response of the Yangtze and Huai rivers
Reporters learned from the Ministry of Emergency Management on the 25th that heavy rainfall is expected from the Sichuan Basin to the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River by the 27th. It is necessary to pay continuous attention to the impact on the flood situation of the Yangtze and Huaihe rivers. The embankments in some parts of the Yangtze and Huaihe river basins have been soaked at high water levels for a long time, and the risk of landslides, collapses and pipe surges is high.
After consultation and judgment, the State General Administration of Prevention decided to continue to maintain the flood control level II response of the Yangtze and Huai rivers.
At the meeting of the Ministry of Water Resources on the 25th, it was stressed that the main stream of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River maintains a high water level, and the flood peak of the main stream of the Huai River passes through the Bengbu section of Anhui Province. The water level of Taihu Lake has continued to exceed the police for 28 days and the protection for 9 days. The current flood control situation is still serious, and flood control work cannot be relaxed in the slightest. We should continue to do a solid job in all defense work.
At the same time, we will do a good job in preventing heavy rainfall in Southwest and North China.
The Ministry of Water Resources maintains the level II emergency response for flood and drought disaster prevention.
At the request of the Jiangxi Provincial Prevention Office, the State Prevention Office and the Ministry of Emergency Management urgently deployed 20 sets of high-flow professional drainage vehicles from the Shandong, Jiangsu and Zhejiang Fire and Rescue Brigade and Fujian Longyan Qiaolong Emergency Equipment Co., Ltd., to help solve the serious disasters such as urban waterlogging and farmland stains caused by heavy rainfall in Jiangxi Province.
On the 25th, all the equipment arrived at the Jiangxi flood rescue line.
In accordance with the unified dispatch of the local government, the Jiangxi Flood Rescue Forward Command of the Fire and Rescue Bureau of the Ministry of Emergency Management immediately arranged for the Jiangxi Fire and Rescue Brigade and the reinforcement forces of the surrounding provinces to set up 20 drainage professional teams to carry out drainage and rescue tasks in Nanchang, Jiujiang and Shangrao, Jiangxi Province.
At the same time, the State Prevention Office and the Ministry of Emergency Management also urgently called on 100 sets of trailer pumping stations for the central reserve of flood control materials to support the flood rescue, rescue and drainage work in Jiangxi Province.
The Anhui Flood Control and Drought Control Headquarters announced that as of 12: 00 on July 25, the relevant areas of the Yangtze, Huai and Chaohu basins in Anhui Province will enter an emergency flood control period.
The Hefei Municipal Disaster Reduction Commission decided to upgrade the Hefei disaster relief emergency response to level II at 10: 00 on July 25.
On July 25, the Sichuan Flood Control and Drought Control Headquarters issued the first yellow warning for flash floods after the flood entered this year.
The warning pointed out that between 20: 00 on July 25 and 20: 00 on July 26, flash flood disasters were more likely to occur in Dazhu County, Dazhou City, neighboring water county, Guang'an City, Meigu County, Lebo County, Mianning County, Yuexi County, Xide County, Zhaojue County and Jinyang County, Liangshan Yi Autonomous prefecture.
In addition, flash flood disasters may occur in many areas, including Kaijiang County and Dachuan District of Dazhou City.
On July 25, at 1530 hours, the Jiangsu Provincial Water Resources Department changed to issue a flood warning for the Nanjing section of the Yangtze River, which was reduced from a red warning to an orange warning. At 1030 hours, the orange flood warning for the Jiangsu section of the Huaihe River was upgraded.
At present, there are still 29 rivers (lakes) in Jiangsu, with a total of 44 stations where the water level is overprotected.
Recently, the Yangtze and Huaihe river basins in China have been hit by floods, and some of the affected people have moved to flood control and resettlement sites for temporary residence.
The personnel of the resettlement sites are concentrated, the temporary use of fire and electricity has increased, and the risk of fire has increased.
On July 25, the Fire and Rescue Bureau of the Ministry of Emergency Management issued fire safety tips for flood control and resettlement sites, calling on management units to implement the main responsibility for fire safety, strengthen safety prevention by the masses and jointly create a good fire safety environment.

On July 24, Aichi 's "Journey" also embarked on the journey of webcasting - Xinhua
Directed by Chen Dsen and supervised by Zheng Baorui, the action adventure film "Journey", starring Liu Xianhua, He Rundong, Lin Chenhan and Jiang Luxia, will go live on Aichi on July 24.
This is also the second major production film to choose to broadcast live after "Mummy".
Adapted from the online game of the same name, "Journey" tells the story of Dongyilong, a young man in Qingyuan village, and Chu Soul, a warrior of the Chu Jiajun, who embarked on the journey to participate in the selection of the Grand Marshal of the South Zhao State soldier and Horse. On the way, they met the little sister of King Kong. The three completed their mission together.
This year marks the 15th anniversary of the game's "Journey" IP15, and the launch of the eponymous film is undoubtedly also a tribute to the classic game.
At the same time as the announcement of the set, the film "Journey" released the "National War" version of the set poster as well as the "Live" pilot trailer.
The excellent picture quality presents a grand picture of the national war in the journey world, portraying the profound brotherhood of the two protagonists, Dongyilong and Chu Soul.
"Journey" chooses the overhead era to build the background of the story.
In the fictional Central Plains mainland, among the ten countries, the State of South Zhao and the State of North Yan live next to each other.
In order to defend against the increasingly powerful Beiyan, Nanzhao held a martial arts conference to select generals.
The news reached the remote Qingyuan village. Villager Dongyilong wanted to become the flag bearer of the family and represent the Qingyuan village family in the competition. However, the villagers questioned his qualifications. After some efforts, Yilong finally embarked on the journey with the warrior Chu Soul.
The total investment of the film is nearly 300 million yuan, and the proportion of special effects lenses in the film is as high as 80%.
As you can imagine, special effects have become one of the biggest points of view of Journey.
And the late special effects production team is also quite promising. MoRE VFX, the special effects team that created wandering Earth, is responsible for restoring the "journey" world with imaginative visual art as well as top technology.
Some of these classic game scenes, Phoenix, Qingyuan Village and Beast King Valley will also appear in the film. Gamers should set off a wave of nostalgia at that time.
In addition to the special effects team, behind-the-scenes production is also a group of accomplished figures in the industry.
Director Chen Dsen has directed "October Siege" and "Purple Rain Storm". Supervisor Zheng Baorui has filmed "Kill the Wolf 2" and "Three dozen White Bones of Monkey King in Journey to the West". The action scenes are the responsibility of Dong Wei, the best action director of the Golden Awards and the Golden Horse Awards. Art director Mak Guoqiang is also the winner of two Golden Awards for Best American Fingers.

Chongqing, July 26 (Xinhua) -- A reporter from Han Lu learned from China Railway Chengdu Bureau Group Co., Ltd., on July 26 that the Little Three Gorges Tunnel of the Zhengwan High Speed Rail, which is about 18.9 km long, was fully connected on the same day.
It is understood that the Little Three Gorges Tunnel is not only the longest high-speed rail tunnel within the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, but also the longest single-hole, two-lane high-speed rail tunnel designed to reach 350 km / h in projects currently under construction in China.
Located in the three provinces and cities of Henan, Hubei and Chongqing, the Zhengwan High Speed Rail connects the Beijing-Guangzhou and Xulan High Speed Rail to the north of Zhengzhou, and the Yuwan High Speed Rail to Chongqing in the south of Wanzhou. It is an important part of the riverside passageway and HuNantong Road in China's "eight vertical and eight horizontal" high-speed railway network.
The Little Three Gorges Tunnel of the Zhengwan High Speed Rail was fully connected on the 26th.
The picture shows the scene of the connection.
The Zhengwan high-speed railway starts in Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, and runs southwest through Pingdingshan City, Nanyang City, Xiangyang City, Hubei Province, to Wanzhou District, Chongqing City. The new line is about 818 km long, with a design speed of 350 km / h and about 184 km in Chongqing.
Among them, the Zhengzhou to Xiangyang section was opened for operation in advance on December 1, 2019, and the Chongqing section is stepping up its construction.
The Little Three Gorges Tunnel, which was fully connected on the 26th, is a full-line control project of the Zhengwan High Speed Rail. The project is located at the junction of Fengjie County and Wushan County in Chongqing. It is about 18.9 km long and has a maximum buried depth of 890 m.
Construction of the tunnel began in February 2017 and was fully connected on July 26, 2020.
According to Wang Jun, head of the design of the Zheng Wan High Speed Rail Tunnel of China China Railway Second Academy Engineering Group Co., Ltd., the survey and designer, the topographic and geological conditions of the location of the Little Three Gorges Tunnel are very complex and face risks such as karst, mud gushing and large deformation of soft rock. It is a Class I high-risk tunnel, which is extremely difficult to design and construct.
"During the construction of the project, we used geological survey method, geophysical exploration method and advanced drilling method to advance geological forecasting, and adopted special design schemes for more than 30 caves of various types. For example, we designed and built bridges 24 meters long, crossing large caves with a longitudinal length of more than 10 meters and a depth of more than 55 meters in the tunnel, so as to avoid tunnel settlement," the Royal Army said.
According to the China Railway Tunnel Bureau, the builder, the construction of the tunnel adopts a combination of diversion and blocking. By building horizontal hole flat guidance, grouting and water blocking, strengthening tunnel structural support and building sewage treatment stations, it not only ensures the orderly progress of the project, but also avoids the damage of construction drainage to the water body of the Little Three Gorges Scenic Area. At the same time, it successfully overcomes the construction problems such as adverse geology such as the large deformation of soft rock up to 7 kilometers long, and the maximum daily water inrush of 157,000 cubic meters.
When the entire Zhengwan high-speed railway line is completed and opened to traffic, it will become a new convenient and fast passenger main route from the Southwest region of China to the Central Plains, North China and Northeast regions. It is of great significance to improve the capacity and quality of the Northeast to railway corridor in the Southwest region, improve the layout of the regional road network, accelerate the development of tourism resources and urbanization along the route, promote the coordinated development of the region, and promote the implementation of the strategy for the development of the western region.
Experts say it is unconstitutional to collect immigration data through the United States Census for the allocation of seats in the House of Representatives.
A number of civil rights organizations and several American cities and counties have sued the US federal government, saying that the Trump presidential palace 's attempt to exclude undocumented immigrants from the US census is unworkable and unconstitutional.
The United States Census will determine the allocation of seats in the House of Representatives of the United States Congress.
Sarah Brannon, executive lawyer of the American Civil Rights and Freedom Alliance, told VOA, "This will not work."
She went on to say that Trump's request to determine the citizenship status of people receiving the census is difficult to do in the census and is "not very reliable."
Another civil liberties group, Common Cause, filed a lawsuit Thursday challenging Trump's executive order.
Some cities in New Jersey, Georgia joined the lawsuit.
Arlington County in Virginia joined the lawsuit Friday.
"The U.S. Constitution requires an accurate count of our population every 10 years," said Garvey, chairman of Arlington County's governing board. "We must accurately count everyone who lives in Arlington County and cannot allow this illegal attempt to scare people away and reduce the number of our immigrant communities to succeed."
Other organizations and individuals praised President Trump's executive order.
Alabama Attorney General Marshall called the executive order a "victory" for the state.
He said, "When allocating congressional House seats and electoral college seats in each state, it must be based on the number of residents living in each state and the number of residents who are legally resident."
The U.S. Supreme Court last year blocked the Trump administration from including the citizenship question in the 2020 Census.
President Trump signed an executive order earlier this week directing Ross, the Commerce Secretary who oversees the United States Census Bureau, to submit data on the undocumented population obtained from the census so that the administration can exclude these undocumented people from the census figures of the states and thus determine whether each state will increase or decrease or maintain the number of members of the House of Representatives.
The United States redistributes seats in the House of Representatives every 10 years according to demographic changes.
Flood control level IV emergency response activated in 33 districts and counties of Chongqing where torrential rain fell -- ScienceDaily
Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, July 26 (Reporters Ke Gaoyang and Li Song) Reporters learned from the Chongqing Flood Control and Drought Control Headquarters that Chongqing has seen a new round of heavy rainfall weather process since July 25, with heavy rain falling in 33 districts and counties and excessive warning level floods in four small and medium-sized rivers. Local flood control level IV emergency response has been activated.
According to the monitoring of Chongqing Hydrological Monitoring Terminal, between 0800 hours on the 25th and 0800 hours on the 26th, large parts of Chongqing received heavy to heavy rain, with 33 districts and counties, including Jiangjin, Qijiang and Wulong, experiencing heavy rain, including 16 districts and counties, including Wanzhou, Yunyang and Nanchuan.
The maximum daily rainfall occurred in Longshan Village, Jinshan Town, Nanchuan, at 197.5 millimeters.
Under the influence of heavy rainfall, four small and medium-sized rivers, Donkey Zi Creek in Jiangjin District, Yojiang River in Fuling District, Yingyang River in Kaizhou District and Tuantan River in Yunyang County, experienced excessive warning level floods. At present, the water level is still rising.
Heavy rainfall has also led to landslides in Liujing Village, Land Township, Wulong District, causing the disruption of village road traffic. The slippery slope slips into the tributaries of the Wujiang River along the Canghe River, blocking the river channel to form a quake lake. The local area has urgently organized the transfer of people downstream.
In response to the rainstorm, the Chongqing Flood Control and Drought Control Headquarters issued the Class III warning information for river floods at 1300 hours on the 26th, and activated the Class IV emergency response for flood control. It requested the relevant districts, counties and units to strengthen inspection and duty, mobilize emergency rescue teams and materials in a timely manner, and evacuate and transfer the people in threatened areas.
In response to the situation, promote the construction of industrial projects - Viewpoint headlines - Hunan Daily Network - Hua Sheng Online
In Hunan in the height of summer, the heatwave hit the face.
And the enthusiasm released by the on-site observation meeting to promote the construction of industrial projects throughout the province overshadowed the heat of the three-volt day, and the clear orientation of "comparing industry to strength and talking about heroes with projects" encouraged the three Xiang and four waters.
The development of Hunan always depends on the construction of projects and the cultivation of industries.
In the face of a very unusual first half of the year, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, the whole province has adhered to a game of chess, made every effort to fight the two hard battles of epidemic prevention and flood control, and took industrial projects as the "forerunner" for the implementation of the "six stable" and "six guarantees".
From a 1.9% year-on-year decline in GDP in the first quarter to a 1.3% year-on-year growth in the first half of the year, the difficulties and great efforts during the period are self-evident.
On this valuable report card, the construction of industrial projects is the key support for Hunan to accelerate its economic recovery and develop steadily for the better.
The potential is smooth and irreversible.
The construction of industrial projects should be put into the overall situation. They should not only be good at building up momentum, building momentum and planning momentum, but also be good at understanding change, seeking change and adapting.
In the context of the complex and severe current international situation, in addition to painstakingly attracting investment, it is necessary to sit back and study the new characteristics of the current new situation, grasp the laws more, be more scientific and precise, and better integrate into the new development pattern with the domestic and international cycles as the main body and the domestic and international double cycles promoting each other.
More attention should be paid to enhancing the basic capacity of the industry.
In the first half of the year, a large number of heavyweight investment projects in emerging industries in our province not only broke ground and started and sowed hope, but also enterprises in traditional superior industries accelerated their distribution and fall like a fly in the digital, intelligent and green industrial transformation.
The Yiyang Oxconn Third Science Park project has transformed the existing production line, with the intelligent production line of high-end printed circuit boards taking the lead. The new factory area of Hunan Zhongyan Changde Cigarette Factory is committed to the process of intelligent transformation and building a modern factory. It is also a vivid portrayal of the "old trees and new buds"... Only by focusing on consolidating and upgrading superior industries, actively cultivating and developing new industries, and comprehensively increasing scientific and technological innovation and domestication substitution can we continuously strengthen the basic conditions and accumulate the momentum of transformation.
More attention should be paid to cultivating and developing new economic and new business models.
The sudden new crown epidemic has brought about the popularity of the "cloud economy", stimulated the potential of the digital economy and provided new opportunities for industrial transformation. In the first half of the year, the computer and office equipment manufacturing industry, electronics and communication equipment manufacturing industry in our province grew by 12.6%, the online retail sales of wholesale and retail enterprises above the limit increased by 32.2% year-on-year, and the online meal income of catering enterprises increased by 35.6% year-on-year.
It is the general trend to cultivate new machines in the crisis and open up new situations in the changing situation, actively promote digital industrialization and industrial digitization, and guide the integration and development of the digital economy and the real economy.
More attention is paid to optimizing and stabilizing the supply chain of the industrial chain.
Construction machinery is the main force of Hunan industry, but two-thirds of the supporting enterprises are outside the province, and there is still space and potential in the supporting chain.
To strengthen the thinking of the industrial chain and grasp projects, it is necessary not only to have the continuous accumulation of leading enterprises and achieve technological breakthroughs in the key links of the industrial chain. It is also necessary for all localities to devote themselves to cultivating, stimulating the "chain" lock response with strong chain replenishment and chain extension, promoting the coordinated layout of relevant supporting industries, and accelerating the construction of an independent, controllable, safe and reliable industrial chain supply chain.
To overcome difficulties and support enterprises, Hunan is still a hot and promised land with a good business environment and emerging market business opportunities.
In the process of recovering the losses caused by the epidemic, all parts of the province have made frequent moves, made new moves and made practical moves to promote the "acceleration" of high-quality development in the hope that the "reduction of the burden" of enterprise relief will lead to the "acceleration" of high-quality development. Shaoyang has implemented "shareholder style" services to do things for enterprises without prevarication, policy implementation without discount and problem resolution overnight.. In the process of recovering the losses caused by the epidemic, various "every effort" has been made to find the right pain points and achieve a vivid story of turning the crisis into an opportunity.
Focusing on studying industries, cultivating industries and developing industries, and firmly optimizing the business environment, will surely win the favor of more investors.
The wind and waves ahead are still there, but the state of riding the waves has become the norm for the whole province to focus on the construction of industrial projects and promote high-quality development.
In this critical period, it is necessary to study and implement the spirit of the series of important instructions and instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping, effectively promote the construction of industrial projects with the certainty of his own work, and persevere in promoting the construction of industrial projects with enthusiasm and sweat to ensure the successful conclusion of the 13th Five-Year Plan and building a well-off society in an all-round way.

Cultivating new forms of industry to open up new space for employment -- ScienceDaily
New employment methods have been emerging, opening up new employment space, and a number of innovative service policies have been launched in succession, helping new employment patterns to thrive.
The latest data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed that the unemployment rate in the national urban survey was 5.7% in June, down 0.2 percentage points from May.
This is also the second consecutive decline in the unemployment rate in the national urban survey since April. Behind the month-to-month decline in the unemployment rate data is the emergence of new employment opportunities in new industries.
Now the monthly salary of more than 5,000, coupled with the freshness of embracing information technology, has made Guo Mei more and more driven.
At the Innovation Incubation Base of Shanxi Transformation and Comprehensive Reform demonstration Area, there are more than 2,300 data taggers.
It is not only data taggers. Since the beginning of this year, the state has also defined 25 occupations, including nucleic acid testers and online learning service providers, as new occupations, developed vocational skills standards and launched skills training programs to help the development of practitioners.
In response to new employment methods and new entrepreneurial paths, the state is also innovating employment services.
Recently, 13 departments, including the National Development and Reform Commission, jointly issued the Opinions on Supporting the Healthy Development of New Business Models and Activating the Consumer Market to Drive the Expansion of Employment, providing workers with a variety of employment opportunities.
Many sectors will jointly cultivate new individuals in the market and further reduce the cost of online entrepreneurship and employment for self-employed persons. New business workers will be more secure, and policies such as protection of the rights and interests of flexible employment and social security will be introduced in succession.

The overall stability of employment and prices highlights the "temperature" of the economy -- ScienceDaily

The overall stability of employment and prices highlights the "temperature" of the economy.
Economic Daily China Economic Network reporter Lin Huocan
In the first half of this year, in the face of the impact of the Xincrown Pneumonia epidemic, China has promoted the prevention and control of the epidemic and economic and social development in an integrated manner. The situation of epidemic prevention and control has continued to improve, the steady recovery of the economy has been obvious, and the performance of employment and prices, which are closely related to the people 's livelihood, has been generally stable. The Chinese economy has handed over a report card on the operation of the economy with temperature.
The survey unemployment rate has risen in the first two months of the year.
In particular, in February, the production and operation activities of many enterprises were basically in a state of shutdown, the employment demand of enterprises decreased, recruitment was delayed or cancelled, and the unemployment rate in urban surveys rose.
With the gradual improvement of the situation of epidemic prevention and control, the production and living order of the whole society has been continuously restored.
The Central Committee of the Party adheres to the general tone of the work of steady progress, further strengthens the hedging of macro-policies, comprehensively strengthens the employment priority policy, and actively promotes the work of helping to stabilize and expand employment.
China has increased its policies to hedge and stabilize jobs, played a combination of "relief and slow return compensation" policies, reduced and exempted the contributions of three social insurance units in a phased manner, allowed for the postponement of the payment of social insurance premiums, expanded the benefits of the stable return of unemployment insurance for small and medium-sized enterprises and the work-substitute training policy, and given absorption subsidies and trainee subsidies to enterprises to absorb the employment of key groups.
With the implementation of various employment stabilization policies, the employment demand of enterprises has steadily picked up, the employment situation has gradually improved, and the urban survey unemployment rate has gradually declined. In June, the survey unemployment rate was 5.7%.
Zhang Yi, Director of the Population and Employment Statistics Department of the National Bureau of Statistics, said that in the second quarter, various employment policies continued to bear fruit, and the labor force that withdrew due to the impact of the epidemic in the early period returned in succession. The urban labor force participation rate rose by about 10 percentage points in June compared with February, close to the level of the same period last year.
The data showed that the total amount of urban employment increased by more than 19% in June compared with February, with most industries reaching pre-epidemic levels. The average weekly working time of employees in enterprises reached 46.8 hours, 6.6 hours higher than in February and slightly 0.1 hours higher than in January.
Prices are also related to thousands of households.
In January this year, the CPI rose 5.4% year-on-year, a multi-year high.
Entering February, the year-on-year increase in CPI fell slightly, but it was still in the "5 range".
The year-on-year increase in CPI is at a high level, driven by both consumer demand before the Spring Festival, as well as the wrong month of the Spring Festival and the low year-on-year base.
However, the impact of the new crown pneumonia epidemic on prices is particularly obvious.
Affected by the prevention and control of the epidemic, all parts of the country experienced logistics delays, untimely supply of materials and increased transportation costs of materials in January and February. Together with the hoarding and rush of some citizens, the prices of some basic necessities of life rose significantly.
In order to deal with the disturbance caused by the prevention and control of the epidemic to the price situation, the relevant departments have included important living materials in the scope of emergency transportation security to ensure the smooth transportation of materials.
Under the role of a series of policy measures, the supply of vegetable, melon and fruit market has been strongly guaranteed.
In response to the rapid rise in pork prices at the beginning of this year, after the central government issued the policy of ensuring supply and stabilizing prices, all regions and departments quickly implemented it. The supply of pork reserves has improved markedly, hog production capacity has been restored in an orderly manner, and the order of production and marketing has gradually become normal.
Since March, pork prices have fallen continuously, driving the year-on-year increase in food prices back to 10.6% in May. In June, pork prices rose slightly year-on-year due to factors such as the slowdown in hog production, the decrease in imports and the recovery of group consumer demand.
The seasonal changes in the price of fresh vegetables are characterized by obvious characteristics, with an average increase of 3.4% in the first half of the year.
Influenced by the high comparative base in the same period last year, the price of fresh fruit continued to decline year-on-year, falling by an average of 13.3% in the first half of the year.
The basic livelihood of the masses has been effectively guaranteed, and the overall economic and social situation has remained stable and orderly.
With the gradual recovery of transportation logistics, various localities have increased their efforts to guarantee supply, and the supply and demand situation in the market has improved.
Since March, the CPI has fallen year-on-year for four consecutive months, and the year-on-year increase has also fallen from 4.3% in March to 2.5% in June. The overall price level has returned to stability.
In the second half of the year, China's prices will continue to remain moderate, and the overall inflationary pressure is small, but it is still necessary to promote the restoration of production and living order on the premise of doing a good job in normalizing epidemic prevention and control.
We will effectively deal with natural disasters such as floods and droughts in major agricultural producing areas such as grain, fruits and vegetables, strengthen market supervision, and resolutely crack down on hoarding and price gouging, which disrupt market order.

New book blasts: Prince Harry felt his brother was' snobbish and arrogant'
The British Times and the Sunday Times serialized a new book called Finding Freedom, which depicts the journey of royal life between Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan Markle.
However, Reuters reported that Harry and Meghan have dissociated themselves from the book, saying that they have not accepted the author 's interview and have not provided any content.

Today, the opening ceremony of the 2020 Hunan Red Tourism and Culture Festival and the first Red Cultural Industry Expo in Xiangtan was held in Shaoshan.
Zhang Hongsen, member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Committee and head of the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Committee, announced the opening of the Red Tourism and Culture Festival, and Wu Guiying, Vice Governor, delivered a speech.
Hunan Red Tourism and Culture Festival has successfully held 16 sessions and is a well-known brand of red tourism throughout the country.
The festival is jointly sponsored by the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Committee, the Provincial Department of Culture and Tourism and the Xiangtan Municipal Committee and Municipal Government.
Wu Guiying said that the holding of this festival is of great significance for implementing the important instruction of General Secretary Xi Jinping that "we should make good use of red resources, carry forward the red tradition and pass on the red gene", further improve the development of red tourism in our province, promote the recovery of the cultural and tourism market, and coalesce the "red power" into a broad joint effort to build a rich, beautiful and happy new Hunan.
It will certainly play a more active role in promoting the red culture, inheriting the red spirit, stimulating the consumption of cultural tourism and promoting the high-quality development of Hunan cultural tourism.

As an artist, connection is very important to me.
Through my works of art, I try to make it clear that human beings are not separated from nature but that everything is connected with each other.
I went to Antarctica for the first time about 10 years ago, and I also saw icebergs for the first time.
I was in awe.
My heart banged quickly and my head was dizzy, trying to understand what this was in front of me.
The iceberg beside me surfaced almost 200 feet to the surface. I can only feel very strange that this is the formation of one snowflake covering another snowflake year after year.
Icebergs are formed when they break away from glaciers or break away from ice shelves.
Each iceberg has its own unique personality.
They interact with their surrounding environment and their situation in a distinct way.
Some icebergs refuse to compromise and stay the course, while others cannot bear to collapse under a moment of violent passion.
When you see icebergs, it is easy to think that they are all isolated. They are independent and integrated, more like the way we human beings sometimes see ourselves.
But the reality is much more than that.
As the iceberg melted, I breathed its ancient smell.
As the iceberg melts, it releases fresh water rich in minerals and nourishes everything.
I set out to photograph these icebergs as if I were taking portraits of my ancestors. I learned that icebergs existed in that way in these individual moments but will never exist like that again.
When they melt, this is by no means death; nor is it an end, but a continuation of the road to life and survival.
Some of the icebergs I have photographed are very young - thousands of years old.
Some ice is more than 100,000 years old.
The last image I would like to show you is an iceberg I took on Kekertsuatsiak in Greenland.
This is a very rare opportunity for you to actually be able to witness an iceberg tumble.
So this is as shown in the picture.
On the left, you can see a small boat.
It's a boat that's about 15 feet.
I would like to draw your attention to the shape of the iceberg. It is deformed on the surface of the water.
Here you see it start to tumble and the boat moves to the other side and a man is standing there.
This is an average size Greenland iceberg.
It surfaced about 120 feet high or 40 meters high.
The video was filmed in real time.
(Music) is like this iceberg. They show you different aspects of their personality.
Thank you.
(Applause)

Qinghai Hainan, CNN, July 26 (UPI) -- "Flower Sea Direct" on the banks of Qinghai Lake: "Sweet" brings goods to help farmers increase their income
Author Hu Guilong Pan Yujie
"On the banks of Qinghai Lake in the height of summer, the eyes are full of golden flowers and thousands of bees flying. Here, the altitude is high, the temperature difference between day and night is large, and there is little air pollution. The strong light has given birth to the most tenacious and generous bee colony, creating the characteristics of Qinghai royal jelly with high activity, high protein, rich nutritional value, low sugar and low fat."
On the 26th, Zhang Jianxun, deputy director of the Industry and Information Administration of Hainan Tibetan Autonomous prefecture in Qinghai Province, said.
On the same day, the live delivery of "concentric war epidemic spring pulp to help farmers" bee products was held on the banks of Qinghai Lake. The China Bee Products Association, representatives of entrepreneurs, bee farmers and other parties gathered to jointly promote Qinghai specialty bee products. A total of nearly 10,000 bottles of Qinghai Plateau royal jelly were sold online and offline, with a total delivery value of nearly 3.8 million yuan.
The picture shows bee farmers displaying bee products on site.
It is reported that the live delivery event promotes the exchange and cooperation of "enterprises + bee farmers + growers" with the help of the Beijing Houde gift bee industry chain network, fast hands, Taobao and other well-known domestic bee product retail enterprises, live streaming and e-commerce platforms, and continuously issues "Qinghai Plateau Spring Pulp Consumer Vouchers" to consumers through online and offline channels. The total annual profit of enterprises is expected to be nearly 5.28 million yuan.
In response, Wuna, President of Beijing Houde Li Bee Co., Ltd. thought it was "well worth it": "This move can expand the visibility of Qinghai bee products, attract more consumers to understand and like bee products without the addition of pure nature, and drive bee farmers to increase their income."
At present, the company has signed a production cooperation strategic agreement with Qinghai Cloud Bee Industry Co., Ltd. and Qinghai Huabao Bee Co., Ltd., with the aim of jointly promoting the rapid development of the local bee industry in Qinghai.
The picture shows the sea of rapeseed on the banks of Qinghai Lake.
This spring, road traffic checkpoints were set up in various places due to the need for epidemic prevention and control. The road of bee farmers to "pursue flowers and honey" was blocked. Many bees died because they missed their flowering period and lacked food. The income of bee farmers was seriously affected.
"Throughout the year, bee farmers follow the flowering period and move all the way north from Yunnan and Sichuan to the northwest region. They sleep rough and have no fixed abode, which is very hard.
As a business, we have a responsibility to help them, "he said.
Wuna said.
"Small bees are 'environmental scouts', and bees cannot survive in heavily polluted areas," said Zhao Xiaochuan, Executive Vice President of the China Bee Products Association. Bee Pollination is an important link in the ecological chain and plays an irreplaceable role in protecting plant diversity and improving the ecological environment.
At the same time, bee Pollination can increase crop production and improve quality, especially in areas with wide planting and poor management conditions, Pollination is of greater significance.
Research data show that Pollination can increase the production of canola by about 15% to 30%.

"The economic, ecological and social benefits created by bee Pollination far outweigh the value of bee products themselves. The bee industry has great potential in human health, crop production, vegetation reproduction and ecological protection, which people have always known little about."
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
Today, the number of beekeepers is decreasing. In addition to the bee farmers who have been away all year round, there are still many poor households with mobility problems who choose to take a stake in the cooperative with beehives.
"The state has financial support. We contact technical personnel to help guide it. Bee farmers lack understanding and judgment on the market environment. To open up sales, they also need the help and coordination of the government, enterprises and industry associations."
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
"We hope that you will pay more attention to and help beekeeping groups in the future," Wuna said. "Our bee products are also screened and controlled strictly in accordance with national standards to ensure quality and protect the rights and interests of consumers while helping bee farmers."

In his speech, Zheng Shixin, Minister Counsellor, said that this is an opportunity for the old Vietnamese and the Lao people to jointly remember the heroic revolutionary heroes of the two countries and jointly express their gratitude to the heroic men who died for the independence and freedom of the two countries. It is also a good opportunity for the two peoples to recall that the two countries work side by side to combat the common enemy, strive for national independence, national reunification, jointly build national development and consolidate bilateral relations.
Seventy-four years ago, on January 23, 1946, 28 soldiers of the Old Vietnam Combat Alliance died heroically during the attack on the Phonehe stronghold.

Liu Yunlong, an old face of espionage drama, plays a stuttering actor - Xinhua
Produced by Liu Yunlong and directed by Yin Fei, and starring Liu Yunlong, Su Qing, Liang Guanhua and Li Liqun, the large-scale espionage drama "The Wins" landed on Guangdong Television 's "Vitality Theater" at 7: 30 p.m. on July 16.
The play tells the story of Tang Fei (Liu Yunlong), an underground member of the Communist Party of China (CPC) lurking in the Japanese pseudo-police station, who joined forces with Soviet agents to assassinate the leader of the Japanese agent and crush the startling plot of the Japanese army.
"The Wins" is based on historical facts and the material is taken from the dusty Soviet military archives for many years.
During the defense of Moscow, the elite of the Soviet Red Army in the Far East advanced westward to help. At this time, the "northward advance faction" of the Japanese Guandong Army believed that it could take advantage of the opportunity and intended to send troops.
In order to solve the danger of suffering from the enemy, the Communist Party of China and the intelligence personnel of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union jointly implemented the "Mudanullah" plan.
According to this historical background, Deng Yuan, a well-known screenwriter, has been polished several times, making the plot twists and turns burn his brain.
Liu Yunlong served as both producer and leading actor in "The Wins" this time.
In the play, he plays Tang Fei, who is the Chief of the Criminal Section of the Linhe Police Department. He is a stuttering policeman with a sense of joy and even a bit of riffraff. His real identity is an underground member of the Communist Party of China.
Cai Meng, the heroine who staged the opposite play, is the head of the Linhe Security Bureau. He is deeply appreciated by his Japanese boss, Fukuhara. There is a delicate relationship between friends and foes and ambiguous with Tang Fei.
Su Qing has tried many different types of characters in recent years, from Lu Ruowen in "We Were Young in Those Years" to Erqing in "Yanxi Tackle", all of which impressed the audience and were recognized for their acting skills.
This time, Su Qing and Liu Yunlong are the first partners. The stuttering sheriff is quite interesting and innovative with the charming policewoman setting.
In addition to the two protagonists, "The Wins" is joined by a large number of powerful actors, including Liang Guanhua, Li Liqun, Qian Bo, Lei Han and Shin Junyi. The old drama is also one of the points of view of the play.
It is understood that "The Wins" is also very well produced, with the cast filming nearly 2,000 kilometers across Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Liaoning provinces.

Xinhua News Agency, Kuwait City, July 26 (reporter Nie Yunpeng Wang Wei) Sana'a: According to local Yemeni media on July 26, the western Yemeni provinces of Hodeida and Hajj were hit by heavy rainfall. Floods have killed at least 16 people in the past 48 hours.
The report said that 13 people were killed in the floods caused by rainfall in Hodeida province, while three people were killed in the floods in the neighboring Hajj province.
In addition, dozens of houses in the northern part of Hodeida Province and the southern part of Haje Province were destroyed by the flood, and some roads and farmland were also damaged to varying degrees.
The military conflict, which lasted for several years, caused the health system in Yemen to nearly collapse.
According to the statistics of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, since 2017, the number of people infected with cholera in Yemen has exceeded 1 million, and the death toll has exceeded 2,000.
Yemeni medical institutions are concerned that the continuing floods will lead to the re-spread of the cholera epidemic.
"Jedi Strike" Releases Fight for a Dream Life in the Boxing Stage - Xinhua
Directed by young director Gao Zhuangzhuang and starring William Liao, Dongyu, Yang Xinran and Wang Yibo, the online film "Jedi Strike" was officially released at Aichi.
The film tells the story of fallen fighter Venus returning to the ring and fighting for dignity, showing a warm-blooded and presumptuous dream-by-dream journey.
Driven by Thailand as the main plot, the film "Jedi Strike" takes "Muay Thai" as the starting point for Venus, the fallen boxing champion, to pursue her dreams. The whole story is based on the adaptation of traditional Chinese cultural values. Whether Venus made up her determination to play fake boxing for her master in the early period or rejuvenated her efforts to fight for dignity in the later period with the support of her friends and lovers, it shows the pursuit and great love of family and dreams by men in traditional Chinese culture.
Combining with the classic Hollywood sports film story model and the strong joint efforts of the professional teams of China and Thailand, "Jedi Strike" will not only present an international effect, but will also impress different types of audiences.
At the same time, "Jedi Strike" shows a large number of Muay Thai combat and training plot, the intensity and blood of the scene.
In the film, Zhang Xiaoliang, a game designer played by Dongyu, helps Venus, played by William Liao, return to the ring and take the crown through fighting games. It combines novel and interesting high technology with warm-blooded and high-burning competitive competition. It also shows the brotherhood of Zhang Xiaoliang and Venus, which seem to be "different" and actually have the same goal.
In addition, the long flow of love between Venus and Jingjing is also very moving. Jingjing 's silent support for Venus and Venus' firm commitment to Jingjing have made the audience see Venus' "Tiehan tenderness" and added a lot of human flavor to the fallen boxing champion.

Greenfield Opens a New Round of Mixed Reform of Shanghai State Capital to Transfer 17.5% Shares - Economic Watch Network Famous Professional Financial News Website
On July 26, Rao Xianjun, a reporter for the Economic Watch Network, Greenfield Holdings (600606.SH) issued the "Indicative Notice on the Proposed Agreement of State-owned Shareholders to Transfer Some Shares of the Company and Resumption of Trading through Public Solicitation of transferees".
The contents of the announcement show that in order to further deepen the reform of state-owned enterprises, optimize the restructuring of the layout of state-owned capital and improve the ownership structure of green space, Shanghai Real Estate (Group) Co., Ltd. (Hereinafter referred to as "Shanghai Real Estate") and Shanghai CityInvestment (Group) Co., Ltd. (Hereinafter referred to as "Shanghai CityInvestment") intend to transfer some of the shares of the company by agreement through a public solicitation of transferees. The total proportion of shares to be transferred shall not exceed 17.5% of the total share capital of green space.
The price of the shares to be transferred shall not be lower than the higher of the following two: The arithmetic average of the daily weighted average price for the first 30 trading days of the indicative announcement date (July 27, 2020); and the audited net asset value per share of the Company in the most recent fiscal year.
At present, the jury is still out on the new strategic investors in Greenfield. According to the public announcement information, it is estimated that the new strategic investors will need to pay about 14 billion yuan to take down the 17.5% equity transferred in Greenfield in this mixed reform.
It is worth noting that after the completion of this share transfer, it is expected that Greenfield will still have no controlling shareholder and actual controller, but the control structure may change considerably.
Since its inception, Greenfield Holdings has carried out a number of institutional and institutional reforms: From 1992 to 1997, it operated in accordance with market-oriented rules under the purely state-owned system; from 1997 to 2013, it established and continuously improved the joint-stock system of state-owned holding and employee ownership; from 2013 to 2015, it introduced strategic investors to form a mixed ownership system of cross-shareholding and integration of state-owned and non-public capital; and from 2015 to the present, it has become a public company as a whole.
The current mixed reform plan of Greenfield is similar to that of Geli. In December 2019, high-level capital led Zhuhai Mingjun to take over 15% of Geli Electric (000651.SZ) for 41.662 billion yuan. Geli Group took a back seat to minority shareholders. After completing the mixed reform, Geli Electric implemented modern enterprise management methods such as executive incentive plan and unreal control structure.
Shanghai Real Estate and Shanghai City Investment are all state-owned enterprise groups wholly owned by the Shanghai SASAC. Zhang Yuliang, Chairman and President of Greenfield Holdings, said that Greenfield 's move is an important measure for Shanghai to promote the comprehensive reform of state-owned enterprises and accelerate the reform of state-owned enterprises in the new phase in accordance with the requirements of the Party Central Committee. It fully demonstrates the new reform ideas adapted to local conditions and tailored to them. By introducing new excellent strategic shareholders to listed companies, it supports enterprises to further improve the degree of marketization, enhance the freedom of management and accelerate the all-round release of reform.
Cross-provincial travel resumes the opening of the country's first special train for cross-provincial train tourism - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, July 25 (Reporter Li Ping) At 12: 20 on July 25, more than 200 Shanghai tourists who took the D771 train successfully arrived in Lanxi City, Zhejiang Province. This is also the first special train for cross-provincial train tourism in the country since the Ministry of Culture and Tourism resumed cross-provincial (district, city) group tours on July 14.
Lanxi City, located in central and western Zhejiang Province, has beautiful scenery. It is home to many scenic spots such as Zhuge Gossip Village, Underground Changhe and Zhiyan Ancient Village. During the two-day and overnight trip, more than 200 Shanghai tourists will experience each of these attractions.
Li Li, deputy general manager of Shanghai Railway International Tourism (Group) Co., Ltd, said that in accordance with the latest policies, the company kept a close eye on the demand for cross-provincial travel, communicated with Lanxi City at the first time, and carefully launched the "Shanghai to Lanxi" and "Summer Enjoy Second Day Tour" products, which sold out less than a week after their launch.
Aunt Sun, from Shanghai, said that because of the epidemic, she has not gone out this year.
"I have been at home for a long time. As soon as I saw that there was a group tour, I immediately shared the news with my friends to sign up together. I have never been to Lanxi before. I am very much looking forward to this trip," said Aunt Sun.
It is understood that in September last year, Lanxi City signed a strategic cooperation agreement with Shanghai Railway International Tourism (Group) Co., Ltd., for the "High Speed Rail Tour Lanxi" project, with plans to run 12 special high-speed rail tourism trains from Zhejiang, Shanghai and Anhui to Lanxi within one year.

Us White House adviser 'bites back' states to resume work too early - CNN
Us White House adviser 'bites back' states to resume work too early
On July 23, local time, the number of confirmed cases of New Crown Pneumonia in the United States exceeded 4 million, accounting for 30% of global cases.
Over the past few months, US President Donald Trump has repeatedly asked states across the country to resume work and school. Only recently did he change his attitude and take the initiative to wear masks in public. His advisers have "bitten back" that some state governments have resumed work too early.
On the 22nd, White House presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway said at a press conference that some state governments did not abide by the standards for the resumption of work and restarted bars and other places prematurely.
Conway also mentioned that the previous claim that the president has the "absolute power" to decide on the resumption of work in the states is a misinformed rumor.
"The president is a federalist. He believes that all states have autonomy."
She defended Trump.
However, the "rumor" in Conway 's mouth was personally uttered by Trump at the White House outbreak briefing on April 13.
This self-punching operation has been ridiculed by netizens as "rewriting history".
Kellyanne Conway wants to rewrite history, she's a liar.
Trump called Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer a dictator for following medical guidelines and insisting on a work stoppage.
Trump wants to push for a return to work so he can hold rallies.
This isn't the first time Kellyanne Conway has courted controversy.
In an interview with Fox News on April 15, Conway blurted out, "This is COVID-19 and not COVID-1, friends!"
She seemed to understand "19" as a version number, which was wildly teased by netizens: Read the newspaper without common sense!
Recently, we have seen the impact of cyber attacks on the business world.
The data breaches of companies such as JPMorgan Chase, Yahoo, Home Depot and Target Department Stores have led to hundreds of millions of dollars, or even billions of dollars, in losses.
A few more such attacks, and the entire world economy will collapse.
The public sphere is not immune.
From 2012 to 2014, there were very serious data breaches at the US Office of Personnel Management.
Security clearance and fingerprint information stolen, affecting 22 million employees
You may also have heard that some government-funded hackers are trying to influence the election results of some countries with stolen data.
The last two, one was the large-scale data theft of the German Bundestag and the other was the email theft of the Democratic National Committee of the United States.
Cyber threats have already affected our democratic process.
And there is a growing trend.
The more advanced computer technology is, the more fragile the means we use to protect data will be.
In particular, a new computer technology called quantum computers uses the microparticles of nature to greatly increase the computing power of computers.
Its computing power is powerful enough to crack many of the encryption systems we use today.
So are we hopeless?
Should we start packing up our electronic survival gear to meet the upcoming data apocalypse?
In my opinion, it has not yet reached that point.
Quantum computers still only exist in labs, and it will take years for them to be used in practice.
More importantly, there have been many major breakthroughs in the field of encryption.
For me, this is a very exciting time in the history of secure communications.
About 15 years ago, I learned that we had unlocked new skills to create quantum effects that do not exist in nature. I was very excited.
I am thrilled by the idea of using the basic laws of physics to advance the development of encryption technology.
Today, a number of selected companies and labs, including mine, have advanced this technology to the stage of practical application.
That's right.
We intend to fight quantum with quantum.
How can it be achieved?
First of all, let 's quickly understand the world of encryption.
You need a briefcase. You have some important documents to give to your good friend, James Bond. Lock them up and keep them safe.
Because these materials are top secret, we want to use a super advanced briefcase.
It is equipped with a special password lock, which, once locked, converts the contents of the file to random numbers.
So you just have to put the file in and lock it. By this time, the file has been converted to random numbers. You give James this briefcase.
When the briefcase has not been delivered, you call him to tell him the password.
Once he got the briefcase, entered the password and the file deciphering was complete, it was simply perfect. You successfully passed an encrypted message to James Bond.
(Laughter) A playful example, but it illustrates the three key points of encryption.
Passwords - we call them encryption keys.
You can think of it as a password.
The phone call that gave James the password.
We call it secret key delivery.
This ensures that we can safely deliver the secret key to the designated place.
And the locks used to encrypt and decrypt files.
We call it an encryption algorithm.
Through the secret key, it converts the contents of the file into random numbers.
A good algorithm can do this, and it is difficult to crack passwords without a secret key.
The importance of the algorithm is that if someone gets the briefcase and opens it, they cannot read the contents of the document without a secret key and without knowing the encryption algorithm.
All you get is some random numbers.
Most security systems rely on the secure secret key delivery method to pass the secret key to the right place.
However, the rapidly growing computing power endangers many of the secret key delivery methods we currently use.
To take an example, we now have a very widely used system, RSA.
When it was invented in 1977, it took about 40 billion years to crack a 426-bit RSA secret key.
And by 1994, just 17 years later, the code had been cracked.
As computers become more and more powerful, the passwords we need are getting longer and longer.
Now we often use passwords with 2048 or 4096 bits.
As you can see, the battle between the encryptor and the decryptor is going on, and both want to overcome each other.
In the next 10 to 15 years, the arrival of quantum computers will crack complex mathematical algorithms more quickly, which are the foundation of the encryption system we use today.
In fact, quantum computers will turn our safe castle into a house of cards that falls at the touch.
We want to try to protect our castle.
In recent years, many research institutions have emerged to study how to enhance encryption with quantum effects.
People have already made some exciting breakthroughs.
Remember the three key points of encryption? High-quality secret key, secure secret key delivery and strong algorithm.
However, advances in science and engineering have endangered two of these priorities.
The first is the secret key.
Random numbers are the basis for forming the secret key.
But today, they're not really random anymore.
At present, we generate secret keys based on random digital frequencies and generated by software, which we call pseudo-random numbers.
There will always be some, perhaps less obvious, laws in the numbers generated by programs or mathematical methods.
The lower the randomness of these figures, or, in terms of terminology, the lower the number included, the easier it will be to predict them.
Recently, some casinos have been attacked, and the way of the attack is very creative.
They shoot at the slot machine for a period of time and then analyze it.
Cyber criminals use reverse engineering to create pseudo-random digital generators behind the turntable.
In this way, they have a good chance of predicting the turn of the turntable and thus making a lot of money.
The secret key is equally insecure.
Having a truly random digital generator is important for generating secure passwords.
For several years, researchers have been trying to create a true random digital generator.
However, most of the designs are either not random enough, not fast enough, or difficult to reuse.
But the world of quantum is truly random.
It's important to take advantage of that real randomness.
Devices that can measure quantum effects can generate continuous random digital flows very quickly.
The casino crime just said can no longer be staged.
Several universities and companies from around the world are concentrating on making truly random digital generators.
In my company, our quantum random digital generator was born out of an optical table 2 meters long and 1 meter wide.
After that we narrowed it down to the size of a box.
Today, it can be installed on a PCI card and plugged into an ordinary computer.
This is the fastest, truly random digital generator in the world.
It can generate a billion random numbers per second by measuring quantum effects.
Today, it has been widely used around the world to enhance the security of cloud service providers, banks and government agencies.
(Applause) However, even with a real random digital generator, we still face the second major cyber security threat: That is, the secure transmission of secret keys.
The current secret key transmission technology cannot counter quantum computers.
The quantum solution to this problem is called quantum secret key distribution, or QKD for short, which takes advantage of the counterintuitive characteristics of a foundation of quantum mechanics.
To observe the behavior of microparticles will change the particle.
Let me give you an example to illustrate it.
Let 's think back to handing over the password to James Bond.
This time, however, we do not call him. We use the quantum effect to carry this code with a beam of laser and pass it to James through ordinary fiber optics.
Let's assume Dr. No wants to get his hands on the password.
Luckily, Dr. No will leave an electronic fingerprint in the process of trying to intercept this quantum secret key, which James and you can detect.
In this way, the intercepted secret key will be invalidated.
And the secret key left behind can provide strong protection for the data.
Because this security mechanism is based on the basic principles of physics, it is impossible for a quantum computer, or any future supercomputer, to crack it.
My team and I are working with many top universities as well as the defense sector to improve this exciting technology and develop the next generation of security products.
The Internet of Things heralds the advent of an era of high interconnection, with 25-30 billion devices expected to be connected to the Internet by 2020.
If our society is to function properly in the Internet of Things world, then trust in these interconnected device systems is essential.
We believe that quantum technology will be very important in building this trust. It will ensure that we fully enjoy these magical innovations and enjoy these innovations that can make our lives rich and colorful.
Thank you all.

Is it reasonable for a 3-year-old child to sue the university authorities after he was smashed playing in the college playground and received compensation?
2020-07-26 05: 01: 11 Source: Legal Daily Author: Wang Sisuo Responsible Editor: Wang Sisuo
The playground was smashed, and the child sued the school authorities after receiving compensation.
Zhao Yifan, Correspondent of this newspaper
Xiaowen, 3, was playing in the playground of a university when he was accidentally hit in the head by Chen Mou of the softball team while pitching.
After Chen made compensation, Xiaowen 's father, Mr. Wen, sued the school to the court as Xiaowen' s legal representative, demanding that the school where the playground was located apologize and pay a total of 20,000 yuan for medical expenses and compensation for moral damage.
Recently, after hearing the case, the Haidian District People 's Court of Beijing held that the school had set up a protective net in the playground at the time of the incident, and had fulfilled its appropriate safety and security obligations, and Chen had made compensation. According to the judgment, the plaintiff' s claim was rejected.
Mr. Wen claimed that during the summer vacation of 2019, he took Xiaowen to play in the school playground, when the softball team was training in the playground.
In order to avoid the risks caused by this, Xiaowen, Mr. Wen and many other children and parents are active in the safe area designated by the softball team.
However, after that, Chen Mou, a member of the softball team, got rid of the ball while pitching, causing the softball to fly over the net to the above-mentioned safe area and hit Xiaowen in the back of the head.
Mr. Wen immediately took Xiaowen to the hospital for treatment and was diagnosed with head trauma.
Mr. Wen believed that the facilities of the school stadium did not comply with the relevant safety regulations and did not effectively manage the team and related facilities.
The fault of the school led to the occurrence of the above incident, which led to great physical and mental suffering for Xiaowen, as well as great suffering for his family, for which the school should bear legal responsibility.
In this regard, the school argued that the school had set up a protective net in the playground and posted management regulations and training notices, informing it that it was necessary to maintain a safe distance from the training ground and remind it of its own safety when entering the playground. The plaintiff could not prove that the school had "failed to fulfill its safety and security obligations", so he did not agree to compensation.
After hearing the case, the court held that the venue of the incident was a venue open to the public free of charge by the university involved. Although the school has a safety and security obligation for the management of the playground, this safety and security obligation only needs to meet the general duty of care.
At the time of the incident, the school set up a protective net in the playground and has fulfilled its appropriate safety and security obligations. Chen also compensated Xiaowen for medical expenses, transportation expenses and other losses of more than 2,000 yuan in accordance with the compensation agreement reached before. The two parties agreed to resolve the dispute in one go.
Afterwards, Xiaowen 's parents once again claimed compensation from the school, which was unfounded in the law, and the court ruled against all the plaintiffs' claims.
After the judgment was handed down, neither party appealed, and the judgment has now entered into force.
According to Article 37 of China's Tort Liability Law, schools, as managers of public places, have the obligation of safety and security. In the case of damage caused by the actions of a third party, the third party shall bear the tort liability, while the manager of a public place who fails to fulfill the obligation of safety and security shall bear the corresponding supplementary liability.
According to the judge, because as the manager of a public place, he is most likely to understand the actual situation of the whole place and foresee the dangers and damage that may occur, so he is most likely to take necessary measures to prevent the occurrence of losses or mitigate the degree of damage, and the cost of avoiding and mitigating the occurrence of damage is the lowest, so the law stipulates that he shall assume the corresponding safeguard obligations for engaging in social activities.
In this case, for unspecified entrants in playgrounds open to the public free of charge, the safety and security obligations of schools should be appropriate to the social activities they engage in. In particular, they should mainly take basic safety measures and have the obligation to inform them of hidden dangers.
In judicial practice, it is not appropriate to impose excessive safety and security obligations on the managers of public places.
If the school has adopted the establishment of a protective net and has fulfilled its obligation to inform, it may be concluded that the school is not at fault and should not bear legal responsibility.
In addition, for the infringement of third parties, even if the administrators of public places such as schools fail to fulfill their safety and security obligations, their liability is used as a supplement to damages. According to the newly promulgated Civil Code, the administrators may also recover compensation from third parties after assuming supplementary liability.
Therefore, in such accidents, the victim should not expand the scope of the claim after he has received compensation from the direct infringer.
Today I want to show you the way we make things in the future.
I believe that soon our buildings and machines will be able to assemble themselves, replicate themselves and repair themselves.
Therefore, I would like to show you what I think is the current situation of the manufacturing industry, and then compare it with some natural systems.
Then in the current manufacturing industry, we have skyscrapers - two and a half years, 500,000 to millions of parts, very complex, using new technologies in steel, concrete and glass.
We have exciting machines that can take us into space - five years, two and a half million parts.
But on the other hand, if you look at natural systems, we have two million types of proteins that can fold in 10,000 nanoseconds, and we can replicate DNA with three billion base pairs in about an hour.
That's the complexity of our natural systems, but they're very efficient, more efficient than anything we build, more complex than anything we can build.
They are more efficient in terms of energy.
They rarely make mistakes.
They can repair themselves and maintain a long life.
There is a super interesting thing about natural systems.
If we can convert that into our built environment, there's a lot of potential in the way we construct things.
I think the key is self-assembly.
If we want to use self-assembly in our own physical environment, I think there are four key factors.
The first is that we need to decode all the complexity of what we are trying to build - that is, our buildings and machines.
We need to decode them into simple sequences - basically the DNA of how our buildings work.
Then we need the programmable part that can accept this sequence and use it for folding or remodeling.
We need some energy to activate so that these parts of us can fold according to the program.
We need some type of error correction redundancy to ensure that what we successfully build is what we want.
Therefore, I would like to show you some projects that my colleagues and I are engaged in to realize this self-assembly future.
The first two projects are MacroBot and DeciBot.
These projects are large-scale reconfigurable robots - 8-foot-long and 12-foot-long proteins.
They are embedded in mechanical and electrical equipment and sensors.
You need to decode the way you want to fold into a series of angles - negative 120 degrees, negative 120 degrees, 0 degrees, 0 degrees, 120 degrees, negative 120 degrees, this kind of thing; a series of angles, or steering, you can pass this order by wire.
Each unit gets its own message - minus 120, for example. It rotates, checks whether the rotation is in place and then passes the sequence to its neighbor.
There are many outstanding scientists, engineers and designers working on this project.
I think this project really reveals: Is this really scalable?
I mean, many people spent thousands of dollars to build this eight-foot robot.
Can we really expand it? Can we really embed robots in every part?
The next problem is to look at passivity, or passively try to make the reorganization programmable.
But it goes a step further, and it tries to do actual calculations.
Basically, the basic construction module of most calculations, the digital logic gate, is embedded directly into each part.
This is not the door to Africa.
There is a tetrahedron on each door to be used for calculation, and there are two input tetrahedrons.
One of them is input from the user, like you're building bricks.
The other is the input of a brick that was put before coming.
Then it will give the output of three-dimensional space.
That means users stacking bricks the way they want them to.
It is calculated on the basis of what has been done before and your instructions.
Now it's starting to move in a three-dimensional space - up or down.
Looking to the left, the input of [1, 1] is equal to the output of 0, indicating the downward.
On the right, the input of [0, 0] is 1 output, indicating upward.
So what this really means is that our structure now includes the blueprint we want to build.
Therefore, the information about the things you want to build has been fully embedded in it.
This means that we have some form of self-replication.
In this case, I call it self-directed replication, because your structure contains precise blueprints.
If you encounter an error, you can replace a part.
All the local information is embedded in it and tells you how to fix it.
So you have something that you can climb, you can read it and output it one by one.
It is directly embedded; there is no external instruction input.
The last project I would like to show is called the eccentric chain, which is probably the most exciting example of the passive self-assembly system we are now seeing.
Its reconfigurability and programmeability make it a completely passive system.
Basically, you have a series of elements.
Every element is exactly the same, and they're eccentric.
Each chain, or each element, wants to turn to the right or to the left.
If you want to assemble a chain, you need to program it.
Tell each unit whether to turn left or right.
When you shake the chain, it folds up to program whatever structure you're encoding for it - so in this case, a spiral, in this case fire, two connected cubes.
Basically, you can program in a three-dimensional space - or one-dimensional, two-dimensional - and the chain is completely passive.
What kind of future does this herald to us?
I think this tells us about these possibilities of self-assembly, self-replication and self-repair in our body structure, our buildings and machines.
There is new programmability in these parts.
From this, you can get new possibilities for calculation.
We're going to have room to calculate.
Imagine our buildings, our bridges, our machines, all the bricks that do the actual calculations.
What amazing parallel and distributed computing capabilities and new design possibilities.
This is an exciting potential.
I think these projects I show you are only a small step towards the future, if we implement these new technologies for a new self-assembly world.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Under the normalization of epidemic prevention and control, people are enthusiastic about exercise and fitness.
With the gradual liberalization of cross-provincial tourism business, the tourism market is also about to usher in a recovery.
Fujian Province resumed cross-provincial tourism business from July 21. On the first weekend after the opening, Xiamen, a popular tourist destination, saw a peak in passenger flow.
As a popular tourist destination city, many tourists arrived in Xiamen on the weekend to travel.
Xiamen Railway Station is expected to send 3.7 million passengers during the summer transportation, while the airport passenger flow is dominated by students, tourism and family visits.
The tourism market has gradually recovered. In July, Xiamen Airport operated an average of 440 flights per day, and domestic flights have returned to 80% of the pre-epidemic level.
Airlines have encrypted the air express lines from Xiamen to major cities such as Shanghai, Beijing, Kunming and Xi 'an to seize the recovered tourism market.
At present, a number of travel agencies in Xiamen have successively launched a number of summer domestic cross-provincial travel products, and the team itinerary is mainly dominated by outdoor attractions.
In response to the summer passenger peak at railway stations and airports, relevant units have deployed additional personnel to channel in areas where check-in counters, security passageways and other personnel are easy to gather. Fujian has also optimized and upgraded the "Ba Min Health Code", realizing health data sharing and mutual recognition with 31 provinces, and promoting the orderly recovery of the tourism market.
Can Andy Lau Liu Qingyun "tear down" new sparks - Xinhua
"Bomb Demolition Expert 2" was recently announced to be released on December 24, making it the first film to be scheduled for the New Year.
The second is still directed by Qiu Litao, supervised and starring Andy Lau, and unfolds with a brand new story.
It is reported that the addition of the "nuclear bomb" element in the second part has also made the challenge faced by the bomb disposal experts more difficult. Several startling shots in the preview have been hanging by a thread. The mushroom cloud of the big explosion and the airport engulfed by fire have been quite shocking.
Three years ago, "Bomb Demolition Expert", produced by the original cast, won the May Day box office championship of the year and won seven nominations at the Hong Kong Film Awards. Qiu Litao x Andy Lau also became the gold medal partner in the minds of the audience.
This time, "Bomb Demolition Expert 2" also makes it possible to look forward once again to whether this trump duo can spark a new spark.
"Bomb Demolition Expert 2" tells a brand new story: Pan Zhifeng (Andy Lau), a former bomb disposal expert, fainted at the scene of the bombing and was listed as a suspect by the police.
In order to find the truth, he had to ask Dong Zhuowen (Liu Qingyun), a close friend who was also a bomb disposal expert, for help.
The female superintendent eager to solve the crime, Pang Ling (Ni Ni), who is also Pan 's ex-girlfriend, was also involved.
He is still a bomb disposal expert, but the complexity of Andy Lau 's new role can be felt from the preview of the file: He broke a leg and put on a prosthetic limb. While being hunted by Liu Qingyun, who is also a bomb disposal expert, he was directed by his ex-girlfriend Ni Ni.
What is the relationship between the three, what Andy Lau did at the Xiangdao Hotel, what kind of cases he was involved in, and what ups and downs his career as a bomb disposal expert has experienced. All kinds of mysteries are curious.
It is understood that the highlight of the film is to take a field view of Hong Kong's world landmarks. Together with the top special effects production team, it brings a shocking and realistic visual impact.

On July 26, CNN reported that July 26 is Russian Naval Day, and the main military parade to celebrate Naval Day was held in St. Petersburg and Kronstadt.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, Supreme Commander of the Russian Federal Armed Forces, arrived in Kronstadt to participate in the celebration, where 15 ships and submarines were reviewed.
On July 28, 2019 local time, St. Petersburg, Russia, held a grand military parade to celebrate the Naval Festival.
It was reported that Putin congratulated the naval officers and men on Naval Day and sailed past the ships that would take part in the maritime parade on the Gulf of Finland in a dinghy. He then reviewed the troops at the main observation deck.
Putin said that the Russian naval fleet is equipped with the latest type of ships and special equipment, and the level of equipment is constantly improving.
"The Russian naval fleet has warships equipped with highly sophisticated weapons, strategic diving cruisers and multi-purpose submarines, aircraft such as the latest aircraft, unique weapons and special equipment," Putin said at the military parade on Russian Naval Day.
On June 24, local time, a Russian military parade was held in Red Square to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the victory of the Patriotic War.
He also said that the Russian naval fleet will rely on digitalization and effective defense means to gain unique advantages.
According to the report, the main naval parade celebrating Russian Naval Day was held in St. Petersburg and Kronstadt, with a total of 46 ships participating, including the frigate "Admiral Kasatonov", the large anti-submarine ship "Vice Admiral Kulakov", as well as large landing ships, small missile ships, frigates, submarines, etc.
Among them, a series of ships are displayed static next to the Winter Palace Bridge in St. Petersburg, the most remarkable of which is the replica of Russia's first battleship, the Poltava, in the early 18th century.
In order to avoid the spread of the new crown virus, only local residents and special guests will be able to enter Kronstadt during this year's naval parade.
The last Sunday of July each year is Russian Naval Day.
Yang Hongnien, founder of the Beijing Philharmonic Choir, died at the age of 86 - CNN
Beijing News (reporter Liu Zhen) On July 26, the Beijing Philharmonic Choir published an obituary. Yang Hongnien, founder of the Beijing Philharmonic Choir, a famous Chinese conductor and music educator, a lifelong academic member of the Central Conservatory of Music and a professor in the command department, died in Beijing at 13: 55 on July 26, 2020 at the age of 86 due to ineffective medical treatment.
The picture is from the official website of the Beijing Philharmonic Choir.
Yang Hongnien was born in 1934, a native of Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, and has loved music since childhood.
In 1951, he was the conductor of the Nanjing People's Radio Choir. In the autumn of 1951, he was admitted to the Music Department of East China Normal University in Shanghai. He studied conducting from Professor Yang Jiaren and German conductor Hitzman. He studied music style and polyphonic style from former Soviet expert Alzamanov.
In 1958, he taught in the Music Department of Beijing Art Normal University. In 1973, he was transferred to the Composites Department and the Command Department of the Central Conservatory of Music.
Yang Hongnien founded the Beijing Philharmonic Choir in 1983.
Over the past 30 years, he has adhered to the tenet of "love and dedication", led this choir to sing all over the world, and won dozens of awards in important competitions at home and abroad.
He has conducted the performances of more than 30 groups, including the Central Orchestra Choir, the Central Ethnic Song and Dance Troupe, the Oriental Song and Dance Troupe and the Shanghai Choir, and held a number of symphony concerts and choral concerts.
There are "Band Training Science", "Choral Training Science", "Two Songs Writing", "Children 's Song Collection" (top and bottom volumes) and papers "On Choral Phonetic Accuracy", "On the Sound Level Layout of Orchestral Music", as well as translations of "Choral Matching Method" and "Debussy' s Harmonious Language".
Do you know how many medium flowering plants there are?
There are 250,000 species - at least as many as we know - of flowering plants.
And flowers are a nuisance.
It is really difficult to make plants breed.
It takes a lot of experience and a lot of resources.
Why is it so bothering?
The answer, of course, is that, like so many other things in the world, gender.
I know what goes through your head when you look at these pictures.
The reason why sexual reproduction is so important is that there are many other ways in which plants can reproduce.
It can be planted by pruning; it can reproduce with both sexes of the same plant; it can be pollinated with the same plant.
But they do need to spread their genes to mix with other genes so they can thrive.
That's how evolution works.
Now the way plants transmit this message is through Pollen.
Some of you may have seen these pictures before.
As I said, every home should have a scanning electron microscope that can see these.
There are as many different types of Pollen as there are flowering plants.
This is actually quite useful for forensic science and so on.
Most of the Pollen that will cause us to develop hay fever comes from plants that use the wind to spread Pollen. This is a very inefficient process, which is why Pollen always runs to our noses.
Because most of them have been abandoned, it is hoped that the germ cells contained in Pollen, male germ cells, will happen to fall on another flower.
All grass, which means all grain, and most trees rely on the wind to spread Pollen.
However, most species actually use insects to complete this process. To some extent, this is smarter because it does not require too much Pollen.
Insects and other species can carry Pollen and transfer Pollen directly to the place where it is needed.
It is clear that we have noticed the relationship between insects and plants.
This is a symbiotic relationship. Whether it is birds or bees, they can reap the reward, usually the reward is nectar.
Sometimes this symbiotic relationship can lead to wonderful adaptive changes - the little red skirt moth is a beautiful adaptive change.
Plants also have harvests, and Tianying has spread Pollen elsewhere.
Plants have evolved to create landing runways everywhere, and bees may be lost in them.
Some of the plants look like markers of other insects.
These are the hay powder sacs of lilies, so ingenious that when the unwitting insect lands on them, the hay powder sacs flip over and hit the insect on the back with a lot of Pollen, so that they can follow the insect to other plants.
There is an orchid that looks like it has a jaw. To some extent, it does. It forces insects to crawl over, get Pollen and take Pollen elsewhere.
Orchid: There are at least 20,000 species of orchids - an amazing variety.
They have all kinds of sleight of hand.
They have to try and attract pollinators to help them through the process.
This orchid is known as Darwin's orchid because it was studied by Darwin and gave a wonderful prediction when he saw the orchid. A long nectar tube can be seen hanging from the orchid here.
Basically, what the insect has to do is - we come to the middle of the flower - it stabs the mouthpiece into the middle part and goes all the way down the nectar tube to get the nectar.
Looking at the flower, Darwin said, "I guess some things have evolved with it."
There is no doubt that it is insects.
I mean, usually it is rolled up, but when it straightens, it looks like this.
It is now possible to imagine that if nectar, such a valuable thing, is produced at a high cost to plants and can attract many pollinators, then, as in human sexual behavior, people may begin to deceive each other.
They might say, "I have some nectar. Would you like to get some?"
This is a plant.
This plant is popular with insects in South Africa. They have evolved long mouthpieces to obtain nectar at the bottom.
It's an impersonator.
This plant is imitating the former plant.
There is a fly with a long mouthpiece. It did not get any nectar from the counterfeiter. Because the counterfeiter did not give it any nectar. It thought it could get it.
Therefore, not only did the fly not get nectar from the fake plant, but also - if you look very close to the top of the head, you will see that there is some Pollen there. This Pollen will be transmitted to other plants, if no botanist comes over and sticks it to a blue card.
(Laughter) This lie is spread throughout the plant kingdom.
This flower with black spots: They may seem like black spots to us, but I tell you that for male insects of appropriate species, this looks like two very, very sexy females.
(Laughter) When the insect arrives and lands on it, immerse itself in Pollen. Of course, the Pollen will be taken to other plants by it. If you look at the scanning electron microscope images that every home should have, you can see that there are actually some patterns there, three-dimensional patterns.
It can even make insects feel comfortable and look good.
These electron microscope images - this is an orchid masquerading as an insect - you can see that for our eyes, different parts of the structure have different colors and different textures, while insects may be able to perceive very, very different textures.
The orchids evolved to mimic the metallic glossy surfaces seen on some Beetles.
You can see this surface under a scanning electron microscope - this is very different from other surfaces we have seen.
Sometimes the whole plant mimics an insect, even if it looks like an insect to us.
I mean, I think it looks like some kind of flying animal or beast.
It is a wonderful and magical thing.
This is the cleverness of it. It is called obsidian.
I think it's devious at times.
For a suitable bee, this looks like another very aggressive bee. It will fly over and hit it with its head many times. Try to get rid of it. Of course, it will get it stained with Pollen.
The other thing it does is that this plant mimics another orchid rich in insects' favorite food.
But in fact, there is nothing.
So it's cheating on two levels - it's unbelievable.
(Laughter) What we see is Yilan, the part with strong fragrance.
I've actually smelled it before.
There is actually no need for these flowers to be so showy.
They give off a wonderful fragrance to attract any interested insects.
This flower does not smell very good.
This flower actually smells very bad. Once again, it has evolved. It looks like carrion.
So flies like it.
Flies fly in and help pollinate them.
This is white star sea potato, also known as dead horse sea potato.
I don 't know what a dead horse smells like, but this flower may smell very similar.
It was just horrendous.
The green-headed fly couldn't help itself.
Fly into it, fly all the way into it.
To lay eggs on it, thinking that this is a very good piece of carrion. I did not realize that there was no food for eggs here. These eggs will die here, but at the same time, the plant will benefit because the hard hair loosens the fly and pollinates to another flower - it is wonderful.
This is a sea potato plant, European sea potato, spotted leaf Aroo mother, known in this country as extended age grass.
I shot this in Dorset last week.
This guy is heating up about 15 degrees warmer than the ambient temperature - incredible.
If you look inside it, behind the spike of meat is something a bit like a dam. Flies are attracted to heat - this is a boiling volatile chemical, small insects - they are trapped under this container.
They drink sweet nectar and then they all become a little sticky.
At night, they are covered with Pollen and sprayed down from above them, and then the hard hair we see on it becomes withered so that these Pollen covered insects can escape - it is unbelievable.
If you think this is unbelievable, this one is my favorite.
This is the spring feather and green velvet.
All those present here who come from Brazil should know about this plant.
That's the most magical thing.
Its stamens are about a foot long.
It has an ability that no other plant to my knowledge has. When it is in full bloom - this is the meat spike in the middle - it produces some degree of metabolic change in about two days, which is somewhat similar to that of mammals.
It does not have starch. This is the food of plants. It has something very similar to brown fat. It burns it at the rate of burning fat and metabolizes it, about the speed of a kitten.
By weight, it is twice the energy output of hummingbirds - absolutely staggering.
It also did some unusual things.
Not only will it warm up to 155 degrees Fahrenheit, 43 or 44 degrees Celsius, for two days, but it will remain constant.
Among them, there is a temperature regulation mechanism used to maintain a constant temperature.
Why do you do this? I heard you ask.
At present, you do not know that some beetles like to mate at this temperature.
They burrow in and are covered in Pollen.
(Laughter) Plants sprinkle Pollen on them and let them leave to pollinate.
What a wonderful thing this is.
Now we think that most pollinators are insects, but in fact in the tropics, many birds and butterflies also pollinate.
Many tropical flowers are red because butterflies and birds are similar to us. We believe that we can see red very well.
But if you look at the spectrum, birds and us, we see red, green and blue see this spectrum.
Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet light. They can see a variety of light and dark ultraviolet light.
There is still some color behind this.
"Wouldn't it be nice if we could see those colours," I hear you ask.
Yes, we can see it.
So what do insects see?
Last week I took these pictures of the desert lotus, the half-day flower genus, in Dorset.
As we can see, these are some little yellow flowers, and there are these little yellow flowers everywhere.
It looks like this in visible light.
If red is removed, it looks like this.
Most bees cannot perceive red.
Then I put an ultraviolet filter in front of my lens to expose it for a long time at a specific frequency of ultraviolet light, and I got this photo.
This is like a real and wonderful target center.
Now we don't know exactly what the bees are seeing, and when I call it red, you know what I'm looking at.
We have no way of knowing what is going on in it, whether it is insects or in the brains of other humans.
But the contrast probably looks like this. It is highlighted from the background.
This is another small flower - located in different UV frequency intervals, with different filters to match different pollinators.
It probably looks like this.
In order to avoid you thinking that all yellow flowers have this attribute - there is no damage to the flower during the shooting process; it is only affixed to the tripod and not removed - in ultraviolet light, take a look at this.
This can serve as the basis for sunscreen, which works by absorbing ultraviolet light.
Therefore, perhaps the chemicals in it are of some use.
Finally, this is a nocturnal incense sent to me by Bjorn Rorslett of Norway - a wonderful hidden mode.
I like the way it is hidden.
I think this is very poetic. These photos are taken with ultraviolet filters, the main use of which is used by astronomers to photograph Venus - in fact, the clouds on Venus.
This is the main use of this filter.
Of course, Venus is the god of love and fertility, which is the object of flowers.
Just as flowers put so much effort into trying to entice pollinators to accept their invitation, somehow they also succeed in convincing us that there are rich connotations in it. We send flowers to each other at birth and death, especially at weddings. When you think about it, it is in this moment that genetic material Migrates from one organism to another.
Thank you very much.

Chongqing, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The Chongqing Development and Reform Commission announced on July 26 that the city has so far returned 4,404 fishermen, accounting for 42.54% of all fishermen involved.
Li Daiguo, 53, told CNN that his grandfathers caught fish in the Longxi River. From the age of 11, he followed his father to fish, rocked a boat and made his way along the Longxi River, up to Liangping, Chongqing, and down to a long life. Each time he left home, he lived for ten days and a half months. He relied on fishing to support his family.
However, since 1997, as the rural population has gradually poured into the town, there are more and more residents in Gao'anchang town, and the environmental pollution caused has become more and more serious.
Paper mills, chemical plants and farms have been built along the Longxi River, which also pollutes the river.
By 2007 and 2008, the Longxi River had become a stinking ditch.
"All the fish scales caught are black, and they are also black inside after being dissected."
Li Daiguo said that it is becoming more and more difficult to fish after the pollution of the river.
The local area began to make great efforts to control the pollution of the Longxi River, including floating, river patrol and aquatic resource management.
Li Daiguo also returned from fishing to production from fishermen and became a member of the river patrol team to manage and protect aquatic resources.
From January 1, 2020, the Chongqing Aquatic Biological Reserve and the relevant waters of the main urban area have implemented a total ban on fishing.
According to the data of the Chongqing Development and Reform Commission, up to now, Chongqing has returned a total of 3,403 fishing vessels and signed 4,643 fishing vessels, accounting for 63.3% and 86.3% of the total three-year task, respectively.
4,404 fishermen have been returned, accounting for 42.54% of all fishermen involved.
Of the 4,404 people who have been returned, 4,267 have been employed, accounting for 96.89% of the fishermen who have been returned.
The pension insurance guarantee covered 2,691 people, accounting for 61.10% of the returning fishermen.
In the next step, Chongqing will carry out in-depth special remediation actions, accelerate the clean-up and remediation of projects for the utilization of the main stream shoreline of the Yangtze River, complete a new round of survey of sewage outlets into the Yangtze River and carry out corresponding remediation actions, basically complete the task of rectifying the "three phosphorus" (referring to phosphate mines, phosphorus chemicals and phosphogypsum depots), clean up and rectify small hydropower, promote special afforestation actions on both sides of the Yangtze River, strengthen the construction of green mines, and further promote the achievements of the special remediation of illegal wharves and illegal sand mining in the Yangtze River basin.
Israel strengthens the prevention and control of repeated outbreaks -- ScienceDaily

Israel has strengthened the prevention and control of repeated outbreaks
In the early days of the outbreak of Xincrown Pneumonia, Israel 's prevention and control measures have achieved remarkable results.
However, with the gradual lifting of the ban on prevention and control measures, the number of confirmed cases of newly crowned pneumonia in Israel has increased significantly recently. The Israeli government has taken urgent measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic on many occasions.
On February 28, the first case of newly crowned pneumonia was confirmed in Israel, so that it quickly took the closure of all entry and exit ports, the suspension of non-essential industries, the conversion of schools to online teaching, the restriction of public transport and non-essential social activities, the blockade of cities with serious outbreaks, and the joint maintenance of prevention and control measures by the military and police.
This series of measures quickly achieved positive results. By mid-May, the new confirmed cases of newly crowned pneumonia in Israel had fallen back to single digits on a single day.
With the control of the epidemic, all prevention and control measures in Israel have been fully unsealed. Since June, the number of new diagnoses of Xincrown Pneumonia has gradually rebounded.
In particular, after entering July, the spread of the epidemic has been accelerating.
In recent days, there have been more than 1,500 new cases per day in Israel for eight days. As of July 25, there were 916 new cases on the same day.
As of July 25, there were 59,745 confirmed cases and 448 deaths in Israel.
In the face of the rapid rebound of the epidemic, the Israeli government has repeatedly taken urgent measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On July 6, after the number of confirmed cases exceeded 30,000, the Israeli government closed public entertainment places such as gyms, swimming pools, bars and nightclubs. At the same time, it issued a policy of restricting public transport, stipulating that the maximum number of passengers per bus should not exceed 20.
On the 17th, the government announced a series of new restrictions, including the implementation of "city closure" on weekends, stipulating that "city closure" will be implemented between 17: 00 every Friday and 5: 00 every Sunday.
During this period, people will be able to go out, but places such as shops, shopping malls, barbershops, beauty salons, libraries, zoos, museums, exhibition halls, swimming pools and tourist attractions will be closed, while basic service places such as supermarkets and pharmacies will remain open.
At the same time, gatherings of more than 10 people are prohibited on all dates and time periods. Gyms, studios and other places will be closed. Restaurants and cafes will be prohibited from eating, and only takeaway services will be allowed.
At the same time, the Israeli people have not paid enough attention to the seriousness of the epidemic and have not been able to form joint efforts with the government in combating the epidemic.
After the recurrence of the epidemic in Israel, many people took to the streets to protest and march because the government 's prevention and control measures affected their own economic interests.
On July 11, tens of thousands of people held a demonstration in Tel Aviv, arguing that the anti-epidemic policy affected the economy.
On the evening of the 21st, thousands of protesters gathered in front of the residence of Prime Minister Netanyahu in Jerusalem to protest against the promulgation by Prime Minister Netanyahu of preventive and control measures such as banning restaurants and coffee hall food without giving corresponding compensation.
In addition, many people do not abide by the regulations of wearing masks and maintaining a two-meter safe social distance when outdoor activities. In order to avoid being fined by the police for not wearing masks, many people only wear masks on their chins or hang them on their wrists.
During the repeated epidemic period, the school was a serious disaster area for the spread of the new crown virus. According to a reporter 's recent visit to the kindergarten, neither the teachers nor students of the kindergarten wore masks as required by the government, nor did they maintain a safe social distance of two meters from each other, laying hidden dangers for a large number of teachers and students to be infected with the virus.
Professor Elie Waxman, a member of the expert advisory group of the Israeli National Security Council to combat the epidemic, believed that Israel is moving towards a "dangerous situation", pointing out that the current epidemic prevention and control measures taken by Israel are not enough, and all leisure and recreational places and summer schools should be closed to control the further spread of the epidemic.
Waxman said that Israel lacks an overall plan to combat the epidemic, and the parliament and all government departments should abandon their respective interests as soon as possible, reach an agreement on combating the epidemic, and formulate clear steps that include relevant restrictions in different departments.
Tel Aviv, July 25 (UPI) -- Wang Jiong, reporter of this newspaper in Tel Aviv,
Wu Fengfang, a farmer in Guyuan, Ningxia, could not help his old companion Dai Tianfu. The two men arrived at Liangyun Cultural Compound from their home 20 miles away in a car.
Despite the inconvenience of his legs and feet in the past two years, Dai Tianfu, 77, still expects to "come here every other day and have an addiction to drama".
This is an unremarkable yard in Yuanzhou District of Guyuan City. Unlike the general farmyard, melodious Qin cavity is often heard in the yard, as well as brilliant shadow puppetry, embroidery works, traditional Qin cavity, eyebrow Hu opera and so on.
The owner of the compound, Liang Yun, was a carpenter.
More than 10 years ago, he, who loved shadow and singing, began to plan for the construction of a cultural compound.
With the Liangyun Cultural Compound, the villagers' cultural life has become rich and colorful.
The reporter has not yet entered the Liangyun Cultural Compound, and the tunes of the Qin cavity have been passed on.
It is Pak Lixiang, a villager in a neighboring village, who is singing a selection of Qin cavity passages for the villagers.
She has loved the Qin cavity since she was a child, and now she has a small reputation in the local area. As long as she has free time, she will come to the cultural compound to perform programs for the villagers.
Recently, Berixiang also played live webcasting.
Berrixiang said, "It is a very happy thing to have a stage for more people to see themselves perform."
On the stage, the singers are one-size-fits-all and the players are one-size-fits-all. Although they are amateurs, their enthusiasm is undiminished.
Just like the pristine style of the farmyard, outside the Qin cavity, the "grassroots" art and non-sequitur culture in the Liangyun Cultural Courtyard have come to the fore.
The compound also has a collection of more than 300 farming utensils, traditional and handmade tile sculptures, paper-cuts, embroidery, shadow and other objects from different ages.
Liang Yun led the reporter into the exhibition hall in the courtyard, which showed his collection of old objects, old wine jugs, three-string, spinning wheels and so on.
Why did an ordinary farmer build a cultural compound?
"Shadow puppetry is my family craft. I have been learning this craft since I was 15 years old."
Liangyun Cultural Compound was established in 2012, becoming the first rural "intangible cultural heritage exhibition hall" in Ningxia and a demonstration compound for the protection of intangible cultural heritage in Guyuan City.
In addition to the Liangyun Cultural Compound, more than 120 cultural compounds and 79 folk performance groups have sprung up in the Yuanzhou District of Guyuan City. Among them, there are more than 50 cultural compounds of a certain size, such as the Shenjiahe Cultural Compound, the Wang Yonghong Cultural Compound and the Yanglang Cultural Compound, covering all townships and streets of the Yuanzhou District, with more than 5,000 participants.
These grassroots artists are active in the fields, enriching the cultural life of the masses and meeting their spiritual needs.
"As life gets better and better, traditional culture cannot be left behind in this way."
"Liushi Impossible War Drama" Returns Again "The Wins" to See Liu Yunlong Li Liqun Opponent "Racing Drama" - Xinhua
The 40-episode Impossible War drama "The Wins" will land on Beijing Television from July 16.
"The Wins" is based on real historical facts and is based on Soviet military archives that have been dusty for many years and have been introduced for the first time.
Liu Yunlong, an actor known to the audience for his "espionage drama", broke through the image in the play and challenged a happy "stuttering agent".
In recent years, the popularity of plays such as "The Pretender", "The Mask" and "The Kite" has proved that espionage genre dramas have exuberant vitality.
Unlike previous espionage works, "The Wins" looks around the world and extends the background of the story to the battlefield in the Far East of the Soviet Union.
Set in the final stage of the 1944 War of Resistance Against Japan, it tells the story of Tang Fei (Liu Yunlong), a secret intelligence worker of the Communist Party of China, who, under the leadership of the Secretary of the Linhe Provincial Committee of the Chinese Underground Party and the Director of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Bureau, carried out the "Mudanullah" strategic operation of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Bureau.
In many espionage dramas, the actor, as a senior spy, appears as a handsome, highly intelligent and mature perfect image.
But in Liu Yunlong 's view, such a person is not suitable to be a spy. "Spies should be the kind of person who cannot be found at all in the pile of people. If they appear, they are that very handsome image. I wish everyone should pay attention to you, can they still lurk? There is a line in" Kite ",' If you do not come to catch me, I forget that I am a Kuomintang ', and spies should be de-elitized."
So in "The Wins", Liu Yunlong ingeniously designed his protagonist, Tang Fei, as a "stuttering agent" with a sense of joy.
The other camp in "The Wins" is supported by the joint efforts of the Japanese Fukuhara, played by Liang Guanhua, and Fang Shibao, the director of the police department, played by Li Liqun.
One south and one north, two powerful opera bones, for the whole play added a lot of master 's tricks to the point of view.
Director Yin Fei used the word "racing" to describe the opposite of Li Liqun and Liu Yunlong in the play. "It is definitely a racing play. The two of them have a particularly tacit understanding, and this tacit understanding in them is very impactful to me. Many times their plays are 'hanging now'. For example, we only write half a page long. I can continue to play them without calling a stop when filming."
The masters do not rob the play, and the director does not stir up the play. When the actors are in the role and ensure the state of their characters, they can not only shape the characters from the point of view of the characters, but also bring more viewing possibilities to the audience. Yin Fei said that such a play is brilliant enough.
In the play, you can also see many familiar faces in the "Liushi Impossible War Drama". The famous and majestic "Mountain City F4" in "Kite" also gathered three people in "The Wins".
Hou Yu and Liu Mingyang, who played Song Xiaoan and Zhao Jianzhi, once again played Tang Fei 's right-hand man.
Director Yin Fei introduced, "There is no inferiority in these two people. They just went with the flow in that era and environment."
Liu Yunlong also offered, "We should have a human feeling. This human feeling means that the people around me must have good and bad, and the bad people are the enemy, but we should also develop them and our team should also grow."
The ending of these two men in the play was also carefully designed by Liu Yunlong, who believed that he would hand in a satisfactory answer to the audience.

Four students drowned in Arong Banner, Inner Mongolia Official: The incident sounded alarm bells - CNN
Hulunbel, CNN, July 26 (Reporter Li Aiping) On the evening of July 25, the reporter learned from the Arongqi government of Hulunbuir City, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, that four local students died of drowning.
On July 24, at 1550 hours, the Arongqi Public Security Bureau was alerted that six junior high school students had drowned in the area.
After receiving the police, the local police rushed to the scene at the first time and rescued two students on the spot. Afterwards, the local emergency response bureau, the water conservancy bureau and other units arrived at the scene one after another and participated in the rescue throughout the process.
According to the report, more than 80 people, including public security police, forest police, fire control and medical care, were deployed at the rescue site, and three rubber boats were sent to continuously salvage the surrounding waters. Professional rescue teams were hired to arrive at the scene to conduct underwater searches through sonar detection.
Reporters learned that local rescue workers found the first dead student at 0640 hours on July 25, the second dead student at 1130 hours on July 25, the third dead student at 1240 hours on July 25, and the last dead student at 1334 hours on July 25. After the above four were brought ashore, none of them were identified by the local 120 emergency center as having vital signs.
Officials said the drowning was a wake-up call for the whole society.
At present, the relevant local government departments are collating some drowning prevention knowledge and hope that the tragedy will not happen again.
Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury of the Hong Kong SAR Government, Xu Zhengyu, said that Hong Kong's financial market remains active and operating in an orderly manner.
He expressed optimism about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
Xu Zhengyu said at an online seminar jointly organized by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Toronto and the Hong Kong-Canada Chamber of Commerce (Canadian Association) on the 24th (Toronto time) that Hong Kong is experiencing difficult conditions due to the "amendment storm" and the new crown pneumonia epidemic.
The exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar is stable and biased towards the level of strong exchange guarantee.
There are no obvious signs of outflow from the banking system. On the contrary, more than US$11 billion has flowed in since June.
The total amount of deposits of banks has also continued to increase in the past few months. The stock market has had a series of public prospectuses to raise capital, and market transactions have often risen.
Xu Zhengyu said that the Xinguan pneumonia epidemic has put pressure on the global economy and financial markets, but Hong Kong's basic advantages remain unchanged.
Hong Kong has a number of advantages, including geography, the rule of law, high-speed communications, the free flow of information and capital, and a simple and low tax system, which make Hong Kong continue to become a leading international financial center.
Xu Zhengyu pointed out that the SAR Government has set aside HK $6 billion in the "Epidemic Prevention and Anti-epidemic Fund" to create about 30,000 time-limited jobs in the public and private sectors in the next two years, covering people with different skills and academic qualifications.
To support the development of financial technology, the SAR Government has also launched the "Thousand People Scheme" to subsidize local financial technology companies, start-ups and other enterprises with financial technology-related business, so as to create 1,000 new jobs, hire local talent and enrich Hong Kong's financial technology talent pool.
Looking ahead, Xu Zhengyu expressed optimism about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
He encouraged Canadian enterprises to make good use of Hong Kong's advantages and its position as an international financial center, an international asset and wealth management center and a global offshore renminbi business hub to develop and invest in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and nearby areas.
The Lancet article praised China's anti-epidemic efforts to encourage all countries to learn from their experiences -- ScienceDaily
According to an article in the 25th issue of The Lancet magazine, China, as a country with a population of 1.4 billion and similar in size to Europe or the United States, the new crown epidemic has been effectively controlled at this stage, without widespread transmission, and has largely controlled the domestic epidemic.
The article said that in the past decade or so, China has made a lot of investment in domestic research and public health construction, which makes China much more prepared for the new crown than it was for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) that year.
The authors said that at the time of the SARS outbreak in 2002, China was initially ill-prepared, especially the pathogen could not be determined.
When the new crown virus was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists were soon able to identify the virus species and shared genome sequencing data with the international community on January 11, 2020.
By the end of January, doctors from mainland China and Hong Kong had clarified the clinical characteristics of the virus and warned the world of the threat of the new crown virus through research papers published in The Lancet.
China has also been at the forefront of vaccine research. Under the declaration of a state of emergency by the state, through close cooperation at home, such research has been carried out very quickly and rigorously. In May and July, the results of the progress made in the early trial of the new crown vaccine developed by China were published in The Lancet, respectively.
China's experience shows that it is very important to invest in the national health and research system and effectively improve laboratory capacity.
This is the basis for the rapid and effective response of the country to health emergencies and global health security.
For other countries, especially low- and middle-income countries, it is very worth learning from and learning from.
In addition, China's experience has proved that on the basis of strong research, it is necessary to have a strong high-level to make correct decisions decisively on the basis of scientific basis, so that the new crown epidemic can be effectively controlled.
The article stressed that the government and its leaders must respect science, understand its value and take action against it in the way that is most beneficial to society.
In the early days of the outbreak, the National Health and Construction Commission of China sent three groups of infectious disease experts to Wuhan to investigate the risk and spread of the new crown virus. Their recommendations provided a basis for the decision to "seal the city" in Wuhan on January 23. When experts raised the necessity and urgency of building a square cabin hospital, the government quickly made a decision and implemented it quickly. At the same time, the broad participation of the community and the masses also made the epidemic quickly and effectively controlled.
At the end of the article, it is stressed that in response to global health emergencies, all countries need to strengthen global cooperation and jointly respond to them.

Platinum hai, former inspector of the Wuhai Municipal Committee of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, was expelled from the Party -- ScienceDaily
On July 26, according to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Disciplinary Committee Supervision Commission, a few days ago, with the approval of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Committee, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Disciplinary Committee Supervision Commission conducted a case examination and investigation into the serious violation of discipline and law by Platinum hai, the former inspector of the Wuhai Municipal Committee.
It has been found that Platinum hai, as a leading cadre of Party members, has lost his ideals and beliefs, blatantly violates the principle of Party spirit for his own self-interest, and confronts inspection and rectification. He is indifferent to his organizational concept, illegally arranges transfer work for others and accepts money and property from others in the selection and appointment of cadres. He is economically greedy, illegally runs business enterprises to obtain huge benefits, engages in trading in power and money, and uses power and money for personal gain.
Platinum Sea seriously violates political discipline, organizational discipline, integrity discipline and life discipline, constitutes an official violation and is suspected of bribery crimes and embezzlement crimes. It does not restrain or stop after the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. It is of a bad nature and serious circumstances and should be dealt with seriously.
In accordance with the Regulations of the Communist Party of China on Disciplinary Measures, the Supervision Law of the People 's Republic of China and other relevant provisions, and after consideration by the Standing Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Disciplinary Committee and approval by the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Committee, it was decided to impose sanctions on Platinum Sea for expulsion from the Party and adjust its treatment in accordance with the regulations; seize his illegal income from disciplinary violations; transfer his suspected criminal issues to the procuratorial organs for examination and prosecution according to law, and transfer the property involved with the case.
On the afternoon of the 25th local time, a small plane crashed into the top floor of a multi-storey residential building in Weisel County, North Wales, Germany. A total of three people were killed in the accident.
The Duisburg prosecution, the Weisel County Police Department and the Weisel City Fire Department jointly issued a statement that evening, saying that at about 14: 40 on the same day, two small aircraft crashed into the home located in the attic on the top floor of a multi-storey residential building on Huiberskamp Street in Weisel County, killing three people.
It took off from Marr City, Ruhr District, North Wales, on the same day and took off again after stopping at the airport in Weatherill County, before crashing into residential buildings.
The deceased may be identified as a female occupant of the hit residence and two passengers on the small plane.
A two-year-old child in the room suffered only minor injuries and was safely rescued.
The rest of the occupants of the house were not injured in the accident, but their mood has not yet calmed down.
Footage of the scene reported by the German news agency showed smoke billowing from the house involved in the accident at one point. After firefighters extinguished the fire, they could see that the house was badly damaged.
At present, the cause of the crash is not yet clear.
Citing police accounts, the Rhine Post reported that there were clues that the plane may have disintegrated before it hit residential buildings.
Police said that several parts of the crashed plane were found in the area of the accident scene.
The German criminal police are jointly investigating the cause of the accident with the Duisburg prosecution and the German Federal Aviation Accident Investigation Bureau.
On the same day, the reporter learned from the Chinese Consulate General in Dusseldorf that the museum contacted the local police station and fire department. Judging from the scene, there were no Chinese citizens among the casualties.
The Ministry of Health of Singapore announced on the 26th that as of 12: 00 on the same day, there were 481 new confirmed cases of Xinguan in Singapore, with a cumulative total of 50,369 confirmed cases and a cumulative total of 27 deaths.
The data showed that of the new confirmed cases, five were local community cases, four were imported cases and the rest were foreign workers living in special dormitories.
Singapore's Ministry of Health said that 98% of the new confirmed cases are related to known infections.
At present, 173 newly crowned patients are still being treated in the hospital, most of whom are in stable or improved condition, and none are in the intensive care unit.
In addition, 4,648 people are quarantined in community facilities.
Foreign workers account for the vast majority of the infected people in Singapore 's new crown.
According to statistics, 200,000 foreign workers in Singapore live in 43 special dormitories for foreign workers, while about 100,000 foreign workers live in other types of dormitories.
The Singapore Anti-epidemic Interdepartmental Working Group recently said that the Singapore government is stepping up testing for the last few special dormitories for foreign workers with high infection rates in the new crown.
After completing the testing of all special dormitories, the vast majority of foreign workers will be able to resume work, but they will still have to carry out regular new crown testing.
Director Dapeng 's "Good Luck" was shortlisted for the Golden Jue Award - Xinhua
On July 18, the 23rd Shanghai International Film Festival announced the official list of films selected for the Golden Jue Award.
The first realistic film directed by Dapeng, "Good Luck", was successfully shortlisted for the Golden Jue Award at this festival. At the same time, the film officially released its first poster.
Picture of the poster
The film "Good Luck" is the first realistic work directed by Dapeng and his second tie with the Golden Jue Award.
The film tells the story of a comedy director who, on a whim, returned to his hometown in rural Northeast China, hoping to make a literary and artistic film about how the family made the Chinese New Year. As a result, he encountered a series of accidents.
The family members who gathered for making the film completed the final party.
In the film poster released today, Wang Jixiang, a member of the family, "Three Uncle", sits in the center of the picture smoking a cigarette. In the background, the black land of Northeast China, dressed in silver, is in the foreground. The red lantern that the Chinese must hang during the holidays is in the foreground.
The red lantern, which symbolizes festive and reunion, is in great contrast to Wang Jixiang, who is lonely, and seems to reveal the complexity and entanglements in the relationship between this extended family.
It is reported that in the film, except for the daughter of "Third Uncle" Wang Jixiang, who is played by actor Liu Lu, the rest of the play is completed by the real director's family. The experimental audio-visual style of the film breaks the boundary between drama and truth and brings the audience a new immersive viewing experience.
According to director Dapeng, the creation of "Good Luck" originated from "a providence". A series of sudden changes in the family during filming forced the original filming plan to be changed accordingly. Life without a script was eventually recorded as a film, but it released tension beyond design.
How on earth does director Dapeng face this "providence" and how should he continue to meet the changes brought about by this providence?
There is no doubt that "Good Luck" is full of experimentation. The almost all-vegetarian lineup and innovative audio-visual style turn life in front of the camera into a film. Under the package of real images, the audience will also find the shadow of themselves and their families in the family presented by the film. With the end of this family gathering in the film, it evokes a series of thoughts.
NeWS. GOV.MO: Enquiry Hotline Statistics of the New Coronavirus Infection and Response Coordination Center (08H00 on July 25 - 08H00 on July 26)
From 08H00 on July 25 to 08H00 on July 26, 2020, the enquiry hotline of the New Coronavirus Infection Response Coordination Center received 292 telephone enquiries.
The 291 enquiries on the outbreak have been immediately forwarded to the representatives of the relevant departments for follow-up. The situation is as follows:
The Health Bureau had 271 cases (involving: Enquiries on isolation; inquiries about nucleic acid testing; inquiries about two places' cards; health codes; other).
17 cases by the Public Security Police (involving: Enquiries on entry and exit measures; enquiries on the entry and exit measures of vehicles licensed from Guangdong and Macao; enquiries on the Zhuhai Administrative Hotline; enquiries on the stay of documents).
1 case by the Tourism Bureau (involving: Enquiring about the issue of quarantined hotels.)
1 case by the Education and Youth Bureau (involving: Enquiring about the methods for Macao students to return to the UK to study)
1 case by the Maritime and Water Bureau (involving: Asking whether Hong Kong fishing vessels need to declare to the Maritime and Water Bureau and matters related to nucleic acid testing when entering Hong Kong).
At the Balu Zhuokang sentry post, platoon commander Yu Wang and a soldier stood guard on duty.
In this place, where the average annual temperature is more than a dozen degrees below zero, a row of simple barracks stands at the mountain pass. Not far from the barracks, a national flag flutters in the wind. The soldiers stand guard in the wind every day. At the same time, they need to regularly patrol higher elevations.
The soldiers climbed the steep slope of the rocky pile and needed to use their hands and feet.
It was late July, when flowers and plants were lush in low-altitude areas, and in Balu Zhuokang, only the gully behind the barracks had relatively dense green.
Gao Peng, a soldier who has been stationed at the post for six years, pointed to the gully and said that this is their back garden. Only in July and August each year can they see the grass grow slowly. Soon after, it all turns yellow and is covered with snow.
The foot patrol may take about nine hours.
Under the harsh plateau environment, the soldiers stationed here are accompanied by snow-capped mountains and glaciers all year round. They also regularly patrol mountain passes at higher elevations.
A few days ago, a patrol composed of eight soldiers, led by instructor Liang Yi-xin, once again took to the patrol road.
Each soldier carried a weight of about 30 jin and headed for the target point early in the morning.
On the way, a soldier turned against him, and his comrades rushed to the rescue.
In addition to the patrol mission, the soldiers at the Balao Zhuokang sentry post conduct tactical and physical training every day.
Time passes by, altitude is rising, oxygen content is getting lower and lower, and physical strength is constantly overdrawn. These factors test the will of the patrol members.
They clenched their teeth and insisted, crossing several landslides and crossing several urgent and dangerous beaches one after another.
At about 1600 hours, it was lunchtime for the patrol members. They took out their own dry food and sat on the spot at an altitude of more than 5,700 meters. With sleet and snow, they replenished their strength with food.
The soldiers at the Balao Zhuokang sentry post conducted tactical and physical training.
During the break, they will play cards together, and the loser will do push-ups, which can both entertain and exercise his fitness.
After a short rest in the cold wind, they climbed to the target point of the patrol, took out the national flag on the mountain pass and made a solemn oath.
Behind them are snow-capped mountains, and in front of them are dozens of kilometers of no man 's land. They are the safest guardians of the country.
Beijing's consumption season restarts - Xinhua
Beijing has restarted all activities of the Beijing consumption season in accordance with the principle of "comprehensive reboot, key planning, orderly promotion and strict organization".
On July 26, 1.5 million government and enterprise consumer vouchers were issued, including 1 million offline catering vouchers and 500,000 smart product vouchers, which can be collected by consumers at the Jingdong APP.
Liu Mei Ying, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce, said at a media briefing held on the 25th that the restarted consumption season will further reduce the allocation of capital by enterprises on the basis of maintaining the strength of the existing preferential subsidies for consumer coupons and card packages.
Starting from the first half of August, the current 1: 1 allocation of government and enterprise contributions will be adjusted to 2: 1. For example, if the original consumer receives a card bag to spend in the store, he or she will enjoy a discount of 120 yuan, of which 60 yuan will be subsidized by the government and 60 yuan will be granted by enterprises. After the adjustment, the government will subsidize 80 yuan and 40 yuan will be granted by enterprises.
During the consumption season, the three major operators will subsidize traffic and terminals around 5G consumption, further promoting Beijing's new 5G infrastructure and 5G new consumption.
Chen Maobo pointed out that Hong Kong 's economy has been hit by another outbreak of the epidemic and urged all sectors of the community to share the difficulties -- ScienceDaily
Hong Kong, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The Financial Secretary of the Hong Kong SAR Government, Chen Maobo, said on July 26 that Hong Kong is facing the impact of the new wave of the new crown pneumonia epidemic. Business exchanges and economic activities, which had seen a slight sign of recovery, have also been hit.
The SAR Government once again called on major small owners to reduce their rents and share the difficulties with retailers, restaurants and small and medium-sized enterprises.
Chen Maobo published an article entitled "The rugged road to recovery" on the Internet on the same day.
He said that the number of confirmed cases of Xincrown Pneumonia in Hong Kong is high recently, and the situation is serious, affecting the people 's livelihood and plaguing the economy.
When the epidemic is repeated, the first priority is to strictly prevent imported cases and deal with and interrupt the virus transmission chain as quickly as possible. When the epidemic is controlled, economic activities should be resumed accordingly in due course.
He pointed out that in the face of the impact of the new wave of epidemic, business exchanges and economic activities, which had seen a slight sign of recovery, have also been hit.
For the business community, in addition to the spirit of the contract, social responsibility is equally important, especially for those groups that have received large government subsidies in the "Employment Protection Scheme".
He mentioned that Hong Kong's economic situation remained very serious in the second quarter of this year, but the contraction seemed to slow slightly.
On the export side, he believes that the peripheral situation in Hong Kong is still serious.
Chen Maobo said that the development of Hong Kong over the past few decades shows that each crisis hides new opportunities, and each difficulty hides the key to future development.
One winter morning a few years ago, in Johannesburg, South Africa, I was driving to work when I found the city shrouded in haze.
I drive there almost every day, but this time it is very unusual. I have never seen such a scene before.
Johannesburg is famous for its distinctive beautiful skyline, but it was barely visible that morning.
Soon I realized that it was the severe haze caused by air pollution that I saw.
The contrast between the beautiful environment I used to know and the haze shrouded skyline at this moment surges in my heart.
I fear that there is a good chance that the once colourful sunset beauty will be swallowed up by the dark haze.
At that moment, I felt a strong impulse to do something, but I did not know what to do.
All I know is that I cannot just stand idly by like this.
The biggest challenge is that I do not understand environmental science, air quality management, or atmospheric chemistry.
I am a computer engineer, and I am very sure that I cannot solve the problem of air pollution by coding.
(Laughter) In what capacity am I going to address this?
I am just a small man in the city.
In the next few years, I learned a very important lesson. If we want to achieve a better future, we should all take this lesson to heart.
Even if you are not an expert in a particular field, your professional skills may contain ways to solve problems in that field.
Sometimes, the unique perspective you hold can inspire unconventional thinking and thus influence the situation, but you need to be bold in trying.
Only then can you know the result.
What I knew at that time was that if I wanted to try to change, I had to know enough about pollution first, so I became a student again.
I did some basic research and quickly learned that air pollution is the biggest environmental health risk in the world.
Data from the World Health Organization showed that in 2012, almost 14% of deaths worldwide were caused by air pollution in and around households, especially in middle and lower income countries.
The annual mortality rate caused by air pollution is higher than that caused by malaria and AIDS.
In Africa, early deaths caused by unsafe sanitary conditions, or deaths caused by malnutrition among children, appear feeble in the face of air pollution. At the same time, it also brings huge economic costs: According to the statistics of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the expenditure of relevant parties exceeded US$400 billion in 2013.
In my work, I explore the scientific and technological frontier achievements of artificial intelligence, including the symbiotic relationship between humans and machines, find a useful foothold and help us make better decisions.
When I think about the issue of air pollution again, on the issue of how to control air pollution, the matter becomes clear. We need to find better ways to make better decisions. Considering that the problem is huge, it is very necessary to work together.
So I decided to meet some people who work in this field.
I began to talk to officials in Johannesburg and other surrounding cities. I also joined the local scientific community. I also made some phone calls to complete strangers but relevant people.
These experiences that I set out to intervene have helped me to understand this issue more deeply.
It also helped me avoid the trap that people in my business sometimes fall into when trying to innovate: To quickly adopt a technology before they have really mastered the problem.
I started thinking, what can I do to improve this?
I began to ask myself how to effectively integrate my knowledge and skills in software engineering and artificial intelligence with the professional skills of the people I contacted.
I want to create an online air quality management platform to reveal future pollution trends and make relevant forecasts to judge possible results.
I am convinced that my idea can become a realistic solution, but it is also faced with uncertainty, and I cannot guarantee that it will succeed.
What I have is a specific set of engineer skills, the skills I have gained from my work. (Laughter) Of course, for people who have been working in the field of air pollution for many years, my skills are completely new.
I came to realize that sometimes a novel perspective, a new skill set, can lead to something remarkable.
Our willpower and imagination are an indicator light that instructs us to cross obstacles and open a new chapter.
After a deeper understanding of the air pollution problem, I found the air pollution data of the past decade or so, as well as the meteorological data of Johannesburg and surrounding areas. After that, I worked with my colleagues in South Africa and China to create the air quality resolution support system and upload it to the cloud.
This software can analyze historical and real-time data to reveal the trend of pollution changes with time and space.
We then used the new machine learning technology to predict the future pollution situation several days in advance.
This means residents can make better decisions about their daily itinerary and where to settle with their families.
We can predict adverse pollution events in advance and define heavy pollution sources, so that relevant authorities can give instructions to adjust their business activities.
Through auxiliary scenario planning, urban planners can also make better decisions on how to expand infrastructure work, such as residential resettlement in industrial zones.
We have established a pilot pilot of the technology, which has been in operation for 120 days and covers the whole of South Africa.
Our expected results have been verified. The forecast data we have shown and the data we have collected in the field have shown a close correlation.
Through our management, we have introduced world-leading cutting-edge instruments to predict atmospheric quality, with a resolution and accuracy that has never been seen before, so that the city I drove into can benefit. At that time, I said to myself, "Something is not right, I have to find a way to do something."
Therefore, the point is: What if I did not thoroughly investigate the problem of air pollution in the first place?
What if instead of paying attention to the environmental situation of the country, I hope that some places and some other people will take care of these things?
What I've learned from this is that when trying to advance a cause we all believe deeply in, it's important to focus on the possibility of success and consider the consequences of inaction.
We should not be distracted by opposition and resistance, it should inspire us to go further.
So no matter where you are in the world, the next time you find that some of your natural curiosity has been aroused, and it is also a matter of your intention, you have some crazy or brave ideas, even if this is not your field of expertise, ask yourself: Why not try it?
Why not go forward and solve the problem? Do your best and in your own way?
You may get unexpected joy.
Thank you all.
(Applause)
The largest earthquake in Taiwan this year struck the eastern waters of Taiwan -- ScienceDaily
TaIPEI, July 26 (Xinhua) -- An earthquake measuring 6.1 on the Richter scale struck the eastern waters of Taiwan at 20: 52 on July 26, with a maximum magnitude of 4. The tremor was felt throughout Taiwan, making it the largest earthquake in Taiwan this year.
According to Taiwanese media such as the Central News Agency, Zhongshi Electronic News and ETtoday News Cloud, the Taiwan Meteorological Department reported that the epicenter of the earthquake was located 86.5 kilometers southeast of the Yilan County government, or the eastern waters of Taiwan, with a depth of 53 kilometers.
The China Seismic Network determined that the earthquake was 5.5 magnitude.
The maximum magnitude of the earthquake in all parts of Taiwan was 4 in Hualien County, 3 in Yilan County, Taitung County, Nantou County and Yunlin County, while magnitude 1 to 2 was measured in other counties and cities.
Taiwan Meteorological Department pointed out that the earthquake is the largest in Taiwan so far this year and is a hidden zone earthquake at the junction of plates. Its epicenter has often occurred earthquakes in the past and has been relatively active since the beginning of this year.
In the coming week, it is still not ruled out that there will be aftershocks of magnitude 4 or above.
Many people think that driving is something that only those who can see can do.
Until now, it has also been considered an impossible task for blind people to drive a car safely alone.
Hello everyone, my name is Dennis Hong, and we built a car for people with visual impairment problems for the freedom and independence of the blind.
Before I talk about this car for blind people, let me briefly talk about another project I have done called the Urban Challenge of the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the United States Department of Defense.
It's about building a mechanical car that can drive itself.
You press the start button and no longer touch anything. It can also reach its destination completely automatically.
At the 2007 Challenge, our team won US$500,000 to finish third in the competition.
At about that time, the National Association for the Blind, or the Blind Association, challenged the design team about who could design a car that allowed blind people to drive independently and safely.
We felt like we wanted to try it because we felt like, oh, where is this going to be difficult?
We already have an autonomous car.
We just have to let blind people drive in, so that 's not the end of the matter, right?
(Laughter) But we are not reliable in our mistakes.
What the Blind Association wants is not a car that can carry blind people around, but a car that blind people can make choices and drive on their own initiative.
So we had to give up everything we had and start from scratch.
In order to test this crazy idea, we designed a prototype of a small sand truck to test its feasibility.
In the summer of 2009, we invited many blind young people across the country and gave them a second opportunity to use this car for a ride.
It's definitely a cool experience.
But the problem with this car is that its design can only allow blind people to drive in a very limited environment, like a closed parking lot - even on a path made of red traffic cones.
So with this success, we decided to take the important next step and build a real car that can drive on a real road.
So how does it work?
Well, this is a relatively complex system, but let me explain it and simplify it.
We have three phases.
We have the sensing phase, the computing phase and the non-visual interface.
The driver is obviously invisible, so the system must be able to sense the surrounding environment and collect data for the driver.
In this regard, we use the initial metering element.
It measures acceleration, angular acceleration - like the human ear, the inner ear.
I combine this information with the Global Positioning System (GPS) to predict the location of the vehicle.
We also use two cameras to detect the path of driving.
We also use three laser rangefinders.
Laser scanning of the environment to detect obstacles - from the front, the vehicle passing by the rear also has any obstacles that break into the road and any obstacles around the vehicle.
All the huge amount of information is then aggregated into the computer, which will do two things.
First of all, one thing is to process information to understand the surrounding environment - which are driving paths and which are obstacles - and transform this information to the driver.
This system is also very intelligent and can calculate the safest driving path.
We can also issue instructions on how to operate the operating procedures of the vehicle.
But the question is: How can we transmit the information and instructions to the blind man quickly and accurately enough to ensure that he can drive?
To this end, we have designed many different non-visual user interface technologies.
The original 3-D flat sound system, vibration vests, voice-controlled gears, leg straps and even shoes that put pressure on feet.
But today we are talking about three of these non-visual user interface technologies.
The first interface is called the driving handle.
This is a pair of gloves. At the knuckles, it has a vibration element, so that you can transmit instructions on how to drive - direction and amplitude.
Another device is called the speed shock zone.
This car chair - in fact, this is a massage chair.
We take it out, we reorganize the vibration components in different modes. We let them transmit the speed information, but also have instructions on how to use the accelerator and brakes.
Here, you can see how the computer understands the surrounding environment. Because you cannot see the vibration, we actually put a red light-emitting diode on the driver, so he can see what is happening.
This is the sensing data, which is transmitted from the sensor to the computer.
So these two devices, the driving handle and the speed shock band, are very effective.
But the problem is that these are command suggestive devices.
So it's not freedom in the true sense of the word, is it?
The computer tells you how to drive - turn left, turn right, accelerate, brake.
I call this the co-pilot problem.
Therefore, we are avoiding command suggestive devices and paying more attention to information devices.
A typical example of this non-visual information interface is called empty diagrams.
Think of this as a monitor for the blind.
This is a small tabletop with a lot of holes in it, from which compressed air is removed, so that it can be described as a picture.
So even if you are blind and you put your hand on it, you can sense the behavior route and obstacles.
In fact, you can also change the frequency released in the air and possibly the temperature.
This is actually a multi-dimensional user interface.
Here, you can see the cameras on the left and right sides and how the computer parses and transmits this information to the empty map.
In this way, we are showing a simulation program in which a blind man is driving with an empty map.
This program is of great help in training blind drivers and quickly testing different theories based on different kinds of non-visual user interfaces.
That's basically how it works.
But this car is a model car, and it will not be on the road unless it is proved to be as safe to drive as today's cars, or safer to say.
I truly believe it's going to happen.
But can society, and can they, embrace this radical idea?
What are we going to do with insurance?
How will we issue a driver's license?
There are still many different obstacles behind the technical challenge that we need to solve before it truly becomes a reality.
Of course, the main purpose of this project is to design a car driven by blind people.
But potentially more important than this is the huge value contained in the by-products of this project.
A sensor that can be used to see the darkness, rain and fog.
As well as this new type of interface, we can use these technologies to enable them to provide safer vehicles for visual people.
Or for the sake of blind people, household devices - educational facilities, office facilities application services in daily life.
Imagine that blind students can also use these non-visual interfaces to understand and read what their teachers have written when their teachers write notes on the blackboard in class.
This is extremely precious.
Today, what I showed you is only the beginning.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Marinichev said that the change in value is affected by the devaluation of the ruble and the epidemic.
"The cost of services is increasing," he said.
People are starting to spend more time on the internet because of the outbreak, "he said.
Marinichev did not rule out that annual Internet prices will rise seriously, arguing that operators can provide customers with higher speeds and more services to offset people's dissatisfaction with the price increase.
"The Chinese Doctor" prepares to pay tribute to the anti-epidemic hero - Xinhua
Recently, with the respect of Chinese filmmakers in the fight against the epidemic, Yu Dong, Chairman of Boehner Pictures Group, and Liu Weiqiang, Director (pictured left) held a talk and exchange with Academician Zhong Nanshan in Guangzhou on the filming and production of the anti-epidemic film "The Chinese Doctor".
Boehner Pictures hopes to use "The Chinese Doctor" to pay tribute to all the medical and epidemic prevention workers who are fighting on the front line of epidemic prevention and control!
In 2021, the film will be released nationwide as a tribute film to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.
At present, Boehner Pictures is organizing the original cast of the film "Captain China" to prepare the film "Doctor China" under the arrangement and deployment of the Ministry of Propaganda and the National Film Bureau, and with the support of the Guangdong Provincial Film Bureau and the Hubei Provincial Film Bureau. This is a film that reflects the unity of the people of the whole country in fighting the Xincrown Pneumonia epidemic under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee.
Focusing on the Wuhan anti-epidemic line, the film will take Wuhan medical staff and the provincial and municipal medical teams to help Hubei as the background. From the point of view of human nature, it will use unique narratives, as well as highly impactful camera language, to show the moving stories of Chinese medical staff full of dedication and sacrifice on the anti-epidemic line in a panoramic view.
It is understood that at the first time of the unsealing day of Wuhan, Boehner overcame many difficulties and sent a filming team to go deep into the front line of the epidemic to exchange understanding and collect information face to face with hundreds of medical workers. At present, it has interviewed a large number of valuable first-hand video materials, including Academician Zhong Nanshan himself, the first person from Guangzhou to Wuhan, the Guangdong medical team, as well as the white angels at the forefront of the anti-epidemic front, such as Wuhan Jintan Hospital, Wuhan Union Hospital and Wuhan Central Hospital.
At the symposium, Academician Zhong Nanshan also raised expectations and hopes for the filming of the film: "I am looking forward to it. I hope you will not only visit some experts who have made more public appearances, but also interview more medical personnel who have worked hard on the front line. They are the majority."
He said that he had seen "Me and My Motherland" and "Captain China" before and thought that the method of telling the story of the big pattern from the perspective of ordinary people was very good.
"At present, some foreign friends still have some misunderstandings about China."
When talking about the spread of the film, Academician Zhong Nanshan said that at present, some people abroad like to label the virus politicized. He hoped that the film would impress the audience from the point of view of human nature: "In addition to being shown in China, it is best for this film to be shown abroad. It is necessary to impress the audience with a true humanistic spirit in a way that audiences at home and abroad can understand."
Academician Zhong Nanshan also fondly recalled the 1980s film "Midlife". "After all these years, it was" Midlife "that impressed me most about the film after the reform and opening up. At that time, my foreign doctor friends saw and cried. If" The Chinese Doctor "could play such a role, it would be remarkable."
Academician Zhong Nanshan said that if "The Chinese Doctor" can resonate with foreign audiences, it will be very successful.
During the discussion and exchange, Academician Zhong Nanshan also shared his opinions and suggestions on the prevention and control of the current international epidemic. "I believe that people will always be smarter than viruses."
Academician Zhong Nanshan said that although the virus is difficult to predict, human beings have passed through many difficulties and risks since primitive society. Today, modern society has developed medical science, technology and social management measures. Together with the basic understanding of medical personnel and even the common people all over the world in responding to the Xincrown Pneumonia epidemic, people will no longer be as passive as before. "Next, we should pay attention to two aspects of work, one is to study how to strengthen cooperation in the world and the other is to pay attention to soothing people 's hearts and minds."

Cultural Travel "Red Fruit" Gathers in Shaoshan - Xiangtan First Red Fair - Highlights of the Day - Hunan Daily Network - Hua Sheng Online
Hunan Daily New Hunan client reporter Jiang Rui Correspondent Xiao Yan
Jiaxing Red Ship Mold, Shaoshan Mao Zedong Bronze Statue, Yan 'an Budui Flower Crafts, Xiangxi Yongshun Bacon... On July 25, the 2020 Hunan Red Tourism and Culture Festival opened in Shaoshan.
As one of the main activities, the first Red Cultural Industry Expo in Xiangtan was launched at the Shaoshan All-Region Tourism Advisory and Distribution Center.
The exhibition area is full of red creative products and local products in the old revolutionary areas, attracting tourists from all over the world to buy them.
"This Red Fair is not only a display of the achievements of the national red cultural industry, but also an important platform for exhibitors and enterprises to exchange experiences and explore development paths."
According to the relevant person in charge of the Executive Committee of the First Red Fair in Xiangtan, the theme of the Red Fair is "Promoting Red Culture to Promote the Warming of Cultural Travel". The total area of the exhibition is nearly 3,000 square meters. An atmosphere building area, a scenic area display exhibition area and a red cultural travel online games online shopping experience area have been set up.
Eight provincial cities, including Zhejiang Jiaxing, Guizhou Zunyi and Shaanxi Yan 'an, as well as 137 enterprises and units in Changsha, Zhuzhou, Yueyang and Chenzhou, our province, were invited to participate in the exhibition. A total of 768 exhibits were on display, including red cultural relics, handicrafts, food specialties, tourism routes, red training courses, red creative products, etc.
The exhibition and sales area will be on display until July 29.
As the host of the Red Fair, the Xiangtan Exhibition Area is full of bright spots.
The person in charge of the exhibition area introduced that the Xiangtan exhibition area is divided into two parts: Red industry and red cultural industry development.
The Red Industrial Exhibition Area displays 31 exhibits from six enterprises, including Hualing Xianggang, Hualing Cable and Xiang Electric Power, while the Red Cultural Industry Development Exhibition Area displays nearly 200 products from 27 units, including red series books, red series food and red series creative products.
In the Yan 'an exhibition area, many tourists are attracted by the cloth pile flower handicrafts and paper-cut works of art on display.
Ma Dongpo, Director of the Yan 'an Municipal Bureau of Culture and Tourism, introduced that the exhibition carefully selected the excellent red creative products of Yan' an in the past two years, 16 of which are the outstanding works of the 2019 national red creative products.
At the same time, they invited the inheritors of the national intangible cultural heritage protection project "Anse Paper-Cutting", "North Shaanxi Folk Song" and the provincial non-heritage project Yanchuan Budui Painting to focus on promoting the products of Yan 'an folklore characteristics, and took the opportunity to communicate with other enterprises in the exhibition area to promote cross-regional cooperation.
The cumulative number of confirmed cases in Xinguan, Japan, exceeds 30,000 - Xinhua
According to statistics, there were 239 new confirmed cases in Tokyo on the 26th, with more than 200 new cases in a single day for six consecutive days, with a cumulative total of 11,214 cases.
In addition, there were 141 new confirmed cases in Osaka prefecture, 90 new cases in Fukuoka prefecture and 80 new cases in Aichi prefecture.
Telecom network fraud crime rose by 70% in the first half of the year. Summary characteristics of the highest inspection -- ScienceDaily
On July 26, according to the Supreme Inspection website, in the first half of this year, procuratorial organs across the country prosecuted a total of 5,8101 fraud crimes, an increase of 35% year-on-year.
In particular, among crimes against epidemic prevention and control, fraud crimes are frequent, and the number of fraud crimes prosecuted by procuratorial organs accounts for 43.4 percent of the total number of crimes against epidemic prevention and control.
The Supreme People 's Procuratorate has carried out targeted guidance. Of the ten typical cases involving epidemic prevention and control that have been issued at present, a total of 9 have involved fraud crimes.
According to the handling of cases by procuratorial organs in the first half of the year, there are a wide variety of fraud crimes involved, ranging from the national macro policy to the food, clothing and housing of the common people, including epidemic fraud, "medical care" fraud, "health products" fraud, "enrollment intermediary" fraud, "routine loan" fraud, fraudulent state subsidy fraud, national asset thawing fraud, etc., which not only cause economic losses to victims, but also seriously affect economic and social development.
In particular, some telecom network frauds break through national borders, regions and personnel restrictions, and have the characteristics of crowd involvement, cross-border, remote and electronic payments. There are many unspecified victims and great harm.
For example, some have set up special companies, rent high-end office buildings, set up multiple departments or posts, use legitimate online platforms to publicize and recruit, train and evaluate recruiters, adopt enterprise operation model management, wear a "legal cloak" and be more beguiling.
It is incumbent upon the procuratorial organs to punish and prevent crimes in accordance with the law and issue early warning to the public and relevant departments in a timely manner.
In judicial cases, the procuratorial organs conscientiously perform their duties, not only insist on maintaining a high-pressure situation against fraud crimes, but also refine various law enforcement measures in a targeted manner, and promote social governance through the production and issuance of procuratorial recommendations.
The procuratorial organs strictly control the facts, evidence, procedures and application of the law in the arrest and prosecution of fraud cases, taking the facts as the basis and the law as the yardstick, so as to ensure that they are not wrong.
In particular, for the crime of telecom network fraud, we should pay attention to the central role of electronic data in the determination of facts, and strive to build a chain of evidence that corroborates each other between electronic data, verbal evidence and documentary evidence.
For example, in an epidemic fraud case handled by the Yinzhou District Procuratorate of Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, the procuratorial organ intervened in advance at the first time. It took only five days from the occurrence of the case to the conclusion of the case, reflecting the attitude and determination to handle it quickly and strictly and maintain the stability of the overall social situation.
In the process of examining arrest and examining prosecution, attention is paid to the prosecution of missed offenders in cases, correcting the omission of 733 people by the public security organs, and correcting the omission of 1,113 accomplices by the public security organs from the examination and prosecution.
In the first half of the year, procuratorial organs throughout the country issued 298 procuratorial recommendations against fraud crimes, promoting joint efforts to prevent fraud crimes and promoting deep governance.
For example, in response to the loopholes found in the supervision of telecommunications networks by communication enterprises, banks and intermediary organizations in the handling of cases, the Guangzhou Municipal Procuratorate of Guangdong Province and the Dongguan Municipal Procuratorate promptly put forward procuratorial recommendations, urging relevant units to strengthen supervision, improve mechanisms and promote the construction of a long-term system.
Fourth, we should make every effort to do a good job in the recovery and recovery of stolen goods.
Local procuratorial organs have seized on important links such as intervening in investigation and guiding evidence collection, examining and prosecuting, urged the investigating authorities to actively recover stolen money, cooperate with the relevant departments to do a good job in recovering stolen goods and recovering losses, and strive to minimize the economic losses caused by fraud crimes to the people.
For example, the Lin Mou routine loan case handled by the Beijing Municipal Procuratorate involved 22 properties waiting to be sealed up. In the case that the property may be disposed of first by other cases, the first "Suspension Letter" was issued and served on the relevant court in a timely manner. It was recommended that the previous seizure court suspend the execution of the property involved and dispose of it uniformly after the facts of the crime have been ascertained, so as to make its best efforts to recover the property involved and recover the losses of the victims.
The prosecutor reminded everyone to be highly vigilant against fraud crimes, not to expect "pie in the sky", nor to be credulous if you think it is cheap, and to keep your "pocketbook" well.
Astana Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province: Short apple trees widen the road to poverty eradication -- ScienceDaily

In the heat and heat, a reporter from the Economic Daily - China Economic Network walked into Zhonghai Village, Astana Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province.
Against the scorching sun, villager Li Yuanzhong weeded in the base. Although his face was red, he hummed a few ditties in his mouth from time to time.
Weining County, where Astana Town is located, has not been able to sell at a good price and has not been able to form an industrial scale because of its low latitude and high altitude, abundant light and large temperature difference between day and night. The apples produced have high sugar content and good taste. They have a certain reputation in the surrounding area. However, because of their small size and many spots, they have not been able to sell at a good price and have not been able to form an industrial scale.
Astana Town was once a poor township with "Baogu potato for spring and autumn". Ten years ago, the incidence of poverty in the area was as high as 25.8 percent.
In the critical period when the fight against poverty enters a decisive battle, it is urgent to change traditional planting habits, adjust the industrial structure and increase farmers' income.
Chen Chao, party secretary of Astana Town, and a group of people in the town believed after many visits that industrial development could no longer follow the old path.
To this end, the town of Astana has introduced leading enterprises and grown apples in a modern way.
Hou Jianwen, deputy general manager of Weining Beyond Agriculture Co., Ltd. came to Astana Town from Shaanxi Province in 2015 to investigate and saw the local planting conditions at a glance. Since 2016, he has been planting apple trees in the area.
At first, the village mobilized Li Yuanzhong to transfer the land to plant apple trees. Li Yuanzhong and his wife muttered to themselves, "After planting apples for so many years, they did not see who in the village made a fortune growing apples."
"The apples planted are dwarfed apples and will not make the apple tree grow too high."
To Li Yuanzhong 's surprise, a new method was adopted for apple cultivation this time. Irrigation pipes were spread under each apple tree, and water and fertilizer were poured to the roots together. When the fruit was harvested in autumn, the tractor drove directly into the orchard and could pick the fruit standing.
At present, the Apple base has gradually entered a period of high production, and the market is as expected by Hou Jianwen. Apple is not worried about selling and is popular with consumers in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other cities.
The growing apple industry has brought new changes to Li Yuanzhong 's life. Although he is still farming, he has a new source of income.
Li Yuanzhong 's family has more than nine acres of land transferred to the Apple base. In addition to the guaranteed land transfer fee, there are profit dividends after hanging fruit each year. The couple usually work in the base. "One person gets 80 yuan a day and has work all year round."
Li Yuanzhong told reporters that last year, he received more than 2,800 yuan in profit dividends. Together with the land transfer fee and the labor income of the couple, the family earned more than 80,000 yuan. "There is no worry about food and clothing, and a well-off life has been lived."
"At present, results have begun to be achieved. The annual output value of one acre of apples exceeds 15,000 yuan, about 10 times that of growing corn."
Chen Chao told reporters that 20,000 mu of apples have been planted in the whole town of Astana, with 6,000 mu in Zhonghai Village alone, covering 4,056 households and 172,000 farmers, including 656 poor households and 2,952 people who have built file cards, with wages of more than 6 million yuan a year. The base has truly been built on their doorstep and there is no need to go out to work.
Li Yuanzhong, whose pockets are bulging day by day, also began to realize his "wish".
This Lunar New Year, Li Yuanzhong bought an SUV and now drives to and from work every day. "There are still more than a dozen acres of land in the family. When the next step is to expand the scale of the Apple base and transfer it all to them, the income will be more."

Membrane separation technology helps crack the "greenhouse effect" -- ScienceDaily
Membrane separation technology helps crack the "greenhouse effect"
A schematic diagram of the new mixed matrix film preparation technology
Shang Rui, a reporter for this newspaper, reported that a few days ago, the atmospheric environment and bioenergy team of Tianjin University made significant progress in the "membrane separation method to capture carbon dioxide", and successfully developed a new mixed matrix film preparation technology, greatly improving the carbon dioxide capture performance of membrane materials.
The relevant results have been published as a cover article of the international journal Greenhouse Gases: Science and Technology.
The "greenhouse effect" is a major environmental problem that perplexes human development, while carbon dioxide emissions are the culprit of the "greenhouse effect".
How to efficiently capture and utilize the carbon dioxide emitted by humans is the focus of scientists' attention.
The "membrane separation method" is a new carbon dioxide capture technology. It separates carbon dioxide gas with the help of membrane materials, which has the characteristics of high efficiency, energy conservation and simple operation.
How to make membrane materials "breathe deeply" and improve the efficiency of gas separation is the bottleneck difficulty of using membrane separation method to capture and collect carbon dioxide.
The research team of Tianjin University innovated its ideas and explored the influence of different solvents on the separation performance of membrane gas through repeated experiments.
The experimental results show that the carbon nanotubes in the resulting membrane materials are more evenly distributed and "more breathable" using N-methylpyroclone as a preparation solvent, effectively improving the gas separation efficiency and rate of the membrane materials.
The carbon dioxide separation performance of mixed matrix membranes prepared with this new technology is close to the current theoretical separation upper limit of such membrane materials.
"The new technology provides a new idea for the membrane separation method to capture and collect carbon dioxide."
Li Run, a member of Tianjin University's atmospheric environment and bioenergy team, said: "We hope that this technology can provide strong support for the treatment of flue gas by coal-fired power plants and chemical enterprises in the future, and play a major role in controlling greenhouse gas emissions and other areas."
Understand what professional grade difference is before volunteering to fill in -- ScienceDaily
2020-07-27 02: 22: 36 Source: Chongqing Morning Post Author: Yu Xiao Responsible Editor: Yu Xiao
Understand what professional grade difference is before volunteering to fill in
Every year, students or parents volunteer for the college entrance examination because they do not understand the nouns involved in the voluntary filing, which in turn affects the voluntary filing.
This year, five universities, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing University of Science and Technology, Beijing University of posts and Telecommunications, Beijing Forestry University and Beijing University of Chemical Technology, jointly issued admission policies for 2020, eliminating professional grade differences.
What does professional grade difference mean and what is the significance in voluntary filing?
There are three ways to allocate professional rules.
Experts reminded that before filling in the volunteer, it is important to read the Admissions Charter of the desired school in detail and understand the admission rules of colleges and universities, including the transfer ratio, the professional allocation rules, etc.
The rules for the allocation of specialties mean that after the transfer of grades in colleges and universities, there are three main ways for the admission of majors: Professional priority, grade priority and professional grade difference.
The specific method used by colleges and universities will be made clear in the Admissions Charter.
However, there are also some colleges and universities whose admission principle is that the total score is preferred, and there is no grade difference between majors.
That is to say, candidates within the scope of admission will be queued according to the total score. When the score does not reach the voluntary admission score line for the first major, it depends on whether the voluntary admission score line for the second major has been reached, and so on until the last professional volunteer is admitted. There is no grade difference between the volunteers for each major.
The so-called "professional grade difference" means that when arranging candidates' majors, institutions determine the admission majors of volunteer candidates for different specialties according to one or more score values published in the admission charter. This score value is the "professional grade difference".
That is, the difference between the scores of institutions when admitting candidates to volunteer for the first major and non-volunteer for the first major, and the grade difference between volunteers for each major, such as 3, 2 and 1, etc.
For example.
It is assumed that Xiaoming, a student, applied for the examination of A colleges and universities and scored 560 points. His professional volunteers are: Computer, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering and e-commerce. The professional admission of A colleges and universities is based on the method of professional grade difference, which is divided into 2, 1, 1 and 0 points.
In the professional allocation, if Xiaoming 's first major volunteer meets the professional admission requirements and his major has a planned balance, Xiaoming will be admitted to the "computer" major. If the computer is not accepted, his score will be subtracted by 2 points. According to the 558 score, he will be ranked with the candidates who volunteered for the "international trade" examination in the first major to determine whether he meets the professional admission conditions. If he still cannot meet the professional admission requirements, the score will be subtracted by 1 point (i.e. 557 points) for the subsequent major.
Different universities have different professional grade differences.
With the popularization of parallel volunteering, many colleges and universities have now eliminated professional grade differences, but some colleges and universities have still retained this method this year. According to the Admissions Charter published by each university, more than 20 universities have set up professional grade differences this year.
For example, Sichuan Agricultural University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Jiangxi Normal University, Chengdu Medical College, Northeast Electric Power University, Jimei University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing University of Technology, Ningxia University, Shandong University of Technology, China Civil Aviation Flight Institute, etc.
In these colleges and universities, the professional grade difference set up by each university is different.
Some colleges and universities have grade differences in each major. For example, Ningxia University, candidates whose files have been submitted to the university will be admitted in order of scores after being reduced by one point in the order in which candidates fill in professional volunteers.
And some universities have set up different professional grade differences between different specialties.
For example, Jimei University, the total score of professional volunteer grade difference is 4 points, that is, the difference between first professional volunteer and other professional volunteer is 3 points, there is no grade difference between other professional volunteer, which is considered parallel volunteer, and the professional grade difference between other professional volunteer and transfer professional volunteer is 1 point.
When volunteering, candidates and parents must carefully read the admission policy of the reported school to see if there is any professional grade difference and what is the form of the grade difference. While taking full account of the score, they should also rationally analyze the proposed school and major. If the institution explicitly adopts the grade difference method in the admission charter, candidates should pay attention to the gradient between the various specialties and improve the admission chance when choosing the major.

The first Atlantic hurricane of the year made landfall in Texas, which was hit hard by the outbreak.
The National Hurricane Center of the United States announced that morning that Hurricane Hanna reached 145 km / h and is expected to cause heavy rainfall to southern Texas and northeastern Mexico until next Monday, which in turn will cause rapid flooding.
At present, customs have weakened as they gradually advance to land. Although there are local power outages, there are no immediate reports of casualties.
Some local officials in Texas are preparing for tornadoes that are most likely along the coast.
President Donald Trump tweeted that the office is closely monitoring the dynamics of Hurricane Hanna and Hurricane Douglas in Hawaii, and called on the public to listen to the emergency management information of the local government and protect families and property.
At the same time, the new crown epidemic in Texas is also deteriorating sharply, with the number of infections soaring, with a cumulative total of more than 390,000 confirmed infections and more than 5,000 deaths.
When this hurricane hits, the government will face the dual problem of sheltering the homeless while preventing the epidemic from worsening again.

Belgian 3-year-old girl dies of new crown virus infection - Xinhua
The Belgian health department said on the 24th that a 3-year-old girl died of new crown virus infection, making her the youngest new crown patient in the country.
Belgian health department spokesman Budwin Katri said the girl had other serious diseases before she was infected with the new crown virus. In addition to the girl, an 18-year-old man recently died of the new crown virus infection.
Katri said that 85 percent of the new crown diagnoses in Belgium last week were under the age of 60.
He warned people in good health and younger age not to take it lightly.
"Although it is relatively rare for young people to die of new crown virus infection, no one is now immune."
Last week, the number of new confirmed cases of the new crown in Belgium increased by 89% over the previous week, with an average of 2.9 people dying of the new crown virus infection per day, up from the daily average of 1.7 the previous week.
During the peak of the epidemic in Europe, the proportion of people infected with the new crown virus among the Belgian population was "among the highest" in Europe.
Belgium has a population of more than 11 million.
The latest data show that a total of 64,847 people in Belgium have been infected with the new crown virus.
Katri warned earlier this week that people must take action before the snowball rolls larger and larger, eventually causing an "avalanche".
In order to curb the rebound of the epidemic, Belgian Prime Minister Sophie Wilmes announced on the 23rd that the relevant regulations on people wearing masks in public places will be stricter, and the implementation of the plan to further lift restrictive measures in August will also be suspended.

Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development of the Hong Kong SAR Government, Qiu Tenghua, said on July 25 that all APEC member economies should act in unison to jointly fight the epidemic and promote economic recovery, and should avoid establishing unnecessary trade barriers in accordance with the rights and obligations stipulated by the World Trade Organization.
Qiu Tenghua made the remarks when he participated in the video conference of trade ministers fighting the Xincrown Pneumonia epidemic held by APEC on the 25th.
During the meeting, the participating ministers exchanged views on the substantive plans that APEC can take to deal with the impact of the new crown pneumonia epidemic and promote the economic recovery of the region.
Qiu Tenghua said that the public health and economic crisis triggered by the epidemic has had an unprecedented and far-reaching impact on society and economy.
"We are in a double battle. We must first overcome the epidemic before we can save the economy.
We must have a clear goal. The virus is our common enemy. Only by working together can we win. On the contrary, we will only fail. "
Qiu Tenghua said that the series of trade restrictions caused by the Xinguan pneumonia outbreak have not helped to control the outbreak.
Trade is a key solution to the current problem and should not be regarded as the problem.
He condemned all discriminatory and divisive policy measures and urged all economies to keep their borders open at this critical moment, maintain the smooth operation of supply chains, avoid erecting trade barriers or adopting irrational trade policies.

Chengdu people pile up to watch the US Consulate Police stop people from 'looking too happy'
In response to the closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston by the United States, China announced the closure of the United States Consulate General in Chengdu on Friday.
On Saturday, the badge of the US Consulate was removed, and on Sunday, a dark-glass car drove away from the Consulate amid boos from passers-by.
On Sunday, many Chengdu people piled up in front of the US Consulate to take photos. Those who had not come also came to see it driven by curiosity about current affairs.
A reporter from Chengdu Station of AFP also went to the vicinity of the US Consulate in Chengdu to observe it. He sent back the news that there was a steady stream of people. There were also many parents who brought their children to take a walk to watch the consulate, take pictures of the building or take selfies.
The consulate was surrounded by guards, and the police occasionally "corrected" the behavior of people. They did not seem to allow any outrageous behavior to appear: A woman was stopped just beginning to prepare to sing a red song, and a guard confiscated a banner.
But residents of a nearby residential building successfully pulled up a giant Chinese flag on their balcony and shouted slogans in support of China.
The Chengdu American Consulate was opened in 1985 and covers all consular related affairs of the United States in southwestern China, especially the Tibet Autonomous Region.
A reporter from Chengdu Station of AFP said that the Chinese government's response to the United States has been relatively restrained: Many Chinese have asked the government to close the United States Consulate in Hong Kong online, but officials have only said that "the closure of the Chengdu American Consulate is a necessary and legal response to the unreasonable behavior of the United States".
At present, in addition to Chengdu, the United States also has consulates in Guangdong, Shanghai, Shenyang, Wuhan and Hong Kong in China.

At present, the Dongchuan District of Kunming City is already hot in summer, and what is hotter than the weather is the poverty alleviation workshop next to the relocation and resettlement site.
Lu Ling, an employee of Kunming Aisford Electronics Technology Company, said, "Now, as soon as you leave your home, you enter the factory door and make money to take care of your family, thanks to the free vocational skills training of the trade union organization."
Walking into the poverty alleviation workshop for the processing of electronic components in Tongdu Street, Dongchuan District, a busy picture of the heat came into view.
Lu Ling, who is in her 40s, is a single mother with children alone and has to take care of her elderly parents.
In her most difficult time, the Dongchuan District General Trade Union helped come up with ideas and ways to "give relief in the snow" after being busy before running.
Since 2018, Lu Ling has enjoyed assistance policies such as housing, schooling, social security and employment, as well as assistance funds issued by trade unions at all levels.
This year, her children have successfully graduated and taken up employment. She herself has a job and income after taking part in skills training. She got out of trouble at the end of April.
It is reported that the Dongchuan District General Organization is a special skills training project to help fight poverty, which is part of the skills training work of the Yunnan Provincial General Trade Union.
In the light of the characteristics of the workers in difficulty in the relocation and resettlement sites for poverty alleviation in the district, the district has conducted an in-depth investigation to understand the training needs and determine the training types. In the near future, it plans to train a total of 450 electricians, welders and noodle artists.
Recently, Li Yi, an employee of the Yunnan Menglian County branch of the Agricultural Bank, wrote a sincere thank-you letter to the county general trade union.
In her letter, she sincerely thanked her for the golden autumn student aid given to her by the union between August 2013 and January 2017, which helped her complete her studies.
In 2004, Li Yi 's father died in a car accident, and her mother was included in the file of workers in difficulty. Since then, she has been enjoying the care of the file card construction policy.
With the help of the local trade union, Li Yi successfully completed her studies.
Since 2016, 3809 households have been released from poverty through institutional guarantees and precise assistance.
The successful relief of the Lu Ling family and Li Yi is a microcosm of the Yunnan trade union 's promotion of the relief and relief work of workers in difficulty.
According to Duan Kaiyuan, a staff member of the Law and Rights Protection Work Department of the Yunnan General Trade Union, the province has always strengthened the dynamic management of the files of workers in difficulty, promoted the normalization of the filing work, and promptly included the assistance system for workers in difficulty who meet the conditions for filing. Broaden the application channels for workers in difficulty and use WeChat to open an online filing service platform for workers in difficulty to declare on their own initiative in a timely manner.
During the epidemic period, it was difficult to go out to work. In order to help the workers in difficulty ease the living pressure, Yunnan Province has allocated more than 13 million yuan in warm funds. In accordance with the standard of 2,000 yuan per family for the workers in difficulty at the national level and 1,500 yuan per family for the workers in difficulty at the provincial level, special warm condolence activities have been carried out for more than 6,000 families at the national level and more than 1,000 workers in difficulty at the provincial level.
At the same time, the provincial general has docked with various Internet recruitment platforms, such as the human society department and Zhilian recruitment, to push recruitment information to workers in difficulty, and to provide employment consultation, employment guidance and other services.
