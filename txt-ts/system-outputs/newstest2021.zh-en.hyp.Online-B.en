Talents are the key to rural revitalization.
Where to find talents?
Outstanding returning migrant workers are an indispensable force.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 26th. Topic: Turn outstanding returning migrant workers into a new force for rural revitalization
Zhang Xiong, 34, lives in Guoyuan Village, Meishan City, Sichuan. In 2010, he quit his job in Beijing with a monthly salary of tens of thousands and returned to his hometown to start a business.
After several years of hard work, the annual income of his grape-growing family farm now exceeds one million yuan. He has become a well-known leader in getting rich. He has also been selected to join the village's "two committees" team.
In recent years, inspired by a series of policies to support agriculture and benefit agriculture, such as national poverty alleviation and rural revitalization, more and more outstanding migrant workers like Zhang Xiong have chosen to return to their hometowns to start their own businesses, which has activated a pool of spring water in the countryside.
Sichuan, a province with a large population in western my country and a large labor exporting province, has implemented the "Excellent Migrant Workers Recruitment Training Project" according to the situation. In 2019 alone, more than 8,000 village party branch secretaries were generated from the outstanding migrant workers to cultivate village reserve forces. There are 61,000 members and more than 20,000 party members will be recruited to provide a strong guarantee for winning the battle against poverty and implementing the strategy of rural revitalization.
Whether or not a well-off society is well-off, the key depends on the fellow villagers.
Since the reform and opening up, a large number of young and middle-aged laborers in rural my country have gone out to work to increase their income, and some have established their own enterprises through hard work.
However, objectively it has also led to the emergence of "hollowing" to varying degrees in rural areas, especially the weakening of rural grassroots organizations. The village party branch secretaries and party members all show the characteristics of "one old and one low", that is, aging, low education, and the village party The team leader is not strong, and the problem of non-compliance is prominent.
If rural talents and other factors have been flowing unidirectionally to the cities, and the rural areas have been in a state of "blood loss" and "anemia" for a long time, revitalization is empty talk.
Attracting back those migrant workers who are capable, conscious, and aspiring to serve their hometowns, guide them to return to their hometowns to start businesses and become wealthy leaders, and select the best to train them into party members and rural cadres, and enrich the grassroots cadre team. This is to solve the problem of rural party members. A permanent solution that is not in contact with the grassroots party organizations.
Excellent migrant workers can be attracted back, but they must be retained and done well.
In recent years, Sichuan has begun to pay close attention to the party building of migrant workers. On the basis of strict selection criteria, it has established systems and mechanisms for outstanding migrant workers’ directional referral, service guarantee, training and promotion, selection and use, etc., so that they can improve their abilities and work. There is a guarantee of security, a hope in life, a real root in the countryside, and a sense of accomplishment in starting a business.
This year is the final year of the decisive battle against poverty. To make the connection between poverty alleviation and rural revitalization, talents are the key factor.
Party committees and governments at all levels should attach great importance to the group of outstanding returning rural migrant workers, and through comprehensive measures, build them into a team and a new force that can be retained, fight, and cannot be taken away, so as to provide the rural areas with poverty alleviation and prosperity and development and revitalization. Strong organizational guarantee and talent support.
Due to the epidemic, this year’s college graduates are very special. On the evening of July 11, the bilibili summer graduation song will bring a special online live show for the graduates, Lao Lang, Pu Shu, Li Yuchun, Mao Buyi Waiting for musicians to send singing and blessings to recent graduates.
Well-known up host SealWu Wu Yifan also brought a song "Weeds", which is a rap song based on Lu Xun's prose poems of the same name, which is extremely popular among young people.
Due to the epidemic situation, many graduates failed to appreciate the ritual sense of setting ears and awarding degree certificates, so they transferred the sense of ritual to the online.
Statistics show that the peak live broadcast popularity of this 2.5-hour song will exceed 35 million.
"Follow your own heart, seize the opportunity and ignore the consequences, sometimes you will have unexpected gains."
Although it was a graduation song, many songs also moved non-graduates.
"I really want to cry after watching the whole show. Everyone's youth is full of beauty and regrets, but they are all worth remembering, and we must go on bravely.
Beijing's natural ecology continues to improve, attracting more than 500 species of wild animals to "settle" in the city-Chinanews.com

The capital's natural ecology continues to improve, attracting wild animals to settle in the city
More than 500 species of wild animals in Beijing
News from our newspaper (Reporter Wang Bin) A reporter from the Beijing Youth Daily learned from the Municipal Landscaping Bureau that in recent years, as the capital's natural ecological environment continues to improve, the types and numbers of wild animals have also continued to increase.
At present, the number of terrestrial spine wild animals inhabiting Beijing has increased to more than 500 species, including national first-class protected animals such as brown horse chicken and black stork, as well as national second-class protected animals such as goral, whooper swan, gray crane and mandarin duck.
Whether it is planted into the urban forests in the second ring road or the small wetlands embedded in the buildings, it not only brings the wildness of nature to the citizens of the capital, but also attracts wild animals to "settle" in the city.
In the midsummer season, the Songshan National Nature Reserve, located in the Yanshan Mountains in the northwest of Yanqing District, is full of vitality.
A raccoon is playing leisurely by the mountain stream, and two badgers are fighting each other.
Looking back, a wild boar couldn't help but scratching his body and was rubbing hard against the bark. According to Hu Qiaoli, Director of the Management Office of Songshan National Nature Reserve, as of the end of 2019, in this green sea with a total area of more than 6,200 hectares, there are living in this green sea, including the national first-class protected animal golden eagle and the national second-class protected animal spoon chicken and goral. Of the 178 species of wild animals in the city, nearly one-third of the city’s wild animal species can be seen here.
"In Songshan, wild animals are the real'owners', and our staff can only be regarded as people's'bodyguards' at best."
Hu Qiaoli said that in order to understand the situation of wild animals and plants in the reserve, more than 30 professional patrol team members will patrol along 16 carefully formulated protection routes every day. I walked almost the entire reserve in a whole day.
"During inspections, not only check and record the biodiversity, but also check the installation of artificial bird nests, rescue injured wild animals, install field infrared cameras and so on."
More than 200 infrared cameras have been installed in Songshan National Nature Reserve to record the living conditions of wild animals in the forest.
Hu Qiaoli introduced that with the continuous enrichment of biodiversity in the reserve in recent years, more and more wild animals have appeared in the lens. Ocelots, raccoon dogs and pig badgers have become "resident guests" and the national second-level protected animals goral. The "appearance rate" is also getting higher.
Zhang Zhiming, director of the Wildlife and Wetland Protection Division of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Landscaping, introduced that the number of terrestrial spine wild animals in Beijing has increased from 461 species in 1994 to more than 500 now. The types and numbers of wild animals in Beijing have continued to increase in recent years. .
The appearance of wild animals in cities has become more common, which is closely related to the continuous upgrade of the capital city's greening in recent years.
In particular, the new round of afforestation and greening construction of one million acres started in 2018, which proposes to reshape the urban ecological environment, enhance the ecological function of woodland and green space, and highlight the concept of "near nature".
In the planning, we strive to achieve interconnection and interaction with the surrounding green space, so that wild animals can "visit relatives and friends". The trees planted are also the honey and food plants that animals love.
I am committed to helping computers communicate with the world around us.
There are many ways to do this, and I like to focus on helping computers talk about what they see and understand.
Given this situation, a modern computer vision algorithm can tell you that there is a woman and a dog.
It can tell you that the woman is smiling.
It can even tell you that this dog is very cute.
I deal with this problem and think about how human beings understand and coexist with the world.
Those thoughts, memories and stories in such scenes may arouse human attention.
The interrelationship of all connected situations.
Maybe you have seen such a dog before, or you have spent time running on such a beach, and further evoke the memories and thoughts of past vacations. When you went to the beach before, you spent time running around with other dogs. time.
One of my guiding principles is to help the computer understand what kind of experience it is, so as to understand the common points of what we believe and feel. Then we have the ability to begin to develop computer technology continuously to complement our experience. the way.
So, to dig deeper into this point, I started working on helping computers produce human-like stories from image sequences a few years ago.
So, one day, when I was working on a computer, I asked it about its views on the trip to Australia.
It looked at the picture and saw a koala.
It doesn't know what a koala is, but the computer says it thinks koalas look like very interesting creatures.
Then I shared a series of images of burned houses with the computer.
The computer looked at the picture, and it said, "This is an amazing view! This is spectacular!"
It makes my spine chill.
The computer saw a terrible, life-changing and life-destroying event and thought it was a positive thing.
I realized that the computer recognizes the contrast between red and yellow, and thinks this is something worthy of positive comments.
Part of the reason is because most of what I enter into the computer is positive images.
That's because people tend to share positive images when they talk about their experiences.
When was the last time you saw a selfie at a funeral?
I realized that in the process of improving artificial intelligence, it is task to task and data set to data set. In the understanding of computers, huge gaps, defects and blind spots are created.
While doing this, I am coding for various prejudices.
Prejudice reflects limited opinions and originates from a data set that reflects the same humans, such as prejudices and stereotypes.
I think back to the development of that technology that brought me to where I was that day-the first color image was calibrated for the skin color of a white woman, which meant that color photography was biased against dark faces.
And the same deviation, that blind spot continued to be brought into the 90s.
Even today, the same blind spot still exists in how to recognize the faces of different people in the application of facial recognition technology.
In today's research, I think of the most advanced technologies, and tend to limit our ideas to one data set and one problem.
And in doing so, we are creating more blind spots and prejudices, which will be further amplified when using artificial intelligence.
At that time I realized that we must think deeply about how we invent and create technology today will be viewed in five to ten years.
In the interaction between humans and the environment, humans use time to correct problems, so evolution is slow.
In contrast, artificial intelligence is developing at an incredible speed.
This means that it is really important, and we have to consider this carefully now-reflect on our blind spots and prejudices, and consider how these prejudices affect the technology we create now, and discuss today's technology and what it means for the future.
CEOs and scientists have weighed their ideas about the future development of artificial intelligence.
Stephen Hawking warned: "Artificial intelligence will destroy mankind."
Elon Musk warned that this is an existential risk, and it is also one of the biggest risks we face as a civilized society.
Bill Gates pointed out: "I don't understand why people are not more worried about artificial intelligence."
But these views-are only part of the story.
The mathematics, models, and the basic components of artificial intelligence are all that we can obtain and use.
We have open source code tools to the public to learn machines, and at the same time make our own contributions.
In addition, we can also share our experience.
We can share in terms of technology and its relationship with us, and what makes us happy.
We can discuss what we love.
We can communicate with the foreseeable future, which may be more beneficial in terms of technology, or over time, more problems may arise.
If we are all focused on opening up discussions about artificial intelligence and looking to the future, this will help create a regular dialogue and awareness, what is artificial intelligence? What can it be? And all the things we need to do to achieve the results that are best for us.
We have seen and understood this in the technology used today.
We use smartphones, digital assistants and automatic vacuum cleaners.
Are they evil?
Maybe sometimes.
Are they beneficial?
Yes, so are they.
They are not exactly the same.
There you have seen the light of the future.
The future will continue to start with what we build and create now.
We started the domino effect, which opened the evolutionary path of artificial intelligence
In our time, shaping the artificial intelligence of tomorrow.
Let us be immersed in the augmented reality technology to bring the past world back to life,
When people have difficulty communicating, technology helps them share their experiences with each other.
Technology built on online visual media can be used in auto-driving cars.
Technology produces language based on the understanding of images, which can evolve into a technology that assists the visually impaired, helping them to better own the visual world.
We have also seen how technology can cause some problems.
We have technology today to analyze the physical characteristics of our birth-such as the color of our skin or the expression on our face to determine whether we are criminals or terrorists.
We have the technology to process data, process data about gender or race, to determine whether we can get a loan.
Everything we see now is just a snapshot of the evolution of artificial intelligence.
Because where we are now is a moment in the evolution.
This means that what we do now will affect the future development of things and extend to the future world.
If we want artificial intelligence to help humans evolve, we need to determine strategies and goals, and immediately open that path.
What I want to see is the development direction of culture and environment suitable for human beings.
Technology can help us cure patients with neurological diseases or other disabilities, making them the same as everyone, making life equally challenging.
The operation of technology does not consider your characteristics or skin color.
What I am focusing on today is the technology of tomorrow and ten years from now,
Artificial intelligence can appear in many different ways.
But in this case, it is not a driverless car without any destination.
This is a car that we can drive at the same time.
We choose when to accelerate and when to decelerate.
We choose whether we need to turn.
We choose what the future artificial intelligence will be.
There will be a vast arena. Allow artificial intelligence to be everything.
It will become a lot of different things.
It is now up to us to figure out what needs to be implemented to ensure that the results of artificial intelligence will be better for all humans.
Thank you.

Black soil "plants" agricultural modernization-Xinhua Net
Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 26, report title: Black soil "plants" agricultural modernization
In midsummer, two spraying planes passed by the 10,000-mu high-yield demonstration field in the second operation station of the fifth management zone of Youyi Farm, forming two white lines. The green field was planted with black rice seedlings as the "first in the world" A few big characters are particularly eye-catching.
Kong Lingqiang, head of the operation station, said that this kind of aircraft can spray chemicals on more than 6,000 acres of cultivated land a day, and the efficiency is about 8 times that of drones and hundreds of times that of manpower.
This farm is located in Youyi County, Heilongjiang Province, my country's largest grain-producing province. From the sound of rice cutting in the past to the sound of rumbling motors in the past, traditional Chinese farming and farms have been transformed on this black soil belt.
In addition to airplanes, satellites are also used in the modern agricultural production of Friendship Farm.
Kong Lingqiang introduced that on the one hand, they use satellite remote sensing technology to achieve precise fertilization, reduce agricultural input and reduce pollution; on the other hand, satellite navigation technology can improve the level of standardized farm machinery field operations.
In this year’s rice production process, the farm expanded the operating area of the satellite-navigation unmanned rice transplanting technology from 3,000 acres last year to 30,000 acres.
This technology makes the planting of seedlings more uniform, maximizes the use of sunlight and arable land resources, and saves 16 yuan in labor costs per mu.
The farm tried new technologies such as informatization and intelligence in agricultural production, forming the largest agricultural machinery group in my country from the ground to the sky.
According to statistics, the total number of agricultural machinery in the farm is 49,000 units (pieces), and the comprehensive mechanization rate in the field reaches 99.8%.
Agricultural machinery operations achieve 100% GPS satellite navigation, 100% precision seeding in dry fields, and 100% high-horsepower locomotive operations in dry fields.
"Green agriculture, smart agriculture, and digital agriculture are the path-finding directions for agricultural modernization."
Said Liu Hualian, director of the Friendship Farm.
The key to agricultural modernization lies in scientific and technological progress.
In recent years, Heilongjiang Agricultural Reclamation, represented by farms, has played a role in the demonstration and leading role of modern large-scale agricultural "aircraft carrier", and has initially established a modern agricultural industrial system led by large-scale planting, standardized production, and industrialized management.
In the suburbs of Youyi County, there is an Agricultural Machinery Expo Park covering an area of 350,000 square meters.
More than 140 agricultural machinery and tools introduced and used by Heilongjiang Nongken over the years are exhibited here.
These agricultural machinery and farms have witnessed the development of my country's agricultural modernization.
Home for everyone-the transfer of the masses in Jiangkouhe Lianwei, Hefei, Anhui Province-Xinhuanet.com
Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, July 26th. Title: Homecoming for everyone-the transfer of the masses in the Jiangkouhe Lianwei, Hefei, Anhui Province
Xinhua News Agency reporters Chen Shangying, Wang Liwu, Liu Xiacun
At around 4 pm on July 25, Fu Kunbao wore muddy rubber shoes and was busy packing things back and forth with his wife Zhou Yan from the front room to the back room.
"After receiving a call from the village cadre to transfer, I was still stalking the grass in the field."
Fu Kunbao said that he has transferred more than 60 acres of land and planted rice, and he is now growing well. "I took the medicine yesterday, and I haven't cleaned up all the tools."
Fu Kunbao pointed to the pesticide sprayer placed in the corner, "No one wants their home to be flooded, let's leave a small home for everyone."
In order to cope with the continued high water pressure and possible heavy rainfall in Chaohu Lake, Hefei, Anhui Province, plans to use the Jiangkouhe Lianwei flood diversion storage facility where Fu Kunbao's family is located on the 26th.
Jiangkouhe Lianwei is located in Feixi County, next to the Chaohu Dike.
There are thousands of villagers involved in Yandian Township and Sanhe Township who need to be transferred.
As of 16:00 on the 25th, the water level of Chaohu Lake, my country's fifth largest freshwater lake, remained at a high level of 13.2 meters, 0.7 meters above the guaranteed water level.
The kitchen in Fu Kunbao's house is clean and tidy. There is a pot of pumpkin head vegetables on the table, and there are eggs and some stewed vegetables in the refrigerator.
"I didn't expect to move, the water in Jiangkou River looks good at the moment."
Zhou Yan said that the house is a bungalow, and I haven't decided where to put some large objects.
"Clean up your valuables first. Large items such as refrigerators and TV sets can be temporarily placed in neighbors or relatives on high ground."
Village leader Wang Liwen gave Fu Kunbao an idea.
Wang Liwen was responsible for the transfer and resettlement of 13 villagers, and notified each household to confirm the resettlement plan for each person.
The nearest resettlement site to Fu Kunbao’s home is Su Xiao Primary School in Yandian Township, about 2 kilometers away.
In addition to the big items, the more than 1,000 catties of grain and some newly bought furniture were also a headache for Fu Kunbao and his wife.
"The food is going to be dragged to the relative's house, and the furniture cannot be moved.
The couple negotiated, put a stool under the newly bought bed, and raised the bed by about half a meter.
At 6 o'clock in the afternoon, Fu Kunbao began to use a tricycle to transport things to his relatives, and Zhou Yan continued to clean up at home.
After 11 o'clock in the evening, the couple looked around at home, turned on the switch, and prepared to go to the resettlement site.
"I hope the water will withdraw soon."
Fu Kunbao said.
At 9:30 a.m. on July 26, the reporter saw at the Jiangkouhe Lianwei site that the local area had made various preparations before flood diversion.
Zhang Jikelin Xiaozhai team up to support muscular teenagers-Xinhua English.news.cn
Sports youth hot-blooded competition show "Sports Boys" officially landed on Hunan Satellite TV on July 11.
Sports leader Zhang Jike and sports assistant Lin Xiaozhai cross-border on the same stage, Lin Dan and Fu Yuanhui commented on their own styles, and the hard core of the "colossal" force pulling device makes the show more "burning".
In the first episode, 11 athletic teenagers appeared on the power track, and their appearance was amazing to the audience. At the same time, the "strong conflict", "strong confrontation" and "strong heart" on the arena also attracted attention.
Among them, the "strong conflict" comes from Super A sports student Qiao Wenyi. He openly challenged Xu Zhibin, who is known as the "Beautiful Man" on the track before the game. He choked that Xu Zhibin's appearance conditions should be sung and danced, and even released "lost." Don’t cry your makeup."
The remarks made the teenagers and the sports leaders on the field take a breath.
The "strong confrontation" is more like a fight between the gods. Sun Jianqi, known as the "big devil", meets the equally powerful Zhang Xindong and staged a strong confrontation.
And their identities are unexpected. Sun Jianqi is an actor who loves fitness, and Zhang Xindong is a retired special forces member and three-time Warrior Medal winner.
At the beginning of the game, the two teenagers tried their best to quickly pull out the small pole. The long-lasting confrontation on the big pole made the audience sweat for them.
In the tense situation, Zhang Jike, as one of the sports leaders of "Sports Boy", also watched the game seriously.
In the comment section, he was also very careful, patiently encouraged the teenager who lost the game, and helped every mistake in the process of resuming the game.
Sports assistant Lin Xiaozhai is a fancy assist, and she makes no secret of her appreciation for the youngsters who are online.
When I learned about the daily training that sports teenagers are overloaded with, I admire them even more.
Lin Dan and Fu Yuanhui, who are also the sports leaders, have their own styles. One is a "prophet" of the calm and relaxed school, and the other is a "preliminary girl" who uses a smile to dispel the tension.
In addition, Jike Junyi and Liu Ye, as sports assistants, also created a lot of hilarious topics around sports teenagers.
Church fire in Nantes, France: Diocese volunteers admit that arson is usually kind and reticent-Chinanews.com
China News Service, July 26. According to foreign media reports, on July 18, the famous religious and historical architectural treasures of Nantes, France, the famous Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul, was severely damaged in a fire and the large pipe organ was completely destroyed.
On the 26th local time, the Nantes prosecutor announced that a diocese volunteer who was responsible for the security of the cathedral had been charged with "arson and destruction."
He has admitted that he was lighting the fire in the church.
According to the report, the local prosecutor Cenas said that the 39-year-old volunteer from the diocese of Rwanda admitted that he had set fire to three places in the cathedral at night.
The person’s lawyer said that the arsonists now regret doing such a thing.
This person entered France through the route of asylum a few years ago, was sheltered in the parish where the fire happened, and taken in in the church.
The prosecutor pointed out that recently, he tried to renew his visa and was in dialogue with the police station.
But the church said that he still couldn't believe that this very kind, smiling, but quiet believer would destroy the church he loves so much.
On the day the fire broke out on July 18, the volunteer had already been questioned and investigated by the police because of a logically unreasonable problem in the narrative, but he was later released.
The picture shows firefighters at the scene rescue.
On the evening of the 25th, because professional engineers from the laboratory of the Central Police Department in Paris obtained new evidence, this person was once again interrogated.
This time, the man admitted to his arson.
According to reports, if the crime of deliberate arson and destruction is convicted, the suspect may face 10 years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros.
According to reports, the fire caused serious damage to the Cathedral of St. Pierre and St. Paul. The pipe organ in the church was completely burned and the stained glass window behind the pipe organ was also badly damaged.
Brunel, the chief architect of the French historical preservation building, believes that it is conservatively estimated that the restoration of the Nantes Cathedral will take at least three years.
Comprehensive news: U.S. unilateralism undermines relations between the two countries, international public opinion supports China's counter-control against the U.S.-Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26. Xinhua News Agency’s foreign correspondents reported: On the morning of July 24, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs notified the U.S. Embassy in China that China had decided to withdraw its approval for the establishment and operation of the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu. The consulate ceased all business and activities to make specific requirements.
International public opinion believes that the unilateral measures taken by the United States have caused serious problems in Sino-US relations. China has responded to the unreasonable provocations by the US and it is legitimate and necessary to take countermeasures.
Andrés Borques, director of the China Studies Center of the Institute of International Studies at the University of Chile, said that the unilateral measures of the United States have destroyed the bridge of understanding between the people of China and the United States, and caused a crisis in the relationship between the two major powers.
China's notification to the United States to close its consulate in Chengdu is a countermeasure to the US unilateral measures and conforms to diplomatic practice.
Patricio Giusto, a professor at the Catholic University of Argentina and director of the Argentina-China Research Center, believes that China's above decision is a legitimate and necessary countermeasure against the previous provocation of the United States, and is not directed at ordinary Americans.
The United States tried to use pressure on China to cover up its ineffective response to the new crown epidemic and divert the attention of the American people.
Bambang Suryono, chairman of the Asian Innovation Research Center, an Indonesian think tank, said that the provocative diplomatic stance of the United States has caused serious problems in Sino-US relations, which are facing severe challenges.
China’s notification of the United States to close its consulate in Chengdu is a normal countermeasure and conforms to diplomatic practice. It not only reflects China’s principled position of resolutely safeguarding its own interests, but also reflects the rationality and integrity of China’s diplomacy.
Francis Semwenza, a current affairs commentator in Tanzania, said that China's above decision is a legitimate and necessary response to the provocation of the United States.
If Sino-US relations are to return to normal, the US should take the initiative to improve relations with China and stop interfering in China's internal affairs.
The United States should focus on how to achieve a win-win situation with China economically and politically, and how to benefit the two peoples and the entire international community.
Ali Youssef, executive director of the Arab-Chinese Friendship Association Federation based in Sudan, said that the countermeasures China was forced to take were a legitimate and necessary response to the unreasonable actions of the United States, and conformed to the basic norms of international law and international relations, as well as diplomatic Convention.
Previously, the US request to close the Chinese Consulate General in Houston seriously violated international law and the basic norms of international relations.
It is hoped that the U.S. side will withdraw the previous relevant decisions and create necessary conditions for the return of bilateral relations to normal.
Singapore’s "Lianhe Zaobao" published an editorial saying that the greater strategic intention of the United States is to contain China and prevent China from continuing to rise.
In the face of the United States’ pressing steadily, although China is very reluctant to see Sino-US relations continue to deteriorate, it has to take countermeasures.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 26 (Reporter Mao Xin) The reporter learned from the Guangdong Maritime Police Bureau that recently, the bureau, in conjunction with the Guangzhou Customs and Public Security Departments, destroyed a very large oil smuggling gang, and initially verified that the gang has been since 2019. A total of about 120,000 tons of refined oil was smuggled, the case value was about 800 million yuan, and the tax evasion was about 240 million yuan.
The Guangdong Maritime Police Bureau and the customs anti-smuggling department have gradually figured out the division of labor and organizational structure of the gang.
On July 8, the Coast Guard, Customs, and Public Security Departments carried out a unified network collection operation in Guangzhou, Foshan and other places, as well as the Pearl River Estuary, and seized 4 suspected smuggled ships on the spot, and seized 4,700 refined oil products respectively in the involved ships and oil depots. Tons, and freeze a batch of fund accounts.
It is understood that the joint operation dispatched 8 ships and 2 helicopters, divided into multiple operation teams to coordinate operations, and carried out a full chain attack on maritime smuggling and illegal operations on land. All 35 major criminal suspects were involved.
The case is currently under further investigation.
The relevant person in charge of the Guangdong Maritime Police Bureau said that in the future, it will continue to maintain a high-pressure situation, crack down on various illegal and criminal activities at sea, and maintain good order in the waters of the jurisdiction.
Hurricane "Hanna" landed in the United States may trigger river surges and flash floods-Chinanews.com
Chinanews, July 26, comprehensive foreign media reported that at 5 pm local time on the 25th, hurricane "Hannah" landed in Texas, USA, which will bring severe storms and rain to Texas, surge in river water, and may also cause life-threatening flash floods. .
The National Hurricane Center said that hurricane Hannah is expected to carry heavy rain and sweep over parts of southern and northeastern Texas. The rain may cause some streams to surge and life-threatening flash floods.
According to reports, the most severely affected by Hurricane Hannah is the area south of Corpus Christi to the estuary of the Rio Grande, and the Rio Grande Valley may have a large-scale flash flood.
Texas Governor Abbott said on the 25th: "Any hurricane is a huge challenge."
Thirty-two counties in the state entered a disaster emergency due to the hurricane.
Corpus Christi, a city with a population of over 320,000, has closed libraries and museums, and residents are waiting.
Abbott also said that at a time when Texas is hit hard by the new crown epidemic, the hurricane can no longer bring more casualties to Texas.
According to reports, precipitation in southern Texas is expected to reach 6 to 12 inches on the night of the 26th, and 3 to 5 inches of rainfall will also occur in northern Texas and coastal areas of Louisiana.
Due to global warming and other factors, "Hannah" formed earlier than the previous Atlantic hurricane season.
Under normal circumstances, the first hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean usually does not form until mid-August.
Poland will withdraw from European treaty to prevent violence against women
The Polish Ministry of Justice said on Saturday that Poland will take steps next week to withdraw from the European Treaty for the Prevention of Violence against Women.
The cabinet of the Polish right-wing government stated that the treaty required schools to teach students on gender issues and violated the rights of students’ parents.
Polish Minister of Justice Giobro held a press conference and said that his Ministry of Justice will ask the Ministry of Labor and Family to start withdrawing from the treaty on Monday.
That treaty is also known as the Istanbul Convention.
Giobro said, "The treaty contains some elements that we consider to be harmful."
Poland’s ruling Law and Justice Party and its ruling coalition partners have a close alliance with the Roman Catholic Church and promote a conservative social agenda.
Polish President Duda made hostility to gay rights one of the main issues during his successful re-election campaign this month.
On Friday, thousands of Poles (most of them women) held protests against withdrawal from the convention in Warsaw and other cities.
Lempat, one of the organizers of the protest, said in a protest march in Warsaw that "the purpose of withdrawing from the treaty is to legalize domestic violence."
Some protesters held up banners that read "Law and Justice Party is a hell for women."
The Law and Justice Party has long complained about the Istanbul Convention.
The previous centrist government in Poland ratified the convention in 2015.
The Law and Justice Party government stated that the treaty does not respect religion and requires liberal social policies to be taught in schools.

Upgraded Russian gunship card-52M first shipped out at the end of the year-Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 25. According to the plan of the Russian Ministry of Defense, the upgraded version of the Russian armed helicopter (hereinafter referred to as Wuzhi) Ka-52, Ka-52M, will be transformed and shipped for the first time in December this year. Reconnaissance, communications and weapon performance will be greatly improved.
According to the Russian newspaper Izvestia a few days ago, Wuzhika-52M is called "Super Alligator". Its development contract was signed by the Russian military and military units in April last year. Currently, the first batch of two of the upgraded version of Wuzhi is currently in Russia. The Far East Helicopter Manufacturing Plant of Progressive Aerospace Corporation has undergone transformation and refurbishment, and its national-level testing and improvement work will be completed before October 2022.
According to Russian experts who understand the above-mentioned upgrade work, the "predecessor" of the "Super Alligator"-Wuzhika-52 was officially installed in November 2011. This model has exposed some weaknesses during use. It is to "make up for shortcomings."
According to the report, compared with the Ka-52, the Ka-52M will partially adopt new protective materials that will not increase the weight. Its pilot cockpit will be reinforced and equipped with new equipment to resist missile attacks, thereby increasing the probability of survival on the battlefield; the assembly power is greater. In order to power more complex airborne electronic equipment; the photoelectric system has been upgraded to detect and identify targets on the battlefield that are farther apart; the new light multi-purpose missile, which is equipped with main attack armored combat vehicles and reinforced concrete fortifications, has a range Up to 20 kilometers, the range of similar missiles used by Russia’s active military helicopters is approximately doubled; its defensive weapons and communication equipment will be used as much as possible with the Mi-28NM armed helicopters that can attack air targets, making related maintenance simple and economical. .
In addition, Ka-52M will have more advanced electronic guidance systems, weapon targeting systems and navigation equipment.
Russian experts also said that it is worth noting that Ka-52M will be equipped with communication equipment to communicate with drones, so as to obtain real-time information transmitted by nearby drones in the air. image.
According to the plan, the pilots of the Ka-52M can directly control the drones that cooperate with them, thereby improving the pilot's grasp of the battlefield situation and the guidance of long-range missiles.
According to Russian media reports, Russian Deputy Defense Minister Krivoruchko stated in December last year that the Russian Defense Ministry plans to purchase more than 110 Wuzhika-52Ms by 2027.
The new law stipulates that the Campania region must wear masks in indoor public places from now on, and offenders can be fined up to 1,000 euros.
On June 1, local time, the Colosseum reopened in Rome, the capital of Italy.
According to reports, according to the latest epidemic prevention ordinance issued by the regional government, people in Campania must wear masks in compliance with epidemic prevention requirements when taking all public transportation, as well as in and out of shops, bars, supermarkets and exhibition halls and other indoor public places.
Violation of this rule can be fined up to 1,000 euros.
The decree also stipulates that all travelers from non-Schengen countries entering the Campania region must be isolated.
The regional government will authorize health agencies to coordinate arrangements for specific hotels to isolate positive asymptomatic patients.
The decree came into effect on July 25th.
In less than an hour, three customers who entered the supermarket received the fine.
Ecological water supply of rivers and lakes in Hebei has reached 1.75 billion cubic meters since the beginning of this year
Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, July 26 (Reporter Wang Kun) The reporter learned from the Hebei Provincial Department of Water Resources that since this year, Hebei Province has coordinated the use of water from the diversion river and local reservoirs, and has successively distributed 28 channels including the Hutuo River, Tang River and Juma River. Ecological water replenishment has been implemented in the rivers and Baiyangdian Lake, and a total of 1.75 billion cubic meters of ecological water replenishment has been completed.
Hebei Province firmly seized the opportunity of increasing the flow of water in the middle route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project, and implemented ecological water replenishment to rivers such as Tanghe, Shahe and Zhulong Rivers by using water from the river.
At the same time, 9 large and medium-sized reservoirs including Xidayang and Tobusi and Baiyangdian have been used to implement ecological water replenishment to Fuyang River, Qinglong River and other rivers, forming a cumulative water surface area of more than 90 square kilometers.
In order to do a good job in ecological water replenishment, the Hebei Provincial Water Resources Department actively organizes the investigation of hidden dangers in replenishing rivers, rectification and reinforcement and river cleaning, refines actual measures, and strengthens inspection, management and protection.
Through supervisory inspections and concentrated unannounced visits, various problems were resolved in a timely manner to ensure the safe and orderly water supply of the river.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Hebei Provincial Department of Water Resources, the orderly implementation of river and lake ecological replenishment has effectively restored the ecological environment of rivers and lakes in Hebei Province, promoted the replenishment and conservation of coastal groundwater, and greatly improved the living environment and economic development along the line. The environment is of great significance to the realization of the river and lake management and protection goals of "clear water, green shores, smooth rivers and beautiful scenery".
You all should know the facts I want to tell.
I think the instinct that inequality can cause social division and corruption existed before the French Revolution.
The difference is that we can now find evidence. We can understand the impact of inequality by comparing societies with different levels of equality.
I will show you some data and explain why those data are indeed related.
But first, let's see how bitter our lives are.
(Laughter) I want to start my speech with a contradiction.
This graph shows the relationship between our average life expectancy and gross national income-the latter measures the average wealth of the country.
You can look at the countries on the right, like Norway and the United States, which are twice as rich as the countries on the left such as Israel, Greece, and Portugal.
But this did not affect the average life expectancy of their citizens.
There is no sign of correlation.
But if we go to understand the inside of the society, we can find that there is a big difference in the health status of the whole society.
This picture shows the average life span.
These are small towns in England and Wales-the poorest on the right and the richest on the left.
There is a big difference between the poor and others.
Even those who are just below the top have worse health than those who are at the top.
So income means a lot in our society, but the comparison between different societies is meaningless.
The explanation of the contradiction is that in our society, we are looking at relative income or social status and identity-that is, the mutual relationship between us and the size of the gap between people.
Once you have that idea, you should immediately think: What will happen if the gap widens? What if the gap is narrowed? What will happen if the income gap is widened or reduced?
This is what I am going to tell you right away.
I did not use any hypothetical data.
My data comes from the United Nations—like the World Bank data—about the income gap between these rich, developed market democracies.
The method we use is simple and easy to understand, and you can download it, which is to compare the income gap between the top 20% and the bottom 20% of each country.
You can see that the countries on the left are all relatively equal-Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden-their top 20% are about 3.5 to 4 times as rich as the bottom 20%.
But on the other side of inequality — Britain, Portugal, the United States, Singapore — the income gap is twice as large.
In this way of comparison, the level of inequality in our country (the United Kingdom) is twice that of other equally successful democratic markets.
Next I will show how this affects our society.
We have collected data on the problems caused by differences within society, and such problems are more common at the bottom of society.
Internationally comparable data include average life expectancy, children’s math and language performance, infant mortality, suicide rate, prison population ratio, teenage pregnancy rate, degree of mutual trust, obesity, mental illness-these diseases all meet the standard diagnostic classification Including drug addiction and alcohol addiction-as well as social mobility.
We put all of these into one coefficient.
They are all weighted equally.
The score of a country is the average of these factors.
As you can see, these scores are related to the inequality comparison I just showed, and I will show these data repeatedly.
The more unequal countries perform worse on various social issues.
The correlation is very strong.
But if you look at the same health and social issues compared with the index of per capita national income and gross national income, then you will find nothing and there is no correlation anymore.
We are a little worried that people might think that we are picking specific issues to cater to our theories and then artificially creating evidence. So we also published a paper on the UNICEF Child Welfare Index in the British Medical Journal.
It contains 40 different sections, summarized from others.
It includes whether children can talk to their parents, whether there are books in the home, what is the immunization rate, and whether there is bullying in the school.
Everything is included.
This is how the index relates to the same degree of inequality.
The more unequal society, the worse the performance of children.
The relationship is remarkable.
But again, if you look at the relationship between child welfare and per capita national income, you will get nothing. There is no sign of association.
All the data I have shown you so far reveal the same thing.
The average welfare of our society no longer depends on national income and economic growth.
They are very important in poorer countries, but not in rich developed countries.
The differences between us and our position relative to others now seem very important.
Below I will show you some parts of our index.
This is the mutual trust index.
Refers to the percentage of people who agree that most people are credible.
This is data from the "World Value Survey".
As you can see, on the more unequal side, about 15% of people feel they can trust others.
But in a more equal society, this proportion has risen to 60% or 65%.
If you look at the participation in community activities or the evaluation of social capital, there are very similar correlations and inequality.
I would say that we repeated this work twice.
The first time we targeted these wealthy developed countries, we changed the test subjects and repeated the test for 50 states in the United States-investigating the same question: whether those states that are more unequal are doing all of these evaluations Worse?
This is the relationship between mutual trust and inequality found by the federal government in a general social survey.
Very similar scattered points are distributed in a similar range of trust levels.
The same thing continues.
Basically, we found that almost all factors related to mutual trust reflected in international surveys are also reflected in the 50 states we separately surveyed.
This is no coincidence.
This picture is a mental illness.
The World Health Organization collects data through random sampling and using the same diagnostic interview method so that we can compare the rates of mental illness in each society.
This is the ratio of the population with any type of mental illness in the previous year.
It ranges from 8% to more than 24%-which shows that the proportion of mental illnesses in the whole society is three times that of other societies.
Similarly, these are closely related to inequality.
This graph is the crime rate.
The red dots represent the states in the United States, and the blue triangles represent the provinces in Canada.
But look at the difference in their numbers.
The murder rate ranges from 15 to 150 per million.
This is the ratio of prison inmates.
This is a gap of 10 times, and the exponential function will magnify this gap.
But the number of prisoners varies from 40 to 400.
Crime is not the main reason for this relationship.
In some places, crime can explain part of the reason.
But there are more severe trials, or harsher trials.
The more unequal society is, the more likely it is to retain the death penalty.
This picture shows the dropout status of children in high school.
Again, the gap is huge.
If we discuss the selection of social talents, we will find that this gap is very harmful.
This graph is the social mobility rate.
In fact, it is calculated based on the turnover rate of income.
Basically, what it asks is: Does rich dad have rich children and poor dad have poor children, or is there no relationship between the two?
On the more unequal side, the father's income is more important-for example, the United Kingdom and the United States.
In Northern Europe, father's income is not so important.
There is more social class mobility there.
As we always say — I know there are many American listeners here — if Americans want to realize their "American Dream", they should go to Denmark.
(Laughter) (Applause) What I have shown is marked in italics here.
I can also show some other problems.
Those problems are more common at the bottom of the social gradient.
But there are endless problems with social gradients, and these problems are worse in unequal countries—not just a little bit worse, but everything is twice as bad as 10 times.
Think about the cost, the cost of labor.
I want to go back to this picture that I showed earlier. We combined everything to illustrate two points.
First, through chart after chart, we find that the countries that perform poorly, no matter what, seem to be more unequal countries, but those who perform well seem to be Northern Europe and Japan.
So what we see is the relationship between general social disorder and inequality.
Not just one or two things went wrong, but almost everything.
Another very important point that I want to point out on this picture is that if you look at the bottom, Switzerland and Japan, they show that they are very different countries in all respects.
The status of women and their adherence to small families are at two extremes in the rich and developed countries.
But another very important difference is how they achieve greater equality.
Sweden has a big difference in income, but it uses taxes, state benefits, generous relief, etc. to close the gap.
Japan is quite different.
First of all, the pre-tax wage gap in Japan is relatively small.
It has lower taxes.
Its welfare is also relatively small.
In the study of the states in the United States, we found sharp contrasts.
Some states performed well through redistribution, while others performed well because of the small pre-tax income gap.
So we came to the conclusion that how to achieve greater equality is not important, what is important is that such equality can be achieved.
I'm not talking about complete equality, what I'm talking about does exist in rich developed market democracies.
Another unexpected thing about this picture is that it is not just the poor that will be affected by inequality.
The words of John Don (British poet) seem to make sense: "No one is an island."
Through a series of studies, we can compare the behaviors of people from each social class in different countries with more or less equal degrees.
This is just an example.
This chart is the infant mortality rate.
According to the British General Socio-Economic Classification records, some Swedes kindly classified many infant deaths.
This is a classification based on father's position that is not in line with the times, so single mothers constitute a set of data on their own.
But when we look at the so-called "lower classes of society", it is manual work without technical skills.
In the middle are manual work that requires technology, then advanced non-manual work, and up to professional work—doctors, lawyers, managers of large companies.
It can be seen that Sweden is doing better than the United Kingdom, doing better in every social class.
The biggest difference appears at the bottom of society.
But even at the top, living in a more equal society has some advantages.
We showed 5 different sets of data including American and international education results and health status.
It seems that on the whole-a more equal society shows the most obvious differences at the bottom of the society, but it also has some advantages at the top of the society.
I should explain what happened.
I think I am showing and discussing the impact of inequality on social psychology.
More attention is paid to the sense of superiority and inferiority, being valued and looked down upon, being respected and degraded.
Of course, those feelings generated by the competition of status and status urge the advancement of social consumerism.
But it also leads to the uncertainty of status.
What we worry more about is how others judge and perceive us, whether we appear attractive, smart, or whatever.
Social value evaluations have increased the fear of these social value evaluations.
Interestingly, some similar work in the field of social psychology is also underway: some people consulted 208 different studies; in the study, volunteers were invited to a psychological testing center and tested their stress Hormon and Their reaction to stressful tasks.
In this observation, scientists are interested in which type of stress can best increase the level of cortisol in the body, and the most important stress, Hormon.
The result is precisely those tasks that include threats of social evaluation — tasks that threaten self-esteem and social status — where others can negatively evaluate your performance.
These stresses have very special effects on stress physiology.
So far we have accepted the criticism.
Of course, some people don't like this, and some people find this unexpected.
However, I should tell you that when people criticize us for picking data, we have never done so.
We have an unconditional rule that if our data source contains data from the observed country, then we include it in the analysis.
Our data source determines whether the data is valid, not us.
Otherwise, deviations will occur.
What about other countries?
Among the academic peer-reviewed journals, there are 200 studies on the relationship between health and income and equality.
This is not limited to these countries here, there is a very simple proof hidden.
The same way of measuring inequality in the same country, one problem after another.
Why don't we control other factors?
I have shown you that the per capita national income has not had any impact.
Of course, some people have applied more complicated methods in the literature to exclude factors such as poverty and education in the experiment.
What about the causality?
Correlation alone does not prove a causal connection.
We spent a considerable amount of time.
Indeed, people have a good understanding of the causal link between our results.
The biggest change in our understanding of the drivers of long-term health in wealthy developed countries is how important the long-term pressure from society is on immunity and the cardiovascular system.
Or, for example, the reason why violence is becoming more and more common in less unequal countries is because people are very sensitive to being looked down upon.
I want to say that in order to solve this problem, we should solve a series of problems after tax and before tax.
We should limit income and curb the top bonus income culture.
I think we must do everything we can to make our leaders accountable to our employees.
The last thing I want to summarize is that we can improve our true quality of life by reducing our income gap.
In this case, we will find that we have suddenly solved the social and mental health problems of the entire society, which is really great.
Thank you.

(Deutsche Welle Chinese website) In the past two weeks, the number of confirmed new crown cases in Spain has risen sharply, with thousands of new cases in multiple days.
The British government made an interim decision on Saturday night (July 25) to remove Spain from the safe travel list starting at midnight on the 26th local time. People entering the UK from Spain must be quarantined for 14 days.
British tourists who were on vacation in Spain expressed surprise, worry, and even anger when they heard about this decision, because the news came so unexpectedly that they were caught off guard.
According to reports, British Transport Secretary Grant Shapps (Grant Shapps) is currently on holiday in Spain.
Before the UK issued the quarantine measures, Norway has also announced that people returning from Spain to Norway will be quarantined for 10 days.
France and Belgium advise their residents to abandon their plans for vacations in Barcelona and surrounding areas ahead.
The beaches in these areas are overcrowded and social distancing cannot be maintained between people. The police needed to take measures to reduce the number of beach tourists.
Tourism is an important pillar industry in Spain
Spain: It's safe here
In response to the decision made by the United Kingdom, the Spanish Foreign Ministry said on Sunday that the country’s epidemic was under control.
Spanish Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya emphasized to the media: "Spain is safe, not only for Spaniards, but also for tourists."
The Spanish government will try to persuade the British government to exclude the Balearic Islands and Canary Islands from the quarantine measures.
The reason is that the infection rate of these two tourist destinations is much lower than that of the British mainland.
In order to prevent the spread of the epidemic, the Catalonia region of Spain has also restarted the "foot ban".
Tourism is an important pillar industry in Spain, and Spain is one of the most popular holiday destinations for British tourists.
The British decision is expected to greatly affect Spain's tourism industry.

Engine may stall, FAA urgently orders 2000 Boeing airliners-Xinhuanet
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an emergency airworthiness directive on the 24th, requiring emergency inspections of approximately 2,000 Boeing 737NG and 737Classic airliners registered in the United States. The reason is that the corrosion of the air check valves of the airliners may cause the engine to fly in the air. parking.
The Federal Aviation Administration said that it has received 4 reports of 737NG and 737Classic aircraft engines stopping in the air, so it has made urgent inspection requirements. The inspection objects are passenger aircraft that have been parked for 7 consecutive days or more and the number of flights has been less than 11 so far after being re-commissioned. Airliner.
The FAA warned that if the level 5 check valves of all two engines of the airliner are corroded, they may become stuck in the open position, causing the airliner to completely lose power and unable to restart the engine.
The aviation regulatory agency ordered that once the check valve is found to be corroded, the aviation operator must replace this key component before the passenger plane is put into service again.
Boeing responded later that day that the outbreak of the new crown epidemic has reduced travel demand, and many passenger aircraft have been sealed or used less frequently, and "check valves are more likely to be corroded."
At the same time, Boeing said that it has advised air operators to inspect the passenger aircraft involved in the order. If problems are found, Boeing will provide assistance in maintenance and replacement of check valves.
The Associated Press reported that airlines owned by major U.S. airlines usually fly multiple times in a day, but after the outbreak of the new crown epidemic, a large number of airliners were grounded; as passenger travel demand has grown slowly recently, some airliners have been put back into operation.
The FAA did not release the details of the four air parking reports.
Alaska Airlines disclosed one of the incidents later on the 24th.
The airline said in a statement that on July 15th, one of its passenger planes was en route from Seattle, Washington to Austin, Texas, when an engine suddenly turned off, and the passenger plane finally made an emergency landing at Austin Airport.
Alaska Airlines stated that it had replaced the airliner's engine and had inspected the engines of six airliners in accordance with FAA instructions.
American Airlines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines said on the 24th that there was no engine stalling associated with the air check valve on their airliners.
Four airliners under American Airlines will be inspected, and 28 airliners under United Airlines will be inspected.
Delta Air Lines said it would inspect its 20 passenger planes, but did not say whether there had been engine stalls.
Many media reported that the FAA's emergency airworthiness directive was another impact on Boeing.
Indonesia Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines each crashed a Boeing 737MAX passenger plane in October 2018 and March 2019 respectively, killing a total of 346 people.
This series of passenger aircraft was subsequently grounded globally, production was suspended in January this year, and production resumed in May.
FAA Director Steve Dixon admitted in June that the FAA "made a mistake" in its supervision of Boeing regarding the 737MAX airliner.
"Ding Dong Online! Hello Teacher" will be online next week, led by Xue Zhaofeng as "Knowledge Promoter"-Xinhuanet
There is another variety show online.

It is understood that the program will create a brand-new youth classroom for all ages, and a group of handsome and talented teachers will enter the battle to challenge the output of interesting knowledge.
Different from the serious impression of teachers in the public minds in the past, "Ding Dong is online! Teacher is good" gathers a group of intellectual representatives with both beauty and talent.
They are not only young intellectual role models from various disciplines, but also a group of all-round "joke players" who can shake their burdens and are good at entertaining and entertaining.
In the program, this group of outstanding young knowledge role models as "knowledge sharing officers" will challenge interesting knowledge classes.
They need to show the most interesting aspect of their subject through an attitude of knowledge output to impress the audience present.
The "You Dao Questioning Group" composed of audiences of all ages will raise ever-changing questions on the spot, which will increase the difficulty of teaching the "Knowledge Sharing Officer" and add a little stimulating atmosphere to the program.
According to reports, the "Knowledge Sharing Officer" includes outstanding young teachers such as Li Yongle, a physics teacher at the High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China, Zhang Xuefeng, a famous teacher for postgraduate entrance examinations, and Wang Lei, a history teacher with ten years of experience. They will present to the scene in unexpected ways. The audience showed the "hard core" knowledge of various disciplines.

In recent days, General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized when visiting the Siping Battle Memorial Hall: “It is necessary for 1.4 billion people and more than 90 million party members, especially leading cadres at all levels, to learn the history of the Communist Party of China and the history of New China well.”
Studying the history of the party and the history of New China is a compulsory course for party members and cadres to keep in mind their original aspirations and keep their mission in mind. They must draw rich nourishment from them, build a strong sense of family and country, and walk the long march of the new era.
A magnificent history of the party and the history of New China records the hard work and glorious history of the Communist Party of China since its birth, and demonstrates the faith and loyalty that the Communists have forged with their lives and blood, and the original intention and mission that they will always adhere to.
History is the best textbook. For party members and cadres, party history and New China history are the brightest chapters in this textbook.
Every party member and cadre must continuously strengthen the historical thinking of taking history as a mirror and moving towards the future, based on the new journey and new mission, take the "relay baton" of the times, and take the long march of contemporary people.
Cast the soul with history, and stick to the original mission in the study of party history and the history of New China.

These great spirits precipitated by history have provided our party with a powerful spiritual incentive to overcome various risks and challenges on the way forward. It is a precious spiritual wealth that cannot be defeated, washed away, or taken away.
The process of studying party history and Chinese history is a process of reviewing these spirits and shaping one's own spirit. We must consciously take the lofty spirit of the revolutionary ancestors as the mirror, stick to the spiritual home of the Communists, and build a firm foundation for advancing the great cause and realizing the great dream.

In the history of the Party and the history of New China, we can see the great deeds of the older generation of revolutionaries who were determined to devote themselves to their beliefs and perseverely striving to achieve the set goals, and we can also see the profound lessons of certain figures who have been shaken by their ideals and beliefs and walked to the opposite of the revolution , Enlighten and warn us with firm determination and will to never stagnate, never slack, always maintain an ample and tenacious fighting spirit, and constantly purify the party spirit, self-cultivation and self-discipline.
To truly become a firm believer and loyal practitioner of the lofty ideals of communism, one needs to dust off the "dust" of thinking and prevent "dirt" from getting infected. Party history and New China history should become every party member and cadre who examines himself, The basis for warning yourself.
Learn about history and be inspired, and bravely take on the important tasks of the times in the study of party history and the history of New China.

"Screw on the Jiangnan" to pursue the poetic "Yellow River Dream"-Chinanews.com
(Chinese Poverty Reduction Story) "Screw on the South of the Yangtze River" Pursuing the Poetic "Yellow River Dream"
China News Service, Yinchuan, July 26 (Yang Di) "The Nine-curved Yellow River has tens of thousands of li sands, and the waves and wind rush from the end of the world."
The Yellow River, which aroused countless literati's lofty passions, gave birth to the beautiful and fertile Ningxia Plain. Today, Ningxia, which has the reputation of "Stopping Jiangnan", is adhering to the concept of "ecology first, green development" and pursuing the poetic "Yellow River Dream".
The beautiful "Bibo Dream" of the river
"The Yellow River in the world enriches Ningxia", the Yellow River flows 397 kilometers through Ningxia and is the "mother river" for nurturing a party.
However, with the rapid advancement of industrialization and urbanization, the development, utilization, management and protection of rivers and lakes have become unbalanced, and chaos such as excessive sewage discharge, lake reclamation, and infringement of waters have emerged, resulting in black and odorous water, excessive water quality, dirty environment, and ecological degradation.
Now, Ningxia is promoting the restoration of diverse water ecology and working hard to make the Yellow River beautiful and clear.
Water control must start from the source.
In Yinchuan, Ningxia, the local government adopted the method of "standard improvement + pollution control + strict management". All sewage in the industrial parks were treated in a centralized manner. The urban sewage treatment plants all achieved Class A discharge standards. The black and odorous water bodies in urban built-up areas were basically eliminated, and the application was successfully declared The third batch of China's black and smelly water demonstration cities.
In addition, Ningxia fully implemented the river and lake chief system in 2017, and now it has achieved full coverage of the five-level river and lake chief responsibility system in districts, counties and villages, and long patrols of rivers and lakes have become the norm.
64-year-old Gu Jincheng lives in a village by the Yellow River. He has witnessed the changes in the Yellow River: “The previous water smelled like a smell, but after the rectification, the smell disappeared.”
Gu Jincheng said that the ecological environment is better and his life is more comfortable. Now he often walks by the Yellow River with his family and feels the blue water and blue sky.
Sha Ouxiang's "Wetland Dream"
Birds, green trees, plank roads, clear water... The beauty of Fan Zhongyan's "Sand Gulls Xiangji" has become a reality in the Yellow River Wetland Park in Yinchuan, Ningxia.
The Yellow River flows through Ningxia, forming river wetlands, lake wetlands, marsh wetlands and other wetlands along the way, which play an important role in promoting the rational use of water resources and the water ecological balance. It has also become an important international bird migration channel.
Since 2009, relevant departments in Ningxia have invested a total of 3.45 billion yuan in wetland protection projects. At present, Yinchuan wetland covers an area of 19,200 hectares, with a wetland protection rate of 78.5%. There are nearly 200 natural lakes and marsh wetlands. There are 5 national wetland parks, 1 national urban wetland park, 6 autonomous region-level wetland parks, and 8 municipal-level parks.
Lu Jinhu, deputy director of the Yinchuan Wetland Conservation Center, told reporters that wetland protection has increased biodiversity, which is particularly evident in birds. “The relict gull is an endangered bird, and there are only more than 20,000 in the world. Among them, the Yinchuan Wetland There are more than 2,000 inhabitants."
At the same time, Ningxia has delineated a 500-meter red line for the wetland protection areas on both sides of the Yinchuan section of the Yellow River in accordance with the law, stipulating that no unit or individual may conduct development, construction and business activities within the protected area except for public welfare projects.
Zhao Shaoyong, deputy director of Yinchuan Water Conservancy Service Center, introduced that through pollution source treatment, comprehensive improvement of river and lake ecology, and terminal wetland construction, 100% of the water quality of Ningxia’s nine main drainage ditches into the Yellow River has reached Class IV standards. “Now the water is clear. The fish swam and the flowers bloomed."
The "Drinking Dream" of Inclusive People's Livelihood
Yinchuan City in Ningxia used to have the title of "embarrassing": the only city along the Yellow River that "guarded the water shortage of the Yellow River".
Since 2010, Yinchuan City has been facing persistent water shortages during the peak summer period. The pain of water shortage in the past ten years has become a painful summer experience for many high-floor residents. Under the current situation that a large area of groundwater over-exploitation funnel area has formed under the limit of mining and urban underground, water shortage has become a problem that plagues Yinchuan City.
Thanks to the improvement of the water quality of the Yellow River, drinking purified Yellow River water has become a good way to solve the drinking water problems of local residents.
According to Ding Ming, deputy director of Yinchuan Water Affairs Bureau, in order to improve the water demand of urban and rural residents in Yinchuan, Ningxia started the water supply project of the West Line of Yinchuan Metropolitan Area at an appropriate time to replace the original underground water source with high-quality Yellow River water.
"On December 29, 2019, the water supply project officially provided water to the three districts of Yinchuan City. In 2020, residents of Minning Town and Helan County will also drink water from the Yellow River."
Ding Ming said that the Yinchuan Water Conservancy Department will make overall plans to consider the integration of rural drinking water and urban water supply in the region. “In the next step, we will integrate all the scattered water supply points in rural areas and connect them to the west line water supply project. It is expected that the Yinchuan area will be basically achieved by the end of this year. Integrated urban and rural water supply."

China urges the US to abide by existing international rules and stop anti-subsidy investigations into the so-called "undervaluation of the RMB exchange rate."
Affected by the further increase in tensions in Sino-US relations, the offshore and onshore RMB exchange rates against the US dollar fell sharply on the 22nd, and both fell below the US$1 to RMB 7.0 mark.
Whether the US Department of Commerce's move is intended to force the yuan to rise is worthy of attention.
The spot exchange rate of the RMB against the US dollar rose above the 7.0 mark on the 23rd to close at 6.9961.
The central parity of the renminbi against the U.S. dollar under official regulation was lowered by 17 basis points to 6.9938 on the 24th.

Henry "Grant" Lewis, Lewis's youngest brother, said at the meeting: "He has devoted his life to helping others."
Samuel Lewis said his mother had warned John "Don't make trouble, don't make trouble."
He added that John didn’t heed his mother’s warning. He said: “We all know that John always gets into trouble, always getting into trouble, but that’s because he insists on the right thing, which is a good trouble. ."
Lewis’ brothers and sisters reminded the people at the memorial service that John’s most famous argument was to create “good troubles”, that is, as long as it was for justice, he would not shy away from provoking trouble.
John once applied to Troy University in Troy, Alabama, where he was born, but Troy University, an all-white school at the time, rejected his application.
John Lewis, who preached the gospel to chickens on his farm as a child, eventually earned a degree in religion and philosophy from Fisk University.
Many years later, the University of Troy awarded Lewis an honorary doctorate.
Senator Doug Jones from Alabama said that the current protesters are "protesting peacefully and non-violently," just like Lewis did in the civil rights movement.
Jones said: "Even if President Trump overturned a boat and described all protesters as thugs, he was wrong.
The protesters are patriots, and they want the United States to move towards a more equal country. "
A series of six-day events to commemorate Lewis will culminate at the funeral in Georgia this week.
On Saturday, Lewis’s coffin was parked at a public memorial service at Troy University. People came to pay tribute to the pioneer of the civil rights movement.
Later on Saturday, a private ceremony paid tribute to him in a small church in Selma, Alabama, followed by a public memorial service.
On Sunday, Lewis' body will pass the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma.
In 1965, he and the demonstrators who demanded the right to vote for blacks were beaten up by the Alabama police in front of this bridge, and the police also released tear gas on the demonstrators.
Lewis was almost killed at the time.
This day will be called "Bloody Sunday" in the future.
Lewis' remains will be transported to Montgomery, the capital of Alabama.
Mayor Steven Reed encouraged people to line up on the sidewalk to complete the final journey with Lewis.
At the same time, officials asked the public to wear masks and maintain social distancing when participating in activities.
Alabama Governor Kay Ivey ordered that the flag be lowered at half-mast on Saturday and Sunday to commemorate Lewis.
During the nearly week-long commemorative event, Lewis's body will be placed briefly in the Alabama State Capitol in Montgomery, the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta, and the U.S. Capitol in Washington for the public to express their condolences.
The Speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced last week that people can go to the US Capitol on Monday and Tuesday to pay tribute to Lewis.
Due to the coronavirus epidemic, public events to commemorate Lewis will be held outdoors.
Shenzhen publicly solicits opinions on the introduction of health regulations-Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Shenzhen, July 26 (Reporters Mao Siqian and Bai Yu) Encourage residents to do physical examinations frequently to detect problems early; prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors; establish a health review system for online games; employers must be equipped with full-time and part-time health management personnel ...... The "Shenzhen Special Economic Zone Health Regulations (Draft for Comment)" was officially released a few days ago, and Shenzhen residents will have their own "health law."
In order to encourage residents to do physical examinations frequently and find problems as early as possible, the above-mentioned consultation draft proposes that the health department should develop a basic catalog of health examination items based on factors such as age and occupation.
The cost of a health check-up within the scope of the basic list of health check-up items shall be paid by the social medical insurance coordinating fund at the standard of once per person per year.
The draft for comments clearly stated that employers should rationally allocate human resources, arrange staff working hours, and implement a rotation system for employees with heavy mental and physical workloads to avoid excessive loss of human functions or physical and mental health damage to employees’ health, and strict implementation Paid leave system for employees.
In addition, the employer must be equipped with full-time and part-time health management personnel, and regularly organize and carry out employee health examinations.
Regarding the physical and mental health of minors, the draft for comments proposes that the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors is prohibited, and at the same time the sales location of alcoholic beverages is restricted. For violations of the regulations, the market supervision and management department will order corrections and impose a penalty of 30,000 yuan. fine.
In addition to "prohibition", minors must also "exercise more."
According to the requirements of the draft, the school should arrange more than one hour of student sports activities every day.
For online games, the public security, culture, broadcasting, television, tourism, sports, network supervision, health and health departments should improve the health supervision system of Internet service business premises, establish a health review system for online games, and create a good communication space and culture for promoting the healthy growth of young people.
In addition, the draft also proposes that influenza patients must wear masks when entering and leaving public places, and medical and health institutions will fine 20,000 yuan for leaking patients' privacy without consent.
It is worth noting that, in addition to the physical and mental health of residents, the draft also requires that various departments in Shenzhen are formulating plans involving urban spatial planning and construction, industrial park planning and construction, resource development and utilization, ecological environment protection, and biomedical industry development. , Before the regulatory documents and approval of major construction projects and implementation of major public service projects, the impact of public policy implementation on the health of the population should be assessed.
Those that have not been assessed or will have a serious adverse impact on urban public health or the health of residents shall not be formulated, promulgated or approved for implementation.

Recently, General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized during an inspection in Jilin Province that it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the party, promote the extension of party organizations to the most basic level, improve the work system of basic party organizations, and provide a strong guarantee for the governance of urban and rural communities.
Adhering to the leadership of party building and implementing party leadership in all areas and links of grassroots governance is a fundamental requirement for the direction of doing a good job of grassroots governance.
To improve the level of grassroots governance, we must adhere to the leadership of party building, and promote the transformation of the party’s political advantages, organizational advantages, and mass work advantages into governance advantages by strengthening political leadership, building battle fortresses, and gathering red forces, so as to transfer the party’s power and propositions to the "nerve". "End" "Last Kilometer".
Pay attention to calcium supplement to create soul and strengthen political leadership.
To strengthen the political leadership of grassroots governance, it is necessary to implement the "Calcium Supplementation and Soul Creation" project.
To learn deeply and thoroughly understand Xi Jinping’s thoughts on socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era as the primary task, take “not forgetting the original aspiration and keeping in mind the mission” as the eternal task of party building and the lifelong task of party members and cadres, and strengthen the understanding of the principles of reading the original texts. Special training, batch training, seminars and exchanges, holding lecture halls, etc., continue to promote the party’s innovative theories to be solid, and promote party members and cadres to further enhance the "four consciousnesses", strengthen the "four self-confidence", and achieve the "two Maintenance" to better perform duties and responsibilities.
Through the combination of online and offline learning methods, broaden the channels of learning and education, and guide the grassroots party organizations and party members and cadres to truly integrate learning and education into daily life and focus on regularity.
Pay attention to practice and exercise. In the process of resolving key and difficult problems in the field of grassroots governance, the annoying and disturbing issues that the masses are concerned about are resolved, and the party spirit and ability are tempered.
Grasp the improvement of standards and build a battle fortress.
The grassroots party organization is not only an important part of the grassroots governance system, but also an important carrier for the manifestation of governance capabilities.
To promote the standardized construction of grassroots party organizations, we must start with the work regulations of party branches, focus on the weakening and falsification of party organization leadership, through the establishment of a linkage mechanism between top and bottom, innovating the branch setting form, normalization and rectification of weak and loose, and establishing and improving the decision-making and discussion mechanism. Serving the masses mechanism, etc., solidify the foundation, make up for shortcomings, and promote development.
In rural areas, strengthen the standardization of village-level party organizations, standardize organizational forms, learning activities, and management mechanisms in accordance with the standardization of party branch construction standards, and effectively promote the implementation of the "three meetings and one lesson", thematic party day activities and other systems.
In the city, pay attention to neighborhoods and communities, explore innovative branch establishment forms, focus on weak areas, "blocking points" and "pain points", and actively build urban party building alliances to achieve effective coverage of party work.
At the same time, establish and improve the grassroots governance system and mechanism, improve the decision-making and discussion mechanism of discussing major issues, co-handling practical issues, determining important issues, discussing urgent issues, solving difficult issues, and leading party organizations at the basic level. Gather the hearts of the people in public service, enhance the sense of gain, happiness, honor, and pride of party members and the masses, and make grassroots governance more warm.
Play a pioneering role and condense the red power.
Grassroots party members and cadres are the cornerstone of grassroots governance.
Improving grassroots governance capabilities focuses on improving the governance capabilities of grassroots party members and cadres, focusing on the demonstration and leading role of "red cells" in grassroots governance, and gathering red forces at the forefront of contacting and serving the masses.
To improve governance capabilities as a compulsory course for grassroots party members and cadres, continuously strengthen ideological refinement, professional training, and practical exercises, carry forward the spirit of responsibility in their posts, urgent, difficult, and dangerous tasks, and lay a solid foundation for promoting the modernization of the national governance system and governance capabilities ,Contribute.
It is necessary to extensively carry out "Community Whistleblowing and Party Member Registration" activities, through participating in thematic party day activities, contacting the people in difficulties, determining service projects, claiming micro-wishes, and making reasonable suggestions to participate in community construction, management, and service, so that party members can be involved in community construction, management, and service. Play a role in community governance.
It is necessary to give full play to the role of unemployed party members in rural areas, and guide the majority of grassroots party members to actively participate in poverty alleviation, ecological construction, petitioning and stability maintenance, and banning straw burning by setting up unemployed party members’ vanguard posts and forming unemployed party members’ work teams. , To better integrate the red forces and serve the people.
The foundation is solid and the building is firm.
The grassroots party organization is the foundation of the ruling building.
Only by persisting in focusing on the close relationship between the party and the masses, increasing the well-being of the people, and taking the leadership of party building as the fundamental way to promote the innovation and development of grassroots governance, can we build a firm foundation and enable the grassroots party organizations to be able to pull out and stand up. Cadres can catch up and rush up, and promote grassroots governance to be "soul", orderly, powerful, and effective.

Hoh Xil Tibetan antelope enters migration season-Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 25 (Reporter Wang Jinjin) The reporter learned from the Wudaoliang Protection Station, Hoh Xil Management Office, Yangtze Source Park, Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration, that monitoring showed that Tibetan antelopes had migrated to the Zhuonai Lake area in the hinterland of Hoh Xil to give birth. The littering is gradually ending, and the cubs are beginning to return to their original habitat.
Monitoring pictures near the Wudaoliang Conservation Station showed that on July 25, about 40 female Tibetan antelopes led three Tibetan antelope cubs through the 3002 kilometers of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway and the Wudaoliang North Bridge on the Qinghai-Tibet Railway. The Tibetan antelopes have begun to move back .
According to expert analysis, in recent years, the number of Tibetan antelope cubs in the relocating flock accounts for one-quarter to one-fifth of the total number of Tibetan antelope flocks.
Lian Xinming, an associate researcher at the Northwest Plateau Institute of Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: "In the early stage of the migration, Tibetan antelopes face a higher risk of predation, so the number of cubs in the flock will be relatively small, and there may even be no cubs."
According to the statistics of the Kekexili Management Office of the Yangtze River Source Park of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration, the number of Tibetan antelopes returning has been increasing year by year. In 2019, the number of Tibetan antelopes returning was 4860, an increase of 338 from 2018.
Lian Xinming said: "It is expected that this year's relocation of Tibetan antelopes will end in early September, and the number of relocated Tibetan antelopes is expected to continue to increase."
Tibetan antelope is a national first-class protected animal.
At the end of May every year, Tibetan antelopes from the Sanjiangyuan of Qinghai, Qiangtang of Tibet, Altyn Mountains of Xinjiang and other places go to Zhuonai Lake, located in the hinterland of Hoh Xil, to lamb.
Wu Xiaomin, a Tibetan antelope conservation expert in my country and a researcher at the Shaanxi Institute of Zoology (Northwestern Endangered Animals Institute), said: “Tibetan antelope migration is a process in which the female Tibetan antelope returns to the habitat with the cubs after the female Tibetan antelope has finished giving birth. The relocation groups of the young land are relatively large, but then the Tibetan antelopes will return to their respective habitats along different paths according to different geographic populations."
In order to ensure the safe relocation of the Tibetan antelope herd, the reporter learned that the Kekexili Management Office of the Yangtze River Source Park of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration has arranged staff to continue to carry out video surveillance and patrols in the main relocation area.
If a flock of Tibetan antelopes is found trying to cross the highway, the mountain patrol team will conduct temporary traffic control as soon as possible to allow the flock to safely pass through the wildlife passage and ensure that it is as little as possible to be disturbed by humans on the way back.
So, how to relieve heat in daily life?
Experts recommend that you try to avoid high temperature periods when you go out in summer, and it is best not to walk or work in the hot sun around noon, because the sun is the strongest during this time period, and the possibility of heat stroke is higher.
If you must go out during this period, you must do a good job of protection, such as wearing a parasol, wearing a sun hat, and wearing sunglasses. If possible, apply sunscreen to protect yourself from injury.
Choose light-colored, breathable cotton, linen, and silk as much as possible for clothes, and wear less chemical fiber clothing, so as not to lose heat in time when you sweat a lot, causing heat stroke.
In the hot and sultry weather, you should prepare enough water to drink and drink it in time. Don’t wait until you are thirsty, because once you feel thirsty, it means that your body is already short of water. Drink 150ml to 200ml of water each time. Boiling water, do not drink ice water.
According to the temperature, the average person drinks 1.5 to 2 liters of water a day, and the high temperature workers drink 3 to 5 liters of water a day.
When you sweat a lot, you can add some salt water appropriately to make up for the salt lost by the body due to sweating.
In addition, the human body is prone to lack of potassium in summer, which makes people feel tired and tired. Potassium-containing tea is an excellent refreshing drink.
Eat more fruits and vegetables with high water content in summer, such as lettuce, cucumber, tomatoes, etc.; fresh fruits, such as peaches, apricots, watermelons, melons, etc., with a moisture content of 80% to 90%, can be used to replenish water; dairy products can both replenish water , And can meet the body's nutritional needs.
In addition, people who work in high-temperature environments should appropriately supplement drinks containing potassium, magnesium and other elements.
In summer, the days are long and nights are short, the temperature is high, the body's metabolism is strong, the consumption is also large, and it is easy to feel tired.
Adequate sleep can relax the brain and body systems, which is not only conducive to work and study, but also a measure to prevent heatstroke.
Experts say that the best bedtime is from 22:00 to 23:00, and the best time to wake up is from 5:30 to 6:30.
Be careful not to lie under the air-conditioning vents and electric fans during sleep to avoid air-conditioning diseases and thermal colds.
Experts suggest that people who are outdoors or working at high temperatures can carry ten drops of water, Rendan, Huoxiang Zhengqi Water or Huoxiang Zhengqi Pills and other heatstroke prevention drugs, or place them in the nearest workplace for use at any time to prevent heat stroke.
I hope you can take some time to consider the very simple fact that, so far, most of our understanding of the universe comes from light.
When we stand on the earth and look up at the night sky, we can see the stars in the sky with our naked eyes.
The strong sunlight is so dazzling,
We can see the light reflected from the moon,
Since Galileo aimed his simple astronomical telescope at the celestial bodies in the universe, the universe as we know it today is presented to us through light.
With the help of modern astronomical telescopes, we have been able to collect dazzling and silent images of the universe-this series of images can be traced back to the Big Bang.
However, the universe is not a mime, because the universe is not really silent.
I want to tell everyone that the universe has its own soundtrack, and the universe itself is constantly playing. Because space can vibrate like a drum.
So it can send out a series of sounds to the universe when some important things happen.
Today, we hope to be able to add sound to this magnificent visual work about the universe.
Although we have never heard a sound from outer space, we should be able to turn up the volume in the next few years and listen to what is happening there.
Aiming at the ambitious goal of capturing the sound of the universe, we will focus our attention on black holes and the prospects they show, because black holes can hit space-time and make a very special sound like a drumstick hitting a drumhead. I am also very happy to give you Play some of the sounds we predicted.
One day in the future we may be able to see a shadow and a black hole can leave a shadow on a very bright background, but it has not been observed yet.
Although black holes cannot be seen, they can be heard because they strike space-time like drums.
The idea that the universe can make a drum-like sound comes from Albert Einstein. In fact, many of our ideas come from him.
Einstein realized that if the universe is empty, if the universe is empty, it will look like this picture, except for the auxiliary lines drawn on it.
But if we are free fall in the universe, even without these auxiliary lines, our trajectory will draw these lines, because we will find that we move along a straight line, passing through the universe along a straight line that does not bend.
Einstein also realized-this is really the most critical part (matter also means "matter")-if you put energy and matter in the universe, the universe will bend. A free-falling object will be deflected and move along a curved path in space when passing a celestial body like the sun.
This is Einstein's great general theory of relativity.
Even the path of light can be bent.
When the bending is large enough, it will revolve around the sun's orbit, just like the earth revolves around the sun and the moon revolves around the earth.
This is the natural curve in the universe.
But Einstein did not realize that if you compress the sun into a ball with a diameter of 6 kilometers-that is to say, if you compress a material equivalent to one million times the mass of the earth into a ball with a diameter of 6 kilometers, you will create a black hole, The density of this object is so great that if the light gets too close to it, it will not escape-leaving a huge black shadow in the universe,
But Einstein always believed that black holes were just a mathematical singularity.
He doesn't believe that black holes really exist.
He believed that nature would prevent the formation of black holes to protect us.
It was decades later that people began to use the term "black hole" and realized that black holes are real celestial bodies-in fact, they are the death of some extremely massive stars after a catastrophic collapse at the end of their lives.
Our sun will not collapse to form a black hole.
Its quality is actually not large enough.
However, if we do some thought experiments – Einstein liked it very much – we can imagine smashing the sun and compressing it within six kilometers, and then placing a small earth in its orbit, such as In orbit 30 kilometers away from the black hole sun.
The earth will shine by itself, because now the sun is gone and we have no other light source – therefore, our little earth has to shine by itself.
You will find that you can even put the earth in an orbit 30 kilometers away from the black hole and make it orbit happily.
This black hole is actually only about the size of Manhattan.
Before it destroys the earth, it may swell to Hudson Street.
But basically this is what we are discussing.
We are talking about an object compressed to half the size of Manhattan.
So we moved this earth to a place close to the black hole – 30 kilometers away – and we noticed it orbited the black hole in a perfect orbit.
There are some rumors that black holes will swallow everything in the universe, but in fact you have to be very close to actually fall in.
But what is impressive is that from our perspective, we can always see the earth.
It cannot hide behind a black hole.
Part of the light emitted from the earth falls into the black hole, but part of it is bent by the black hole and then we see it.
So you cannot hide anything behind a black hole.
If this is the story of Battlestar Galactica and you are fighting the Cylons, don't hide behind the black hole.
They can see you.
Our sun will not collapse into a black hole; its mass is not large enough, but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
If one of them is devouring the Milky Way, it will look like this.
We will see the shadow of a black hole cast on the hundreds of billions of stars in the Milky Way galaxy and dust belts illuminated by stars.
If we fall towards this black hole, we will see light being refracted around the black hole, and we will not even feel that some huge changes are happening quietly when we start to enter this shadow.
If we try to start the rocket and leave there, the result will not be very good, because we cannot escape, not even light.
Although the black hole looks dark from the outside, it is not like that from the inside, because the light from all galaxies can fall into the black hole with us.
And even so, due to the time dilation effect of the theory of relativity, our clock seems to be slower compared to the time of the Milky Way, which looks as if the outer galaxies are accelerating and changing, just before we ourselves are destroyed by the black hole.
It's like experiencing the feeling of dying, you see the light at the end of the tunnel, but this is a complete death experience.
(Laughter) You can't tell anyone that you see the light at the end of the tunnel.
So far, we have never seen the shadow left by such a black hole, but black holes can be heard, even if they cannot be seen.
Imagine in a real astronomical scene-imagine two black holes that have existed together for a long time.
Maybe they were previously stars and then collapsed into two black holes-each of them is 10 times the mass of the sun.
Now we compress them to within 60 kilometers.
They can rotate hundreds of times per second.
At the end of life, they approach each other at the speed of light.
Thousands of kilometers can be traversed in a fraction of a second. In this process, they will not only bend the space, but also cause vibration in the space behind the wake, a kind of real space-time wave.
When the black hole collides with the universe, the space is squeezed and stretched.
These vibrations travel through space at the speed of light.
This computer simulation was done by Goddard's Relativity Group of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
It took nearly 30 years to solve this problem.
This is one of many groups.
It shows two black holes rotating around each other, these are imaginary curves.
As you can see-maybe a little fuzzy-you can see the red waves being emitted, these are gravitational waves.
They are the sounds of the real universe, and these sounds will propagate outward from these black holes at the speed of light as the black holes merge with each other, until the two black holes merge into a quietly rotating black hole.
If you stand close enough, your ears will resonate with the squeezing and stretching of these spaces.
You can really hear these sounds with your own ears.
Of course, you will find helplessly that your head is also squeezed and stretched, so you may not be able to understand what is going on.
But I am willing to play the sound of our prediction for you.
This is the result of my group's research-a relatively simple calculation model.
Imagine a black hole with a smaller mass falling into a black hole with a larger mass.
The sound you hear comes from the collision of a small-mass black hole with space as it approaches a large-mass black hole.
If they are far away, the sound will be very small.
But gradually the sound became like a drumstick beating the space, making the space vibrate like a drum.
We can predict what this voice will become.
We know that in the process of falling, the small-mass black hole will get faster and faster, and the sound will be louder.
Eventually, we will hear that the small black hole has completely fallen into the big black hole.
I never felt this sound was so loud-it was actually amplified here.
When I listened to it at home, I felt that the sound was a bit weak.
It sounds like, Ding, Ding, Ding.
This is another voice simulated by our research team.
I will not show you the image here, because the black hole will not leave any useful traces, and the real space will not show you those virtual curves.
But if you hear this sound when you are on vacation in the universe, I suggest you run quickly.
(Laughs) It's best to stay away from this sound as soon as possible.
Both black holes are moving.
The two black holes are approaching each other.
In this case, they are shaking violently.
Then they will merge into one.
That sharp sound is a sign of black hole fusion-a sharp sound will be emitted when the fusion ends.
This is our prediction of what we will see.
Fortunately, we are very safe in Long Beach, California.
There is no doubt that two black holes have merged together somewhere in the universe.
It is also unquestionable that the space around us can also feel these vibrations that travel a million light years, or from a million years ago, that travel at the speed of light and eventually meet us.
But these sounds are so small that we can't hear them at all.
There are some experiments in the world that require a lot of effort to set up-one of them is called LIGO-which will be able to detect spatial vibrations that are less than one nucleus at a distance of four kilometers.
This is a very bold attempt, and its sensitivity will not be surpassed in the next few years-it will be used to detect spatial vibration.
Another research project on the universe is expected to be launched in the next ten years. This project is called LISA.
LISA will be able to see supermassive black holes-those that are millions or even billions of times the mass of the sun.
In the image returned from the Hubble Telescope, we see these two galaxies.
It looks like they are still hugging each other.
There may be a super black hole with a huge mass in their centers.
But they are not standing still, in fact they are merging.
These two black holes will collide, and their fusion will take billions of years.
Therefore, collecting their sounds has exceeded the limit of our human perception.
But LISA can see the final stage of the two supermassive black holes that began to merge a long time ago, that is, 15 minutes before they merge.
This detection is not limited to black holes, it can also be used to detect any large disturbances in the universe-the biggest disturbance is the "Big Bang".
When the word was coined, some people mocked and said-"Oh, who would believe in the Big Bang?"
This animated short film made by my friend at Proton Studios shows the scene of watching the Big Bang from the outside.
We would never really want to be like this; we want to be inside the universe, because there is no such thing as being outside of the universe.
So, imagine you are in a big bang.
The universe is everywhere, everything in the world surrounds you, and the space is swaying disorderly.
14 billion years have passed, and this voice still lingers around us.
Galaxies are gradually formed, and batches of stars are formed in the galaxy. On a certain planet, there is at least one such planet, suitable for life.
Here, we are crazy to set up experiments, do calculations, and write computer codes.
Imagine two black holes collided a billion years ago.
This voice has been traveling through time and space all the time.
We are not even here.
It is getting closer and closer-40,000 years ago, we were still painting on the walls of the cave.
If the sound we want to acquire is from the Big Bang, it will sound like this.
Strictly speaking, it is noise.
This is a kind of white noise, a chaotic ringtone.
But it is everywhere around us, as long as it is not offset by some other process in the universe.
If we can detect these sounds, it will be like music to our ears, because this quiet echo comes from the moment we were created, from the universe we look up at.
So in the next few years, we will be able to turn up the volume of these soundtracks a little bit, so that the universe is presented to us in audio form.
However, if we can detect those earliest moments, it will also take us one step further from understanding the Big Bang and enable us to ask some of the most difficult and at the same time the most ethereal questions.
If we play the history of the universe backwards, we can know that there was a big bang in the past, and we can even hear its noisy sound, but is our big bang the only big bang in the universe?
I mean we can’t help asking, has there been a similar explosion before that?
Will it happen again in the future?
I want to say that if the significance of this question is raised to the level that TED advocates to trigger people to rethink, at least in this last minute, we can ask some questions, those that we may never be able to answer.
But we can't help asking: Is our universe just an episode in a larger history?
Or maybe we are just a branch in the multiverse – each branch has experienced its own big bang – maybe some of them have buzzing black holes, maybe some don’t – maybe some exist consciously Life, perhaps some do not exist-they do not belong to our past, nor do they exist in our future, but are connected to us in some way?
Therefore, we can't help but wonder, if there is a multiverse, is there life in other branches of this multiverse?
This is life in our multiverse.
Are there other beings in the multiverse? Are they also guessing about our existence, thinking about their own origin?
If so, I can imagine them doing calculations, writing computer codes, setting up experimental instruments, trying to detect the faint sounds from their origins, and wondering who else is there.
Thank you. thank you all.

Graduate art exhibition moved into shopping mall for charity exhibition-Xinhuanet
In the "cloud graduation" season of major colleges and universities, a rare offline graduate art exhibition opened last weekend warmly.
However, it is neither in the art museum nor on the campus, but in the public space of Chaoyang Joy City. It is open to the public for free and will last until August 23.
The reporter learned that this 2020 graduate art exhibition has collected 50 works/groups of 57 young artists from the Central Academy of Fine Arts, Communication University of China and Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts. The exhibition space extends from the 2nd floor to the 6th floor and is fully Use the light box in the building to display the graphic works, which highlights the artistic atmosphere of the graduation season to the greatest extent.
Under the epidemic situation, the significance of this exhibition is particularly special.
Ge Pingyan, the head of Meichen, Chaoyang Joy City, said: "We have chosen to bring the graduation exhibition to the'cloud' back to the offline space again. We also hope that more people can see the youth's exploration of themselves and the understanding of the world. The healing power of art for society and the soul."
She revealed that the works exhibited this time were collected from graduates of several major art colleges, and selected from them suitable for display in commercial spaces. The forms of the works range from traditional easel paintings and sculptures to new media installations and interactions. Animation, VR panorama, volume and richness are the highest in history.
Among them, Li Yunxiao expressed his feelings in this epidemic through a mix of mechanical and manual creative language in "The First Battle of 2020"; Liu Jiaying discussed "Sound Money" through the work "Sound Money" created by the Ethereum blockchain. Themes such as "cryptocurrency", "credibility creation", and "transaction"; Zhang Jiaqi's "Cat Forest" and Qiu Daqiang's "Ji" show animals that often accompany humans, and we can see the young artists' relationship between people and animals Understanding; and Zhu Zhongyu’s work "Winter of Faith—Gifts" reminds young people in their growth, "When one day a successful career, do not forget the original intention, remember that simplicity and sincerity."
Among the few graduates who personally set up the exhibition is Li Jingyin from the Sculpture Department of Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts.
"I came to Beijing on July 7, when I was actually a little worried about the epidemic, and I did a nucleic acid test three days in advance. I brought the alcohol cotton and the test report to the exhibition."
His work "Yesterday is Like a Mystery" has a complicated structure and must be done by himself.

University of Australia develops new drug that is expected to treat blood vessel blockage caused by new crown-Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Sydney, July 26 (Reporter Chen Yu) Researchers at Monash University in Australia are developing a new drug that helps prevent heart disease and stroke, and hope that this drug can be used to treat blood vessels caused by the new coronavirus Blocked.
Researchers have found that before a heart attack or stroke, an enzyme in platelets accelerates platelet clotting.
As a result, they developed a drug that can temporarily inhibit platelet clotting, thereby avoiding clogging of blood vessels and preventing heart disease and stroke.
The researchers said that this drug will only inhibit the clotting effect of platelets when there are signs of heart disease or stroke.
Since studies have shown that similar blood vessel blockage is one of the main causes of death in severely ill patients with new coronary disease, researchers hope that this drug can be used in the treatment of such severely ill patients in the future.
At present, the drug has achieved good results in animal model experiments, and researchers are preparing for the next phase of human clinical trials.
The research results have been published in the American journal "Science and Translational Medicine" a few days ago.

China News Service, Hami, Xinjiang, July 26th, title: Xinjiang is deeply plowing the "sunflower field" and making good use of clean energy
More than 6000 pentagonal heliostats, each 48 square meters, are neatly arranged in a circle, like a silver "sunflower field", which rotates with the sun and reflects the sunlight to the 200-meter-high heat-absorbing tower in the center to realize power generation .
The reporter saw this scene on the 25th at the CLP Engineering Hami molten salt tower solar thermal power plant in Naomaohu Town, Yiwu County, Hami City, Xinjiang.
"The so-called molten salt tower solar thermal power generation is to concentrate sunlight through the mirror surface to the heat absorption tower to form heat energy, and then convert the heat energy into electric energy through traditional power generation technology."
Zhang Yong, deputy general manager of CLP Hami Solar Thermal Power Generation Co., Ltd., said that its design principle is similar to the solar cookers used in rural areas in Northwest China, which must gather sunlight.
The power plant started construction in October 2017 and was connected to the grid at the end of last year. It covers an area of 6,600 mu and plans to install 14,500 heliostats.
"Compared with traditional solar power generation technology, its biggest advantage is that it can store the concentrated heat energy and generate electricity at night."
Zhang Yong said that the 13-hour heat storage system configured in the project can keep the generator set in continuous and stable operation without being affected by changes in light; it can also quickly participate in grid peak shaving according to the demand of grid load peaks and valleys.
After the project is completed, it can generate 198 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, save more than 60,000 tons of standard coal, reduce more than 60 tons of sulfur dioxide, more than 60 tons of nitrogen oxides, about 20 tons of soot, and more than 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide each year. Provide a steady stream of clean energy for the local area.
In addition, there is another silver "sunflower field" in the Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park in Hami City.
The Hami Fuguang Solar Photovoltaic Power Station covers an area of more than 2,300 acres. The 714 power generation equipment that have been built also follow the sun and always maintain a 90-degree right angle between the sunlight and the surface of the concentrating panel.
"We use dual-axis tracking concentrating power generation technology. Through unified integrated control, all power generation equipment will adjust the angle according to the sun's height to maintain power generation efficiency."
Duan Mengqi, the station's head, said that in good weather conditions, the power generation technology can increase the efficiency of conventional photovoltaic power generation by about 20%.
In the first half of this year, the power station has achieved power generation of more than 7 million kWh, supplementing local electricity demand.
Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park is currently a photovoltaic industry demonstration park with the largest monomer scale and the most complete types of photovoltaic modules in Xinjiang. There are 38 photovoltaic power generation projects and a total installed capacity of 820,000 kilowatts.
The power generation completed in the first half of this year exceeded 110 million kWh, an increase of 6% over the same period in 2019.
Hami is one of the regions with the best solar energy resources in China.
The annual average total solar radiation is more than 6,200 megajoules per square meter, and the annual sunshine hours are about 3,200 hours.
In recent years, the city has vigorously developed the photovoltaic industry and planted "sunflower fields."
A solar power generation scale with installed capacity of more than 2.5 million kilowatts has been built. The city's photovoltaic power generation capacity exceeded 1.4 billion kWh in the first half of this year, an increase of about 14% year-on-year.
At present, there are more than 330 grid-connected photovoltaic power stations in Xinjiang, with installed capacity exceeding 10 million kilowatts.
It is estimated that this year's photovoltaic power generation will reach 15 billion kWh, which can replace more than 6 million tons of standard coal.

U.S. media revealed the truth about the U.S. unprovoked request for China to close the Consulate General in Houston
On the 24th, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs notified the US Embassy in China that the Chinese side decided to revoke the permission for the establishment and operation of the US Consulate General in Chengdu, and made specific requirements for the consulate general to stop all business and activities, as a response to the US’s sudden request for China’s closure on the 21st. Countermeasures taken by the Consulate General in Houston.
This behavior of the US government has aroused many concerns, and its political motives have been questioned by foreign media and scholars.
Why is China required to close the consulate general?
Many foreign media said that it is not clear why the United States chose the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, but for the purpose of this move, foreign media bluntly stated: for the general election.
CNN reported on the 23rd that the U.S. request that China close the Consulate General in Houston has aroused public doubts about its political motives.
The article stated that the disastrous response of the US government to the new crown epidemic has caused President Trump's pre-election poll support rate to be relatively low.
White House officials said privately that the tough strategy adopted against China was to save Trump's approval rate and also to shift the responsibility of the White House's failure to respond to the epidemic.
The article believes that the Chinese Consulate in Houston is a "political-driven and very cautious" target chosen by the United States. The US government chose it "to create a tough attitude while avoiding the risk of major conflict."
The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) also believes that when the US election season is approaching and the US economy is severely hit by the epidemic, Trump believes that "playing the'China card' has a political advantage."
The current situation is "a spiraling, tit-for-tat struggle", which is promoted to a certain extent by the US government from the perspective of domestic considerations, and will only worsen the tension between China and the United States.
CBS reported that Trump’s re-election prospects are under pressure due to the outbreak, and he has repeatedly accused China of the outbreak.
Almost every day, the United States takes new actions against Trump's absurd thesis that "China exploits the United States".
"The Consulate General of Houston is very important in establishing ties between the two countries"
The Associated Press commented that the United States' request for China to close its consulate in Houston has aggravated tensions between the two largest economies in the world.
If the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is closed, in addition to diplomatic impact, Chinese citizens located in the southern United States will face difficulties in obtaining consular services, as will American citizens seeking visas and other services.
A Houston business group expressed regret over the US request of China to close the Consulate General in Houston, saying that the Consulate General has played an important role in establishing trade, investment and cultural ties between the two countries.
The Associated Press believes that this reflects the importance of China's economy.
The website of the US "Foreign Policy" magazine believes that the US move "is part of a series of provocative measures that will only worsen US-China relations."
Reuters quoted Jonathan Pollack, an expert on East Asia issues at the Brookings Institution, a US think tank, as saying that since the establishment of comprehensive diplomatic relations between the United States and China in 1979, he could not think of any action that would be compatible with the United States’ attack on the Chinese Consulate in Houston. This action comes on par.
Hong Kong’s "South China Morning Post" reported that this move by the United States was unprecedented in the more than 40 years of diplomatic relations between China and the United States.
Analysts believe that this move may cause lasting damage.
The Chinese Consulate General in Houston was established in 1979 and was the first Chinese Consulate General in the United States.
Currently, China has one embassy and five consulates-generals in the United States.

The spokesperson emphasized that the Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security and has always resolutely opposed and combated any form of cyber attacks and cyber crimes.
A reporter asked: According to the media, hacker organizations related to China have interfered with the network system of a British company, launched attacks on British and American technology companies with patent data, and invaded the government networks of EU countries.
The spokesperson said that the Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security and has always resolutely opposed and cracked down on any form of cyber attacks and cyber crimes.
Cyberspace is highly virtual, difficult to trace, and diverse actors. Sufficient evidence should be presented when investigating and identifying cyber incidents, and no unreasonable guesses should be made.

Free nucleic acid testing in Urumqi, most districts have basically completed secondary testing in high-risk areas
China News Service, Urumqi, July 26 (Reporter Sun Tingwen and Zhao Yamin) Zhang Wei, director of the Urumqi Health Commission, reported on the latest outbreak and nucleic acid testing in Urumqi on the 26th, saying that at present, most areas of Urumqi’s free nucleic acid testing work have been basically completed. carry out.
The expert group of the State Council and the experts of the autonomous region and Urumqi city are making further assessments of the development of the epidemic based on the results of nucleic acid testing and epidemiological investigations.
The Press Office of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region held a press conference on the 26th to report on the epidemic situation and its prevention and control in Xinjiang.
According to him, from 0 am to 24:00 on July 25, 22 new cases of new coronary pneumonia were confirmed in Urumqi City (5 of them were asymptomatic infections converted to confirmed cases), and 38 new cases of asymptomatic infections were added.
As of 24:00 on July 25, Urumqi City has 135 confirmed cases and 147 asymptomatic infections.
The newly-added asymptomatic infections on the 25th were basically detected through the city's free nucleic acid test and active screening.
Zhang Wei, director of the Urumqi Municipal Health Commission, said on the 26th that most districts in Urumqi City have basically completed free nucleic acid testing.
He also said that from the experience of other regions in the country, there are many factors that affect the results of nucleic acid testing, such as the sensitivity of the test reagent, the time of infection and detoxification of the tested person, and the cooperation of the tested person when the specimen is taken (poor cooperation may lead to the specimen Not taken in place) and the testing environment, the operating proficiency of the inspectors, etc.
For various reasons, false negative results can also occur in nucleic acid testing.
The so-called false negative means that the tested person is indeed an infected person, but the nucleic acid test result is negative.
In addition, for people who have had close contact with confirmed cases and suspected cases, two nucleic acid tests are usually required to exclude them.
For people who have been to high-risk areas of the epidemic, if they have fever and respiratory symptoms, a negative nucleic acid test may have a false negative, so two nucleic acid tests are needed to rule out.
He said that, in view of the above situation, for the health of the people of all ethnic groups in the city, starting today, Urumqi City will conduct a second free nucleic acid test in key areas such as Tianshan District and Shayibake District, and carry out "checking for omissions" at the same time.
It is reported that Tianshan District and Shayibak District are high-risk areas of the epidemic.

Representatives of the US-China Business Talks meet in August
Hong Kong’s South China Morning Post quoted an anonymous person familiar with the matter as reporting that Liu He, the head of China’s trade negotiation team and vice premier of the State Council, and Lai Haizhe, co-leader of the US team and trade representative, are expected to hold formal talks in August to assess the performance of the two parties. The situation of the first phase of the US trade agreement.
The report said that although China has substantially increased its purchases of American agricultural products in the past few months, due to factors such as the new crown virus epidemic, China's purchases are still some distance from the amounts promised in the trade agreement.
Analysts say that the recent closure of each other's consulates by the United States and China, together with other disputes, may undermine any progress in trade between the two sides.
The first phase of the Sino-US trade agreement came into effect one month after it was signed on January 15. The agreement stipulates that the high-level trade framework group formed by the two sides should hold talks every six months.
According to people familiar with the matter, the meeting will be "an important turning point" for both parties to assess the progress of the agreement.
But this person also said that if the tension between the United States and China leads to a low willingness to talk at this time, the two sides may agree that the May 8 conference call between Lai Haizhe and Liu He has met the terms of the semi-annual talks in the trade agreement.
Since the beginning of this year, Sino-US relations have deteriorated rapidly. Disputes between the two sides include a series of issues such as the origin of the new crown virus, trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the South China Sea, and ideology.
Although US President Trump boasted about his achievements in the first phase of the agreement at the beginning of the year, his attitude has changed recently.
He said at a White House press conference on the 23rd that although China has recently purchased a record amount of US corn in a single day and has also bought a lot of soybeans, "but this trade agreement is not as meaningful to me as it was when it was reached."
An anonymous Beijing government consultant also believes that due to the poor relationship between the United States and China, a new round of trade negotiations is unlikely to take place.
However, he revealed that Chinese economic and trade related units still met on the 23rd to discuss a series of issues, including how to increase imports from the United States. "We have tried our best to buy, so any additional procurement will be difficult."
Peng Jiening, vice chairman of the US-China Business Council, said that maintaining the momentum of the first phase of the agreement is “more important than ever” and that China has made progress this year in further opening its financial markets to US companies.
An analyst at Plenum, an independent research firm, said: "It is better to talk than nothing, although it may only be regarded as a routine matter."

Everyone was asking if they could go public in the U.S. in the future, but then we discovered that these problems were not a problem on the investors' side. Investors had a recent roadshow to the U.S. for IPO. These questions may be asked, and even become standardized questions, but they are not regarded by investors as an important factor in investing or not investing in a Chinese company.
It is recommended that everyone treat the current situation with a calm mind as much as possible.
Of course, this may seem to be the worst situation in the past two years, but in terms of investor appetite, it has not been affected in any way.
So from now until the end of this year or before the US general election, the upsurge of going to the US for IPOs will continue. "

Compared with the same period last year, it has rebounded, up by more than 52.4%; in terms of industry distribution, the number of IPOs in the healthcare industry in the first half of this year was outstanding, an increase of 100% over the same period last year.
According to Hao Yusheng, the quality of Chinese companies that went to the US for IPO in the first half of this year is relatively high, and high-quality companies with strong fundamentals and growth potential will be more favored by investors.
From a short-term, mid-term and long-term perspective, Hao Yusheng continues to be optimistic about Ming Chinese companies' IPO in the United States.
"In the short term, the upsurge of going to the U.S. for IPOs continues; in the medium term, Chinese companies have more choices. A-shares, Hong Kong stocks, and U.S. stocks. Everyone will consider the U.S. election and Sino-U.S. relations as market choices and timing considerations. In the long run, , Everything will return to normal. Market fluctuations are cycles. There are political cycles and economic cycles, and they will eventually return to the normal stage. The stock market has always moved forward with volatility."
Hao Yusheng also said, “There are many uncertain factors this year, but for high-quality companies, no matter whether the market is good or bad, as long as they are solid and have growth that investors can see, other factors are relatively minor. Yes, investors need to invest in outstanding Chinese companies."

People's Daily Commentator: Concentrate on doing your own affairs well and create new advantages for future development-on studying and implementing General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the entrepreneurs forum-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 25th, People’s Daily, July 26th commentator’s article: Concentrate on doing your own affairs and create new advantages for future development
At present, the global epidemic and the world economic situation are still severe and complex, and the challenges my country faces in its development are unprecedented.
Maintaining strategic determination, enhancing confidence in victory, and focusing our efforts on doing our own affairs are the keys to our response to various risks and challenges.
At the recent entrepreneurs forum, General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized that in the current external environment of rising protectionism, downturn in the world economy, and shrinking global markets, we must concentrate our efforts on our own affairs and give full play to the advantages of the domestic super-large-scale market. , Gradually form a new development pattern with the domestic big cycle as the main body and the domestic and international double cycles mutually promoting each other, improve the modernization level of the industrial chain and supply chain, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation, accelerate key core technology research, and create new advantages for future development.
The one who observes the situation is wise, the one who controls the situation wins.
In the external environment of the in-depth development of economic globalization, the "two ends" of the market and resources have played an important role in the rapid development of our country.
Now, the world under the impact of the epidemic is undergoing profound changes, facing more unstable and uncertain factors, and economic globalization is encountering headwinds and waves of backlash.
To be prepared for a longer period of time to respond to changes in the external environment, and to promote my country’s economy to ride the winds and waves, stabilize and achieve long-term development, an extremely important aspect is to take the expansion and satisfaction of domestic demand as the strategic basis for development, and give full play to its own advantages. Prospering the domestic economy and unblocking the domestic cycle will add impetus to my country's economic development and drive the recovery of the world economy.
We must deeply realize that building a complete domestic demand system has a bearing on my country's long-term development and long-term stability.
The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China reviewed the situation and clearly stated that it is necessary to resolutely implement the strategy of expanding domestic demand. This is the need to cope with the impact of the epidemic, to maintain the long-term sustainable and healthy development of my country's economy, and to meet the needs of the people's ever-growing good life.
The advantage of a major country's economy is that it is internally recyclable.
my country has the world's most complete and largest industrial system, strong production capacity, and complete supporting capabilities. It has more than 100 million market players and more than 170 million people with higher education or various professional skills, including more than 400 million The super large-scale domestic demand market formed by the 1.4 billion middle-income groups is currently in the rapid development stage of new industrialization, informatization, urbanization, and agricultural modernization, with huge investment demand potential.
Public ownership is the main body, multiple ownership economies develop together, distribution according to work is the main body, and multiple distribution methods coexist. The socialist market economic system and other socialist basic economic systems can not only stimulate the vitality of various market entities, liberate and develop social productive forces, It can also promote the organic unity of efficiency and fairness, and continuously realize common prosperity.
We must firmly grasp the strategic basis of expanding domestic demand, make production, distribution, and circulation more dependent on the domestic market to achieve a virtuous circle, clarify the strategic direction of supply-side structural reforms, and promote aggregate supply and aggregate demand to a higher level. Achieve dynamic balance.
It is necessary to accelerate the construction of a complete domestic demand system, vigorously promote technological innovation and other innovations, accelerate the promotion of strategic emerging industries such as digital economy, intelligent manufacturing, life and health, and new materials, form more new growth points and growth poles, and gradually form A new development pattern that takes the domestic cycle as the main body and the domestic and international double cycles promote each other.
Openness brings progress, and closure will inevitably fall behind.
General Secretary Xi Jinping has repeatedly emphasized that China's door to opening up will not close, but will only open wider and wider.
Taking the domestic cycle as the main body, it is by no means a closed door to operate, but by leveraging the potential of domestic demand to better connect the domestic market with the international market, and make better use of the two international and domestic markets and two resources to achieve a stronger and more Sustainable development.
At the same time, there is no contradiction between expanding domestic demand and opening up. The smoother the domestic cycle, the more conducive to building a new pattern of openness, and the more conducive to forming new advantages in participating in international cooperation and competition.
Although the current international protectionist trend is rising, we must stand on the right side of history, persist in deepening reforms, expanding opening up, strengthening open cooperation in the field of science and technology, promoting the building of an open world economy, and building a community with a shared future for mankind.
The Chinese nation has experienced many hardships in history, but it has never been crushed.
On the way forward, there is the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the significant advantages of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, strong mobilization capabilities and strong comprehensive strength, and the unity of the entire party, the army, and the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country. Struggle, we will be able to overcome all difficulties and obstacles, maintain the momentum of my country's economic and social development, build a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way, and smoothly embark on a new journey of building a modern socialist country in an all-round way!
Yu'ebao's revenue declines, "post-90s" but "retaliatory" to save money?
With the decline in Yu'e Bao's income, the "post-90s" not only did not escape from Yu'e Bao, but began to "retaliate" saving money?
The "Yuebao Post-90s Post-90s Savings Report" (2020 version) recently released by the China New Economic Research Institute and Alipay shows that in the first half of the year, post-90s are more likely to save money: the average amount of money saved per capita has increased by nearly 40% compared to 2019.
What's interesting is that "post-90s" tend to start saving from a small amount of money, and 60% of the savings are less than 20 yuan per transaction...…
Saving money with Yu'e Bao has also become the habit of saving money for "post-90s".
Data shows that among the 700 million Yu'ebao users, 134 million are "post-90s."
There are 174 million "post-90s" in China, that is to say, about 3 out of 4 "post-90s" in the country are using Yu'e Bao to save money.
At present, the 7-day annualized rate of return of currency funds such as Yu'ebao has fallen to around 1.5% from a level of higher than 2% at the beginning of the year.
Even so, it did not affect the pace of saving money for the "post-90s".
In the context of the enhancement of Yu'e Bao's “money saving effect”, many young people who are accustomed to using Yu'e Bao have directly transformed into “basic people”.
According to Alipay data, as of July 13, the number of new "basic people" on Alipay has more than doubled year-on-year in the past month, and more and more young people have achieved "advanced" financial management on Alipay.
Some analysts believe that the inflow of funds from Yu'ebao into the stock market is also an important reason for the clear decline in currency fund shares in June.
The report also shows that "post-90s" girls are more inclined to save more money, which is on average 20% higher than that of boys; 60% of users who hold funds on the Alipay platform are men, and women tend to choose more than men. A more robust financial management method.
After saving money, what plans does the "post-90s" have?
Alipay data shows that "post-90s" have the habit of saving money for their goals, and the most users make travel as their goal to save money.
Affected by the epidemic, many "post-90s" save money to prepare for travel after the epidemic; the resumption of movie theaters also provides a new way to switch from saving money to consumption.

France increases military investment in space-Xinhuanet
French Defense Minister Florence Parley said on the 24th that France will add hundreds of millions of euros to its space defense budget to develop space military forces to prevent "unfriendly moves" that other countries may make in outer space.
Parley told the Provence newspaper that between 2019 and 2025, the expenditure budget for French space military projects will increase from the previously planned 3.6 billion euros (approximately 4.2 billion US dollars) to 4.3 billion euros (5 billion US dollars).
According to the French Military Planning Act from 2019 to 2025 approved by the French Parliament in 2018, France is expected to update its existing observation satellites and communication satellites in the future, launch 3 electromagnetic detection satellites, and improve the modernization level of space surveillance radars.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced in July last year that the French Air Force will establish a space military command and an "Aviation and Space Force."
Parley said that she will formally announce the establishment of the space force when she visits a military academy in Salon, Provence.
Parley said that this space force is affiliated to the Air Force and will have 500 personnel by 2025.
She said: "In the past, people thought that space serves the common interests of science. This idea is gone forever. Now space is a place where countries compete for global hegemony."
Parley reiterated Macron's previous statement, saying that France has no intention to provoke an arms race.
"We are by no means engaged in an arms race. But it is my responsibility to thoroughly recognize the threats we may face."
Parley revisited the surveillance of a military satellite shared by France and Italy in 2017.
She said that the "spy" was a Russian satellite.
The Russian side denies this statement.
Parley said that France "soon" will have small patrol satellites that can detect and lock "the black hands behind those unfriendly actions."
French media believe that the reason why France is seeking to establish a space force is due to US President Donald Trump's request in February last year that the US Department of Defense draft a bill to establish a space force.
Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act in December last year, approving the establishment of the sixth largest U.S. service, the Space Force.
Some experts worry that these US measures have accelerated the pace of US space militarization and may trigger a new round of space arms race.

China News Service, Chongqing, July 26 (Reporter Han Lu) The reporter learned from the China Railway Chengdu Bureau Group Co., Ltd. on the 26th that the Zhengwan High-speed Railway Small Three Gorges Tunnel with a total length of about 18.9 kilometers was completed on the same day.
It is understood that the Small Three Gorges Tunnel is not only the longest high-speed rail tunnel within the Three Gorges Reservoir area, but also the longest single-hole double-track high-speed rail tunnel with a design speed of 350 km/h among the projects currently under construction in China.
Zhengzhou-Wanzhou high-speed railway is located in the three provinces and cities of Henan, Hubei and Chongqing. It is connected to the Beijing-Guangzhou and Xulan high-speed rails in the north of Zhengzhou, and the Yu-Wanzhou high-speed rail is connected to Chongqing in the south of Wanzhou. An important part of the Hunan Passage.
The Zhengwan High-speed Railway Small Three Gorges Tunnel was fully completed on the 26th.
The picture shows through the scene.
The Zhengzhou-Wanzhou high-speed railway starts in Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, and runs southwest through Pingdingshan City, Nanyang City, and Xiangyang City in Hubei Province to Wanzhou District of Chongqing City. The new line is about 818 kilometers long, with a design speed of 350 kilometers per hour, and about 184 kilometers in Chongqing.
Among them, the Zhengzhou-Xiangyang section has been opened for operation in advance on December 1, 2019, and the Chongqing section is stepping up its construction.
The Small Three Gorges Tunnel, which passed through on the 26th, is a full-line control project of Zhengwan High-speed Railway. The project is located at the junction of Fengjie County and Wushan County in Chongqing City.
Construction of the tunnel began in February 2017, and the tunnel will be completed on July 26, 2020.
According to Wang Guojun, head of Zhengwan high-speed railway tunnel design at the China Railway Second Academy Engineering Group Co., Ltd., the survey and design party, the small Three Gorges Tunnel is located in very complicated terrain and geological conditions. For Class I high-risk tunnels, tunnel design and construction are extremely difficult.
“During the construction of the project, we used geological survey methods, geophysical methods, and advanced drilling methods to make advance geological predictions, and adopted special design plans for more than 30 caves of various types. For example, we designed and built a 24-meter-long bridge across the tunnel. Large karst caves with a longitudinal length of more than 10 meters and a depth of more than 55 meters can avoid tunnel settlement." Wang Guojun said.
According to the construction party, China Railway Tunnel Bureau, the construction of the tunnel adopted a combination of dredging and blocking, through the construction of horizontal tunnels, grouting, water blocking, strengthening of the tunnel structure support, and construction of sewage treatment stations, which ensured the orderly progress of the project. It also avoids the damage of construction drainage to the water body of the Small Three Gorges Scenic Area. At the same time, it successfully overcomes the construction problems of 7 kilometers long soft rock large deformation and other bad geology, and daily maximum water inflow of 157,000 cubic meters. .
After the Zhengzhou-Wanzhou high-speed rail line is completed and opened to traffic, it will become a new convenient and fast passenger transport channel from Southwest China to the Central Plains, North China, and Northeast China. The process of resource development and urbanization is of great significance to promote coordinated regional development and to promote the implementation of the strategy for the development of the western region.
Experts say it is unconstitutional to collect immigration data through the U.S. Census for seat allocation in the House of Representatives
Some civil rights organizations and several U.S. cities and counties filed suits against the U.S. federal government, claiming that the Trump Presidential Palace’s attempts to exclude undocumented immigrants from the U.S. Census are unworkable and unconstitutional.
The U.S. Census will determine the distribution of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Sarah Brannon, the executive attorney of the American Civil Liberties Alliance, told VOA, "It won't work."
She went on to say that Trump's requirement to determine the citizenship of the census in the census is difficult and "not very reliable."
Another civil liberties organization Common Cause filed a lawsuit on Thursday to challenge Trump's executive order.
Some cities in New Jersey and Georgia joined the lawsuit.
Arlington County, Virginia, also joined the lawsuit on Friday.
Arlington County Board of Management Chairman Garvey said, "The U.S. Constitution requires an accurate count of our population every 10 years. We must accurately count everyone who lives in Arlington County, and we must not let this illegal attempt scare away. People and shrinking the number of our immigrant communities succeeded."
Other organizations and individuals praised President Trump's executive order.
Alabama Attorney General Marshall called the executive order a "victory" for the state.
He said, "The allocation of seats in the House of Representatives and electoral college seats in each state must be based on the number of residents living in each state, and the number of residents living legally."
The US Supreme Court last year prevented the Trump administration from including citizenship issues in the 2020 census form.
President Trump signed an executive order earlier this week instructing the Secretary of Commerce of the U.S. Census Bureau to submit data on the undocumented population obtained from the census so that the administration can exclude these undocumented populations from the state census In addition to the number, and to determine whether each state will increase or decrease or maintain the seats of the House of Representatives.
The United States redistributes seats in the House of Representatives every 10 years based on demographic changes.

Acting in response to the trend and advancing the construction of industrial projects-Viewpoint Headline-Hunan Daily-Huasheng Online
In the midsummer of Hunan, the heat wave is blowing.
The enthusiasm released by the provincial industrial project construction promotion on-site observation meeting overwhelmed the heat of the dog days, and the clear orientation of "comparing the strength of the industry and the hero of the project" agitated the three Hunan and four rivers.
The development of Hunan always depends on building projects and training industries.
Facing the extremely unusual first half of the year, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the whole province insisted on a game of chess, went all out to fight the two tough battles of epidemic prevention and flood prevention, and implemented industrial projects as the implementation of "six stability". The "first move" of "six guarantees".
From a year-on-year decline of 1.9% in GDP in the first quarter to a year-on-year growth of 1.3% in the first half of the year, it is self-evident that the period was difficult and the effort was huge.
In this precious report card, the construction of industrial projects is the key support for Hunan's rapid economic recovery and stable development.
The situation can be smooth and irreversible.
The construction of industrial projects should be put into the overall situation. It is not only good at accumulating, accumulating, and seeking momentum, but also good at recognizing changes, seeking changes, and adapting to changes.
In the current complex and severe background of the current international situation, in addition to the hard work of attracting investment, it is necessary to calm down to study the new characteristics of the current new situation, to grasp the rules, to be more scientific and accurate, and to better integrate into the domestic and international markets. A new development pattern in which dual cycles promote each other.
Pay more attention to improving the basic capabilities of the industry.
In the first half of the year, not only did a large number of heavyweight investment projects in emerging industries break ground and sow hopes in our province, but also enterprises in traditional advantageous industries accelerated their deployment in digital, intelligent, and green industrial transformation.
The Yiyang Aoshikang Third Science Park project transforms the existing production line, and the intelligent high-end printed circuit board production line takes the lead; the new factory area of Hunan China Tobacco Changde Cigarette Factory is committed to intelligent transformation and the process of building a modern factory. Vivid portrayal of "old trees sprout"... Only by focusing on the major national strategy and the "two new and one heavy" strategy, focusing on consolidating and upgrading advantageous industries, actively cultivating and developing emerging industries, and comprehensively increasing technological innovation and localization substitution, can we continue to consolidate basic conditions, Accumulate momentum for transformation.
Pay more attention to cultivating and developing new economics, new business forms and new models.
The sudden new crown epidemic has brought about the popularity of the "cloud economy", stimulated the potential of the digital economy, and provided new opportunities for industrial transformation: in the first half of the year, the province's computer and office equipment manufacturing, electronic and communication equipment manufacturing industries grew by 12.6 %, the online retail sales of wholesale and retail enterprises above designated size increased by 32.2% year-on-year, and the online meal fee income of catering companies increased by 35.6% year-on-year.
It is the general trend to nurture new opportunities amidst the crisis, open a new game amidst changes, actively promote digital industrialization and industrial digitization, and guide the integrated development of the digital economy and the real economy.
Pay more attention to optimizing and stabilizing the supply chain of the industrial chain.
Construction machinery is the main force in Hunan's industry, but two-thirds of the supporting enterprises are outside the province, and there is still room and potential in the supporting chain.
Strengthening industrial chain thinking and grasping projects requires not only the continuous accumulation of leading companies and the realization of technological breakthroughs in key links of the industrial chain, but also the efforts of various regions to cultivate and stimulate the "chain" reaction by strengthening the chain to supplement the chain and promote the coordination of related supporting industries. Layout, and accelerate the construction of an independent, controllable, safe and reliable industrial chain supply chain.
To overcome difficulties and support enterprises, Hunan is still a hot spot and paradise where business environment is good and market opportunities emerge.
All parts of the province have frequently recruited, new and practical measures, in the belief that the "burden reduction" of corporate relief has led to the "acceleration" of high-quality development; Shaoyang implements "shareholder-style" services, and does not shirk shirkiness for enterprises, and does not discount policies. , The problem is not solved overnight... In the process of restoring the losses caused by the epidemic, various "do everything possible" to pinpoint shortcomings and pain points, and turn crises into opportunities.
Focusing on researching, cultivating, and developing industries, and optimizing the business environment steadily, will surely win more investors' favor
The wind and waves are still ahead, but the state of riding the wind and waves has become the norm for the province to focus on the construction of industrial projects and promote high-quality development.
At this critical time, we must learn and implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping’s important instructions, effectively respond to external uncertainties with the certainty of our own work, persevere in promoting industrial project construction, share enthusiasm and sweat to ensure " The 13th Five-Year Plan and the completion of a moderately prosperous society in all respects came to a successful conclusion.

Employment and prices are generally stable, showing that the economy has "temperature"-Chinanews.com

Employment and prices are generally stable, demonstrating the "temperature" of the economy
Lin Huocan, reporter of Economic Daily and China Economic Net
In the first half of this year, facing the impact of the new crown pneumonia epidemic, my country has coordinated efforts to promote epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development. The epidemic prevention and control situation has continued to improve, the economy has been recovering steadily, and the performance of employment and prices that are closely related to people's livelihood are generally stable. , China's economy has handed over a report card of economic performance with warmth.
In the first two months of this year, the surveyed unemployment rate increased.
Especially in February, many enterprises' production and operation activities were basically in a state of suspension of work and production, and enterprises' labor demand decreased, recruitment was delayed or cancelled, and the surveyed unemployment rate in cities and towns increased.
With the gradual improvement of the epidemic prevention and control situation, the production and life order of the whole society has been continuously restored.
The Party Central Committee adheres to the general tone of seeking progress while maintaining stability, further intensifies macro-policy hedging, comprehensively strengthens the employment priority policy, and actively promotes assistance to enterprises to stabilize jobs and expand employment.
my country has stepped up policy hedging to stabilize jobs, hit the "reduction, exemption, delay, return and compensation" policy combination, phased reduction and exemption of three social insurance unit payment parts, allowing deferred payment of social insurance premiums, and expanding the unemployment insurance for small and medium-sized enterprises to reimburse the stable jobs and pay for workers. For the benefit of the training policy, enterprises will be given subsidies for absorbing the employment of key groups, subsidies for internships, etc.
With the implementation of various employment stabilization policies, the demand for employment by enterprises has steadily picked up, the employment situation has gradually improved, and the surveyed unemployment rate in urban areas has gradually decreased. In June, the surveyed unemployment rate was 5.7%.
Zhang Yi, director of the Population and Employment Statistics Department of the National Bureau of Statistics, said that in the second quarter, various employment policies continued to be effective. The labor force who withdrew due to the impact of the epidemic in the early stage returned one after another. The urban labor participation rate in June increased by about 10 percentage points compared with February. The level was close to the same period last year.
Data show that the total urban employment in June increased by more than 19% compared with February, and most industries reached the pre-epidemic level; the average weekly working hours of corporate employees reached 46.8 hours, an increase of 6.6 hours from February and slightly higher than January by 0.1 hours.
Prices are also related to millions of households.
In January this year, the CPI rose by 5.4% year-on-year, setting a new high for many years.
Entering February, although the year-on-year increase of CPI fell slightly, it was still in the “5 range”.
The year-on-year growth rate of CPI is at a high level, due to factors driving consumer demand before the Spring Festival, as well as factors such as the wrong month of the Spring Festival and a low year-on-year base.
However, the impact of the new crown pneumonia epidemic on prices is particularly obvious.
Affected by the prevention and control of the epidemic, in January and February, there were delays in logistics, untimely supply of materials, and increased transportation costs of materials in various parts of the country. In addition, some citizens were hoarding and rushing to buy, and the prices of some daily necessities increased significantly.
In response to the disturbances caused by the epidemic prevention and control to the price situation, relevant departments included important living materials into the scope of emergency transportation guarantee to ensure smooth transportation of materials.
Thanks to a series of policy measures, the market supply of vegetables and fruits has been strongly guaranteed.
In response to the rapid increase in pork prices at the beginning of this year, after the central government promulgated the policy of ensuring supply and stabilizing prices, various regions and departments quickly implemented them. The supply of pork reserves has improved significantly, the production capacity of live pigs has been restored in an orderly manner, and the order of production and sales has gradually become normal.
Since March, pork prices have continued to fall. In May, the year-on-year increase in food prices fell to 10.6%; in June, affected by factors such as the slowdown in slaughter of live pigs, the reduction in imports, and the rebound in group consumer demand, pork prices rose slightly from the previous month.
The seasonal changes in fresh vegetable prices are obvious, with an average increase of 3.4% in the first half of the year.
Affected by the high comparison base in the same period last year, the price of fresh fruits continued to decline year-on-year, with an average drop of 13.3% in the first half of the year.
The basic lives of the people are effectively guaranteed, and the overall economic and social situation remains stable and orderly.
With the gradual recovery of transportation and logistics, various regions have increased their efforts to ensure supply, and the market supply and demand situation has improved.
Beginning in March, the CPI fell for four consecutive months, and the year-on-year growth rate dropped from 4.3% in March to 2.5% in June. The overall price level returned to stability.
In the second half of the year, my country's prices will continue to remain at a moderate level, and overall inflationary pressure will not be large, but it is still necessary to promote the restoration of production and living order under the premise of normalizing epidemic prevention and control.
Effectively respond to natural disasters such as floods and droughts in the main agricultural production areas such as grains, fruits and vegetables, strengthen market supervision, and resolutely crack down on behaviors that disrupt market order such as hoarding and price hikes.

As an artist, contact is very important to me.
Through my art work, I try to clarify that human beings are not separated from nature but everything is connected to each other.
I went to Antarctica for the first time about 10 years ago, and I saw an iceberg for the first time.
I am in awe.
My heart thumped quickly, dizzy and dizzy, trying to understand what this was before me.
The iceberg next to me surfaced almost 200 feet. I can only find it very strange that this is the result of one snowflake covering another snowflake, year after year.
Icebergs are formed when they break away from glaciers or from ice shelves.
Each iceberg has its own unique personality.
They interact with their surrounding environment and their situation in a distinct way.
Some icebergs refuse to compromise and persevere to the end, while other icebergs cannot bear to burst into water and ice under a violent spurt of passion.
When you see icebergs, it's easy to think that they are all isolated, they are independent, separate, and more like what we humans sometimes think of ourselves.
But the reality is far more than this.
As the iceberg melted, I breathed its ancient smell.
As the iceberg melts, it releases mineral-rich fresh water that nourishes everything.
I set out to photograph these icebergs as if I was photographing portraits of my ancestors, learning that at these individual moments the icebergs existed in that way but never existed like that again.
When they melt, this is by no means death; it is by no means an end, but a continuation of the road to endless life.
Some of the icebergs I have photographed are very young - thousands of years old.
Some ice is more than one hundred thousand years old.
The last picture I want to show you is an iceberg I took on Kekertsuatsiak in Greenland.
This is a very rare opportunity for everyone to actually witness an iceberg rolling.
So this is as shown in the figure.
On the left you can see a small boat.
This is a boat about 15 feet.
I want you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and its deformation on the water.
Here you see it start to roll, the boat moves to the other side, and a man is standing there.
This is an average size Greenland iceberg.
It surfaced approximately 120 feet or 40 meters high.
This video was shot in real time.
(Music) Just like this iceberg, they show you different aspects of their personality.
Thank you.
(applause)

Author Hu Guilong Pan Yujie
"In the midsummer Qinghai Lake, there are eyes full of golden flowers and thousands of bees flying. The altitude here is high, the temperature difference between day and night is large, and the air pollution is low. Contains nutritional value, low sugar and low fat characteristics."
On the 26th, Zhang Jianxun, deputy director of the Industry and Information Administration of Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, said.
On the same day, the live broadcast of bee products with the "One Heart Fighting Epidemic Spring Pulp to Help Farmers" was held on the banks of Qinghai Lake. The Chinese Bee Products Association, representatives of entrepreneurs, and beekeepers gathered together to promote Qinghai's characteristic bee products, which were sold online and offline. 10,000 bottles of Qinghai Plateau Royal Jelly, with a total of nearly 3.8 million yuan.
The picture shows beekeepers on-site displaying bee products.
It is reported that this live delivery event has facilitated the exchange and cooperation of "enterprise + beekeeper + grower" with the help of Beijing Houdeli Bee Industry Chain Store Network, Kuaishou, Taobao and other well-known domestic bee product retail companies, live broadcast, and e-commerce platforms. Through online and offline channels, the “Qinghai Plateau Spring Milk Consumption Coupons” were continuously issued to consumers. It is estimated that the company will make a total profit of nearly 5.28 million yuan throughout the year.
In this regard, Wu Na, president of Beijing Houdeli Bee Industry Co., Ltd., believes that "it is worth it": "This move can expand the popularity of Qinghai bee products, attract more consumers to understand and like pure and natural bee products without additives, and drive bee products. Farmers’ income increases."
At present, the company has signed production cooperation strategic agreements with Qinghai Cloud Bee Industry Co., Ltd. and Qinghai Huabao Bee Industry Co., Ltd., hoping to jointly promote the rapid development of Qinghai's local bee industry.
The picture shows the sea of rape blossoms by the Qinghai Lake.
This spring, because of the need for epidemic prevention and control to set up road access barriers in various places, the path of beekeepers "chasing flowers and honey" was blocked. Many bees died due to missed flowering and lack of food, and the income of beekeepers was seriously affected.
"At the end of the year, the beekeepers traveled long distances from Yunnan and Sichuan all the way north to the northwest region following the flowering period.
As a business, we have a responsibility to help them. "
Wu Na said.
"Little bees are'environmental scouts', and bees cannot survive in heavily polluted areas." Zhao Xiaochuan, executive vice president of China Bee Products Association, introduced that bee pollination is an important link in the ecological chain, which is important for protecting plant diversity and improving ecology. The environment has an irreplaceable role.
At the same time, bee pollination can increase the yield and quality of crops, especially in areas with a wide variety of crops and poor management conditions, the significance of pollination is greater.
Research data shows that pollination can increase rapeseed yield by 15%-30%.
The picture shows Zhao Xiaochuan (right), executive vice president of China Bee Products Association, promoting Qinghai bee products.
"The economic, ecological and social benefits created by bee pollination are far greater than the value of bee products themselves. The bee industry has huge potential in human health, crop production, vegetation reproduction, and ecological protection, and people have always been little aware of this."
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
Nowadays, the number of beekeepers is decreasing. In addition to beekeepers who are always on the move, there are still many poor households with limited mobility who choose to use beehives to invest in cooperatives.
"The state has financial support. We contact technical personnel for help and guidance. The beekeepers lack understanding and judgment of the market environment. To open a market, they also need the help and coordination of the government, enterprises, and industry associations."
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
"I hope everyone will pay more attention to and help beekeepers in the future," said Wu Na. "Our bee products are also screened and controlled in strict accordance with national standards to ensure quality and protect consumer rights while helping beekeepers."

Economic Observer Network reporter Rao Xianjun, on July 26, Greenland Holdings (600606.SH) issued the "Reminder Announcement Regarding the Transfer of Part of the Company's Shares and the Resumption of Trading through Public Solicitation of Transferees by State-owned Shareholders."
The content of the announcement shows that, in order to further deepen the reform of state-owned assets and state-owned enterprises, optimize the adjustment of state-owned assets, and improve the equity structure of Greenland, Shanghai Real Estate (Group) Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Shanghai Real Estate") and Shanghai Urban Investment (Group) Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as " "Shanghai Urban Investment") intends to transfer some of the company’s shares through an agreement through public solicitation of transferees, and the total proportion of shares to be transferred shall not exceed 17.5% of the total share capital of Greenland.
The price of the shares to be transferred this time shall not be lower than the higher of the following two: the arithmetic average of the daily weighted average price of the 30 trading days before the informative announcement date (July 27, 2020); the most recent one The company’s audited net asset value per share for the fiscal year.
At present, the new strategic investor in Greenland is still inconclusive. According to the estimation of the public announcement, the new strategic investor will need to pay about 14 billion yuan to acquire the 17.5% equity transferred in the mixed reform of Greenland.
It is worth noting that after the completion of the share transfer, it is expected that Greenland will still have no controlling shareholders and actual controllers, but the control structure may undergo major changes.
Since its establishment, Greenland Holdings has carried out many system and mechanism reforms: from 1992 to 1997, it operated in accordance with market-oriented rules under a purely state-owned system; from 1997 to 2013, it established and continuously improved the state-controlled and employee-owned shareholding system; 2013 From 2015 to 2015, it introduced strategic investors to form a mixed ownership system of cross-shareholding and mutual integration of state-owned and non-public capital; since 2015, it has been listed as a whole and has become a public company.
The current mixed reform plan of Greenland is similar to Gree. In December 2019, Hillhouse Capital led Zhuhai Mingjun to take over 15% of Gree Electric (000651.SZ) with 41.662 billion yuan. Gree Group retreated to a minority shareholder. After the mixed reform was completed, Gree Electric has implemented modern corporate management methods such as the executive incentive plan and no actual control structure.
Shanghai Real Estate and Shanghai Urban Investment are both state-owned enterprise groups wholly-owned by the Shanghai SASAC. Zhang Yuliang, Chairman and President of Greenland Holdings, said that the move by Greenland is Shanghai in accordance with the requirements of the Party Central Committee to promote the comprehensive reform of state-owned and state-owned enterprises and accelerate the new one. The important measures taken in the reform of state-owned assets and state-owned enterprises at this stage fully demonstrate the new thinking of reform in accordance with local conditions and tailor-made. By introducing new outstanding strategic shareholders to listed companies, supporting enterprises to further increase the degree of marketization, increase the degree of freedom of operation and management, and accelerate the full release of reform vitality.
Inter-provincial travel resumes the nation's first inter-provincial high-speed train travel special train-Xinhuanet.com
Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, July 25th (Reporter Li Ping) At 12:20 on July 25th, more than 200 Shanghai tourists who took the D771 motor train successfully arrived in Lanxi City, Zhejiang Province. This was also July 14th by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism. Since the resumption of inter-provincial (regional, municipal) group tours, the first inter-provincial EMU train traveled across the country.
Lanxi City, located in the central and western part of Zhejiang, has beautiful scenery. There are many scenic spots such as Zhuge Bagua Village, Underground Long River, Zhiyan Ancient Village, etc. During the two-day and one-night itinerary, more than 200 Shanghai tourists will appreciate these scenic spots one by one.
Li Li, deputy general manager of Shanghai Railway International Tourism (Group) Co., Ltd., said that the company closely followed the needs of inter-provincial travel in accordance with the latest policies, communicated with Lanxi City as soon as possible, and carefully launched "Shanghai to Lanxi" and "Summer Lotus "Two-day Tour" product, the product was sold out in less than a week after launch.
Aunt Sun from Shanghai said that because of the epidemic, she has not gone out this year.
"I have been bored at home for a long time. When I saw a group tour, I immediately shared the news with my friends to sign up. I have never been to Lanxi before and look forward to this trip very much," said Aunt Sun.
It is understood that in September last year, Lanxi City and Shanghai Railway International Tourism (Group) Co., Ltd. signed a strategic cooperation agreement on the "Take High-speed Rail·Travel to Lanxi" project, planning to open 12 high-speed rail tourism trains from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai and Anhui to Lanxi within one year.
I slap myself?
U.S. White House advisers "bite" back to work prematurely in various states-Chinanews.com
U.S. White House consultants "bite back" states to resume work too early
On July 23, local time, the number of confirmed cases of new coronary pneumonia in the United States exceeded 4 million, accounting for 30% of global cases.
Over the past few months, US President Trump has repeatedly asked all states across the country to resume work and school. It was only recently that he changed his attitude and took the initiative to wear masks in public, and his consultants even "bited back" and said that some state governments resumed work too early.
On the 22nd, White House presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway stated at a press conference that some state governments had failed to comply with resumption standards and had restarted places such as bars prematurely.
Conway also mentioned that the previous claim that the president has the "absolute power" to decide the resumption of work in each state is a misrepresentation.
"The president is a federalist, and he believes that all states have autonomy."
She defended Trump.
However, the "rumors" in Conway's mouth were personally spoken by Trump at the White House epidemic briefing on April 13.
This self-slapped operation was mocked by netizens as "rewriting history."
Kylian Conway wants to rewrite history. She is a liar.
Trump called Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer a dictator because she followed medical guidelines and insisted on stopping work.
Trump wants to promote the resumption of work so that he can hold a rally.
This is not the first time Kylian Conway has caused controversy.
On April 15, when Conway was interviewed by Fox News, he blurted out: "This is COVID-19, not COVID-1, friends!"
She seemed to understand "19" as a version number and was frantically ridiculed by netizens: read the newspaper without common sense!
Recently, we have seen the impact of cyber attacks on the business world.
Data leaks from companies such as JPMorgan Chase, Yahoo, Home Depot, and Target have resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars, or even billions of dollars, in losses.
With a few more attacks like this, the entire world economy will collapse.
The public domain is not immune.
From 2012 to 2014, a very serious data breach occurred in the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.
Security clearance and fingerprint information were stolen, affecting 22 million employees.
You may have also heard that some government-sponsored hackers try to use stolen data to influence the results of elections in some countries.
The two most recent incidents were a large-scale data theft incident in the German Bundestag, and the other was an e-mail theft incident in the US Democratic National Committee.
Cyber threats have affected our democratic process.
And there is a growing trend.
The more advanced computer technology is, the weaker the methods we use to protect data.
Especially a new kind of computer technology called quantum computer, which uses microscopic particles in nature to greatly increase the computing power of computers.
Its computing power is so powerful that it can crack many of the encryption systems we use today.
So are we hopeless?
Should we start packing up electronic survival equipment to welcome the coming data doomsday?
I think it is not there yet.
Quantum computers still only exist in the laboratory, and it will take several years before actual use.
More importantly, there have been many major breakthroughs in the encryption field.
For me, this is a very exciting time in the history of secure communications.
About 15 years ago, I learned that we have unlocked new skills that can create quantum effects that do not exist in nature. I am very excited.
The idea of using the basic laws of physics to advance the development of encryption technology excites me.
Today, some selected companies and laboratories, including mine, have advanced this technology to the stage of practical application.
That's right.
We intend to use quantum to fight quantum.
How to achieve it?
First, let's take a quick look at the world of encryption.
You need a briefcase, and you have some important documents to give to your good friend, James Bond, to lock it up for safety.
Because these materials are top secret, we are going to use a super advanced briefcase.
It is equipped with a special code lock, once locked, the content of the file will be converted into random numbers.
So you just put the file in and lock it. At this time, the file has been converted to a random number, and you give this briefcase to James.
When the briefcase has not been delivered, you call to tell him the password.
Once he got the briefcase, entered the password, the file was deciphered, it was perfect, and you successfully passed an encrypted message to James Bond.
(Laughter) A fun example, but it illustrates the 3 key points of encryption.
Password-we call it an encryption key.
You can think of it as a password.
The phone call that told James the code.
We call it secret key transfer.
This ensures that we can safely deliver the secret key to the designated location.
And the lock used to encrypt and decrypt files.
We call it an encryption algorithm.
With the secret key, it converts the contents of the file into random numbers.
A good algorithm can do this, it is difficult to crack the password without the secret key.
The importance of the algorithm is that if someone gets a briefcase and opens it, without the secret key and without knowing the encryption algorithm, they cannot read the contents of the document.
All you get is some random numbers.
Most security systems rely on a secure key transfer method to deliver the secret key to the right place.
However, the rapidly growing computing power has endangered many of the key transfer methods we currently use.
To give an example, we now use a very widely used system-RSA.
When it was invented in 1977, it took about 4 quadrillion years to crack a 426-bit RSA key.
In 1994, only 17 years later, the password was cracked.
As computer performance becomes stronger, the passwords we need are getting longer and longer.
Now we often use 2048 or 4096-bit passwords.
As you can see, the battle between the encryptor and the decryptor is going on, both want to defeat the other.
In the next 10 to 15 years, the arrival of quantum computers will crack complex mathematical algorithms faster. These algorithms are the foundation of the encryption system we use today.
In fact, quantum computers will turn our security castle into a one-touch house of cards.
We must try to protect our castle.
In recent years, many research institutions have emerged to study how to use quantum effects to enhance encryption.
People have made some exciting breakthroughs.
Remember the 3 key points of encryption? High-quality secret keys, secure secret key transfer and strong algorithms.
However, advances in science and engineering have jeopardized two of the key points.
The first to bear the brunt is the secret key.
Random numbers are the basis of the secret key.
But today, they are no longer truly random.
At present, we generate secret keys based on the frequency of random numbers and generated by software, which we call pseudo-random numbers.
There will always be some numbers generated by programs or mathematical methods, and maybe not so obvious rules are in them.
The lower the randomness of these numbers, or in terminology, the lower the moisture content, the easier they are to predict.
Recently, some casinos have been attacked, and the method of attack is very creative.
They aimed at the slot machine and filmed for a period of time and then analyzed.
Cybercriminals use reverse engineering to create a pseudo-random number generator behind the turntable.
In this way, they have a high probability of predicting the rotation of the turntable and making a lot of money.
The secret key is also insecure.
Having a true random number generator is important for generating secure passwords.
For several years, researchers have been trying to create a real random number generator.
But most designs are either not random enough, fast enough, or difficult to reuse.
But the quantum world is truly random.
It is very important to take advantage of this true randomness.
A device capable of measuring quantum effects can generate a continuous stream of random numbers very quickly.
The casino crime just mentioned is no longer possible.
Several universities and companies from all over the world are concentrating on making true random number generators.
In my company, our quantum random number generator was born from an optical table with a length of 2 meters and a width of 1 meter.
Then we reduced it to the size of a box.
Today, it can be installed on a PCI card and plugged into an ordinary computer.
This is the fastest and truly random number generator in the world.
It can generate 1 billion random numbers per second by measuring quantum effects.
Today it has been widely used all over the world to improve the security of cloud service providers, banks and government agencies.
(Applause) But even with a real random number generator, we still face the second major cybersecurity threat: that is the secure transmission of secret keys.
The current secret key transmission technology cannot fight against quantum computers.
The quantum solution to this problem is called quantum key distribution, or QKD for short, which utilizes a fundamental counterintuitive property of quantum mechanics.
Observing the behavior of microscopic particles will change this particle.
Let me illustrate with an example.
Let's think about it again, and give the password to James Bond.
But this time, we don’t call him. We use the quantum effect to carry the code with a laser beam and pass it to James through an ordinary optical fiber.
Let's assume that Dr. Nou wants to get this code.
Fortunately, Dr. Nou will leave an electronic fingerprint in the process of trying to intercept this quantum key, which James and you can detect.
In this way, the intercepted key will be invalidated.
The remaining secret key can provide strong protection for the data.
Because this security mechanism is based on the basic principles of physics, it is impossible for a quantum computer or any future supercomputer to crack it.
My team and I are working with many top universities and defense departments to improve this exciting technology and develop next-generation security products.
The Internet of Things heralds the advent of a highly interconnected era, and it is estimated that 25-30 billion devices will be connected to the Internet by 2020.
For our society to function properly in the world of Internet of Things, trust in these systems of interconnected devices is crucial.
We believe that quantum technology will be very important for building this trust. It will ensure that we fully enjoy these magical innovations, and enjoy these innovations that can enrich our lives.
thank you all.

Is it reasonable for a 3-year-old child to be smashed while playing in the college playground.
2020-07-26 05:01:11 Source: Legal Daily Author: Wang Sishuo Editor: Wang Sishuo
The playground was smashed, and the child was compensated before suing the school
□ Correspondent Zhao Yifan
The 3-year-old Xiaowen was accidentally hit in the head by Chen of the softball team while playing in the playground of a certain university.
After Chen made the compensation, Xiaowen's father, Mr. Wen, served as Xiaowen's legal representative to the school to the court, demanding an apology from the school where the incident occurred, and payment of medical expenses, mental damage relief, etc. totaling 20,000 yuan.
Recently, after hearing the case, the People’s Court of Haidian District of Beijing held that the school had set up a protective net on the playground at the time of the incident, and that it had fulfilled its obligations to ensure proper safety, and Chen had already paid compensation. Based on this judgment, the plaintiff’s decision was rejected. Claims.
Mr. Wen claimed that he took Xiaowen to play on the school playground during the summer vacation of 2019, when the softball team was training on the playground.
In order to avoid the risks posed by this, Xiaowen, Mr. Wen and many other children and parents play in safe areas designated by the softball team.
But then the softball player Chen dropped his hand while pitching, causing the softball to fly over the guard net into the above-mentioned safe area and hit the back of Xiaowen's head.
Mr. Wen immediately took Xiaowen to the hospital for treatment and was diagnosed with head trauma.
Mr. Wen believes that the school stadium facilities do not comply with relevant safety regulations, and the team and related facilities have not been effectively managed.
The school’s negligence caused the above incidents to occur, which caused Xiaowen to suffer tremendous physical and mental pain, and at the same time brought greater pain to his family. The school should bear legal responsibility for this.
In response, the school argued that the school had set up a protective net on the playground, and posted management regulations and training notices, informing them that entering the playground must keep a safe distance from the training site and reminding their own safety. The plaintiff could not prove that the school was “not enough. "Safety guarantee obligation", so I do not agree to compensation.
After the trial, the court held that the site involved in the incident was a site open to the public free of charge by the university involved. Although the school has a safety guarantee obligation for the management of the playground, this safety guarantee obligation only needs to meet the general duty of care.
At the time of the incident, the school set up a protective net on the playground, and has fulfilled its proper safety guarantee obligations. Chen also compensated Xiaowen for various losses including medical expenses and transportation expenses in accordance with the previously reached compensation agreement. Both parties It is agreed that this dispute will be resolved at one time.
After the incident, Xiaowen's parents again claimed compensation from the school. There was no basis in the law. The court ruled that all the plaintiff's claims were rejected.
After the verdict was pronounced, neither party appealed, and the verdict is now in effect.
According to Article 37 of my country’s Tort Liability Law, schools, as managers of public places, have the obligation to ensure safety; in the event that the actions of a third party cause damage to others, the third party bears tort liability, but the safety protection is not fulfilled. The responsible public place manager shall bear corresponding supplementary responsibilities.
The judge stated that as a manager of a public place, he is most likely to understand the actual situation of the entire place and foresee possible dangers and damages, so that he is most likely to take necessary measures to prevent the occurrence of losses or reduce the extent of damage, and to avoid and mitigate them. The cost of damage is the lowest, so the law stipulates that it shall bear the corresponding guarantee obligations for engaging in social activities.
In this case, for unspecified people entering the playground that is free to the public, the school’s safety guarantee obligations should be compatible with the social activities it engages in. Specifically, it should take basic safety measures and deal with hidden dangers. Have the obligation to inform.
In judicial practice, it is not appropriate to impose excessive safety guarantee obligations on managers of public places.
If the school has set up a protective net and fulfilled its obligation of notification, it can be determined that the school is not at fault and should not bear legal responsibility.
In addition, for third-party infringements, even if the administrators of public places such as schools fail to fulfill their obligations to ensure safety, their liability is a supplement to compensation for damages. According to the latest civil code, after the administrator assumes additional liability, You can also claim compensation from a third party.
Therefore, in such accidents, the victims should not expand the scope of compensation after they have received compensation from the direct infringer.
Today I want to show you how we will make things in the future.
I believe that soon our buildings and machines will be able to assemble, replicate and repair themselves.
So I want to show you what I think is the current state of the manufacturing industry, and then compare it with some natural systems.
So in the current manufacturing industry, we have skyscrapers-in two and a half years, 500,000 to millions of parts, very complex, using new technologies in steel, concrete and glass.
We have exciting machines that can take us into space - 2.5 million parts in five years.
But on the other hand, if we look at the natural system, we have two million types of proteins that can be folded in ten thousand nanoseconds, and we can analyze DNA with three billion base pairs in about an hour. Make a copy.
This is the complexity of our natural systems, but they are very efficient, more efficient than anything we build, and more complex than anything we can build.
They are more energy efficient.
They rarely make mistakes.
They can repair themselves to maintain longevity.
There is a super interesting thing about natural systems.
If we can transform it into our built environment, then the way we build things will have a lot of potential.
I think the key is self-assembly.
If we want to use self-assembly in our own physical environment, I think there are four key factors.
The first is that we need to decode all the complexity of what we want to build-our buildings and machines.
We need to decode them into simple sequences-basically the DNA of our building operations.
Then we need the programmable part that can accept this sequence and be used for folding or reshaping.
We need some energy to activate, so that these parts of us can be folded in accordance with the program.
We need some type of error correction redundancy to ensure that we successfully build what we want.
Therefore, I want to show you some of the projects that my colleagues and I are working on to realize this self-assembled future.
The first two projects are MacroBot and DeciBot.
These projects are large-scale reconfigurable robots-8-foot, 12-foot long proteins.
They are embedded in electromechanical equipment, sensors.
You need to decode the way you want to fold into, decode into a series of angles — minus 120 degrees, minus 120 degrees, 0 degrees, 0 degrees, 120 degrees, minus 120 degrees, — things like this; a series of angles, or To turn, you can pass this sequence through the wire.
Each unit gets its own message—for example, minus 120. It rotates, checks whether it rotates in place, and then transmits the sequence to its neighbors.
There are many outstanding scientists, engineers, and designers working on this project.
I think this project really reveals: Is this really scalable?
I mean, it cost thousands of dollars and many people to make this eight-foot robot.
Can we really expand it? Can we really embed robots in every part?
The next question is to look at passivity, or passively try to make reorganization programmable.
But it goes one step further, it tries to make actual calculations.
It basically embeds the basic building blocks of most calculations, digital logic gates, and directly enters each part.
This is a NAND gate.
There is a tetrahedron on each gate to be used for calculation, and there are two input tetrahedrons.
One of them is input from the user, just like you are building a brick.
The other is the input of a brick placed before coming.
Then it will give the output in three-dimensional space.
This means that users pile up bricks the way they want.
It calculates based on what you have done before and your instructions.
Now it starts to move in three-dimensional space-up or down.
Looking at the left, the input of [1,1] is equal to the output of 0, which means downward.
On the right, the input of [0,0] is 1 output, which means upward.
So what this really means is that our structure now contains the blueprint we want to build.
So the information about what you want to build is all embedded in it.
This means that we have some form of self-replication.
In this case, I call it self-directed replication, because your structure contains precise blueprints.
If you encounter an error, you can replace a part.
All local information is embedded in it, telling you how to fix it.
So you have something to climb, you can read it and output one by one.
It is directly embedded; there is no external command input.
The last project I want to show is called the eccentric chain, and it may be the most exciting example of the passive self-assembly system we see now.
Its reconfigurability and programmability make it a completely passive system.
Basically you have a series of elements.
Every element is exactly the same, and they are eccentric.
Every chain, or every element, wants to turn right or turn left.
If you want to assemble a chain, you need to program it.
Tell each unit whether to turn left or right.
When you shake this chain, it folds to program whatever structure you have coded for it - so in this case, a spiral, in the case of fire, two connected cubes.
Basically you can program in three-dimensional space-or one-dimensional or two-dimensional-the chain is completely passive.
What kind of future does this foretell us?
I think this tells us the possibility of self-assembly, self-replication and self-repair in our body structure, our buildings and machines.
There is new programmability in these parts.
From this you can gain new possibilities for calculations.
We will have room to calculate.
Imagine our buildings, bridges, machines, all bricks can be actually calculated.
What an amazing parallel computing and distributed computing power and new design possibilities.
This is an exciting potential.
I think these projects I show you are just a small step towards the future, if we realize these new technologies for a new self-assembled world.
Thank you.

Under the normalization of epidemic prevention and control, people's enthusiasm for exercise and fitness is high.
With the gradual liberalization of inter-provincial tourism business, the tourism market is also about to usher in a recovery.
Fujian Province has resumed its inter-provincial tourism business from July 21. In the first weekend after opening, Xiamen, a popular tourist destination, ushered in a peak in passenger flow.
As a popular tourist destination city, many tourists arrive in Xiamen on weekends.
Xiamen Railway Station expects that Shuyun will send 3.7 million passengers, while the passenger flow at the airport is dominated by students, tourists, and visiting relatives.
The tourism market is gradually picking up. In July, Xiamen Airport operated an average of 440 flights per day, and domestic flights had recovered to 80% of the pre-epidemic value.
Airlines have encrypted the air express lines from Xiamen to Shanghai, Beijing, Kunming, Xi'an and other major cities to seize the revived tourism market.
At present, many travel agencies in Xiamen have successively launched a batch of domestic cross-provincial tourism products during summer vacations, and the group itinerary is mainly based on outdoor attractions.
In response to the summer passenger traffic peaks in railway stations and airports, relevant units have deployed additional manpower in areas where people are easy to gather such as check-in counters and security check lanes. Fujian has also optimized and upgraded the "Bamin Health Code" to achieve a 31 Health data sharing and mutual recognition between the provinces have promoted the orderly recovery of the tourism market.
Can Andy Lau and Liu Qingyun "dismantle" new sparks-Xinhuanet
"Bomb Disposal Expert 2" recently announced that it will be released on December 24, becoming the first fixed-file movie for the Lunar New Year.
The second part is still directed by Qiu Litao, and produced by Andy Lau and starred in a new story.
It is reported that the addition of the "nuclear bomb" element in the second part also makes the challenge faced by the bomb disposal experts more difficult. The few stunning shots in the trailer have been hanging on the heart. The mushroom cloud of the big explosion has been burnt. The scene of the engulfed airport was quite shocking.
Three years ago, "The Bomb Disposal Expert" produced by the original team won the 51 box office champion of the year and won 7 nominations at the Hong Kong Film Awards. Qiu Litao × Andy Lau also became the audience's mind. Gold medal partner.
This time, "Bomb Disposal Expert 2" also makes people look forward to whether this pair of ace combinations can spark new sparks.
"Bomb Disposal Expert 2" tells a new story: The former bomb disposal expert Pan Chengfeng (Andy Lau) fainted at the scene of the bombing and was listed as a suspect by the police.
In order to find the truth, he had to ask his friend Dong Zhuowen (Liu Qingyun), who is also a bomb disposal expert, for help.
The female inspector eager to solve the case and Pang Ling (Ni Ni), who is also Pan Chengfeng's ex-girlfriend, was also involved.
I am still an expert in bomb disposal, but from the preview of the movie, I can feel the complexity of Andy Lau's new role: I broke a leg and put on a prosthetic leg. action.
What kind of relationship is the three of them, what exactly did Andy Lau do at the Island Hotel, what kind of cases he was involved in, and what twists and turns he has experienced in his career as a bomb disposal expert. The mysteries make people curious.
It is understood that the highlight of the film is to view Hong Kong’s world landmarks on the spot, coupled with the top special effects production team, to bring shocking and realistic visual impact.

Do you know how many flowering plants there are?
There are 250,000 species-at least as many as we know-of 250,000 flowering plants.
And flowers are a nuisance.
It is really difficult to breed plants.
It requires a lot of experience and a lot of resources.
Why is it so troubled?
Of course, the answer is, like many other things in the world, gender.
I know what you think in your head when you look at these pictures.
The reason why sexual reproduction is so important-plants have many other ways to reproduce.
You can use cuttings; you can reproduce with both sexes on the same plant; you can pollinate with the same plant.
But they do need to spread their genes to mix with other genes so that they can be ecological.
This is how evolution works.
Now the way plants transmit this information is through pollen.
Some of you may have seen these pictures before.
As I said, every family should have a scanning electron microscope that can see these.
There are as many different types of pollen as there are kinds of flowering plants.
This is actually quite useful for forensics and so on.
Most of the pollen that causes us to get hay fever comes from plants that use wind to spread pollen. This is a very inefficient process, which is why pollen always gets into our noses.
Because most of them have been discarded, it is hoped that the germ cells contained in the pollen, the male germ cells, will happen to fall on another flower.
All grass, which means all grains, and most trees spread pollen by the wind.
But most species actually use insects to accomplish this process. In a way it’s smarter, because it doesn’t require too much pollen.
Insects and other species can carry pollen and transfer it directly to where it is needed.
Obviously, we have noticed the relationship between insects and plants.
This is a symbiotic relationship. Whether it is a bird or a bee, they can get rewards, usually nectar.
Sometimes this symbiotic relationship can lead to wonderful adaptive changes-the red skirt hawk moth is a beautiful adaptive change.
Plants are also harvested, and Tian'e spreads pollen elsewhere.
Plants have evolved, creating landing tracks everywhere, and bees may get lost in them.
Many plants have marks that look like other insects.
These are the pollen sacs of lilies, very ingenious, so when an unknowing insect falls on it, the pollen sac turns over and hits the insect's back with a lot of pollen, so that it can follow the insect to other plants.
There is an orchid that looks like it has a jaw. In a way, it does; it forces insects to crawl over, pick up pollen, and carry pollen elsewhere.
Orchids: There are at least 20,000 species of orchids-a variety of amazing.
They have various tricks.
They must try and attract pollinators to help them complete this process.
This orchid is called Darwin's orchid because it was studied by Darwin and he gave a wonderful prediction when he saw this orchid. You can see a long nectar tube hanging from the orchid here.
Basically what the insect has to do is-we come to the middle of the flower-it pierces the mouthparts into the middle part all the way down to the nectar tube to get the nectar.
Darwin said, looking at the flower, "I guess something has evolved with it."
There is no doubt that it is insects.
When I mean it, it is usually rolled up, but when it is straightened, it looks like this.
Now you can imagine that if such a valuable thing as nectar is expensive for plants to produce and attract many pollinators, then, as in human sex, people might start to deceive each other.
They might say, "I have some nectar. Would you like to come and get some?"
This is a plant.
This plant is loved by insects in South Africa. They have evolved long mouthparts to get the nectar at the bottom.
This is an imitator.
This plant is imitating the previous one.
There is a fly with a long mouthpart that does not get any nectar from the counterfeit. Because the counterfeit didn't give it any nectar. It thought it was available.
Therefore, not only did the flies not get the nectar from the fake plant, but also - if you look at the top of the head very closely, you will see some pollen there. The pollen will be spread to other plants. If it is glued to a blue card.
(Laughter) Such lies are all over the plant kingdom.
This flower with black spots: They may look like black spots to us, but I tell you that to male insects of the appropriate species, these look like two very, very sexy females.
(Laughter) When the insect arrives and lands on it, immerse itself in the pollen. Of course, the pollen will be taken by it to other plants. If you look at the scanning electron microscope images that every family should have, You can see that there are actually some patterns there, three-dimensional patterns.
It even makes insects feel comfortable and looks good.
These electron microscope images - this is an orchid disguised as an insect - you can see that to our eyes, different parts of the structure have different colors and different textures, and insects may perceive very, very Different textures.
This orchid has evolved to mimic the metallic shiny surface seen on some beetles.
You can see this surface under a scanning electron microscope - it is very different from other surfaces we have seen.
Sometimes the whole plant will imitate an insect, even if we look like an insect.
I mean, I think it looks like some kind of flying animal or beast.
It is a wonderful and magical thing.
This is its cleverness. It is called obsidian.
I think it is sometimes cunning.
For a suitable type of bee, this looks like another very aggressive bee. It will fly over and hit it with its head many, many times, trying to drive it away. Of course, this will make it stained with pollen. .
Another thing it does is that this plant imitates another orchid that is rich in insects' favorite food.
But in fact there is nothing.
So it deceives on two levels - it's incredible.
(Laughter) What we see is ylang-ylang, the part with strong fragrance.
I actually smelled it before.
These flowers actually don't have to be so gorgeous.
They emit a wonderful fragrance to attract any interested insects.
This flower doesn't smell very good.
This flower actually smells very unpleasant. Mention it again. This is an evolution. It looks like rotten flesh.
So flies like it.
Flies fly in and pollinate it.
This is White Star Alocasia, also known as Dead Horse Alocasia.
I don't know what the dead horse smells like, but this flower may smell very similar.
It's terrible.
Blow fly can't help it.
Fly into it, fly into it all the way.
I lay eggs on it. I thought it was a good piece of carrion. I didn’t realize that there was no food for the eggs. These eggs would die here, but at the same time this plant would benefit, because the bristles loosened the flies and disappeared, pollinating to Another flower - it's amazing.
This is the alocasia plant, Alocasia, Variegated Aroma, which is called Trillium in this country.
I shot this in Dorset last week.
This guy heats up about 15 degrees higher than the ambient temperature - incredible.
If you look inside it, behind the ear of meat is something a bit like a dam. The flies are attracted by heat - this is a boiling volatile chemical, small insects - they are trapped under this container.
They sipped the sweet nectar and then all became a little slimy.
At night they are covered with pollen, sprayed from them, and then the bristles we see above become withered allowing these pollen-covered bugs to escape - it is incredible.
If you think this is incredible, this one is my favorite.
This is Spring Feather Philodendron.
Everyone here from Brazil should know this kind of plant.
This is the most amazing thing.
Its stamens are about a foot long.
It has an ability that no other plant has as far as I know. When it blooms - this is the meat in the middle - for about two days, it produces a certain degree of metabolic changes somewhat similar to mammals.
It does not have starch. This is plant food. It has something very similar to brown fat. It burns it at a rate of fat burning and metabolizes it, about the speed of a kitten.
In terms of weight, it is twice the energy output of a hummingbird - absolutely amazing.
It also did something unusual.
Not only will it heat up to 155 degrees Fahrenheit, 43 or 44 degrees Celsius for two days, but it will also maintain a constant temperature.
There is a temperature adjustment mechanism to maintain a constant temperature.
Why do you want to do this? I heard you ask.
You don’t know yet, some beetles like to mate at this temperature.
They got in, covered with pollen.
(Laughter) Plants spread pollen on them and let them go to pollinate.
What a wonderful thing this is.
Now we think that most pollinators are insects, but in fact many birds and butterflies also pollinate in tropical areas.
Many tropical flowers are red. This is because butterflies and birds are similar to us. We believe that red can be seen very well.
But if you look at the spectrum, birds and us, we see red, green and blue to see this spectrum.
Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet rays, and they can see all kinds of light and dark ultraviolet rays.
There is some color behind this.
"Wouldn't it be good if we could see those colors," I heard you ask.
Yes, we can see.
So what do insects see?
Last week I took pictures of these Desert Roses, Hemidiaea, in Dorset.
As we can see, these are little yellow flowers, and these little yellow flowers are everywhere.
It looks like this under visible light.
It looks like this if you remove the red color.
Most bees cannot perceive red.
Then I put an ultraviolet filter in front of my lens and exposed it for a long time at a specific frequency of ultraviolet light, and I got this picture.
This is like a real and wonderful bullseye.
Now we don’t know what the bees are seeing. When I call it red, you know what I’m looking at.
We have no way of knowing what happened in it, whether it was insects or other human brains.
But the contrast looks like this. Stand out from the background.
This is another kind of floret - located in a different UV frequency range, with different filters to match different pollinators.
It looks like this.
In order to avoid that you think that all yellow flowers have this attribute - the flower was not damaged during the shooting; just stick it on a tripod and did not take it off - under ultraviolet light, look at this.
This can be used as the basis for sunscreens, because sunscreens work by absorbing ultraviolet light.
So maybe the chemicals in it are useful.
In the end, this is an evening scent that was sent to me by Bjorn Rorslett from Norway-a wonderful hidden pattern.
I like this way of hiding.
I think this is very poetic. These photos were taken with a UV filter, the main purpose of this filter is for astronomers to take pictures of Venus - actually the clouds on Venus.
This is the main purpose of this filter.
Of course, Venus is the god of love and fertility. This is the story of flowers.
Just as flowers have spent so much energy trying to attract pollinators to accept their invitations, somehow they have succeeded in making us believe that they are rich in content. We send flowers to each other at birth and death, especially at weddings, when you think about it. At this moment, genetic material migrates from one organism to another.
thank you very much.

China News Service, Chongqing, July 26 (Reporter Liu Xian) The Chongqing Development and Reform Commission announced on the 26th that the city has so far returned 4,404 fishermen, accounting for 42.54% of all fishermen involved.
In an interview with a reporter from Chinanews.com, the 53-year-old Li Daiguo said that his grandfathers used to fish in the Longxi River. Since the age of 11, he has been fishing with his father, shaking his boat, and traveling along the Longxi River to Liangping, Chongqing , Down to longevity, every time I leave home is ten and a half months, relying on fishing to support family life.
However, since 1997, as the rural population has gradually flowed into the town, there are more and more residents in Gao'anchang town, which has caused more and more serious environmental pollution.
Paper mills, chemical plants, and breeding farms were built along the Longxi River, which also polluted the river.
By 2007 and 2008, Longxi River became a stinking ditch.
"The scales of the fish caught are all black, and the inside is also black after being cut open."
Li Daiguo said that fishing has become more and more difficult after river water pollution.
The local area began to make great efforts to control the pollution of the Longxi River, including cleaning up the river, patrolling the river, and managing and protecting aquatic resources.
Li Daiguo also retired from fishermen's catch and switched to production and became a member of the river inspection team to manage and protect aquatic resources.
Starting from January 1, 2020, Chongqing Aquatic Life Reserve and related waters in the main urban area have implemented a comprehensive ban on catching.
According to data from the Chongqing Development and Reform Commission, as of now, Chongqing has retired 3,403 fishing vessels and 4643 fishing retreat agreements have been signed, accounting for 63.3% and 86.3% of the total three-year mission respectively.
4404 fishermen have been retired, accounting for 42.54% of all fishermen involved.
Among the 4404 people who have been retired, 4267 have achieved employment, accounting for 96.89% of the fishermen who have retired.
The pension insurance coverage covers 2691 people, accounting for 61.10% of the fishermen who retreat.
In the next step, Chongqing will carry out in-depth special rectification actions, accelerate the cleanup and rectification of the Yangtze River's shoreline utilization projects, complete a new round of surveys of the Yangtze River's sewage outfalls and carry out corresponding rectification actions, and basically complete the "three phosphorus" , Phosphorus chemical industry and phosphogypsum reservoirs) rectification tasks, small hydropower clean-up and rectification, promote the special afforestation and greening activities on both sides of the Yangtze River, strengthen the construction of green mines, consolidate the results of the special rectification of illegal docks and illegal sand mining on the mainstream of the Yangtze River, and further promote the ban on catching and retreating in the Yangtze River Basin Catch work.
Israel strengthens prevention and control of repeated epidemics

Israel strengthens prevention and control of repeated epidemics
In the early stage of the outbreak of the new crown pneumonia, Israel's prevention and control measures were effective.
However, with the gradual lifting of the ban on prevention and control measures, the number of confirmed cases of new coronary pneumonia in Israel has recently increased significantly. The Israeli government has repeatedly taken emergency measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On February 28, the first case of new coronary pneumonia was confirmed in Israel. It quickly closed all entry and exit ports, suspended non-essential industries, schools changed to online teaching, restricted public transportation and non-essential social activities, and blocked cities with severe epidemics. The military and police jointly maintain prevention and control measures, etc.
This series of measures quickly achieved positive results. By mid-May, the number of new confirmed cases of new coronary pneumonia in Israel fell back to single digits in a single day.
With the epidemic under control, Israel’s various prevention and control measures have been fully unblocked. Since June, the number of newly diagnosed new coronary pneumonia has gradually rebounded.
Especially since July, the spread of the epidemic has continued to accelerate.
In recent days, there are more than 1,500 new cases in Israel every day for 8 days. As of the time of publication on July 25, there were 916 new cases on that day.
As of July 25, there have been 59,745 confirmed cases and 448 deaths in Israel.
Facing the rapid rebound of the epidemic, the Israeli government has repeatedly taken emergency measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On July 6, after the number of confirmed cases exceeded 30,000, the Israeli government closed public entertainment venues such as gyms, swimming pools, bars, nightclubs, and introduced a policy to restrict public transportation, stipulating that each bus cannot have more than 20 passengers. .
On the 17th, the Israeli government announced a series of new restrictive measures, including the implementation of "closure of the city" on weekends, etc., stipulating that the "closure of the city" shall be implemented from 17:00 every Friday to 5:00 every Sunday.
During this period, people can go out, but shops, shopping centers, barber shops, beauty salons, libraries, zoos, museums, exhibition halls, swimming pools and tourist attractions will be closed, while supermarkets, pharmacies and other basic services will remain open .
At the same time, on all dates and time periods, gatherings of more than 10 people are forbidden, gyms, studios and other places will be closed, restaurants and cafes are forbidden to eat in, and only takeaway services are allowed.
At the same time, the Israeli people did not pay enough attention to the severity of the epidemic and failed to form a joint force with the government in fighting the epidemic.
After the recurrence of the Israeli epidemic, many people took to the streets to protest and march because the government's prevention and control measures affected their economic interests.
On July 11, tens of thousands of people held a demonstration in Tel Aviv, believing that the anti-epidemic policy would affect the economy.
On the evening of the 21st, thousands of protesters gathered in front of Prime Minister Netanyahu’s residence in Jerusalem to protest against Prime Minister Netanyahu’s promulgation of prevention and control measures such as the prohibition of restaurants and cafes without giving corresponding compensation.
In addition, many people also fail to observe the regulations on wearing masks and maintaining a safe social distance of two meters during outdoor activities. In order to avoid being fined by the police for not wearing masks, many people only wear masks on their chins or on their wrists.
During the recurrence of the epidemic, the school was the hardest hit by the spread of the new crown virus. According to a reporter’s recent visit to this kindergarten, it was discovered that neither the teachers nor students in the kindergarten had worn masks as required by the government, nor had they maintained a safe social distance of two meters from each other. Infection with the virus bury hidden dangers.
Professor Eli Waxman, a member of the Israeli National Security Council’s expert advisory group to combat the epidemic, believes that Israel is moving towards a “dangerous situation” and pointed out that Israel’s current epidemic prevention and control measures are not enough, and all leisure and entertainment venues and summer vacations should be closed. Schools to control the further spread of the epidemic.
Waxman said that Israel lacks an overall plan to fight the epidemic. The parliament and government departments should abandon their own interests as soon as possible, reach an agreement on the fight against the epidemic, and formulate clear steps that include relevant restrictions on different departments.
Tel Aviv, July 25th, by reporter Wang Jiong in Tel Aviv
Wu Fengfang, a farmer in Guyuan, Ningxia, couldn't help but his wife Dai Tianfu. The two rushed to the Liangyun Cultural Compound from their home 20 miles away in a car.
Despite the inconvenience of legs and feet in the past two years, 77-year-old Dai Tianfu still counts on "come here every other way and get addicted to tricks."
This is an inconspicuous courtyard in Yuanzhou District of Guyuan City. Different from ordinary farmyards, the courtyard often spreads the melodious Qin opera, as well as wonderful shadow puppet shows, embroidery works, traditional Qin opera, and eyebrow opera.
The owner of the compound is called Liang Yun, who was a carpenter.
More than 10 years ago, he loves shadow puppets and sings operas and started planning to build a cultural compound.
With Liangyun Cultural Compound, the cultural life of the villagers has become rich and colorful.
Before the reporter entered the Liangyun Cultural Compound, the tune of Qinqiang had already spread.
It is Bai Lixiang, a villager from the neighboring village, who is singing excerpts from Qinqiang for the folks.
She has loved Qinqiang since she was a child, and now she is well-known in the local area. As long as she has free time, she will come to the cultural compound to perform for the folks.
Recently, Bai Lixiang also played a webcast.
Bai Lixiang said: "It is a very happy thing to have a stage for more people to see themselves performing."
On the stage, the singer gave a stern look, and the player tuned every tune. Although he was an amateur, his enthusiasm was undiminished.
Just like the pristine style of the farmyard, outside of Qinqiang, the "grassroots" art and intangible cultural heritage in the Liangyun Cultural Courtyard are rushing to the face.
The compound also houses more than 300 real objects such as farming utensils of different ages, traditional and hand-made tile sculptures, paper-cutting, embroidery, and shadow puppets.
Liang Yun led the reporter into the exhibition hall in the courtyard, where his collection of old objects, old hip flasks, sanxianzi, and spinning wheels were displayed.
Why does an ordinary farmer build a cultural compound?
"Shadow puppetry is my family handicraft, I have been learning this craft since I was 15 years old."
Liangyun Cultural Courtyard was established in 2012, becoming the first rural "intangible cultural heritage exhibition hall" in Ningxia, and it is also a demonstration compound for intangible cultural heritage protection in Guyuan.
In addition to the Liangyun Cultural Complex, more than 120 cultural complexes and 79 folk performance groups have emerged in Yuanzhou District of Guyuan City. Among them, there are more than 50 cultural complexes of a certain scale, such as Shenjiahe Cultural Complex and Wang Yonghong Cultural Complex. The courtyard, Yanglang Cultural Complex, etc., cover all towns and streets in Yuanzhou District, with more than 5,000 participants.
These grassroots artists are active in the fields, enriching the cultural life of the masses and satisfying their spiritual needs.
"As life gets better, traditional culture cannot just be left behind."
"Liu's spy war drama" is back again, "Odds" to see Liu Yunlong and Li Liqun's opponents "boom show"-Xinhuanet.com
The 40-episode spy war drama "Odds" will be available on Beijing Satellite TV from July 16.
"Success" is adapted from real historical facts and is based on the Soviet military archives that have been sealed for many years and first appeared.
The actor Liu Yunlong, who is well-known to the audience in the "spy war drama", broke through his image in the play and challenged a "stuttering agent" with a sense of joy.
In recent years, the popularity of dramas such as "The Pretender", "Mask", and "Kite" has all proved that the spy war genre has strong vitality.
Different from previous spy war works, "Chance of Winning" looks at the world and extends the background of the story to the Soviet Far East battlefield.
It is set against the background of the final stage of the Anti-Japanese War in 1944. It tells that Tang Fei (played by Liu Yunlong), a CCP’s secret intelligence worker, under the leadership of the Secretary of the Chinese Underground Party Linhe Provincial Committee and the Director of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Agency, executed the Soviet Far East Intelligence Agency’s The story of "Mudan Ula" strategic action.
In many spy war dramas, the male protagonist, as a senior spy, has a perfect image of handsome, high IQ, and maturity.
But in Liu Yunlong’s view, such a person is not suitable for being a spy. "Spy should be someone who can’t be found in the pile of people. If they appear on the scene, they will have a very handsome image. I wish everyone would want it. Pay attention to you, can you still be lurking? There is a line in "Kite", "If you don't come to catch me, I will forget that I am a Kuomintang." The spy is going to be elitist."
Therefore, in "Odds", Liu Yunlong ingeniously designed his protagonist Tang Fei as a "stuttering agent" with a sense of joy.
The other camp in "Winning" is supported by the Japanese Fukuhara played by Liang Guanhua and Fang Shibao, the chief of the National Police Agency played by Li Liqun.
The two powerful actors, one south and one north, add a lot of highlights to the whole show.
Director Yin Fei used the term "Biao Opera" to describe the rivalry between Li Liqun and Liu Yunlong in the play. "It is definitely a Biao Opera. The two of them have a special tacit understanding. The tacit understanding between them is very impactful to me. Many times their The scenes are all'off-the-shelf'. For example, we only wrote half a page in length. If I didn't call to stop during filming, the two of them could continue to perform."
The masters do not rob each other, and the director does not disturb the play. When the actors are in the role and ensure their character status, they can not only shape the role from the perspective of the character, but also bring more viewing to the audience. Possibility, Yin Fei said that this kind of drama is enough.
In the play, you can also see many familiar faces from the "Liu's Spy War". The famous and majestic "Mountain City F4" in "Kite" also gathered three people in "Odds".
Hou Yu and Liu Mingyang, who played Song Xiaoan and Zhao Jianzhi, once again played Tang Fei's right arm.
Director Yin Fei said, "These two people have no inferiority in them. They just drifted with the crowd in that era and that environment."
Liu Yunlong also took the initiative to propose, "We must have a human touch. This human touch means that there must be good and bad people around me, and bad people are enemies, but we must develop them and our team must also grow."
The ending of the two people in the play was also carefully designed by Liu Yunlong, and he believes that he will give the audience a satisfactory answer.

Four students in Arong Banner, Inner Mongolia, drowned and died
China News Service, Hulunbuir, July 26 (Reporter Li Aiping) On the evening of the 25th, the reporter learned from the government of Arong Banner, Hulunbuir City, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region that four local students died of drowning.
At 15:50 on July 24, Arong Banner Public Security Bureau 110 received a report that six junior high school students drowned in the local area.
After receiving the police, the local police rushed to the scene as soon as possible and rescued 2 students on the spot. Then the local emergency bureau, water conservancy bureau and other units rushed to the scene one after another to participate in the rescue.
According to reports, the rescue site dispatched more than 80 people including public security police, forest police, firefighting, medical care, etc., and dispatched 3 rubber boats to continuously salvage the surrounding waters, and hired professional rescue teams to arrive at the scene to conduct underwater searches through sonar detection.
The reporter learned that local rescuers found the first student who died at 6:40 on July 25, the second student who died at 11:30 on the 25th, and the third student who died at 12:40 on the 25th. , The last student who died was found at 13:34 on the 25th. After the above 4 people were salvaged and landed, they were identified as having no vital signs by the local 120 emergency center.
Officials said that the drowning incident has sounded a wake-up call for the whole society.
Currently, relevant departments of the local government are compiling some knowledge about drowning prevention, hoping that the tragedy will not happen again.
Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 25. Xu Zhengyu, Director of the Bureau of Financial Affairs and the Treasury of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, said that Hong Kong's financial market remains active and orderly.
He expressed optimism about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
Xu Zhengyu stated at an online seminar co-organized by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Toronto and the Hong Kong-Canada Chamber of Commerce (Canada) on the 24th (Toronto time) that Hong Kong is experiencing difficult conditions due to the "regulations" and the new crown pneumonia epidemic. .
The exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar is stable and favors the exchange guarantee level of the strong side.
The banking system has no obvious signs of capital outflows. On the contrary, more than 11 billion U.S. dollars in capital has flowed in since June.
The total amount of bank deposits has also continued to increase in the past few months. There has been a series of public offerings in the stock market, and market transactions have repeatedly increased.
Xu Zhengyu said that the new crown pneumonia epidemic has put pressure on the global economy and financial markets, but Hong Kong's basic advantages remain unchanged.
Hong Kong has many advantages, including geography, rule of law, high-speed communications, free flow of information and capital, and a simple and low tax system, making Hong Kong a leading international financial center.
Xu Zhengyu pointed out that the SAR government has set aside 6 billion Hong Kong dollars in the "epidemic prevention and anti-epidemic fund" to create about 30,000 time-limited jobs in the public and private sectors in the next two years, covering people with different skills and academic qualifications.
To support the development of fintech, the SAR government has also launched the "Thousand Talents Plan" to subsidize local fintech companies, start-ups and other companies with fintech-related businesses to create 1,000 new jobs, hire local talents and enrich Hong Kong’s finances Technological talent pool.
Looking ahead, Xu Zhengyu is optimistic about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
He encouraged Canadian companies to make good use of Hong Kong's advantages and its status as an international financial center, an international asset and wealth management center, and a global offshore RMB business hub to develop and invest in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and nearby areas.
"The Lancet" published an article praising China's efforts to fight the epidemic and encouraging countries to learn from experience-chinanews.com
The Lancet magazine published an article on the 25th that China, as a country with a population of 1.4 billion and a scale similar to Europe or the United States, has effectively controlled the new crown epidemic at this stage, and there has been no large-scale spread. China has brought the domestic epidemic under control.
The article said that in the past ten years, China has made a lot of investment in domestic research and public health construction, which makes China's preparation for the new crown much better than that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
The author stated that when the SARS outbreak broke out in 2002, China was underprepared at first, especially the pathogen could not be identified.
When the new coronavirus was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists were soon able to identify the type of virus and shared genome sequencing data with the international community on January 11, 2020.
By the end of January, doctors from mainland China and Hong Kong clarified the clinical characteristics of the virus and warned the world about the threat of the new crown virus through research papers published in The Lancet.
China has also been at the forefront of vaccine research. When the country declares a state of emergency, through close domestic cooperation, such research has been carried out very quickly and strictly. In May and July, China announced on the "Lancet". Early trials of the developed new crown vaccine are the result of progress.
China’s experience shows that it is very important to invest in national health and research systems to effectively improve laboratory capabilities.
This is the basis for the country to respond quickly and effectively to health emergencies and global health security.
Other countries, especially low-income and middle-income countries, are very worth learning.
In addition, China’s experience proves that on the basis of strong research, there must be a strong high-level decisive and scientific basis to make correct decisions, so that the new crown epidemic can be effectively controlled.
The article emphasizes that the government and its leaders must respect science, understand the value of science, and act on it in the most beneficial way for society.
At the beginning of the outbreak, the National Health and Construction Commission of China sent three groups of infectious disease experts to Wuhan to investigate the risk and spread of the new crown virus. Their suggestions provided the basis for the decision to "close the city" in Wuhan on January 23; when some experts proposed the construction method When the cabin hospital was necessary and urgent, the government quickly made a decision and implemented it quickly; at the same time, the extensive participation of the community and the masses also enabled the epidemic to be quickly and effectively controlled.
At the end of the article, it is emphasized that in response to global health emergencies, countries need to strengthen global cooperation and jointly respond.

Bai Jinhai, the former inspector of the Wuhai Municipal Party Committee of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, was expelled from the party-chinanews.com
China News Service, July 26, according to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Commission for Discipline Inspection: A few days ago, with the approval of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Committee, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Commission for Discipline Inspection conducted an investigation and investigation on the serious violations of discipline and law by the former inspector of the Wuhai Municipal Party Committee, Bai Jinhai.
After investigation, Bai Jinhai, as a leading cadre of a party member, lost his ideals and beliefs, and for his own self-interest, he blatantly violated the principle of party spirit and resisted inspection and rectification; he had indifferent organizational concepts, arranged mobilization work for others in violation of regulations, and accepted property from others in the selection and appointment of cadres; economically greedy , Business-run enterprises in violation of regulations obtain huge profits, engage in power and money transactions, and use power for personal gain; life is corrupted, causing adverse effects.
Bai Jinhai seriously violated political discipline, organizational discipline, integrity discipline, and life discipline, constituted a violation of the law and was suspected of crimes of bribery, corruption, and refused to converge or take hands after the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. The nature is bad and the circumstances are serious. Take it seriously.
Pursuant to the "Regulations on Disciplinary Actions of the Communist Party of China", "The Supervision Law of the People's Republic of China" and other relevant provisions, after reviewing at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Commission for Discipline Inspection and reporting to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Committee for approval, it was decided to give Bai Jinhai a penalty of expulsion from the party and adjust the benefits he enjoyed according to the regulations; Confiscated the proceeds of violation of discipline and law; transferred the suspected crime to the procuratorial organ for review and prosecution in accordance with the law, and the property involved was transferred along with the case.
On the afternoon of the 25th local time, a small plane crashed into the top floor of a multi-storey residential building in Wesel County, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Three people were killed in the accident.
Duisburg prosecutors, the Wesel County Police Department and the Wesel City Fire Department issued a joint statement that evening, stating that at about 14:40 that day, a two-seater small plane crashed into the Fabers in Wesel Three people were killed in a loft on the top floor of a multi-story residential building on Camp Street.
On the same day, it took off from Mar City, Ruhr District, North Rhine-Westphalia, and took off again after stopping at the airport in Wesel County.
The deceased may be a female resident in the impacted house and two passengers on the small plane.
A two-year-old child in the room suffered only minor injuries and was rescued safely.
The rest of the residents in the room were not injured in the accident, but their emotions have not yet recovered.
The scene screen reported by Deutsche News Agency showed that the house that was involved in the accident once emitted thick smoke, and the firefighters showed that the house was seriously damaged after extinguishing the fire.
At present, the cause of the plane crash is still unclear.
The "Rhine Post" quoted the police and reported that there are clues that the plane may have disintegrated before it hit a residential building.
The police said that several parts of the crashed plane were found near the scene of the accident.
The German Interpol is working with the Duisburg prosecutors and the German Federal Aviation Accident Investigation Agency to investigate the cause of the accident.
The reporter learned from the Chinese Consulate General in Düsseldorf that the consulate had contacted the local police and fire departments. According to the judgment on the scene, there were no Chinese citizens among the casualties.
The Ministry of Health of Singapore announced on the 26th that as of 12 o'clock that day, Singapore had newly confirmed 481 new cases of new crown, a total of 50,369 confirmed cases; a total of 27 deaths.
Data show that among the newly confirmed cases, 5 are local community cases, 4 are imported cases, and the rest are foreign workers living in dedicated dormitories.
The Ministry of Health of Singapore said that 98% of the newly confirmed cases are related to known infections.
There are still 173 new crown patients receiving treatment in the hospital, most of whom are in stable or improving condition, and no one is in the intensive care unit.
In addition, 4648 people are quarantined in community facilities.
Foreign workers account for the vast majority of people infected with the new crown in Singapore.
According to statistics, there are 200,000 foreign workers living in 43 foreign workers’ dormitories, and about 100,000 foreign workers living in other types of dormitories.
The Singapore Anti-epidemic Interdepartmental Working Group recently stated that the Singapore government is stepping up testing for the last few foreign workers’ dormitories with high rates of COVID-19 infection.
After completing the testing of all dedicated dormitories, the vast majority of foreign workers will be able to return to work, but they will still have to undergo regular COVID-19 testing.
Director Dapeng's "Auspicious Ruyi" shortlisted for Golden Goblet Award-Xinhuanet
On July 18, the 23rd Shanghai International Film Festival announced the official list of films selected for the Golden Goblet Award.
Director Dapeng’s first realistic film "Auspicious Ruyi" was successfully shortlisted for the Golden Goblet Award at the Shanghai Film Festival. At the same time, the film officially released its first poster.
Image courtesy of posters
The film "Auspicious Ruyi" is director Dapeng's first realistic work, and it is also his second bond with the Golden Goblet Award.
The film tells a story: a comedy director came back to his hometown in the northeastern rural area on a whim, hoping to make a literary and artistic film for the family during the New Year, but encountered a series of accidents.
The family members gathered for making the movie completed the final gathering.
In the movie poster released today, a member of the family-"San Jiu" Wang Jixiang is sitting in the center of the screen smoking a cigarette. The background is the black land of northeast China with silver clothing, and the foreground is that the Chinese people will hang it every New Year's holidays. Red lanterns.
The red lanterns, which symbolize joy and reunion, form a huge contrast with the lonely Wang Jixiang, which seems to reveal the complexity and entanglement of this big family relationship.
It is reported that in the film, except for the daughter of "Three Uncle" Wang Jixiang, which is played by actor Liu Lu, the rest of the scenes are performed by the real director's family. The experimental audio-visual style of the film breaks the boundary between drama and reality and brings a whole new look to the audience. Immersive movie viewing experience.
According to director Dapeng, the creation of "Auspicious Ruyi" originated from "a providence." During the filming, a series of sudden family changes made the original filming plan have to be changed. The life without a script was eventually recorded as a movie, but Release the tension beyond design.
How exactly does the director Dapeng face this "province" and how to continue to embrace the changes brought about by this providence?
There is no doubt that "Auspicious Ruyi" is full of experimentation. The almost full lineup and innovative audio-visual style turn life in front of the camera into a movie. Under the package of real images, the audience will also be presented from the movie. Finding the shadow of yourself and your family in the family, as the family gathering in the film ends, a series of thoughts are evoked.
NEWS.GOV.MO: New Coronavirus Infection Response Coordination Center Enquiry Hotline Statistics (July 25th 08H00-July 26th 08H00)
From 08H00 on July 25, 2020 to 08H00 on July 26, the enquiry hotline of the Novel Coronavirus Infection Response Coordination Center received a total of 292 telephone enquiries.
291 enquiries about the epidemic have been immediately transferred to representatives of relevant departments for follow-up, and the situation is as follows:
271 cases from the Health Bureau (involving: inquiring about quarantine; inquiring about nucleic acid testing; inquiring about two-place license; health code; others.)
17 cases from the Public Security Police Station (involving: inquiring about immigration measures; inquiring about immigration measures for vehicles with Guangdong and Macao licenses; inquiring about Zhuhai government affairs hotline; inquiring about document staying issues.)
1 case from the Tourism Bureau (involving: inquiring about the problem of isolated hotels.)
1 case from the Education and Youth Affairs Bureau (involving: inquiring about the method for Macao students to return to the UK to study.)
1 case from the Maritime and Water Affairs Bureau (involving: asking whether Hong Kong fishing boats entering the port need to report to the Maritime and Water Affairs Bureau and nucleic acid testing related matters.)
At Ba Nong Zhuo Kang sentry point, platoon leader Yu Wang and a soldier stand guard.
In this place where the annual average temperature is more than ten degrees below zero, a row of simple barracks stands on the mountain pass. Not far from the barracks, a national flag is fluttering in the wind. The soldiers are on duty in the wind every day, and they need to regularly patrol higher altitudes. .
The soldiers climbed up the steep slope of the rubble, requiring both hands and feet.
It was late July, when the flowers and plants flourished in low-altitude areas, and in Ba Nong Zhuo Kang, only the ravine behind the barracks had relatively dense green.
Gao Peng, a soldier who had been stationed at the outpost for 6 years, pointed to the ravine and said that this is their back garden. Only in July and August each year can the grass grow slowly. After a while, all of them turned yellow and covered with snow.
Patrol on foot may take about 9 hours.
In the harsh plateau environment, the soldiers stationed here are accompanied by snow-capped mountains and glaciers all year round, and they also regularly patrol the higher mountain passes.
A few days ago, a patrol team composed of eight fighters, led by the instructor Liang Yixin, once again embarked on the patrol road.
Each soldier carries a weight of about 30 kilograms and marches towards the target point early in the morning.
On the way, a soldier fought back, and his comrades gave emergency help.
In addition to patrol missions, the soldiers at the Ba Nong Chokang outpost must conduct tactical and physical training every day.
Time passed by, the altitude continued to rise, the oxygen content became lower and lower, and the physical strength continued to be overdrawn. These factors tested the patrol members' will.
They gritted their teeth and insisted, stepping over several landslides and several fast and difficult beaches one after another.
At about 16 o'clock, it was lunch time for the patrol members. They took out their own dry food and sat on the spot at an altitude of more than 5,700 meters, accompanied by sleet and sleet, and supplemented their physical strength with food.
The soldiers at the Ba Nong Chokang sentry point conducted tactical and physical training.
During the break, they will play cards together, and the loser will do push-ups, both for entertainment and physical exercise.
After a short rest in the cold wind, they climbed to the target point of the patrol, took out the national flag on the mountain pass, and solemnly swore.
Behind them is the snow-capped mountains. In front of them is a no-man’s land for dozens of kilometers. They are the safest guardians of the country.
Beijing consumption season restarts-Xinhuanet
Beijing has restarted various activities in the Beijing consumption season in accordance with the principles of "comprehensive restart, focused planning, orderly progress, and tight organization".
On July 26, 1.5 million government and enterprise consumption vouchers were issued, including 1 million offline catering and shopping vouchers and 500,000 smart product vouchers. Consumers can receive them on the JD APP.
Liu Meiying, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce, introduced at the media briefing held on the 25th that the consumption season after the restart will further reduce the company's capital allocation while maintaining the existing preferential subsidies for consumer voucher card packages.
Starting from early August, the current 1:1 allocation of funds from the government and enterprises has been adjusted to 2:1. For example, consumers can enjoy a discount of 120 yuan after receiving a card package and spending at the store, of which 60 yuan is a government subsidy and 60 yuan is given to the enterprise. Yuan; after the adjustment, the government subsidizes 80 Yuan, and the enterprise makes a profit of 40 Yuan.
During the consumption season, the three major operators will subsidize traffic and terminals around 5G consumption to further promote Beijing's new 5G infrastructure and new consumption.
Chen Maobo points out that Hong Kong's economy has been hit by the outbreak again and calls on all walks of life to tide over the difficulties together
China News Service, Hong Kong, July 26. The Financial Secretary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, Chen Maobo, said on the 26th that Hong Kong is facing a new wave of new crown pneumonia, and business contacts and economic activities that had seen signs of recovery have also been hit.
The SAR government once again urged all large and small property owners to reduce rents to tide over the difficulties with retailers, restaurants and SMEs.
Chen Maobo published an article entitled "The Bumpy Road to Recovery" on the Internet that day.
He said that the recent high number of confirmed cases of new coronary pneumonia in Hong Kong and the severe situation have affected the livelihood of the society and the people, and also troubled the economy.
When the epidemic is repeated, the most important thing is to strictly prevent imported cases, and deal with and interrupt the chain of virus transmission as quickly as possible; when the epidemic is controlled, economic activities should be resumed in a timely manner.
He pointed out that in the face of the new wave of the epidemic, business contacts and economic activities that had seen signs of recovery have also been hit.
For the business community, in addition to the spirit of contract, social responsibility is equally important, especially those groups that have received large government subsidies in the "Employment Guarantee Program".
He mentioned that the economic situation in Hong Kong in the second quarter of this year is still very severe, but the contraction seems to have slowed slightly.
In terms of exports, he believes that Hong Kong's external situation is still severe.
Chen Maobo said that the development history of Hong Kong over the past few decades shows that every crisis hides new opportunities, and every difficulty hides the key to future development.
One winter morning a few years ago, in Johannesburg, South Africa, when I drove to work, I found that the city was covered by smog.
I drive by there almost every day, but this time is very unusual, I have never seen such a sight before.
Johannesburg is famous for its distinctive and beautiful skyline, but it was almost invisible that morning.
I soon realized that what I saw was the severe smog caused by air pollution.
The contrast between the beautiful environment that I used to know and the skyline shrouded in smog at this moment is constantly surging in my heart.
I am worried that it is very possible that the once colorful sunset will be swallowed by the gloomy haze.
At that moment, I felt a strong urge to do something, but I didn't know what to do.
All I know is that I can't just stand by.
The biggest challenge is that I don't understand environmental science. Air quality management, or atmospheric chemistry.
I am a computer engineer, and I am pretty sure that I cannot solve the problem of air pollution by coding.
(Laughter) In what capacity will I solve this problem?
I'm just a small civic.
In the next few years, I learned a very important lesson. If we want to achieve a better future, we should all keep this lesson in mind.
Even if you are not an expert in a particular field, your professional skills may contain solutions to problems in that field.
Sometimes, your unique perspective can stimulate unconventional thinking and influence the situation, but you need to be bold to try.
Only then can you know the result.
What I knew at the time was that if I wanted to try to change, I had to know enough about pollution, so I became a student again.
I did some basic research and quickly learned that air pollution is the biggest environmental health risk in the world.
Data from the World Health Organization show that in 2012, almost 14% of deaths worldwide were caused by air pollution at home and surrounding areas, especially in low- and middle-income countries.
The annual death rate caused by air pollution is higher than that of malaria and AIDS.
In Africa, premature deaths caused by unsafe sanitary conditions, or deaths caused by children’s malnutrition, are pale in the face of air pollution. At the same time, it also brings huge economic costs: According to statistics from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, 2013 Expenditures on related parties exceeded US$400 billion in the year.
In my work, I explore the cutting-edge achievements of artificial intelligence, including the symbiotic relationship between humans and machines, to find a useful foothold and help us make better decisions.
When I think about the issue of air pollution again, it becomes clear how to deal with the issue of air pollution. We need to find better ways to make better decisions. Considering that the problem is huge, collaboration is very necessary. .
So I decided to meet some people who work in this field.
I started talking with officials in Johannesburg and other surrounding cities. I joined the local scientific community. I also made some phone calls to people who were completely unfamiliar but related.
The experiences that I set out to intervene helped me understand this issue more deeply.
It also helped me avoid the trap that people in my profession sometimes fall into when they try to innovate: to quickly adopt a technology before they really grasp the problem.
I started to think, what can I do to improve this situation?
I began to ask myself, how can I effectively integrate my knowledge and skills in software engineering and artificial intelligence with the professional skills of the people I contact.
I want to create an online air quality management platform to reveal future pollution trends and make relevant predictions to determine possible results.
I am sure that my idea can become a realistic solution, but I also face uncertainty. I cannot guarantee that it will succeed.
What I have is a specific set of engineer skills, the skills I have gained from my job. (Laughter) Of course, for people who have been working in the field of air pollution for many years, my skills are completely new.
I gradually realized that sometimes a novel perspective, a new combination of skills, can give birth to something remarkable.
Our willpower and imagination are an indicator light that instructs us to overcome obstacles and open a new chapter.
I have a more in-depth understanding of the problem of air pollution, and I have found air pollution data in the past ten years, as well as weather data in and around Johannesburg. After that, I created an air quality decision support system with my colleagues in South Africa and China and uploaded it to the cloud.
This software can analyze historical and real-time data to reveal the trend of pollution over time and space.
We then used new machine learning technology to predict future pollution a few days in advance.
This means that residents can make better decisions about their daily schedule and where to settle with their families.
We can predict unfavorable pollution incidents in advance and define the sources of heavy pollution so that relevant authorities can issue instructions to adjust their business activities.
By assisting scenario planning, urban planners can also make better decisions on how to expand infrastructure work, such as residential resettlement in industrial areas.
We have established a pilot pilot of this technology, which has been running for 120 days, covering the entire South Africa.
Our expected results have been verified. The predicted data we showed and the data we collected on the spot showed a close correlation.
Through our management, we have introduced the world's leading cutting-edge instruments to predict air quality, the resolution and accuracy of which are unprecedented, so that the city I traveled into on a winter morning not long ago can benefit. At that time I said to myself, "Something is wrong, I have to find a way to do something."
So, the point is: What if I didn’t investigate the issue of air pollution in depth?
What if I don’t pay attention to the country’s environmental conditions but hope that certain places and other people will take care of these things?
What I learned from this is that it is important to pay attention to the possibility of success and consider the consequences of inaction when working hard to advance a cause that we all believe in.
We should not be distracted by opposition and resistance, it should motivate us to go further.
So no matter where you are in the world, the next time you find that some kind of natural curiosity of yours is aroused, and it is also about what you care about, you have some crazy or brave thoughts, even if it’s not In your area of expertise, ask yourself: Why not try it?
Why not go forward and solve the problem? Do your best, in your own way?
You may get unexpected joy.
thank you all.

The largest earthquake in Taiwan this year occurred in the eastern waters of Taiwan
China News Agency, Taipei, July 26. An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.1 on the Richter scale occurred at 20:52 on the 26th in the eastern seas of Taiwan, with a maximum magnitude of 4. The earthquake was felt throughout Taiwan, and it was the largest earthquake in Taiwan this year.
Comprehensive reports from Taiwan Central News Agency, China Times Electronic News, ETtoday News Cloud and other Taiwanese media, the Taiwan Meteorological Department reported that the epicenter of the earthquake was 86.5 kilometers southeast of the Yilan County Government, that is, the waters of eastern Taiwan, with a focal depth of 53 kilometers.
China Earthquake Networks determined that the earthquake was 5.5.
The largest earthquake intensity across Taiwan is: Hualien County Level 4, Yilan County, Taitung County, Nantou County, Yunlin County Level 3, and other counties and cities measured 1 to 2 magnitude.
Taiwan’s Meteorological Department pointed out that this earthquake is the largest earthquake in Taiwan this year. It is a submerged zone-type earthquake at the junction of plates. The epicenter has been frequent earthquakes in the past and has been relatively active this year.
In the next week, it is still not ruled out that there will be aftershocks of magnitude 4 or above.
Many people think that driving is something that only those who can see can do.
Blind people want to drive a car safely and alone until now, it has also been considered an impossible task.
Hello everyone, my name is Dennis Hong. We have built a car designed for people with visual impairments for the freedom and independence of the blind.
Before I talk about this car for the blind, let me briefly talk about another project I have done called the U.S. Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Urban Challenge.
This is about making a mechanical car that can be driven by itself.
You press the start button, no longer touch anything, it can also reach its destination completely automatically.
In the 2007 Challenge, our team won $500,000 and won the third place in the competition.
Around that time, the National Association of the Blind, or the Association for the Blind, challenged the design team about who could design a car that allowed blind people to drive independently and safely.
We think we have to try it, because we think, hey, where is this going to be difficult.
We already have an autonomous car.
As long as we let the blind drive inside, it won't be over, right?
(Laughter) But we were wrong and unreliable.
What the Blind Association wants is not a car that can carry blind people around, but a car that blind people can actively make choices and drive.
So we had to give up all our original things and start from scratch.
To test this crazy idea, we designed a prototype of a small dune buggy to test its feasibility.
In the summer of 2009, we invited many blind youths across the country and gave them a chance to take this car for a ride.
This is definitely a cool experience.
But the problem with this car is that its design can only allow blind people to drive in a very limited environment, like a closed parking lot - even on small roads built with red traffic cones.
So with this success, we decided to take an important next step, to build a real car that can drive on real roads.
How does it work?
Well, this is a relatively complex system, but let me explain it to simplify it.
We have three stages.
We have a sensing phase, a calculation phase and a non-visual interface.
The driver is obviously invisible, so the system must be able to perceive the surrounding environment and collect data for the driver.
At this point, we use the initial metering element.
It measures acceleration, angular acceleration - just like the human ear, the inner ear.
I combined this information with the global positioning system to predict the location of the vehicle.
We also use two cameras to detect the path of the vehicle.
We also use three laser rangefinders.
The laser scans the environment to detect obstacles-vehicles passing by from the front and back at the same time any obstacles breaking into the road, any obstacles around the vehicle.
All the massive amounts of information are then aggregated into the computer, and the computer will do two things.
First, one thing is to process information to understand the surrounding environment - which are driving paths and which are obstacles - and transform this information to the driver.
This system is also very intelligent and can calculate the safest driving path.
We can also issue instructions on how to operate the vehicle's operating procedures.
But the question is: How can we transmit information and instructions to the blind person quickly and accurately to ensure that he can drive?
To this end, we have designed many different non-visual user interface technologies.
The original three-dimensional flat sound system, vibrating vests, voice-activated gears, leg straps, and even shoes that put pressure on the feet.
But today we are talking about three of these non-visual user interface technologies.
The first interface is called the driving handle.
This is a pair of gloves. It has vibration elements on the knuckles, so you can transmit instructions on how to drive - direction and amplitude.
Another device is called a velocity shock belt.
This car chair--actually, this is a massage chair.
We took it apart, and we reorganized the vibration elements of different modes. We let them transmit speed information, as well as instructions on how to use the accelerator and brake.
Here, you can see how the computer understands the surrounding environment. Because you can't see the vibration, we actually installed a red LED on the driver so he can see what is happening.
This is the sensed data, which is transferred from the sensor to the computer.
So these two devices, the steering handle and the speed shock belt, are very effective.
But the problem is that these are instruction hinting devices.
So this is not freedom in the true sense, right?
The computer tells you how to drive - turn left, turn right, accelerate, brake.
I call this the co-pilot problem.
So we are avoiding instruction suggesting devices and focusing more on information devices.
A typical example of such a non-visual information interface is called an empty map.
Think of this as a display for the blind.
This is a small desktop with many holes on it, compressed air is excluded from it, so it can be described as a picture.
So even if you are blind and you put your hand on it, you can sense the path and obstacles.
In fact, you can also change the frequency and possibly temperature released in the air.
This is actually a multi-dimensional user interface.
Here, you can see the cameras on the left and right and how the computer parses and transmits these information to the empty image.
In this way, we are showing a simulation program where a blind person is driving with an empty chart.
This program is very helpful for training blind drivers and quickly testing different theories in terms of different types of non-visual user interfaces.
This is how it basically works.
But this car is a model car, and it will not go on the road unless it is proven to be as safe as today's car, or safer.
I really believe this will happen.
But is society, can they accept this radical idea?
How will we deal with insurance?
How will we issue a driver's license?
Behind the technical challenges, there are many different obstacles that we need to solve before it becomes a reality.
Of course, the main purpose of this project is to design a car driven by the blind.
But potentially more important than this is the huge value contained in the by-products of this project.
A sensor that can be used to see through darkness, rain and fog.
And with this new type of interface, we can use these technologies to make them provide safer vehicles for visible people.
Or for the blind, the household devices used in daily life-education facilities, office facilities and application services.
Imagine that in the classroom, the teacher writes notes on the blackboard. Blind students can also use these non-visual interfaces to understand and read what the teacher writes.
This is extremely precious.
Today, what I show you is just the beginning.
thank you very much.

Marinichev said that changes in value are affected by the devaluation of the ruble and the epidemic.
He said, "Service costs are increasing.
Due to the epidemic, people began to spend more time on the Internet. "
Marinichev does not rule out that Internet prices will increase severely this year. He believes that operators can provide customers with higher speeds and more services to offset people's dissatisfaction with price increases.
"Chinese Doctor" prepares to pay tribute to anti-epidemic heroes-Xinhua English.news.cn
Recently, with the respect of Chinese filmmakers’ heroes fighting the epidemic, Bona Pictures Chairman Yu Dong and director Liu Weiqiang (pictured left) have a discussion with Academician Zhong Nanshan on the production of the anti-epidemic film "Chinese Doctor" in Guangzhou communicate with.
Bona Pictures hopes to use "Chinese Doctor" to pay tribute to all medical and epidemic prevention workers who are fighting on the front line of epidemic prevention and control!
In 2021, the film will be screened nationwide as a tribute film celebrating the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.
At present, Bona Pictures is organizing the original crew of the film "Captain of China" to make the film "Chinese Doctor" under the arrangements and deployment of the Central Propaganda Department and the National Film Bureau, and with the support of the Guangdong Film Bureau and the Hubei Film Bureau. This is a film reflecting the unity of the people of the whole country to fight the new crown pneumonia epidemic under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee.
The film focuses on the front line of Wuhan's anti-epidemic. It will take Wuhan medical staff and the medical teams of various provinces and cities as the background of characters. From the perspective of human nature, use unique narrative and highly impactful lens language to show the full dedication and dedication of the anti-epidemic front line. The touching story of sacrificed Chinese medical staff.
It is understood that the first time on the day when Wuhan was unblocked, Bona Company overcame numerous difficulties and dispatched a shooting team to go deep into the front line of the epidemic, face-to-face exchanges with hundreds of medical workers, and collect information. So far, it has interviewed academician Zhong Nanshan. I, the first person from Guangzhou to aid Wuhan, the Guangdong aid to Hubei medical team, and the white-clothed angels at the forefront of the anti-epidemic front such as Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan Union Hospital, Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan Central Hospital, etc., have photographed a large number of precious firsts. Hand video material.
Academician Zhong Nanshan also raised expectations and hopes for the filming of the film in this symposium: "I am looking forward to it. I hope that you will not only visit some of the more publicity experts, but also interview more medical staff who are working hard on the front line. , They are the majority."
He said that he had read "Me and My Motherland" and "Captain of China" before and thought that the way to tell the story of the big pattern from the perspective of ordinary people is a good way.
"Now some foreign friends still have some misunderstandings about China."
When talking about the dissemination of the film, Academician Zhong Nanshan said that at present, some people in foreign countries like to label the virus as politicized. He hopes that the film can impress the audience from the perspective of human nature: "In addition to being shown in China, this film can also When screening abroad, we must impress the audience with the true humanistic spirit in a way that audiences at home and abroad can understand."
Academician Zhong Nanshan also fondly recalled the film "Man to Middle Age" in the 1980s, "After so many years, I still have the deepest impression of "Man to Middle Age" after the reform and opening up. At that time, my doctor friends abroad were all I'm crying. If "Chinese Doctor" can play such a role, it will be great."
Academician Zhong Nanshan said that if "Chinese Doctor" can resonate with foreign audiences, it will be very successful.
During the discussion and exchange, Academician Zhong Nanshan also shared his opinions and suggestions on the current international epidemic prevention and control, "I believe that people are always smarter than viruses."
Academician Zhong Nanshan said that although the virus is unpredictable, mankind has survived all kinds of dangers since primitive society. Nowadays, modern society has advanced medical technology and social management measures. In addition, medical staff and even ordinary people all over the world have With a basic understanding of scientific response to the new crown pneumonia epidemic, people will no longer be as passive as before. “Next, we must pay attention to two aspects of work. One is to study how the world can strengthen cooperation, and the other is to focus on comforting people’s hearts.” .

The cumulative number of confirmed cases of new crown in Japan exceeds 30,000-Xinhua English.news.cn
According to statistics, 239 new cases were confirmed in Tokyo on the 26th. There were more than 200 new cases in a single day for 6 consecutive days, and the total number has reached 11214.
In addition, there were 141 new confirmed cases in Osaka Prefecture, 90 new cases in Fukuoka Prefecture, and 80 new cases in Aichi Prefecture.
Telecom network fraud crimes rose by 70% in the first half of the year
China News Service, July 26. According to the Supreme Procuratorate website, in the first half of this year, prosecutors nationwide prosecuted 58,101 people for fraud, a year-on-year increase of 35%.
In particular, among crimes that hinder the prevention and control of the epidemic, fraud crimes occur frequently, and the number of people prosecuted by the prosecutors for fraud accounted for 43.4% of all crimes that hinder the prevention and control of the epidemic.
The Supreme People's Procuratorate has carried out targeted guidance. Among the ten batches of typical cases involving epidemic prevention and control that have been released, there are 9 cases involving fraud.
Judging from the case handling by the procuratorial organs in the first half of the year, there are many names involved in fraud crimes, ranging from national macro policies to people’s clothing, food, housing and transportation, including epidemic-related fraud, “medical care” fraud, “health care product” fraud, “admission agency” fraud, The “routine loan” fraud, the fraud of obtaining state subsidies, the fraud of national assets unfreezing, etc., continue to “innovate”, covering education, medical care, employment, pension, social security, land acquisition and demolition, targeted poverty alleviation, financial credit and other fields. The victims caused economic losses and also seriously affected the economic and social development.
In particular, some telecommunications network fraud breaks through the restrictions of national boundaries, regions and personnel, and has the characteristics of stakeholder, cross-border, remote, electronic payment, etc., and there are many unspecified victims and great harm.
For example, some set up specialized companies, rent high-end office buildings, set up multiple departments or positions, use legal network platforms to promote and recruit, train and evaluate recruiters, adopt corporate operation mode management, and wear a “legal cloak” to confuse Stronger sex.
Punishing and preventing crimes in accordance with the law, and promptly issuing early warnings to the public and relevant departments are the unshirkable responsibilities of procuratorial organs.
In judicial case handling, the procuratorial organs earnestly perform their duties, not only insisting on maintaining a high-pressure posture against fraud crimes, but also targeting specific law enforcement measures, and promoting social governance through the formulation and issuance of procuratorial recommendations.
The procuratorial organs strictly control the facts, evidence, procedures, and application of law in approving and prosecuting fraud cases, taking facts as the basis and the law as the criterion, so as to be invincible.
Especially for telecommunication network fraud crimes, we pay attention to the core role of electronic data in fact determination, and strive to build an evidence chain that mutually confirms electronic data, verbal evidence, and documentary evidence.
For example, the Yinzhou District Procuratorate of Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province handled an epidemic-related fraud case, and the prosecutors intervened as soon as possible. From the occurrence of the case to the completion of the case, it only took 5 days, which reflected that it was handled quickly and strictly, and the overall social stability Attitude and determination.
In the process of reviewing arrests and reviewing prosecutions, we focused on the prosecution of missed offenders, corrected the missed arrest of 733 people by public security organs, and corrected the missed review and prosecution of 1,113 co-criminals by public security organs.
In the first half of the year, procuratorial organs across the country issued 298 procuratorial recommendations for fraud crimes, promoting joint efforts to prevent fraud crimes and promoting in-depth governance.
For example, in response to the loopholes in the supervision of telecommunications companies, banks, and intermediary organizations found in the handling of the case, the Guangzhou Procuratorate of Guangdong Province and the Dongguan Procuratorate promptly put forward procuratorial suggestions, urging relevant units to strengthen supervision, improve mechanisms, and promote the leaders. Effective system construction.
The fourth is to make every effort to recover stolen goods and restore damages.
Local procuratorial organs seize important links such as intervening in investigations to guide evidence collection, review and prosecution, supervise investigative agencies to actively recover stolen money, cooperate with relevant departments to recover stolen money, and strive to minimize the economic losses caused by fraud crimes to the people.
For example, the Lin Moumou Routine Loan case handled by the Beijing Municipal Procuratorate involved 22 houses waiting to be sealed up. In the case that the real estate may be dealt with in advance by other cases, the original "Letter of Suspension of Execution" was created and sent to the relevant courts in a timely manner. It is recommended that the court previously closed down the real estate involved in the case to suspend the execution, and after the facts of the crime are ascertained, it will be dealt with in a unified manner, so as to make the greatest efforts to recover the real estate involved in the case and recover the losses of the victims.
The prosecutor reminded everyone to be very vigilant against fraud and crimes. Don't expect "pie in the sky", and don't be credulous when you think it's cheap, and keep your "money bag" safe.
Yina Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province: Shorter Apple Trees Wider the Road to Poverty
2020-07-26 11:42:58 Source: China Economic Net Author: Zhu Yanjing Responsible Editor: Zhu Yanjing
In the sweltering heat, a reporter from Economic Daily-China Economic Net walked into Zhonghai Village, Yina Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province.
Under the scorching sun, villager Li Yuanzhong was weeding in the base. Although his face was flushed with sun, he hummed a few small songs from time to time.
Weining County, where Yina Town is located, has low latitude, high altitude, sufficient sunlight, and large temperature difference between day and night. The apples produced have high sugar content and good taste. Failed to sell at a good price, failed to form an industry scale.
Yina Town used to be a poor township that "wrapped the valleys and potatoes to survive the spring and autumn". The local poverty incidence was as high as 25.8% 10 years ago.
As the fight against poverty has entered a critical period of decisive victory, it is urgent to change the traditional planting habits, adjust the industrial structure, and increase the income of farmers.
After many visits, Chen Chao, secretary of the Party Committee of Yina Town, and a group of people in the town believed that industrial development should not go the same way.
To this end, Yina Town introduced leading enterprises to grow apples in a modern way.
Hou Jianwen, deputy general manager of Weining Chaoyue Agriculture Co., Ltd., came to Yina Town from Shaanxi in 2015 for investigation. He saw the local planting conditions at a glance, and began to plant apple trees in 2016.
At first, the village mobilized Li Yuanzhong to transfer the land to plant apple trees. The Li Yuanzhong and his wife murmured in their hearts: "After so many years of apples, they have never seen anyone in the village who has grown apples and made a fortune."
"All the apples are dwarfed apples, which will not make the apple trees grow too tall."
What Li Yuanzhong did not expect was that the new method of apple planting was adopted. Irrigation pipes were laid under each apple tree. Water and fertilizer were poured to the roots of the tree. When the fruit was harvested in autumn, the tractor drove directly into the orchard and stood there. Can pick fruit.
At present, the apple base has gradually entered a high-yield period, and the market is just as Hou Jianwen expected. Apples are not worried about selling, and they are deeply loved by consumers in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.
The growing apple industry has brought new changes to Li Yuanzhong's life. Although he is still farming, he has a new source of income.
Li Yuanzhong’s family has more than 9 acres of land transferred to the apple base. In addition to the guaranteed land transfer fee, there are profit dividends after the fruit is sold. The couple usually work in the base. ".
Li Yuanzhong told reporters that last year's profit distribution received more than 2,800 yuan, plus the land transfer fee and the couple's labor income, and the family's income was more than 80,000 yuan. "You don't have to worry about food and clothing, and the life of a well-off society is already over."
"At present, initial results have been achieved. The annual output value of 1 mu of apples exceeds 15,000 yuan, which is about 10 times that of corn."
Chen Chao told reporters that the whole town of Yina currently planted 20,000 mu of apples. In Zhonghai Village alone, there are 6,000 mu, covering 4,056 households and 17,200 rural households, including 656 registered poor households with 2,952 people. The annual salary is more than 6 million yuan, which really realized that the base was built in front of the house, and there was no need to go out for work.
Li Yuanzhong, whose pockets are gradually bulging, also began to realize his "wish."
This year's Lunar New Year, Li Yuanzhong bought an off-road vehicle, such as driving a car to get off work today, "there is still more than ten acres of land at home, when the next step is to expand the scale of Apple's base, all will be transferred to them, the income will be more."

Membrane separation technology helps crack the "greenhouse effect"-Chinanews
Membrane separation technology helps crack the "greenhouse effect"
Schematic diagram of new mixed matrix membrane preparation technology
Our reporter Shang Rui reported: Recently, the Tianjin University Atmospheric Environment and Bioenergy Team has made significant progress on the "membrane separation method to capture carbon dioxide" and successfully developed a new hybrid matrix membrane preparation technology, which greatly improves the carbon dioxide capture performance of membrane materials.
Related results have been published as the cover article of the international journal "Greenhouse Gas: Science and Technology".
The "greenhouse effect" is a major environmental issue that plagues human development, and carbon dioxide emissions are the culprit responsible for the "greenhouse effect".
How to efficiently capture and use carbon dioxide emitted by humans is the focus of attention of scientists.
"Membrane separation method" is an emerging carbon dioxide capture technology. It separates carbon dioxide gas with the help of membrane materials. It has the characteristics of high efficiency, energy saving and simple operation.
How to let the membrane material "breathe deeply" and improve the efficiency of gas separation is the bottleneck difficulty in the use of membrane separation to capture carbon dioxide.
The scientific research team of Tianjin University has innovated ideas and through repeated experiments, explored the influence of different solvents on the membrane gas separation performance.
The experimental results show that using N-methylpyrrolidone as the preparation solvent, the carbon nanotubes in the produced membrane material are more uniformly distributed and "more air-permeable", which effectively improves the gas separation efficiency and rate of the membrane material.
The mixed matrix membrane prepared by this new technology has a carbon dioxide separation performance close to the current theoretical separation upper limit of this type of membrane material.
"The new technology provides new ideas for the capture of carbon dioxide by membrane separation."
Li Run, a member of Tianjin University's Atmospheric Environment and Bioenergy Team, said: "We hope that this technology can provide strong support for future coal-fired power plants and chemical companies to deal with flue gas, and play a major role in the control of greenhouse gas emissions.
Understand what is a professional grade difference before volunteering to fill in the report-Chinanews.com
2020-07-27 02:22:36 Source: Chongqing Morning News Author: Yu Xiao Editor: Yu Xiao
Understand what is a professional level difference before volunteering
Every year when applying for the college entrance examination, there are students or parents who do not understand the terms involved in the voluntary reporting, which affects the voluntary reporting.
This year, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing University of Science and Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing Forestry University, and Beijing University of Chemical Technology jointly issued the 2020 enrollment policy to cancel the major difference.
What is the meaning of professional grade difference, and what is its significance in voluntary reporting?
There are three ways of professional assignment rules
Experts remind that before filling in the application, you must read the "Admissions Regulations" of your favorite school to understand the admission rules of the college, including the transfer ratio, professional distribution rules, etc.
The rules of major distribution refer to the three main methods of major admission, major priority, score priority, and major difference after colleges are transferred.
The specific method used by colleges and universities will be specified in the "Admissions Regulations".
However, the admission principle of some colleges and universities is to give priority to the total score, and there is no difference between majors.
That is to say, candidates in the admission range are queued according to the total score. When the score does not reach the first professional volunteer admission score, it will be determined whether they have reached the second professional volunteer admission score, and so on until the admission to the last professional volunteer, each professional volunteer There is no level difference between them.
The so-called "professional level difference" refers to the "professional level difference" that the colleges and universities determine the admission majors of volunteer candidates of different majors according to one or several points announced in the admissions regulations when arranging candidates' majors. This point value is the "professional level difference".
That is, the difference between the scores of the colleges and universities in the admission of candidates for the first professional volunteer and the non-first professional volunteer, and the number of grade differences between the professional volunteers, such as 3 points, 2 points, 1 point, etc.
for example.
Suppose that student Xiao Ming applied for college A and scored 560 points. His professional volunteers are: computer, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering, and e-commerce. The professional admission of college A adopts the professional grade difference method, and the grade difference is 2 points and 1 point. , 1 point, 0 point.
When assigning a major, if Xiao Ming’s first major volunteer meets the professional admission requirements and the major has a planned balance, then Xiao Ming is admitted to the "computer" major; if the computer is not admitted, his score will be deducted by 2 points , According to the score of 558 points and the first professional volunteers to apply for "international trade" candidates to determine whether they meet the professional admission requirements; if it still cannot be met, the score is subtracted by 1 point (ie 557 points) for the third professional volunteer "automation" If it is still not satisfied, the score will be subtracted by 1 point (that is, 556 points) for admission to the fourth major. If the follow-up major still cannot meet the professional wishes, the points will no longer be reduced, and so on.
Different universities have different professional level differences
With the popularization of parallel volunteering, many colleges and universities have now cancelled the professional level difference, but some colleges and universities still retain this method this year. According to the "Admissions Regulations" announced by each school, there are mainly more than 20 colleges this year. The professional level is poor.
For example, Sichuan Agricultural University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Jiangxi Normal University, Chengdu Medical University, Northeast Dianli University, Jimei University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing University of Technology, Ningxia University, Shandong University of Technology, China Civil Aviation Flight Academy, etc.
In these universities, the professional level difference set by each university is different.
Some colleges and universities have a grade difference in each major, such as Ningxia University. Candidates who have already submitted their files to the school will be admitted according to the order in which the candidates fill in the majors.
And some universities have set up different professional level differences between different majors.
For example, Jimei University has a total score of 4 points for the professional volunteer grade, that is, the first professional volunteer and the other professional volunteers have a grade difference of 3 points. There is no level difference between other professional volunteers, which is regarded as parallel volunteers, and other professional volunteers and transfer professional volunteers are majors The level difference is 1 point.
When filling in their volunteers, candidates and parents must carefully read the admission policy of the school reported to see if there is a professional grade difference and what the form of the grade difference is. While fully considering the scores, they must also reasonably analyze the school and major to be selected. , If the college adopts the grade difference method for admission in the admissions charter, candidates should pay attention to the gradient between the majors when choosing a major to increase the chance of admission.

General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that “2020 is a year of milestone significance. We will build a moderately prosperous society in all respects and achieve the first centenary goal. 2020 is also a year of resolute victory in poverty alleviation”.
The large-scale financial media action "Walking the Village Live to Watch Poverty Alleviation" is an important measure taken by the Financial Program Center of China Central Radio and Television General Station to cope with this major theme and promote poverty alleviation.
The action will go into poverty alleviation villages in more than 20 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities across the country, dig out live poverty alleviation stories, directly hit the huge changes in the appearance of the village, and show how the villagers can break through the plight of survival and development and become rich.
This operation will last more than three months.
The reporter departed from Xuzhou and divided into two groups, all the way to the southwest line, passing through Anhui, Hubei, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, Chongqing, Yunnan, Tibet and other places; the other way to the northwest line, passing through Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu , Qinghai, Xinjiang, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Hebei and other places, the travel distance exceeds 10,000 kilometers.
In terms of reporting format, "Walking the Village Live to Watch Poverty Alleviation" boldly integrated.
The economic development of the villages visited by the caravan will be broadcasted through the CCTV Finance Channel, CCTV Economic Voice, China Communications Broadcasting, and CCTV Finance New Media.
Among them, the live TV broadcast will be mainly completed in the noon news program "Tianxia Finance" of the CCTV Finance Channel (first broadcast time: Monday to Sunday 12:00-13:00), and the prime news section of the CCTV Finance Channel "Economic Information Network" will be completed Open a column for poverty alleviation reports (first broadcast time: Monday to Sunday 20:30-21:30).

Walking into the electronic component processing and poverty alleviation workshop in Tongdu Street, Dongchuan District, a busy scene came into view.
Lu Ling, in her 40s, is a single mother who takes care of her children alone and also takes care of elderly parents.
When she was in the most difficult time, the Dongchuan District Federation of Trade Unions helped to come up with ideas and find a way to "send charcoal in the snow" after running.
Since 2018, Lv Ling has enjoyed housing, school, social security, employment and other assistance policies and assistance funds issued by labor unions at all levels.
This year, her child has successfully graduated and got a job. She herself has a job and income after participating in skills training, and she has gotten out of trouble at the end of April.
It is reported that the special skills training project of Dongchuan District General Organization to help poverty alleviation is part of the skills training work of the Yunnan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions.
Based on the characteristics of the employees in difficulties in relocation sites for poverty alleviation and resettlement in the district, the district will conduct in-depth investigations to understand the training needs and determine the types of training work. In the near future, it plans to train a total of 450 electricians, welders, and pastry chefs.
Recently, Li Yi, an employee of the Yunnan Menglian County Branch of the Agricultural Bank, wrote a sincere thank-you letter to the County Federation of Trade Unions.
In the letter, she sincerely thanked the union for the Golden Autumn Scholarship from August 2013 to January 2017 to help her complete her studies.
