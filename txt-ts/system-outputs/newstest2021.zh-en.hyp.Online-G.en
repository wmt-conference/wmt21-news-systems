Xinhua Time review: The excellent returning migrant workers into the rural revitalization force-Xinhua
Rural revitalization, talent is the key.
Where to find talent?
The excellent group of returning migrant workers is an indispensable force.
Xinhua News Agency sent Shang Hai Chun works
Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 26th topic: To make excellent returning migrant workers into a rural revitalization force
Zhang Xiong, 34, lives in Orchard Village, Meishan City, Sichuan Province. In 2010, he quit his job in Beijing, where he paid tens of thousands of dollars a month, and returned to his hometown to start a business.
After several years of hard work, now he runs the wine-growing family farm with an annual income of more than one million yuan, became a famous leader of the rich, and was selected to enter the village“two committees”team.
In recent years, more and more outstanding migrant workers like Zhang Xiong have chosen to return to their hometown to start a business, activating a pool of spring water in the countryside, inspired by a series of policies to support farmers and benefit farmers, such as the country's efforts to eradicate poverty and revitalize the countryside.
In 2019 alone, more than 8,000 village Party branch secretaries, 61,000 village reserve forces and more than 20,000 party members were generated from the outstanding migrant workers returned, providing a strong guarantee for winning the battle against poverty and implementing the strategy of rural revitalization.
Well-off is not well-off, the key to look at fellow countrymen.
Since the reform and opening-up, a large number of young and middle-aged laborers in rural China have gone out to increase their income, and some have set up their own enterprises through hard work.
But objectively, it has also led to the emergence of“hollow”in rural areas to varying degrees, especially the weakening of rural grass-roots organizations, and the“one old and one low”characteristics of the village party branch secretaries and party members, namely the aging of age, low education, and the problem of the lack of leadership in the village party organizations.
If the rural talent and other elements have been one-way flow to the city, the countryside for a long time in the state of“blood loss” and “anemia”, revitalization is an empty word.
Attracting those migrant workers who have the ability, awareness and ambition to serve their hometown, guiding them to return to their hometown to start their own businesses and become leaders in getting rich, training them to become party members and rural cadres on a merit-based basis, and enriching the cadres at the grass-roots level is the strategy to solve the problem of the disparity between the ranks of rural party members and the grass-roots party organizations.
Good migrant workers will be brought back, but also let them stay and do well.
In recent years, Sichuan has started by paying close attention to the party building of migrant workers. On the basis of strict candidate criteria, it has established a system and mechanism for the targeted return of outstanding migrant workers, service guarantee, training and selection, so that they can improve their ability, guarantee their work and hope in their lives, so that they can truly take root in the countryside and have a sense of accomplishment in starting their own businesses.
This year is the final year of the decisive battle against poverty. Talent is the key factor to do a good job of bridging poverty alleviation and rural revitalization.
Party committees and governments at all levels should attach great importance to the group of outstanding returning migrant workers. Through comprehensive measures, they will be built into a team and force that can stay, fight and take away, so as to provide strong organizational guarantee and personnel support for the rural areas to get rid of poverty and achieve a well-off and revitalization of development.
On the evening of July 11, bilibili summer graduation song will bring a special online live performance to the graduates, and musicians such as Old Wolf, Park Shu, Li Yuchun and Mao are not easy to send songs and blessings to the fresh graduates.
Well-known up master SealWu Wu Yifan also brought a song "weeds", which is based on Lu Xun's collection of prose poems of the same name to create a rap style song, very popular among young people.
As a result of the epidemic, many graduates did not experience the ritual of ear-picking and awarding degrees on the spot, and they transferred the ritual to the online.
The data show that the 2.5-hour song session, the peak live popularity of more than 35 million.
"Follow your own heart, seize the opportunity, regardless of the consequences, sometimes there will be unexpected gains."”
Although it is a graduation song, many songs also make non-recent graduates moved.
"The whole scene to see down really want to cry, who's youth are full of beauty and regret, but are worth remembering, to go down bravely."”

The natural ecology of the capital continues to attract wildlife to the city " to settle”
More than 500 species of wild animals have been found in Beijing
Newspaper news (reporter Wang Bin) Beijing Youth Daily reporter learned from the city landscaping Bureau, in recent years, with the capital's natural ecological environment continues to improve, the species and number of wild animals will continue to increase.
At present, the number of terrestrial vertebrate wildlife living in Beijing has increased to more than 500 species, including brown horse chicken, black stork and other state-level protected animals, as well as gazelle, swan, crane, mandarin duck and other state-level protected animals.
Whether it is planted into a city forest in the second ring road, or embedded in the small and micro-wetland between buildings, not only for the urban people to bring nature's wild interest, but also attract wild animals to the city to“settle”.
In midsummer, Songshan National Nature Reserve, located in the Yanshan Mountains in the northwest of Yanqing District, is flourishing.
A raccoon is playing leisurely by the mountain stream,while two wolverines fight with each other.
Looking back, a wild boar could not resist the body of the "prick", is rubbing hard against the bark.Hu Qiaoli, director of the Management Department of Songshan National Nature Reserve, said that as of the end of 2019, in the green sea with a total area of more than 6,200 hectares, there are 178 species of wild animals, including the golden eagle of the state-level protected animals and the spoon chicken and the gazelle of the state-level protected animals.
"In Matsuyama, wild animals are the real' masters‘, and our staff can at best be regarded as people's’bodyguards'.”
Hu Qiaoli said that in order to understand the wildlife in the protected area, more than 30 professional rangers are patrolling along 16 well-established protection routes every day. Every month, there will be a“big circle”, spending a full day traveling almost the entire protected area.
"During the inspection, it is necessary not only to check the record of biodiversity, but also to check the installation of artificial nests, rescue injured wildlife, installation of field infrared cameras and so on.”
More than 200 infrared cameras have been installed in Songshan National Nature Reserve to record the living status of wild animals in the forest.
Hu Qiaoli said that with the abundance of biodiversity in protected areas in recent years, more and more wild animals appear in the camera, ocelot, raccoon and pig badger has become the“resident guest”, the“appearance rate”of the national second-level protected animal gazelle is also getting higher and higher.
Zhang Zhiming, Director of the Department of Wildlife, Flora and Fauna and Wetland Protection of the Beijing Bureau of Landscaping, said that the number of terrestrial vertebrate wildlife in Beijing has increased from 461 species in 1994 to more than 500 species today, and the number of wildlife species and numbers in Beijing has continued to increase in recent years.
The presence of wild animals in the city is more and more common, closely related to the upgrading of greening in the capital city in recent years.
In particular, the new round of afforestation and greening construction started in 2018 proposed to reshape the urban ecological environment,enhance the ecological function of woodland green space, and highlight the concept of“near nature”.
Planning to achieve interconnection and interaction with the surrounding green areas, to facilitate wildlife "visiting friends and relatives", the trees are also animals love honey source, food source plants.
I am committed to assisting in communication between computers and the world around us.
There are many ways to do this, and I like to focus on helping computers talk about what they see and understand.
Given such a scenario, a modern computer vision algorithm can tell you that there is a woman, and there is a dog.
It can tell you that the woman is smiling.
It can even tell you that this dog is very cute.
I deal with this question and think about how humans understand and live with the world.
Those thoughts, memories, and stories in such a scene, may arouse human attention.
The interconnectedness of all connected situations.
Perhaps you have seen such a dog before, or you have spent time running on such a beach, and further evoke memories and thoughts of past holidays, before going to the beach, spending time running around with other dogs.
One of my guiding principles is that by helping computers understand what it's like to experience and to understand what we believe and feel in common, we have the ability to begin to evolve computer technology in a way that complements our experience.
So, digging deeper into this, I started working a few years ago to help computers produce human-like stories from image sequences.
So, one day, while I was working on a computer, I asked him what he thought of his trip to Australia.
He looked at the picture and saw a koala.
It doesn't know what koalas are, but the computer says it thinks koalas look like interesting creatures.
Then I shared with the computer a series of images about the burning of houses.
The computer looked at the picture and it said, " This is an amazing landscape!" It's spectacular!」
It chills my back.
The computer sees a terrible, life-changing and life-destroying event and thinks it's a positive thing.
I realized that the computer recognized the contrast between red and yellow and thought it was something worthy of positive evaluation.
Part of the reason is because most of the images I type into the computer are positive.
That's because people tend to share positive images when talking about their experiences.
When was the last time you saw a selfie at a funeral?
I realized that in the process of improving artificial intelligence, it is task to task, data set to data set, in the understanding of the computer, creating huge gaps, defects and blind spots.
While doing this, I'm coding for various biases.
Biases reflect limited views, stemming from a data set that reflects the same kinds of human beings, such as stereotypes and stereotypes.
I think back to the development of the technology that brought me to the position I was in that day-the first color image was calibrated for the skin color of a white woman, which meant that color photography was biased against black faces.
And the same deviation, that blind spot continues to bring into the 90s.
Even today, the same blind spot still exists in the application of facial recognition technology, how to identify the faces of different people.
In today's research, I think of the most advanced technologies that tend to limit our ideas to one data set and one problem.
And in doing so, we are creating more blind spots and biases that will be further amplified when using artificial intelligence.
That's when I realized that we had to think about what we invented today and how we would look five to ten years from now.
In human interaction with the environment, humans use time to correct problems, so evolution is slow.
Artificial intelligence, by contrast, is evolving at an incredible rate.
This means that it is really important, and we need to think carefully about it now-reflect on our blind spots and biases, and consider how these biases affect the technology we create now, and discuss today's technology and what it means for the future.
CEOs and scientists have weighed in on their ideas about future AI developments.
Stephen Hawking warns: "Artificial intelligence will destroy humanity.」
Elon Musk warns that this is an existential risk and one of the greatest risks we face as a civilized society.
"I don't understand why people aren't more worried about artificial intelligence," Bill Gates said.」
But these views -- they're just part of the story.
The math, the models, the basic components of these artificial intelligence, are something that we can all acquire and use.
We have source code tools that are open to the public to learn machines and at the same time make our own contributions.
In addition to this, we can also share our experience.
We can share the place in terms of technology and how it relates to us,and how it makes us jump.
We can discuss what we love.
We can communicate with the foreseeable future, on the technical side this may be more beneficial, or over time, more problems may arise.
If we all focus on opening up the discussion about AI to the future, it will help create a regular conversation and awareness about what AI is? What can it become? And all the things we need to do to achieve the results that work best for us.
We have seen and understood this in the technologies we use today.
We use smartphones, digital assistants and automatic vacuum cleaners.
Are they evil?
Maybe sometimes it is.
Are they beneficial?
Yes, they are, too.
They are not exactly the same.
There you have seen the light of the future.
The future will continue to start with what we are building and creating now.
We activated the domino effect, which opened up the evolutionary channel of artificial intelligence
In our time, the artificial intelligence that shapes tomorrow.
So that we can immerse ourselves in augmented reality technology and bring the world of the past back to life，
When people have trouble communicating, technology helps them share each other's experiences.
Technology built on online visual media can be used in self-driving cars.
Technology, which produces language based on the understanding of images, can evolve into technology that helps the visually impaired and helps them better possess the visual world.
We also see how technology can cause some problems.
We have technology today that analyzes the physical characteristics of our birth-such as the color of our skin or the expression on our faces-to determine whether we are criminals or terrorists.
We have the technology to process data, to process data about gender or race, to determine whether we can get a loan or not.
Everything we see now is just a snapshot of the evolution of artificial intelligence.
Because where we are now, it is a moment in evolution.
This means that what we do now will affect the future development of things and extend to the world of the future.
If we want artificial intelligence to help the way humans evolve, we need to define strategies and goals and open that path right away.
What I want to see is the direction of development that is suitable for human culture and environment.
Technology can help us cure people with neurological diseases or other disabilities, making their lives as challenging as everyone else.
Technology doesn't work with your characteristics or skin color.
My focus today is on technology tomorrow and ten years from now.，
Artificial intelligence can appear in many different ways.
But in this case, it is not a driverless car without any destination.
This is a car that we can drive and control at the same time.
We choose when to accelerate and when to slow down.
We choose whether we need to turn or not.
We choose what the AI of the future will be.
There will be a vast arena. Allowing artificial intelligence can be everything.
It will turn into a lot of different things.
Now it's up to us to figure out what needs to be implemented to ensure that the outcome of AI is better for all humans.
Thank you.

Black land " seed”out of agricultural modernization-Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 26th topic: Black land“seed”out of agricultural modernization
In the middle of summer, two spray-spraying aircraft passed from the 10,000 acres of high-yield demonstration field in the second operation station of the fifth management area of Friendship Farm, forming two white lines. The words“the first field in the world”, which were planted with black rice seedlings, were particularly striking in the green fields.
Kong Lingqiang, the station chief, said the aircraft can spray agents on more than 6,000 acres of arable land a day, about eight times the efficiency of drones and hundreds of times the efficiency of artificial.
This farm is located in Youyi County, Heilongjiang Province, the first grain-producing province in China. From the sound of cutting rice in the past to the sound of rumbling motors today, traditional Chinese farming and farms have transformed in this black soil belt.
In addition to aircraft, satellites are also used in the modern agricultural production of Friendship Farm.
On the one hand, they use satellite remote sensing technology to achieve accurate fertilization, reduce agricultural input, reduce pollution;on the other hand, satellite navigation technology can improve the standard operation level of agricultural machinery in the field.
In this year's rice production process, the farm will be satellite navigation unmanned rice planting technology operating area expanded from 3,000 acres last year to 30,000 acres.
This technology makes seedling planting more uniform,can maximize the use of sunlight and arable land resources, and can save 16 yuan per acre of labor costs.
The farm tries new technologies such as informationization and intelligence in agricultural production, forming the largest group of agricultural machinery in our country from the ground to the sky.
According to statistics, at present, the total amount of farm machinery is 49,000 units (pieces), and the comprehensive mechanization rate of the field is 99.8%.
Agricultural machinery operation to achieve GPS satellite navigation 100%, dry field precision sowing 100%,dry field high-power locomotive operation 100%.
"Green agriculture, smart agriculture, digital agriculture is the direction of agricultural modernization .”
Friendship Farm director Liu Hua Lian said.
The key to agricultural modernization lies in scientific and technological progress.
In recent years, Heilongjiang Agricultural reclamation, represented by farms, has played a demonstration and leading role in modern agricultural“aircraft carrier”, and has initially established a modern agricultural industry system dominated by large-scale planting, standardized production and industrial management.
On the outskirts of Friendship County, there is an agricultural machinery Expo park covering an area of 350,000 square meters.
Here, more than 140 sets of agricultural machinery (pieces) introduced and used by Heilongjiang agricultural reclamation over the years are displayed.
These agricultural tools and farms have witnessed the development of China's agricultural modernization.

Church fire in Nantes, France: Parish volunteer admits arson is usually kind-hearted-<url>
Beijing, July 26, according to foreign media reports, on July 18, Nantes, France, the religious historical architectural treasures,the famous Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul, in a fire was seriously damaged, the organ completely destroyed.
On the 26th local time, Nantes prosecutors announced that a parish volunteer in charge of the protection of the cathedral has been charged with“arson destruction.”
He had admitted that he had set the fire in the church.
Local prosecutor Senas said the 39-year-old parish volunteer from Rwanda admitted he set three fires in the cathedral during the night, according to the report.
The man's lawyer said the arsonist now regretted doing so.
The man entered France a few years ago by way of refuge, was sheltered in the parish where the fire occurred, and was taken into custody in the church.
Prosecutors said he had recently tried to renew his visa and was in conversation with the police.
But the church said it still could not believe that the usually very kind, smiling, but not very talkative believer would destroy the church he loved so much.
On the day of the fire on July 18, the volunteer had been questioned by the police because of illogical problems in the narrative, but he was later released.
The picture shows firefighters at the scene to rescue.
On the evening of the 25th, the man was arraigned again as a professional engineer in the laboratory of the Paris Central Police Department obtained new evidence.
This time, the man admitted to his act of arson.
If convicted of arson, the suspect could face up to 10 years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros, according to reports.
The report said that the fire caused serious damage to the cathedral of St. Pierre and St. Paul, the church organ was completely burned down, the stained glass windows behind the organ was also badly damaged.
Brunet, the chief architect of historic preservation in France, believes that the restoration of Nantes Cathedral will take at least three years, according to a conservative estimate.
Comprehensive News: US Unilateralism undermines Bilateral Relations International Public Opinion supports China's counter-system against the United States-Xinhua
Beijing, July 26 (Xinhua) -- On the morning of July 24, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the U.S. Embassy in China that China had decided to revoke the permission for the establishment and operation of the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu and made specific requests for the Consulate General to cease all operations and activities.
International public opinion believes that the unilateral measures taken by the United States have caused serious distress to the relations between China and the United States, and that it is legitimate and necessary for China to respond to the unjustified provocations of the United States and take counter-measures.
Andres Borkes, director of the Center for China Studies at the Institute of International Studies at the University of Chile, said the unilateralist measures in the United States have undermined the bridge of understanding between the two peoples and put the relationship between the two great powers at risk.
China has informed the United States that the closure of its Consulate general in Chengdu is a response to unilateral measures by the United States and is in line with diplomatic practice.
Patricio Giusto, a professor at the Catholic University of Argentina and director of the Arab-Chinese Research Center, believes that China's decision is a legitimate and necessary counter-measure against the previous provocations of the United States, not against the ordinary American people.
The United States is trying to distract the American public by pressuring China to cover up its weak response to the new crown outbreak.
Banbang Surjono, chairman of the Asian Innovation Research Center, an Indonesian think tank, said the provocative diplomatic gesture by the United States has caused serious distress to relations between the Two countries and faced serious challenges.
China has informed the United States that the closure of its Consulate General in Chengdu is a normal counter-measure and is in line with diplomatic practice. It reflects not only China's principled position of resolutely safeguarding its own interests, but also the rational and beneficial interests of Chinese diplomacy.
Francis Semwenza, a Tanzanian current affairs commentator, said China's decision was a legitimate and necessary response to U.S. provocations.
The U.S. side should take the initiative to improve relations with China and stop interfering in China's internal affairs.
The United States should focus on how to achieve economic and political win-win with China, and how to benefit the people of both countries and the international community as a whole.
Ali Youssef, executive Director of the Sudan－based Federation of Arab-Chinese Friendship Associations, said China's forced countermeasures were a legitimate and necessary response to the unjustified actions of the United States, in line with international law and basic norms of international relations, as well as diplomatic practice.
The U.S. request to close the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is a serious violation of international law and the basic norms of international relations.
It is hoped that the United States will rescind the previous decision and create the necessary conditions for the return of relations between the two countries to normalcy.
Singapore's Lianhe Zaobao said in an editorial that America's greater strategic intention is to contain China and prevent it from continuing to rise.
In the face of US pressure, China is reluctant to see China-US relations continue to deteriorate, but has to take counter-measures.

Hurricane Hannah makes landfall in Texas or causes river surge and flash floods-<url>
Beijing, July 26 comprehensive foreign media reported that at 5: 00 pm local time on the 25th, hurricane "Hannah" landed in Texas, will bring strong wind and rain, river surge, may also lead to life-threatening flash floods.
The National Hurricane Center said hurricane Hannah is expected to carry heavy rain, sweeping through parts of the southern and northeast parts of the state, causing flooding and life-threatening flash flooding in parts of the state.
The report said the worst affected by hurricane Hannah was south of Corpus Christi to the mouth of the Rio Grande River, and the Rio Grande Valley could erupt with widespread flash flooding.
Texas Governor Abbott said on the 25th: "Any hurricane is a huge challenge."”
Thirty-two counties in the state were in emergency because of the hurricane.
The city of Corpus Christi, a city of more than 320,000, has closed its libraries and museums, and residents are waiting.
Mr. Abbott also said the hurricane could not be allowed to bring more casualties to Texas as the state is being hit hard by the new crown epidemic.
It is reported that precipitation in southern Texas is expected to reach 6 to 12 inches by the night of the 26th,with 3 to 5 inches of rain in northern Texas and coastal Louisiana as well.
Due to global warming and other factors,“Hannah”formed earlier than the previous Atlantic hurricane season.
In general, the first hurricane in the Atlantic usually does not form until mid-August.
Poland will withdraw from the European treaty on the prevention of violence against women
Poland will take steps next week to withdraw from the European Treaty on the Prevention of Violence against Women, Poland's justice Ministry said Saturday.
Poland's right-wing government cabinet said the treaty, which requires schools to teach students about gender issues, trampled on the rights of parents.
Poland's Justice Minister Gioblo said at a news conference that his Ministry of Justice would submit a request to the Ministry of Labour and Family on Monday to begin withdrawing from the treaty.
That treaty is also known as the Istanbul Convention.
“The treaty contains some elements that we consider to be harmful to the meaning of morphological nature, " Mr. Gioblo said.”
Poland's ruling Law and Justice Party and its ruling coalition partners are closely allied with the Roman Catholic Church and advocate a conservative social agenda.
Polish President Andrzej Duda has made hostility to gay rights one of the main issues during his successful re-election campaign this month.
On Friday, thousands of Poles, most of them women, staged protests against the withdrawal from the convention in Warsaw and other cities.
“The purpose of withdrawing from the treaty is to legitimize domestic violence,”one of the organizers of the protest, Rempat, said at a protest march in Warsaw.
Some protesters held banners that read " The Law and Justice Party is a hell for women."
The Law and Justice Party has long complained about the Istanbul Convention.
Poland's previous centrist government ratified the convention in 2015.
The Law and Justice Party government says the treaty does not respect religion and calls for liberal social policies to be taught in schools.
But so far the party has not decided to withdraw from the convention.

Upgraded version of the Russian gunship helicopter card-52M first shipped at the end of the year-Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 25, according to the Russian Ministry of Defense plans, the upgraded version of the Russian gunship (hereinafter referred to as Wuzhi) card-52 --card-52M will be completed for the first time in December this year, the model in reconnaissance, communications and weapons performance will be greatly improved.
According to the Russian "Izvestia" recently reported that Wuzhika-52M named "super alligator“, its development contract was signed by the Russian military and military units in April last year, the first batch of two of the upgraded version of Wuzhika is in the Russian”progress" aerospace group company's Far East helicopter factory to undergo transformation, its national testing and improvement of the finishing work will end before October 2022.
According to Russian experts who understand the upgrade work, the“super alligator”“predecessor”-Wuzhika-52 was officially installed in November 2011, the model exposed some weaknesses in use, the transformation and upgrade is to“make up the short board.”
The report said that compared with the Ka-52, the KA-52M will partially use new protective materials that will not increase the weight of its pilot cockpit will be reinforced, equipped with new equipment to resist missile attacks, thereby increasing the probability of battlefield survival; assembly of more powerful generators, in order to power more complex airborne electronic equipment; photoelectric system upgrade, can detect and identify more distant battlefield targets; equipped with the main attack armored fighting vehicles and reinforced concrete fortifications of the new light multi-purpose missile, its range of up to 20 kilometers, than the range of similar missiles used in active Russian military; its defense weapons and communications The equipment will be maximized with Mi-28NM gunship helicopters that can attack aerial targets, making related maintenance easy and economical.
In addition, the card-52M will have more advanced electronic guidance systems, weapon targeting systems and navigation equipment.
Russian experts also said it is worth noting that the KA-52M will be equipped with communication equipment to communicate with the drone, so as to obtain real-time information transmitted by nearby drones in the air, such as the helicopter's cockpit screen to display images taken by the drone.
According to the plan, the pilot of the card-52M can directly control the drone with its cooperation, thereby improving the pilot's grasp of the battlefield situation and guidance of long-range missiles.
According to Russian media reports, Russia's deputy defense Minister Krivoruchko said in December last year that the Russian defense Ministry plans to buy more than 110 Wuzhikar-52M by 2027.

1.75 billion cubic meters of ecological water for Rivers and lakes in Hebei this year-<url>
Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, July 26 (Reporter Wang Kun) The reporter learned from the Hebei Provincial Water Conservancy Department, this year, Hebei Province coordinated the use of lead river water and local reservoir water, one after another to Hutuo River, Tang River, Juma River and other 28 rivers and Baiyangdian implementation of ecological water supply, a total of 1.75 billion cubic meters of river and lake ecological water supply.
Hebei Province clung to the favorable time for the south-to-north water diversion project to increase the flow of water, and implemented ecological water supply to the Tang River, Shahe, Zhulong River and other rivers by using the water diversion to Tang River, Shahe, Zhulong River and other rivers.
At the same time, the use of West Ocean, Tobu Shi and other nine large and medium-sized reservoirs and Baiyangdian to Fuyang River, Qinglong River and other rivers to implement ecological replenishment, the cumulative formation of water surface area of more than 90 square kilometers.
In order to do a good job in ecological water supply, Hebei Province Water Conservancy Department actively organized to carry out water supply river hidden danger investigation, remediation and reinforcement and river cleaning work, refine and implement measures, strengthen inspection control and protection.
Through supervision and inspection and centralized unannounced visits, all kinds of problems are solved in a timely manner, to ensure the safety and order of river water supply.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Department of Water Conservancy of Hebei Province, the orderly implementation of river and lake ecological replenishment has effectively repaired the ecological environment of rivers and lakes in Hebei Province, promoted the replenishment and conservation of groundwater along the coast, greatly improved the living environment and economic development environment along the route, and is of great significance to the realization of the goal of river and lake management and protection of“clear water, green shore, river and beautiful scenery”.
You should all know what I'm going to tell you.
I believe that the intuition that inequality can cause social division and corruption existed before the French Revolution.
The difference is that we can now find the evidence, and we can understand the impact of inequality by comparing societies, societies with different levels of equality.
I'm going to show you some data and explain why those data are really related.
But first, let's see how hard our lives are.
(Laughter) I want to start my speech with a contradiction.
This chart shows the relationship between our average life expectancy relative to gross national income, which measures the average level of affluence of the country.
You can look at the countries on the right, like Norway and the United States, which are twice as rich as the countries on the left, like Israel, Greece and Portugal.
But this has not affected the average life expectancy of their citizens.
There is no sign of interrelation.
But if we look inside societies, we can see that there are large differences in health conditions within their societies as a whole.
This picture shows that the average life expectancy is still.
These are the towns of England and Wales-the poorest on the right and the richest on the left.
There is a big difference between the poor and the others.
Even those who are just below the top are in worse health than those who are at the top.
So income means a lot in our society, but it doesn't make sense to compare between different societies.
The paradoxical explanation is that in our society, we look at relative income, or social status,identity-that is, the relationship between us and the size of the gap between people.
Once you have that idea, you should immediately think: What happens if the gap widens? What if we close the gap? What about widening or reducing the income gap?
That's what I'm going to tell you right away.
I'm not using any hypothetical data.
My data from the United Nations-like that of the World Bank-is about the income gap between these rich, developed-market democracies.
The method we use, which is easy to understand, and you can download, is to compare the income gap between the top 20% and the bottom 20% of each country.
You can see that the countries on the left are all more equal-Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden-and that the top 20% are about 3.5 to 4 times richer than the bottom 20%.
But on the other side of inequality-the UK, Portugal, the US, Singapore-the income gap is twice as large.
In this way, our country (Britain) is twice as unequal as other equally successful democratic markets.
Next I will show how this has affected our society.
We have collected data on problems arising from differences within society, which are more common at the bottom of society.
Internationally comparable data include life expectancy, children's math and language performance, infant mortality, suicide rates, the proportion of the prison population, early teenage pregnancies, levels of mutual trust, obesity, mental illness-all of which meet standard diagnostic classifications, including drug and alcohol addiction-and social mobility rates.
We put all of this into a single coefficient.
They are all weighted on average.
The score of a country is obtained on average by these factors.
As you can see, these scores are related to the inequalities I just showed, and I will show the data over and over again.
The more unequal countries are, the worse they will be on various social issues.
The correlation is very strong.
But if you look at the comparison of the same health and social problems with the index of national income per capita and gross national income, you will find nothing, and no correlation.
We are a little worried that people might think we are picking specific problems to cater to our theory and then artificially creating evidence. So we also published a paper in the British Medical Journal on the UNICEF Child Welfare Index.
It contains 40 different sections, summaries from others.
It includes whether children can talk to their parents, whether they have books in their homes, how much immunization rates are,and whether there is bullying in schools.
It's all included.
This is how the index relates to the same level of inequality.
The more unequal the society, the worse the children's performance is.
Relationships and their significance.
But once again, if you look at the relationship between child welfare and national income per capita, you will find nothing. There is no sign of association.
All the data I'm showing you so far reveals the same thing.
The average welfare of our society is no longer dependent on national income and economic growth.
They are important in poorer countries, but not in rich developed countries.
And the differences between us and our position relative to others now seem very important.
Below I will show you some of the divisions of our index.
This is the index of mutual trust.
Refers to the proportion of people who agree that the majority of people are credible.
This is data from the World Values Survey.
As you can see, on the more unequal side, about 15% of people feel that they can trust others.
But in more egalitarian societies, the proportion rose to 60 or 65 per cent.
If you look at community engagement or social capital assessments, there are very similar associations and inequalities.
I would say that we have repeated this work twice.
The first was for rich developed countries, and then we changed the test subjects and repeated the test for 50 states in the United States-the same question: Are the more unequal the states do worse on all these assessments?
This is the relationship between mutual trust and inequality that the federal government concluded in a general social survey.
Very similar scatters are distributed over a similar range of levels of trust.
The same thing continues.
Basically, we found that almost all of the factors related to mutual trust reflected in international surveys were also reflected in the 50 states we surveyed.
This is no coincidence.
This picture is a mental illness.
The World Health Organization (WHO) collected data using the same diagnostic interview method through random sampling allows us to compare the rates of mental illness in each society.
This is the rate of the population suffering from any kind of mental illness in the previous year.
It ranges from 8% to more than 24% - suggesting that society as a whole suffers from three times as many mental illnesses as other societies.
Similarly, these are closely linked to inequality.
This picture is the crime rate.
The red dot represents the states of the United States, and the blue triangle represents the provinces of Canada.
But look at the difference in their number.
The murder rate ranges from 15 to 150 per million.
This is the ratio of prison prisoners.
This is a 10-fold gap, and the exponential function amplifies that gap.
But the number of incarcerated varies from 40 to 400.
Crime is not the main cause of this relationship.
In some places, crime can explain part of the reason.
But it was more of a harsh trial, or rather a harsh trial.
The more unequal society is, the more inclined it is to retain the death penalty.
This picture shows the situation of children dropping out of high school.
Again, the gap is large.
If we discuss the selection of social talents, we will find that the harm of this gap is very serious.
This chart is the rate of social mobility.
It is actually calculated based on the flow rate of income.
Basically, what it asks is: Does rich dad have rich children Poor dad has poor children, or is there nothing to do with the two?
On the more unequal side, dad's income is more important - for example, in the United Kingdom and the United States.
And in Northern Europe, dad's income is not so important.
There is more movement of social classes there.
As we often say-and I know there are a lot of American listeners here-if Americans want to realize their“American dream,” they should go to Denmark.
(Laughter) (applause) What I've shown is marked here in italics.
I can also show some other questions.
Those problems are more pervasive at the bottom of the social gradient.
But there are endless problems with social gradients, which are worse in unequal countries-not just a little worse, but as much as twice as bad as 10 times worse at all.
Think about the cost, the cost of labor.
I'd like to go back to the previous picture and we'll combine everything to illustrate two points.
First, through chart after chart, we find that the countries that perform poorly, whatever, seem to be the more unequal, but those that do well seem to be Northern Europe and Japan.
So what we see is the relationship between general social disorder and inequality.
Not just one or two things went wrong, but almost everything.
Another very important point I would like to point out on this chart is that if you look at the bottom, Switzerland and Japan, they show in all respects that they are very different countries.
The status of women, and their adherence to small families, in rich and developed countries, is at two extremes.
But another important difference is how they achieve greater equality.
Sweden has a big difference in income, but it uses taxes, state benefits, generous relief, and so on to close the gap.
Japan is quite different.
First, Japan's pre-tax wage gap is relatively small.
It has lower taxes.
Its benefits are also relatively small.
And in a study of the states of the United States, we found a sharp contrast.
Some states do well through redistribution, while others do well because of a small pre-tax income gap.
So we conclude that it is not important how to achieve greater equality, it is important to achieve such equality.
I am not talking about complete equality, I am talking about the fact that it exists in rich, developed market democracies.
Another unexpected thing about this figure is that it is not just the poor that are affected by inequality.
The words of John Dorn (English poet) seem to make sense: “No man is an island.”
Through a series of studies, we were able to compare the behavior of people of each social class in more or less different countries to the degree of equality.
This is just an example.
This chart is infant mortality.
According to the British General socio-economic classification records, some Swedes are very benevolent in classifying a lot of infant deaths.
This is an out-of-date classification based on fathers ' positions, so single mothers form their own set of data.
But we look at the so-called” lower strata of society", which is manual work without technology.
In the middle is manual work that requires technology, to advanced non-manual work, all the way to professional work-doctors,lawyers, managers of large companies.
It can be seen here that Sweden is doing better than Britain and is doing better at every social level.
The biggest difference arises at the bottom of society.
But even at the top, living in a more equal society has some advantages.
We presented five different sets of data, including U.S. and international educational outcomes as well as health.
It seems that, overall, more equal societies show the most distinct differences at the bottom of society, but there are also some advantages at the top of society.
I should explain what's going on.
I think I'm demonstrating and discussing the psychosocial impact of inequality.
It is more about superiority and inferiority, to be valued and despised, to be respected and belittled.
Of course, those feelings of competition for status motivated the advance of social consumerism.
But it also leads to a lack of status assurance.
We are more concerned about how others judge and perceive us, whether we are attractive, intelligent, or something like that.
Social value evaluation reinforces the fear of these social value evaluation.
Interestingly, similar work in the field of social psychology is also going on: some people looked at 208 different studies, in which volunteers were invited to a psychological testing center and tested their stress and their responses to stress tasks.
In this observation, scientists are interested in which kind of stress most raises the level of cortisol in the body, the most important stress Holmon.
The result is tasks that include social evaluation threats-tasks that threaten self-esteem and social status-in which others can negatively evaluate your performance.
These pressures have a very special effect on the physiology of stress.
At the moment we have accepted the criticism.
Of course, some people do not like this, some people find this very unexpected.
I should tell you, however, that when people criticize us for picking data, we never do that.
We have an unconditional rule that if our data source contains data from the observed country, then we will include it in the analysis.
Our data source determines whether the data is valid, not us.
Otherwise, there will be deviations.
What about other countries?
In academic peer-reviewed journals, there are 200 studies on the relationship between health and income and equality.
This is not confined to these countries here, there is a very simple proof.
The same countries, the same methods of measuring inequality, the problem is one after the other.
Why don't we control the other factors?
I have shown you that per capita national income has not had any impact.
Of course, others have applied more complex methods in the literature to exclude poverty, education and other factors in the experiment.
What about cause and effect?
Correlation alone does not prove a causal link.
We spent quite a bit of time.
Indeed, there is a good understanding of the causal link between these results.
The biggest change in our understanding of the drivers of long-term health in rich developed countries is how important long-term stress from society is for immunity and the cardiovascular system
Or, for example, the reason violence is becoming more common in less unequal countries is because people are so sensitive to being despised.
I would like to say that in order to solve this problem, we should solve a series of problems after and before taxes.
We should limit income and curb the bonus income culture at the top.
I think we have to do everything we can to make our leaders accountable to our employees.
The last thing I want to sum up is that we can improve our real quality of life by reducing our income gap.
In this case, we will find that we suddenly solve the psychosocial health problems of the whole society, which is great.
Thank you.

(Deutsche Welle) Spain has seen a sharp rise in new crown cases in the past two weeks, with thousands of new cases emerging on several days.
On Saturday (July 25), the British government temporarily decided to remove Spain from the safe travel list from 00: 00 local time on the 26th, and that people entering the UK from Spain must be quarantined for 14 days.
British tourists on holiday in Spain have been surprised, worried and even angry at the decision because of the sudden and unexpected news.
Grant Shapps, the British Transport secretary, is also reportedly on holiday in Spain.
Norway has also announced a 10-day quarantine for people returning to Norway from Spain, ahead of the UK's quarantine measures.
France and Belgium advise their residents to abandon their plans for holidays in Barcelona and the surrounding areas.
The beaches in these areas were overcrowded and people were unable to maintain social distance, and the police once needed to take steps to reduce the number of beach visitors.
Tourism is an important pillar industry in Spain
Spain:It's safe here
In response to the British decision, Spain's foreign Ministry said on Sunday that the outbreak in the country was under control.
Spanish Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya stressed to the media: "Spain is safe, not only for Spaniards, but also for tourists."
The Spanish government will try to persuade the British government to exclude the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands from the quarantine measures.
The reason is that the rates of infection in these two tourist resorts are much lower than in the UK.
In order to prevent the spread of the epidemic, the Spanish region of Catalonia has also renewed the"restraining order."
Tourism is an important pillar industry in Spain, which is one of the most popular holiday destinations for British tourists.
The UK's decision is expected to have a major impact on Spain's tourism industry.

Engine may Stall FAA Orders 2,000 Boeing airliners-Xinhua
The United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)issued an emergency airworthiness directive on the 24th, requiring emergency inspection of about 2,000 Boeing 737NG and 737Classic aircraft registered in the United States, because the air check valve corrosion of the aircraft may cause the engine to stop in the air.
The FAA said it had so far received four reports of aerial parking of the engines of the 737NG and 737Classic aircraft, resulting in an emergency inspection request for aircraft that had been parked for seven consecutive days or more and for aircraft that had flown less than 11 times since re-entering the aircraft.
The FAA has warned that the Class 5 check valves on all two of the aircraft's engines, if corroded, could become stuck in the open position, causing the aircraft to lose power completely and be unable to restart the engine.
The aviation regulator ordered that if the check valve was found to be corroded, the airline operator must replace the critical component before the aircraft is put into service again.
Boeing responded later in the day that the outbreak of the new crown outbreak led to reduced travel demand, and many airliners were mothballed or used less, “ check valves are more vulnerable to corrosion. ”
Boeing also said it had advised air carriers to inspect the airliners involved in the directive, and if problems were found, Boeing would provide assistance in overhauling and replacing check valves.
airliners owned by major U.S. air carriers usually fly multiple times a day, but a large number of airliners have been grounded after the new crown outbreak, and some have been put back into operation as demand for passenger travel has recently grown slowly, the Associated Press reported.
The FAA did not release the details of the four aerial parking reports.
Alaska Airlines disclosed one of the incidents late on the 24th.
The airline said in a statement that one of its airliners made an emergency landing at Austin Airport on July 15 when an engine suddenly stalled on the way from Seattle, Washington, to Austin, Texas.
Alaska Airlines says it has replaced the engine of the airliner and has inspected the engines of six airliners in accordance with FAA instructions.
American Airlines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines said on the 24th, respectively, its passenger aircraft did not appear associated with the air check valve engine flameout.
Four of American Airlines ' aircraft will be inspected and 28 of United's aircraft will be inspected.
Delta said it would inspect 20 of its airliners, but did not say whether there had been engine failures.
A number of media reports, the FAA emergency airworthiness directive is another shock to Boeing.
Indonesian Lion Airlines and Ethiopian Airlines each crashed a Boeing 737MAX airliner in October 2018 and March 2019, respectively, killing a total of 346 people.
The series of airliners was subsequently grounded worldwide,discontinued in January and resumed production in May.
FAA Chief Steve Dickson admitted in June that the FAA had“made a mistake” in regulating Boeing on the 737MAX.

The Chief Secretary for Administration of the HKSAR Government: The situation is grim and the fight against the epidemic is full-on-the-wall-<url>
Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 26, the Chief Secretary for Administration of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, Mr. Cheung Kin-chung, said on the 26th that the situation of the new crown pneumonia epidemic in Hong Kong continues to be serious, if the epidemic turns bad, the Special Administrative Region Government will decisively take more stringent control measures, further restrict business premises and reduce the space for people to go out.
At this stage, however, the HKSAR Government has no intention of introducing a“home order”or a“foot restraining order”to restrict people from going out.
Zhang Jianzong published a blog on the same day entitled "The situation is grim and full anti-epidemic".
He said the outbreak was the worst in six months, and the next two weeks would be critical to try to prevent further spread of the virus in the community.
In addition to the necessary measures taken by the HKSAR Government, self-discipline and co-operation among the public are also very important.
He urged members of the public to stay at home as much as possible, reduce social contact and eat out.
Members of the public should comply with mandatory measures to wear masks to protect themselves and others. They should also pay attention to personal and environmental hygiene and wash their hands frequently.

(China Poverty Alleviation Story)“Plug into the South " to pursue the poetic dream of the Yellow River”
China News Agency, Yinchuan, July 26 (Yang Di) " Nine Qu Yellow River, thousands of sand, waves and wind wind from the end of the world."”
The Yellow River, which aroused the pride of countless literati, gave birth to the beautiful and rich Ningxia Plain. Now, Ningxia, which has the reputation of“plugging the Jiangnan”, is adhering to the concept of“ecological priority and green development”and pursuing the poetic“Yellow River Dream”.
The“Blue Wave Dream " of the River Shimizu Show”
The Yellow River flows through Ningxia 397 kilometers and is the“mother River”that nurtures one side.
However, with the rapid advance of industrialization and urbanization, the development and utilization of rivers and lakes and management and protection imbalance, excessive sewage, surrounding lakes and fields, encroachment of water and other disturbances highlight, resulting in black and smelly water, excessive water quality, environmental mess, ecological degradation.
Now, Ningxia is promoting the restoration of water ecological diversity, and trying to restore the Yellow River water show the river Qing.
The water should be treated from the source.
In Yinchuan, Ningxia, the local approach of“standard improvement+pollution control+strict control”has been adopted. All industrial parks have achieved centralized treatment of sewage, all urban sewage treatment plants have achieved level A standard discharge, and the black and smelly water bodies in urban built-up areas have basically been eliminated, and the third batch of Chinese black and smelly water demonstration cities have been successfully declared.
In addition, Ningxia fully implemented the river and lake long system in 2017, and now has realized the full coverage of the five-level river and lake long system responsibility system in districts, cities, counties and villages, and river and lake long patrol has become the norm.
Gu Jincheng, 64, who lives in a village along the Yellow River, witnessed the change: "The water used to stink, and after rectification, the stink was gone.”
Gu Jincheng said that the ecological environment is good,his life is more comfortable, now he often and his family go to the Yellow River for a walk, feel the clear water and blue sky.
"Wetland Dream" by Shagu Xiang Collection”
Flying birds, green trees, plank roads, clear water...... Fan Zhongyan's”Shagu Xiangji " beauty in the Yellow River Wetland Park in Yinchuan, Ningxia has become a reality.
The Yellow River flows through Ningxia, forming a variety of wetlands such as river wetlands, lake wetlands and marsh wetlands along the way, which plays an important role in promoting the rational utilization of water resources and the ecological balance of water, and also becomes an important international migration channel for birds.
Since 2009, the relevant departments of Ningxia have invested about 3.45 billion yuan in wetland protection projects.At present, Yinchuan Wetland covers an area of 19,200 hectares, with a wetland protection rate of 78.5%, there are nearly 200 natural lakes and marshes, and there are five national wetland parks, one national urban wetland park, six wetland parks at the autonomous region level and eight municipal parks.
Lv Jinhu, deputy director of Yinchuan Wetland Protection Center, told reporters that wetland protection has increased biodiversity, which is particularly evident in birds.“The gull is an endangered bird, there are only more than 20,000 birds in the world, of which Yinchuan Wetland inhabits more than 2,000."”
At the same time, Ningxia has delineated a red line of 500 meters for the wetland protection area on both sides of the Yinchuan section of the Yellow River according to law, stipulating that no unit or individual may carry out development, construction and business operations within the scope of protection except for public welfare projects.
Zhao Shaoyong, deputy director of Yinchuan Water Conservancy Service Center, said that through pollution source control, comprehensive remediation of river and lake ecology and the construction of end wetlands, the water quality of nine major yellow drainage ditches in Ningxia has now reached 100% of the class IV standard,“now the water is clear, the fish are also swimming, the flowers are also blooming."”

Yinchuan City, Ningxia, once had an”awkward "title: the only city along the Yellow River" to watch the Yellow River lack of water to drink".
Since 2010, Yinchuan City began to face a persistent summer peak water shortage problem, nearly a decade of "water shortage pain" has become a summer painful experience for many high-floor residents,but in the major water sources in the limit of over-mining, urban underground has formed a large area of groundwater over-mining funnel area under the status quo, water shortage has become a problem plaguing Yinchuan City.
Thanks to the improvement of the water quality of the Yellow River, drinking purified Yellow River water has become a solution to the problem of drinking water of local residents.
Ding Ming, deputy director of Yinchuan Municipal Water Bureau, introduced that in order to improve the demand for water for urban and rural residents in Yinchuan, Ningxia timely launched the water supply project for urban and rural western line in Yinchuan Metropolitan area, replacing the original groundwater source with high-quality Yellow River water.
On December 29, 2019, the water supply project officially opened to the three districts of Yinchuan. In 2020, residents of Minning Town and Helan County also drank the Yellow River water. ”
Ding Ming said that the Yinchuan water conservancy department will consider the integration of regional rural drinking water and urban water supply transformation, " the next step, we will integrate the rural decentralized water supply points after all access to the Western line water supply project, is expected to basically realize the integration of urban and rural water supply in Yinchuan region by the end of this year."”

U.S. launches countervailing investigation against China over“undervalued RMB Exchange Rate”for the first time
In response to the recent announcement by the U.S. Department of Commerce, it has decided to launch an anti-dumping and countervailing investigation on cable ties (cable ties) products originating in China, and launched an investigation on the“undervaluation of the Renminbi exchange rate“project.
China's Ministry of Commerce pointed out that this is the first time that the United States has investigated the so-called”undervaluation of the renminbi exchange rate“in a countervailing case, which China firmly opposes.
The Ministry of Commerce of China issued a special press release on the evening of the 23rd, said that China implements a floating exchange rate system based on market supply and demand, adjusted with reference to a basket of currencies, managed by the market, the market plays a decisive role in the formation of the exchange rate.
The press release stressed that, overall, the Renminbi exchange rate is at a reasonably balanced level and is not undervalued.
Since 2005, the renminbi has appreciated more than 17 per cent against the dollar.
According to data released by the Bank for International Settlements, from early 2005 to May 2020, the RENMINBI's nominal effective exchange rate appreciated by 38% and the real effective exchange rate appreciated by 49%, making it the strongest currency in the G20 economies and one of the largest currencies in the world.
The Ministry of Commerce pointed out that the exchange rate issue exceeded the competence of members to conduct countervailing investigations in accordance with World Trade Organization rules.
In February, the United States amended its regulations to conduct countervailing investigations on other countries ' exchange rates, which has been suspected of violating WTO rules and has been opposed by many sides.
Even under U.S. regulations, the applicant's complaint contained numerous errors and did not have the necessary countervailing elements such as financial assistance, grant of benefits, and exclusivity, the press release said.
China urges the United States to abide by existing international rules and stop conducting countervailing investigations into the so-called“undervaluation of the Renminbi exchange rate.”
Affected by the further increase in the tension between China and the United States, the offshore and onshore renminbi against the US dollar exchange rate on the 22nd was a great devaluation, both fell below the US dollar against the US dollar 7.0 yuan mark.
Whether the U.S. Commerce Department's move is intended to force a rise in the renminbi is a matter of concern.
The spot exchange rate of the renminbi against the dollar rose above the 7.0 mark on the 23rd, closing at 6.9961.
The central price of the renminbi against the dollar, which is regulated by the official exchange rate, was cut by 17 basis points on the 24th to 6.9938.

Lewis Family: John Lewis is a warrior who“fights for the weakest”
U.S. Congressman John Lewis, a Civil rights fighter, was remembered as a soldier“fighting for the weakest”at a memorial service for him on Saturday (July 25).
Lewis ' public memorial service has been held in Alabama since Saturday.
There were two memorial services on the first day.
At a public memorial service Saturday at Troy University in Alabama, Lewis's five siblings and a nephew spoke of a loving, fearless, family-oriented man.
Henry“Grant”Lewis, Lewis's youngest brother, said at the meeting: "He has devoted his life to helping others.”
Samuel Lewis said his mother had warned John“not to get in trouble, not to get in trouble."”
He added that John did not heed his mother's warning,saying, " We all know that John is always in trouble,always in trouble,but it is because he insists on the right thing, that is a good trouble."”
Lewis's brothers and sisters reminded people at the memorial service that John's most famous argument was to create "good trouble," that is, not to be shy about provoking trouble for the sake of justice.
John had applied to Troy University in Troy, Alabama, where he was born, but Troy University, an all-white school at the time, rejected his application.
John Lewis, who preached the gospel to chickens on his farm as a child, eventually earned a degree in religion and philosophy from Fisk University.
Years later, Troy University awarded Lewis an honorary doctorate.
Sen. Doug Jones, R-Alabama, said the current protesters are "protesting peacefully, nonviolently," as Lewis did in the Civil rights movement.
“ Even if President Trump knocked over a boat and called all the protesters a thug, he was wrong, " Jones said.
The protesters were patriots who wanted the United States to move towards a more equal country.”
A six-day series of events in Lewis ' memory will culminate this week at a funeral in Georgia.
Lewis ' coffin was parked at a public memorial at Troy University on Saturday, and people came to pay their respects to the pioneer of the Civil Rights movement.
Later Saturday, a private ceremony paid tribute to him in a chapel in Selma, Ala., followed by a public memorial.
On Sunday, Lewis ' body will pass through the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma.
In 1965, he and protesters demanding the right to vote were beaten in front of the bridge by Alabama police, who also fired tear gas at demonstrators.
Lewis was almost killed.
This day will later be called“Bloody Sunday".
Lewis ' body will be transported to Montgomery, the capital of Alabama.
Mayor Steven Reed encouraged people to line up on the sidewalk to join Lewis on this last ride.
At the same time, officials asked the public to wear masks and maintain a social distance when participating in the event.
Alabama Governor Kay Ivey ordered the flag to be lowered at half-mast on Saturday and Sunday in honor of Mr. Lewis.
Lewis ' body will be interred at the Alabama State Capitol in Montgomery, the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta, and the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., during a nearly week-long commemoration.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced last week that people could pay tribute to Lewis at the U.S. Capitol on Monday and Tuesday.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenzhen, July 26 (reporter Mao Siqian, Bai Yu) Encourage residents to do physical examination, early detection of problems;prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors; establish an online game health censorship system; employers should be equipped with full-time and part-time health management personnel...... Recently, the“Shenzhen Special Economic Zone Health Regulations (draft for solicitation of comments)”officially released, Shenzhen residents will have their own " health law."
In order to encourage residents to carry out regular medical examinations and detect problems at an early stage, the above draft proposes that the health and health departments should formulate a basic catalogue of health check-up items according to different factors such as age and occupation.
The expenses for health examination that fall within the scope of the basic catalogue of health examination items shall be paid by the social medical insurance co-ordination Fund in accordance with the standard once a year for each person.
The draft for Solicitation of Comments makes it clear that the employing unit shall rationally allocate human resources, arrange the work schedule of employees, implement a system of rest for employees with heavy mental and physical labor loads, so as to avoid excessive loss of human function or physical and mental health harm to the health of employees, and strictly implement the system of paid leave for employees.
In addition, employers should be equipped with full-time and part-time health management personnel, and regularly organize and carry out employee health check-ups.
With regard to the physical and mental health of minors, the draft proposes that the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors is prohibited, while restrictions are imposed on the location of the sale of alcoholic beverages, and those who violate the provisions will be ordered by the market supervision and administration department to make corrections and fined 30,000 yuan.
In addition to“prohibition”, minors also have to“exercise more. ”
In accordance with the requirements of the draft, the school should arrange more than one hour of physical activity for students every day.
With regard to online games, public security, culture, radio, television, tourism, sports, internet supervision, health and health departments should improve the system of health supervision in Internet service business premises, establish a system of health censorship for online games, and create a good communication space and culture for promoting the healthy growth of young people.
In addition, the draft also proposes that influenza patients must wear masks in public places, medical and health institutions without consent to disclose patient privacy fines of 20,000 yuan.
It is worth noting that, in addition to the physical and mental health of residents, the draft also requires Shenzhen departments to assess the impact of public policy implementation on the health of the population before formulating planning and normative documents involving urban spatial planning and construction, industrial park planning and construction, resource exploitation and ecological environmental protection, and the development of the biomedical industry, as well as before approving major construction projects and implementing major public service projects.
Where no assessment has been made or the assessment will have a more serious adverse effect on the public health of the city or on the health of the residents, it shall not be formulated, promulgated or approved for implementation.

Recently, during a visit to Jilin Province, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed the need to strengthen the leadership of the party, promote the extension of the party organization to the grass-roots level, improve the working system of the grass-roots party organization, and provide a strong guarantee for the governance of urban and rural communities.
Adhering to party building as the guide and implementing party leadership into all aspects and links of grass-roots governance is a fundamental requirement for doing a good job in grass-roots governance.
To improve the level of governance at the grass-roots level, we must adhere to the leadership of party building. By strengthening political leadership, building battle bastions and rallying red forces, we must promote the transformation of the party's political advantages, organizational advantages and mass work advantages into governance advantages, so as to transfer the party's power and ideas to the“nerve endings” and the “last mile”.
Pay attention to calcium casting soul, strengthen political leadership.
To strengthen the political leadership of grass-roots governance, it is necessary to implement the“calcium casting soul”project well.
We should take learning and understanding the thought of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era of Xi Jinping as a top priority, take“never forget your original heart and remember your mission”as the eternal theme of party construction and the lifelong theme of party members and cadres, strengthen the principle of reading the original books and learning the original texts, and continue to promote the Party's innovative theory through special training, batch training, seminars and exchanges, and hold lectures, so as to further strengthen the“four consciousness”, firmly“four self-confidence”, achieve“two maintenance”, and better perform their duties and responsibilities.
Through the combination of online and offline learning methods, broaden the channels of learning and education, and guide grassroots party organizations and party members and cadres to truly integrate learning and education into their daily lives and catch them on a regular basis.
Focus on practice and exercise,in the process of resolving key difficult problems in the field of grass-roots governance, solve the troubles and troubles of the masses ' attention well, and temper the party's character and ability.
Grasp the norms of promotion, build a battle fortress.
The grass-roots party organization is not only an important part of the grass-roots governance system, but also an important carrier of the performance of the governance capacity.
To promote the standardization of party organizations at the grass-roots level, it is necessary to start with the regulations on the work of party branches, focus on the weakening and blurring of party organizations ' leadership, and strengthen the foundation, fill the short boards and promote development through the establishment of the upper and lower linkage mechanism, the establishment of the form of innovative branches, the normalization of the weak and lax, the establishment and improvement of the decision-making and deliberation mechanism, and the mechanism of serving the masses.
In rural areas, we will strengthen the standardization of party organizations at the village level, standardize organizational forms, learning activities and management mechanisms against the standardized construction standards of party branches, and effectively promote the implementation of the system of“three sessions, one lesson”and thematic party day activities.
In cities, focus on street communities, explore the form of innovative branches, focus on weak areas, "blocking points”and "pain points", and actively build urban party-building alliances, so that the work of the party can be effectively covered.
At the same time, the grass-roots governance system and mechanism will be established and improved, the decision-making and deliberation mechanism led by the grass-roots party organizations will be improved, and the mechanism for contacting party members and cadres to serve the masses will be improved, so as to enhance the sense of gain, happiness, honor and pride of party members and the masses will be enhanced, so that the grass-roots governance will be more warm.
Play the vanguard role, condense the red power.
Party members and cadres at the grass-roots level are the cornerstone of grass-roots governance.
To enhance the governance capacity of grass-roots party members and cadres, to give full play to the demonstration and leading role of“red cells”in grass-roots governance, and to unite the red power at the forefront of contact and service to the masses.
It is necessary to make the improvement of the governance capacity a compulsory course for party members and cadres at the grass-roots level, constantly strengthen ideological quenching, professional training and practical exercise, carry forward the spirit of responsibility in their posts and in the heavy tasks of emergency and risk, and strengthen the foundation and contribute to the modernization of the national governance system and governance capacity.
The activities of“blowing the whistle in the community and reporting for party members”should be carried out extensively, and party members should participate in community construction, management and service by participating in the theme party day activities, contacting the people in need, identifying service items, claiming micro-wishes and making reasonable suggestions, so as to allow party members to play a role in community governance.
We should give full play to the role of unrepresented party members in rural areas. By setting up pioneer posts for unrepresented party members and forming task forces for unrepresented party members, we should guide party members at the grass-roots level to actively participate in poverty alleviation, ecological construction, petitions and visits to maintain stability, and the prohibition of straw burning, so as to better integrate the red power and serve the people.
If the foundation is solid, the building is strong.
The grass-roots party organization is the foundation of the ruling building.
Only by keeping close party-mass relations and increasing the well-being of the people as the focus, and leading party building as the fundamental way to promote innovation and development of grass-roots governance can we build a strong foundation, so that grass-roots party organizations can pull out and top up, and grass-roots party members and cadres can rush up and rush up, and promote grass-roots governance with a“soul”, orderly, powerful and effective.

Kekexili Tibetan antelope enters the migration season-Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 25 (Reporter Wang Jinjin) Reporters learned from the Sanjiangyuan National Park Director Jiangyuan Park Kekexili Management Office Wudaoliang protection station, monitoring shows that the tibetan antelope that had previously gone to the Zhonai Lake area in the hinterland of Kekexili are ending litter, began to return with their cubs to their original habitat.
Surveillance footage near the Wudaoliang Protection Station showed that on July 25, about 40 female antelope led three antelope cubs through the Wudaoliang North Bridge of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway, 3002 kilometers from the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, and the antelope had begun to move back.
In recent years, the number of pups of the Tibetan antelope has accounted for one-fourth to one-fifth of the total population of the Tibetan antelope herd, experts said.
Lian Xinming, associate researcher at the Northwest Institute of Plateau Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, said:“In the early stages of migration, Tibetan antelope faces a higher risk of being eaten, so the number of pups in the flock will be relatively small, and even there may be no pups.”
According to the statistics of the Kekexili Administration Office of Jiangyuan Park, Director of the Sanjiangyuan National Park, the number of Tibetan antelope relocation has increased year by year. In 2019, the number of Tibetan antelope relocation was 4,860, an increase of 338 compared with 2018.
Lian Xinming said: "It is expected that this year the return of the tibetan antelope will end in early September,the number of the return of the tibetan antelope is still expected to continue to increase.”
The Tibetan antelope is a protected animal at the national level.
At the end of May every year, Tibetan antelope from Qinghai Sanjiangyuan, Tibet Qiangtang, Xinjiang Aljinshan and other places go to Zhuonai Lake in the hinterland of Kekexili to lay lambs.
Wu Xiaomin, an expert on the protection of tibetan antelope and a researcher at the Shaanxi Institute of Zoology (Northwest Institute of Endangered Animals) in China, said:“The return of the tibetan antelope is the process of the female antelope returning to its habitat after the end of the litter.At first, the population of the antelope is larger, but then the antelope will return to their habitat along different paths according to different geographical populations.”
In order to ensure the safe relocation of the Tibetan antelope herd, the reporter learned that recently Sanjiangyuan National Park management director Jiangyuan Park Kekexili management office has arranged staff in the main relocation area, continue to carry out video monitoring and area patrol.
If a herd of tibetan antelope is found trying to cross the road, the mountain patrol team will conduct temporary traffic control at the first time, so that the flock can safely pass through the wildlife channel, to ensure that they are on the way back to the least possible human interference.
So, in the end, how to relieve the heat in daily life?
Experts recommend that summer go out as far as possible to avoid the heat period, it is best not to walk or work in the hot sun around noon, because this time the sun is the strongest, the possibility of heat stroke is higher.
If you must go out at this time, be sure to do a good job of protection, such as umbrellas, sunshades, sunglasses, the best conditions to apply sunscreen to prevent sunburn.
Clothes try to choose light color, good breathability of cotton, hemp, silk texture, wear less chemical fiber category clothing, so as not to heat up in time when a lot of sweating, causing heat stroke.
When hot and sultry weather, to prepare enough water to drink, drink in time, do not wait for thirst before drinking water, because once you feel thirsty indicates that the body has a shortage of water, each drink water control in 150 ml to 200 ml, drink warm water, do not drink ice water.
According to the temperature level, the average staff drink 1.5 liters to 2 liters of water a day, high temperature workers, drink 3 liters to 5 liters of water a day.
Sweating more can be appropriate to add some salt water, make up for the body lost due to sweating salt.
In addition, the summer body is prone to lack of potassium, people feel tired and tired, potassium-containing tea is an excellent cooling drink.
Summer eat high water content of fruits and vegetables,such as lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, etc.; fresh fruits, such as peaches, apricots, watermelons, melons and other moisture content of 80% to 90%, can be used to replenish water; dairy products can replenish water, but also to meet the nutritional needs of the body.
In addition, people working in a high temperature environment, should be appropriate to supplement drinks containing potassium, magnesium and other elements.
Summer days and nights are short,the temperature is high, the body's metabolism is strong,the consumption is also large, easy to feel tired.
Adequate sleep allows the brain and body systems to be relaxed, both conducive to work and study, but also to prevent heat stroke measures.
Experts say the best bedtime is from 22: 00 to 23: 00, and the best time to get up is from 5: 30 to 6: 30.
Be careful not to lie under the air conditioning outlet and electric fan during sleep, so as not to suffer from air conditioning disease and heat and cold.
Experts suggest that people who are outdoors or working at high temperatures can carry ten drops of water, Ren Dan, Huoxiang Zhengqi water or Huoxiang Zhengqi pills and other anti-heat drugs, or placed in the nearest workplace, ready to use, in case of heat stroke.
I would like you to take a moment to consider the very simple fact that most of what we know about the universe so far comes from light.
We stand on Earth and look up at the night sky and see the stars in the sky with the naked eye.
The strong sunlight is so dazzling，
We can see the light reflected back from the moon.，
Ever since Galileo aimed his rudimentary telescope at the celestial bodies of the universe, the universe we know today is presented to us by light.
With the help of modern telescopes, we have been able to collect dazzling and silent images of the universe – a series of images that can be traced back to the Big Bang.
However, the universe is not a mime, because the universe is not really silent.
I want to tell you that the universe has its own soundtrack, and the universe itself is playing non-stop. Because space can vibrate like a drum.
So when something big happens, it is able to make a series of sounds to the universe.
Today, we hope to be able to add sound to this magnificent visual work about the universe.
Although we have never heard a sound from outer space, we should be able to turn the volume up in the next few years and hear what's going on there.
With the ambitious goal of capturing cosmic sounds, we are focusing on black holes and the prospects they present, because black holes can strike space-time and make very special sounds like drumsticks strike the surface of the drum, and I am very happy to play you some of the sounds we predict.
One day we may be able to see a shadow a black hole can leave a shadow on a very bright background, but it has not been observed yet.
Although black holes can not be seen, they can be heard because they hit space-time like drums.
The idea that the universe could make a drum-like sound came from Albert Einstein, and a lot of our ideas came from him.
Einstein realized that if the universe is empty, if the universe is empty, it will look like this picture, except for those auxiliary lines painted on it.
But if we fall free in the universe, even without these guides, our trajectories will draw these lines, because we will find that we move in a straight line, through the universe in a straight line that does not bend.
Einstein also realized that-that's really the most critical part(matter also means”matter")– if you put energy and matter in the universe, the universe will bend. Free-fall objects will be deflected as they pass toward objects such as the Sun and move along a bent path in space.
This is Einstein's great theory of general relativity.
Even the path of light will be bent.
When the bend is large enough, it revolves around the orbit of the sun, just as the earth revolves around the sun, and the moon revolves around the Earth.
This is the natural curve of the universe.
But Einstein didn't realize that if you compress the sun into a ball of six kilometers in diameter-that is, you compress matter a million times the mass of the earth into a ball of six kilometers in diameter-you will create a black hole that is so dense that if light is too close to it, it will not escape-leaving a huge shadow in the universe，
But Einstein always thought that black holes were just a mathematical singularity.
He does not believe that there is a black hole.
He believes that nature will prevent the formation of black holes to protect us.
It was decades later that people began to use the term“black holes”and realized that black holes were real objects – in fact, they were the death of some of the most massive stars after a catastrophic collapse at the end of their lives.
Our sun does not collapse to form a black hole.
Its quality is actually not large enough.
But if we do some thought experiments-which Einstein liked to do-we can imagine crushing the sun and compressing it within six kilometers, and then putting a tiny earth in orbit around it, say 30 kilometers away from the black hole sun.
The earth will shine on its own, because now that the sun is gone, we have no other light source – therefore, our little earth has to shine on its own.
You will find that you can even put the Earth in orbit 30 kilometers away from the black hole and make it orbit happily.
The black hole is actually about the size of Manhattan.
Before it destroys the Earth, it may swell into Hudson Street.
But basically that's what we're talking about.
We're talking about an object that's compressed to half the size of Manhattan.
So we moved this earth closer to the black hole – 30 kilometers away-and we noticed that it went around the black hole in a perfect orbit.
There are some rumors that black holes will devour everything in the universe, but in fact you have to get very close to it to actually fall in.
But it is impressive that from our point of view, we can always see the earth.
It can't hide behind a black hole.
Some of the light emitted from the earth falls into the black hole, but some of it is bent by the black hole and we see it.
So you can't hide anything behind a black hole.
If this is the story in Battlestar Galactica and you're fighting the Cylons, don't hide behind the black hole.
They can see you.
Our sun does not collapse into a black hole; its mass is not large enough, but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
If one of them was devouring the Milky Way, it would look like this.
We will see the shadow of a black hole cast over hundreds of billions of stars in the Milky Way and the dust belt that the stars illuminate.
If we fall into the black hole, we will see light refracted around the black hole, and we will not even begin to enter the shadow at all without feeling that some huge changes are quietly taking place.
If we try to start the rocket and get out of there, the result will not be very good, because we can not escape, even the light can not escape.
Although the black hole is dark from the outside, it is not so from the inside, because all the light of the galaxy can fall into the black hole with us.
And even so, because of the relativistic time-dilation effect, our clocks seem to be slower compared to the time of the Milky Way, which looks as if the outer galaxies are accelerating, just before we are destroyed by black holes.
It's like experiencing the feeling of dying, you see the light at the end of the tunnel, but it's a complete experience of death.
(Laughter) You can't tell anyone you saw the light at the end of the tunnel.
So far, we have never seen the shadows left by such a black hole, but black holes can be heard, even if they can not be seen.
Imagine, in a real astronomical scene-imagine two black holes that have been together for a long time.
Perhaps they were stars before they collapsed into two black holes-each 10 times the mass of the sun.
Now we compress them to within 60 kilometers.
They can rotate hundreds of times per second.
At the end of life, they approach each other at the speed of light.
Can travel thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second. In the process, they not only bend the space, but also cause the vibration of the space in the wake behind it, a real space-time wave.
The black hole squeezes and stretches space when it collides with the universe.
These vibrations travel through space at the speed of light.
The computer simulation was done by NASA Goddard's Relativity group.
It took nearly 30 years before and after solving this problem.
This is one of many groups.
It shows two black holes rotating around each other, these are imaginary curves.
As you can see – maybe a little fuzzy – you can see that the red waves are emitted, and these are gravitational waves.
They are the sounds of the real universe, which will travel at the speed of light from the black holes as they fuse with each other until the two black holes merge into a quietly rotating black hole.
If you stand close enough, your ears will resonate with the squeezing and stretching of these spaces.
You can really hear these sounds in your own ear.
Of course, you will find helplessly that your head is also squeezed and stretched, so you may not be able to understand exactly what is going on.
But I'd like to play the sound of our prediction for you.
This is the result of my group's research - a relatively simple computational model.
Imagine a smaller-mass black hole falling into a larger-mass black hole.
The sound you hear comes from the collision of a small mass black hole with space as it approaches a large mass black hole.
If they are far away, the sound will be very small.
But gradually the sound becomes like a drumstick beating the space, making the space vibrate like a drum.
We can predict what this sound will look like.
We know that in the process of falling, the small mass black hole will be faster and louder, and the sound will be louder.
Eventually, we will hear that the small black hole completely fell into the big black hole.
I never thought it was so loud-it was actually amplified here.
When I listen at home, I feel that the sound is a little weak.
It sounds like, Ding, ding, ding.
This is another sound that our team simulated.
I'm not going to show you images here, because black holes don't leave any useful traces, and real space doesn't show you virtual curves.
But if you hear this sound while you're on vacation in the universe, I suggest you run.
(Chuckles) Better get away from the sound.
Both black holes are moving.
Two black holes are approaching each other.
In this case, they are shaking violently.
Then, they will blend together.
That sharp sound is a sign of black hole fusion - a sharp sound at the end of fusion.
This is our prediction of what we are going to see.
Fortunately, we are very safe in Long Beach, California.
There is no doubt that somewhere in the universe two black holes have fused together.
There is also no doubt that the space around us can feel these vibrations, which travel a million light years, or a million years ago, traveling at the speed of light and eventually meeting us.
But these sounds are so small that we can't hear them at all.
There are some experiments in the world that take a lot of effort to set up – one called LIGO - that will detect space vibrations that are less than one nucleus at a distance of every four kilometers.
This is a very bold attempt, and its sensitivity will not be surpassed in the next few years-it will be used to detect space vibrations.
Another research project on the universe is expected to be LAUNCHED in the next decade, THIS project IS CALLED LISA.
LISA WILL BE ABLE TO SEE SUPERMASSIVE black holes - those millions or even BILLIONS of TIMES THE MASS of the SUN.
In the images from the Hubble telescope, we see these two galaxies.
It looked as if they were still hugging together.
There may be a massive super-black hole at the center of them.
But they are not still, in fact, they are merging.
The two black holes will collide, and their fusion will take billions of years.
Therefore, collecting the sounds they make is beyond the limits of our human perception.
BUT LISA CAN SEE THE FINAL STAGES OF TWO SUPERMASSIVE BLACK HOLES THAT BEGAN TO FUSE A LONG TIME AGO, 15 MINUTES BEFORE THEY FUSE.
This detection is not limited to black holes, it can also be used to detect any large disturbance in the universe-the largest of which is the Big Bang.
When the word was coined, some people mockingly said - " Oh, who would believe in the Big Bang?"”
This animated short film, made by my friends at Proton Studios, shows the big bang from the outside.
We would never really want to be like this; we would like to be inside the universe, because there is no such thing as being outside the universe.
So, imagine you're in the middle of a big bang.
The universe is everywhere,everything in the world is around you, and space is rocking in disorder.
14 billion years have passed, and this voice still lingers around us.
Galaxies gradually form, and groups of stars form in galaxies. On a certain planet, there exists at least one such planet, suitable for life to live on.
Here, we frantically build experiments, do calculations, write computer code.
Imagine, a billion years ago, two black holes collided.
This sound has been traveling through time and space all the time.
We didn't even show up here.
It's getting closer and closer - 40,000 years ago, we were still painting on the stone walls of the cave.
If the sound we're trying to get was from the Big Bang, it would sound like this.
Strictly speaking, it is noise.
It's a white noise, a confusing ringtone.
But it is everywhere around us, as long as it is not offset by some other process in the universe.
If we can detect these sounds, it will sound like music to our ears, for this quiet echo comes from the moment we are created, from the universe we look up at.
So in the next few years, we will be able to turn up the soundtracks a little more and let the universe be presented to us in audio form.
But if we can detect those earliest moments, it will take us a step further from understanding the Big Bang, and allow us to ask some of the most difficult, and at the same time the most ethereal, questions.
If we play the course of the universe backwards, we can know that there was a big bang in the past, and we can even hear the noise of it, but is our big bang the only big bang in the universe?
I mean, we can't help but ask, has there ever been a big bang like that before that?
Will it happen again in the future?
I WANT TO SAY THAT IF WE RAISE THE MEANING OF THIS QUESTION TO THE LEVEL THAT TED ADVOCATES FOR RETHINKING, AT LEAST FOR THE LAST MINUTE, WE CAN ASK QUESTIONS THAT WE MAY NEVER BE ABLE TO ANSWER.
But we can't help but ask: Is our universe just an episode in a larger history?
Or, would we just be a branch of the multiverse – each of which has experienced its own big bang-maybe some of them have buzzing black holes, maybe some don't-maybe some have conscious life, maybe some don't-they don't belong to our past, they don't exist in our future, but are somehow connected to us?
Therefore, we can not help but guess, if there is a multiverse, in the other branches of this multiverse, there is life?
This is life in our multiverse.
Are there any other life in the multiverse, and are they also speculating on our existence and thinking about their own origin?
If so, I can imagine them doing calculations, writing computer code, building experimental instruments, trying to detect the faint sounds that come from their origins, and wondering who else was there.
Thank you.Thank you all.

Graduate Art Exhibition Moves into Shopping Mall Public Welfare Exhibition-Xinhua
In the season of“cloud graduation”in major universities, a rare offline graduate art exhibition opened warm on the weekend.
However, it is neither in the museum nor on campus, but in the public space of Chaoyang Joy City, and is open to the public for free until August 23.
The exhibition space extends from the 2nd floor to the 6th floor,and makes full use of the light box in the building for the display of graphic works, to maximize the artistic atmosphere of the graduation season.
Under the epidemic, the significance of this exhibition is particularly special.
Ge Pingping, director of Chaoyang Joy City Beauty Chen, said:“We have chosen to bring the graduation exhibition to the‘cloud’back to the offline space again. We also hope that more people will see the youth's exploration of their own and understanding of the world, and amplify the healing power of art for society and the mind.”
She revealed that the works of the exhibition were collected from graduates of several major art colleges and selected suitable for commercial space display. The works range from traditional easel paintings and sculptures to new media installations, interactive animations and VR panoramas, with the largest volume and richness in the past year.
In“The First Battle of 2020”, Li Yunxiao expressed his feelings in the epidemic through a mixture of mechanical and manual creative language; Liu Jiaying's work“Sound Money” through the Ethereum blockchain explores the themes of“cryptocurrency”,“credit creation " and "trading"; Zhang Jiaqi's "Cat Forest" and Qiu Daqiang's "Custody" represent animals that often accompany humans, from which you can see the young artists 'understanding of the relationship between humans and animals; and Zhu Zhongyu's" Winter of Faith—Gift "is a reminder Young people growing up," When one day a successful career, do not forget the beginning of the heart, remember that simple and sincere."”
Among the few graduates who have personally arranged the exhibition is Li Jingyin from the Sculpture Department of Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts.
"I came to Beijing on July 7, when I was actually a little worried about the epidemic, and I did a nucleic acid test three days in advance, and I brought alcohol cotton and a test report to the exhibition.”
His work "Yesterday is like a mystery" is more complex in structure and must be done by hand.
At the same time, he also took on the task of helping his classmates repair the damaged works.
"The exhibition was held until 4: 30 a.m. and then mended. The time was tight.I forgot to take a picture with the work, and it was a bit of a pity.”
He hopes that when the epidemic is more stable, he and his classmates will come to Beijing to see their works.

That morning, Mr. Bosonaro, 65, tweeted a photo of him in sneakers and no mask, sitting at a breakfast table with a smile on his face, a thumbs-up in one hand and a box of hydroxychloroquine in the other.
He wrote in a tweet: "Good morning everyone!New crown virus test results: negative.”
However, Mr. Bosonaro did not say when the test for the new crown virus had taken place.
On July 5, Bosonaro developed symptoms of new crown pneumonia. On the 6th, he tested positive for the virus. On the 7th, he announced through live television that he had been diagnosed with new crown pneumonia.
On the 14th and 21st, Bosonaro has twice tested for the new crown virus, the results are still positive.
During the quarantine period, Bosonaro repeatedly showed his hydroxychloroquine drug through social media live, and said that hydroxychloroquine has a good effect on the new crown pneumonia, he feels good after taking it, and his good health is due to hydroxychloroquine, advocating that Brazilian medical institutions use hydroxychloroquine drugs to treat the new crown pneumonia.
So far, five cabinet ministers and 10 governors in Brazil have been diagnosed with new crown pneumonia, according to Brazilian media reports.

A new drug developed by the University of Australia is expected to be used to treat blood vessel blockage caused by the new crown-Xinhua
Sydney, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Researchers at Monash University in Australia are developing a new drug to help prevent heart disease and stroke, and hope the drug can be used to treat blockage of blood vessels caused by the new crown virus.
The researchers found that an enzyme in platelets accelerates platelet coagulation before a heart attack or stroke.
So they developed a drug that temporarily inhibits platelet coagulation, thereby avoiding blockage of blood vessels and preventing heart disease and stroke.
Researchers say the drug only inhibits the coagulation effect of platelets in the event of signs of heart disease or stroke.
As studies have shown that similar blockage of blood vessels is one of the leading causes of death in patients with severe new crowns, the researchers hope that the drug can be used in the treatment of such severe patients in the future.
At present, the drug has achieved good results in animal model experiments, the researchers are ready for the next stage of human clinical trials.
The results of the research have been published in the American journal Science Translational Medicine.
He became the first person to enter the CBA league rematch after allowing the audience to watch the game live.
On the same day, during the second stage of the 2019-2020 China Men's Basketball Professional League (CBA) rematch (Laoshan Division) held in Qingdao, Shandong Province, medical staff, teachers and public security front personnel watched the match of Shanghai Jiushi Team against Shandong Xiwang Team through the official ticket purchase platform after completing the relevant procedures, including nucleic acid detection.

More than 6,000 pentagonal heliostats, each 48 square meters, arranged neatly in a circle, such as a silver“sunflower field”, with the sun rotation, the sunlight reflected to the center of more than 200 meters high endothermic tower, to achieve power generation.
Reporters on the 25th in Xinjiang Hami City Yiqi County Nao Maohu Town of China Electric Project Hami molten salt tower solar thermal power plant, see this scene.
"The so-called molten salt tower photothermal power generation, is the concentrated reflection of sunlight through the mirror to the endothermic tower to form thermal energy, and then through the traditional power generation technology to convert thermal energy into electrical energy."”
Zhang Yong, deputy general manager of CLP Hami Solar Thermal Power Co., Ltd., said the design principle is similar to the use of rural solar stoves in northwest China, all to gather the sunlight.
The power plant started construction in October 2017 and was connected to the grid at the end of last year, covering an area of 6,600 mu, with a total planned installation of 14,500 heliostats.
"Compared to traditional solar power technology, its biggest advantage is that the gathered heat energy can be stored,can also generate electricity at night.”
Zhang Yong said that the 13-hour heat storage system configured in the project can keep the generator set running continuously and stably, not affected by changes in light, and can also quickly participate in the peak adjustment of the grid according to the demand for the peak and valley of the grid load.
When the project is fully completed, it can achieve an annual power generation capacity of 198 million degrees, save more than 60,000 tons of standard coal per year, reduce sulfur dioxide more than 60 tons, nitrogen oxides more than 60 tons, about 20 tons of soot, more than 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide, and provide a steady stream of clean energy for the local area.
In addition, there is another silver“sunflower field”in Hami Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park.
Hamifuguang solar photovoltaic power station covers an area of more than 2,300 acres, has built 714 power generation equipment also follow the rotation of the sun, always keep the sunlight and the condenser plate at a 90-degree right angle.
"We use dual-axis tracking concentrator power generation technology, through a unified and integrated control, all power generation equipment will adjust the angle according to the sun height, to maintain power generation efficiency.”
The station manager Duan Mengqi said that in the light of good weather conditions, the power generation technology compared with the traditional photovoltaic power generation efficiency can be increased by about 20%.
In the first half of this year, the power station has achieved more than 7 million degrees of power generation, to supplement the local electricity demand.
Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park is currently the largest single-scale, the most complete type of photovoltaic module type of a photovoltaic industry demonstration park in Xinjiang, a total of 38 photovoltaic power generation projects, the total installed capacity of 820,000 kilowatts.
In the first half of this year, more than 110 million kWh of power generation was completed, an increase of 6% over the same period in 2019.
Hami is one of the best areas for solar energy resources in China.
The average annual total solar radiation per square meter of more than 6200 megajoules, the number of sunshine hours of the year is about 3200 hours.
In recent years, the city vigorously develop the photovoltaic industry, planting a good "sunflower field".
In the first half of this year, the city's photovoltaic power generation exceeded 1.4 billion degrees, an increase of about 14% year-on-year.
At present, Xinjiang grid-connected photovoltaic power plants more than 330, the installed capacity of more than 10 million kilowatts.

U.S. Media Reveal the truth about U.S. Unwarranted Demand for China to close Consulate General in Houston-<url>
2020-07-26 14: 40: 44 Source: CCTV Author: Zhu Yanjing Editor: Zhu Yanjing
The US media revealed the truth about the US side's unwarranted demand that China close the consulate general in Houston
On the 24th, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China informed the U.S. Embassy in China that China had decided to revoke the permission for the establishment and operation of the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu and made specific requests for the Consulate General to cease all operations and activities as a counter measure to the U.S. sudden demand on the 21st for China to close the Consulate General in Houston.
The U.S. government's behavior has aroused many concerns, and its political motivation has been questioned by foreign media and scholars.
Why is China required to close the Consulate general?
A number of foreign media said that it is not clear why the United States will choose the Chinese Consulate general in Houston, but for the purpose of this move, foreign media bluntly said: for the election.
CNN reported on the 23rd that the United States asked China to close the consulate general in Houston, raising questions about its political motives.
According to the article, the US government's disastrous response to the new crown epidemic has caused President Trump to have a relatively low approval rating in the polls before the election.
White House officials say privately that the tough approach to China is designed to save Trump's approval ratings and to shift blame for the failure of the White House's response to the outbreak.
According to the article, the Chinese Consulate General in Houston was a“politically driven and very cautious”target chosen by the US government“to create a tough attitude while avoiding the risk of a major conflict.”
The BBC also believes that Mr. Trump believes that“playing the‘China card’has a political advantage”at a time when the US election season is approaching and the US economy is badly hit by the epidemic.
The current situation is“a spiraling, tit-for-tat struggle,”driven in part by the US government's domestic considerations, which will only exacerbate tensions between China and the United States.
CBS reports that Trump's re-election prospects are under pressure because of the outbreak, which he has repeatedly blamed on China.
Almost every day there are new actions in the United States against the absurdity of Trump's so-called“Chinese exploitation of the United States.”
"The Consulate General of Houston is very important in establishing ties between the two countries”
The Associated Press commented that the U.S. demand for China to close its consulate general in Houston has heightened tensions between the world's two largest economies.
The closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston would, in addition to the diplomatic implications, make it difficult for Chinese citizens in the southern United States to access consular services, as well as for U.S. citizens seeking visas and other services.
A business group in Houston expressed regret at the U.S. demand that China close the Consulate General in Houston, saying it played an important role in building trade, investment and cultural ties between the two countries.
This reflects the importance of China's economy, according to the Associated Press.
The US Foreign Policy magazine website described the move as“part of a series of provocative moves that will only worsen relations between the US and China.”
Jonathan Pollack, an expert on East Asia at the Brookings Institution, a US think tank, was quoted by Reuters as saying he could not think of anything comparable to the US action against the Chinese consulate general in Houston since the US and China established full diplomatic relations in 1979.
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported that the move was unprecedented in more than 40 years of diplomatic relations between China and the United States.
Analysts believe the move could cause lasting damage.
Built in 1979, the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is China's first consulate general in the United States.
Currently, China has one embassy and five consulates-general in the United States.

Free Nucleic acid detection in Urumqi Most areas have basically completed secondary testing in high-risk areas-<url>
Beijing Urumqi July 26 (reporter Sun Tingwen Zhao Yamin)Urumqi Health and Health Committee director Zhang Wei on the 26th in the briefing Urumqi city of the latest outbreak and nucleic acid testing, said that at present, Urumqi city free nucleic acid testing work in most areas has been basically completed.
The expert group of the State Council and experts from the autonomous region and Urumqi City are making further assessments on the development of the epidemic on the basis of the findings of nucleic acid detection and epidemiology.
The Press Office of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region held a press conference on the 26th to inform the situation of the epidemic and prevention and control in Xinjiang.
According to him, from 00: 00 to 24: 00 on July 25, there were 22 new confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia in Urumqi(5 of which were confirmed cases of asymptomatic infected persons) and 38 new cases of asymptomatic infected persons.
As of 2400 hours on July 25, Urumqi has 135 confirmed cases and 147 asymptomatic infected people.
On the 25th, the new asymptomatic infected people are basically through the city's free nucleic acid test, active screening out.
Zhang Wei, director of the Urumqi Health Committee, said on the 26th that most areas of free nucleic acid testing in Urumqi City have been basically completed.
He also said that from the experience of other parts of the country, many factors affect the results of nucleic acid test, such as the sensitivity of the detection reagent, the time of infection and detoxification of the test personnel, the cooperation of the test when the sample is taken(poor cooperation may lead to the sample is not taken in place), as well as the detection environment, the operation proficiency of the test personnel, etc.
For a variety of reasons, nucleic acid detection will also appear false negative results.
The so-called false negative means that the subject is indeed an infected person, but the nucleic acid test results are negative.
In addition, two nucleic acid tests are usually required to exclude people who have been in close contact with confirmed and suspected cases.
For people who have been to high-risk areas in the outbreak, if there are fever and respiratory symptoms, a nucleic acid test negative there is a false negative possibility, so two nucleic acid tests are also required to rule out.
He said, in view of the above situation, for the health of all ethnic groups in the city, starting today, Urumqi City will be Tianshan District, Shayibak District and other key areas for secondary free nucleic acid testing, while carrying out“check the legacy of leakage.”
It is reported that Tianshan District, Shayibak district is a high-risk area of the epidemic.

U.S.-China Trade Representatives meet in August
Liu He, head of China's trade negotiating team and vice Premier of the State Council, and Lai Haizhe, co-leader of the U.S. team and trade representative, are expected to hold formal talks in August to assess the implementation of the first phase of the trade agreement between the two sides, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported on the 25th, citing an anonymous person familiar with the matter.
The report said that while China has significantly increased its purchases of U.S. agricultural products in the past few months, China's purchases are still some distance from the amount promised in the trade agreement because of the new crown virus outbreak and other factors.
Analysts say the recent closure of each other's consulates by the US and China, along with other disputes, could undermine any progress on trade.
The first phase of the trade agreement between China and the United States came into force one month after the signing of the agreement on January 15. The agreement stipulates that a high-level trade framework group of the two sides shall hold talks every six months.
People familiar with the matter said the meeting would be“an important turning point”for both sides to assess the progress of the agreement.
But the person also said that if tensions between the United States and China lead to a lack of willingness to talk at this time, the two sides may agree that the May 8 conference call between Mr. Lai and Mr. Liu has met the terms of the semi-annual talks in the trade agreement.
Since this year, relations between China and the United States have deteriorated rapidly, with disputes between the two sides including the origin of the new Crown virus, trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the South China Sea and ideology and a series of other issues.
U.S. President Donald Trump, who boasted at the beginning of the year about his achievements in the first phase of the agreement, has recently changed his attitude.
He said at a White House press conference on the 23rd that although China recently purchased a record number of U.S. corn and bought a lot of large beans in a single day,“This trade agreement now means less to me than it did when it was reached.”
An anonymous Beijing government adviser also believes that a new round of trade talks is unlikely because of poor US-China relations, and that “trade issues have lost their weight in Sino-Us relations.”
But he said that China's economic and trade related units on the 23rd still met to discuss a series of issues, including how to increase imports from the United States, “we have tried our best to buy, so any additional purchases will be difficult.”
Peng Jie Ning, vice-president of the US-China Trade National Committee, said it was“more important than ever” to maintain momentum for the first phase of the agreement, noting that China has made progress this year in further opening up financial markets to US companies.
“It is better to talk than not, although it may only be treated as a routine, " said an analyst at Plenum, an independent research firm.”

NASDAQ China Chief Representative Hao Yusheng: Now is the best time for Chinese companies to go to the United States IPO node-Economic Watch－Professional financial news website
Economic watch network reporter Zhang Bin because of Ruixing Coffee fraud incident, the United States market for the implementation of more stringent supervision of the shares, coupled with long-term valuation pressure, in the United States listed shares feel pressure, Netease, Jingdong and other shares have recently opened the journey back to Hong Kong listing.
The recent shell, ideal car and other companies, to the United States listing enthusiasm is high.
Is now the best time for Chinese companies to go public in the United States under the epidemic and the crisis of China's stock market?
"In terms of recent IPO cases and the next companies to go to the United States, the IPO in the United States has not been affected in nature, but now the market is very good, and even now this time is the best time for Chinese companies to go to the United States IPO in the past 10 years."”
Hao Yusheng, Chief Representative of the Nasdaq Stock Exchange in China, said at the 2020 Listed Company Leaders Summit, hosted by Snowball.
In April, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the U.S. Public Company Accounting Regulatory Commission (PCAOB) released a Statement on Audit Quality and Regulatory Access to Audit and Other International Information — a discussion on Current Challenges to Access to Information for U.S. listed companies with significant operations in China.
While international cooperation and coordination have increased significantly in recent years, U.S. regulators still have problems with access to information, and the SEC and PCAOB still face legal and practical challenges, according to the statement. In contrast to the document, the PCAOB website details a list of listed companies that have encountered audit obstacles and their audit institutions, with a large number of mid-cap companies listed.
In addition, in May, the U.S. Senate passed the Foreign Company Accountability Act, imposing additional disclosure requirements on foreign companies to list in the U.S.
In Hao Yusheng's view, the crisis has not affected the appetite of investors.
"When the news came out, everyone was panicking, and everyone was asking if they could go public in the United States in the future, but then we found that these questions were not a matter for investors, and investors may ask these questions during the recent IPO roadshow in the United States, and even become standardized questions, but this was not used by investors as an important factor in investing in and not investing in a Chinese company.
It is recommended that you try to look at the current situation with a normal mind.
Of course, this may seem to be the worst of the past two years, but in terms of investor appetite, it has not been affected in any way.
So between now and the end of this year or before the US election, the IPO boom in the United States will continue.”
On May 9 this year, Jinshan Cloud officially listed on Nasdaq in the United States, becoming the first Chinese company to ipo in the United States after the epidemic.
"The listing of Jinshan Cloud gives a lot of confidence to Chinese companies that are preparing for IPOs later.”
Hao Yusheng said.
Snowball released the first half of 2020 stock data report shows that in the first half of this year, a total of 20 Chinese companies to the United States IPO, an increase of 17.6% compared with the same period last year; from the total amount of initial capital raised, 20 enterprises raised a total of 2.725 billion, compared with the same period last year, up more than 52.4%; in the industry distribution, the first half of this year, the number of health care industry IPO, an increase of 100% compared with the same period last year.
According to Hao Yusheng, the first half of this year to the United States IPO of Chinese companies of higher quality, with excellent fundamentals and growth of high-quality companies, will be more favored by investors.
In the short, medium and long term, Hao Yusheng continues to be optimistic about the IPO of Ming Chinese companies to the United States.
"In the short term, the IPO boom is still continuing; in the medium term, Chinese companies have more options. A shares, Hong Kong stocks, and US stocks, we will consider the US election and Sino-US relations as market choices and time choices; in the long term, everything will return to the norm, and the market volatility is a cycle, both political and economic cycles, and eventually will return to the normal stage, and the stock market has always been volatile.”
Hao Yusheng also said, " This year there are more uncertainties, but for high-quality companies, regardless of the market, as long as they are solid and have the growth that investors can see, other factors are relatively secondary, investors need to invest in excellent Chinese companies."”

People's Daily commentator: Focus on doing your own business to build new advantages for future Development -- On Learning and Implementing General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the Entrepreneurs Forum-Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 25, People's Daily, July 26, commentator's article: Focus on doing their own things to build new advantages for future development
At present, the global epidemic situation and the world economic situation are still grim and complex, and the challenges facing our country's development are unprecedented.
Maintaining strategic strength, enhancing confidence in winning,and concentrating on doing our own business is the key to our response to various risk challenges.
At the entrepreneurs ' forum held recently, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed that in the current external environment of rising protectionism, the world economy is depressed and the global market is shrinking, we must concentrate on our own business, give full play to the advantages of domestic super-large-scale markets, gradually form a new development pattern with domestic large-scale circulation as the main body and domestic and international double circulation promoting each other, raise the level of modernization of the industrial chain supply chain, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation, accelerate key core technology research and development, and build new advantages for future development.
He who sees the potential is wise,and he who drives the potential wins.
In the external environment of the deep development of economic globalization, the market and resources have played an important role in the rapid development of our country.
Now, the world under the impact of the epidemic is undergoing profound changes, facing more instability and uncertainty, and economic globalization is facing headwinds and backwardness.
One of the most important aspects is to take expansion and meeting domestic demand as the strategic basis for development, give full play to their advantages, and add impetus to China's economic development through the prosperity of the domestic economy and the smoothness of the domestic cycle, so as to promote the recovery of the world economy.
We should deeply realize that building a complete domestic demand system is related to our country's long-term development and long-term stability.
This is the need to cope with the impact of the epidemic, to maintain the long-term sustainable and healthy development of our economy, and to meet the growing needs of the people for a better life.
The advantage of a large economy is that it is internally recyclable.
With the world's most complete and largest industrial system, strong production capacity and perfect supporting capacity, China has more than 100 million market players and more than 170 million highly educated or professional skills, as well as an ultra-large-scale domestic demand market formed by a population of 1.4 billion people, including more than 400 million middle-income groups, and is in the stage of rapid development of new industrialization, information technology, urbanization and agricultural modernization, with great potential for investment demand.
The socialist basic economic system, such as public ownership as the main body, multiple ownership as the common development of the economy, distribution according to work as the main body, coexisting in a variety of distribution modes, and the socialist market economy system, can not only stimulate the vitality of various market entities, emancipate and develop social productive forces, but also promote efficiency, fairness and organic unity and the continuous realization of common prosperity.
We should firmly grasp the strategic basis of expanding domestic demand,so that production, distribution and circulation links rely more on the domestic market to achieve a virtuous circle, clarify the strategic direction of supply-side structural reform, and promote the dynamic balance between total supply and aggregate demand at a higher level.
We need to accelerate the construction of a complete domestic demand system, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation and other aspects of innovation, accelerate the digital economy, intelligent manufacturing, life and health, new materials and other strategic emerging industries, forming more new growth points and growth poles, and gradually form a new development pattern with the domestic large cycle as the main body and the domestic and international double cycle to promote each other.
Openness brings progress,and closure is bound to lag behind.
General Secretary Xi Jinping has repeatedly stressed that China's open door will not be closed,but will only get bigger and bigger.
Taking the domestic cycle as the main body, by no means shut the door to close the operation, but by giving full play to the potential of domestic demand, so that the domestic market and the international market can be better connected, better use of the two international and domestic markets, two kinds of resources, to achieve stronger and more sustainable development.
At the same time, there is no contradiction between expanding domestic demand and opening up. The smoother the domestic cycle, the more conducive to building a new pattern of opening up, the more conducive to forming new advantages for participation in international cooperation and competition.
Although the international trend of protectionism is now on the rise, we should stand on the right side of history, adhere to deepening reform, expanding openness, strengthening open cooperation in the field of science and technology, promote the construction of an open world economy and promote the construction of a community of human destiny.
The Chinese nation has experienced a lot of hardships in history, but has never been crushed, but has grown more and more courageous, constantly growing up in the tribulations and rising up from the tribulations.
Along the way,with the strong leadership of the Central Committee of the Party, with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the remarkable advantages of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, the strong mobilization capacity and strong comprehensive strength, and the unity and struggle of the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country, we will be able to overcome all hardships and obstacles, maintain the good momentum of our economic and social development, build a well-off society in an all-round way, and smoothly start a new journey towards building a socialist modern country in an all-round way.

France Ramps up military investment in space-Xinhua
French Defense Minister Florence Pali said on the 24th, France will add hundreds of millions of euros in the space defense budget, the development of space military forces, to prevent other countries may carry out“unfriendly moves ” in outer space.
The French budget for military space projects will increase from 3.6 billion euros (约合 4.2 billion) to 4.3 billion euros (5 5 billion) between 2019 and 2025, Pali told Provence newspaper the same day.
In accordance with the French Military Planning Act 2019-2025, approved by the French Parliament in 2018, France is expected to update its existing observation and communication satellites, launch three electromagnetic listening satellites and modernize space surveillance radars.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced last July that a space military command and an“air and space Force”would be established within the French Air Force.
Paley said she will officially announce the formation of the space force when she visits a military academy in Salon, Provence, later.
The space force, which is part of the Air Force, will be 500 by 2025, Mr. Paley said.
“Gone are the days when people thought that space services served the common good of science, " she said.Today, space is a place for nations to compete for global hegemony.”
Pali reiterated Macron's previous statement, saying France has no intention of provoking an arms race.
"We are by no means engaged in an arms race.But it is my responsibility to fully recognize the threats that we may face.”
Pali recalled the surveillance of a military satellite shared by France and Italy in 2017.
She said it was a Russian satellite that was“ peeping on."
The Russian side denies this claim.
France will“soon”have small patrol satellites capable of spotting and targeting“those behind unfriendly moves,”Mr. Paley said.
French media believe that France sought the establishment of a space force, because US President Donald Trump last February asked the United States Department of Defense to draft the establishment of a space army bill.
Trump signed the Defense Authorization Act last December, approving the creation of the United States ' sixth-largest army, the Space Army.
Some experts worry that the US moves have accelerated the pace of US space militarization and could trigger a new space arms race.

Experts say the collection of immigration data through the U.S. Census for the allocation of House seats is unconstitutional
Several civil rights groups and several U.S. cities and counties have sued the federal government, saying the Trump Administration's attempt to exclude undocumented immigrants from the U.S. census is unworkable and unconstitutional.
The U.S. Census will determine the allocation of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
“It's not going to work, " Sarah Brannon, executive counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, told VOA.”
She went on to say that Trump's request to determine the citizenship of people who receive the census in the census is difficult to do and“not very reliable."”
Another civil liberties group, Common Cause, filed a lawsuit Thursday challenging Trump's executive order.
Cities in New Jersey and Georgia have joined the lawsuit.
Arlington County, Virginia, also joined the lawsuit Friday.
“The U.S. Constitution requires an accurate count of our population every 10 years, " said Garvey, chairman of the Board of Management of Arlington County.We must accurately count everyone who lives in Arlington County, and we must not let this illegal attempt to scare people away and reduce the number of our immigrant communities succeed.”
Other organizations and individuals have praised President Trump's executive order.
Alabama Attorney General Marshall called the executive order a“victory”for the state.
“The allocation of seats in the House of Representatives and in the Electoral College in each state must be based on the number of residents living in each state and the number of residents who are legally resident, " he said.”
The U.S. Supreme Court last year blocked the Trump administration from including citizenship issues on the 2020 Census table.
President Trump signed an executive order earlier this week directing the U.S. Census Bureau's Commerce Secretary, Ross Ross, to submit census-generated data on undocumented populations so that the administration can exclude those undocumented populations from census numbers in each state, thereby determining whether each state will increase or decrease or retain seats in the House of Representatives.
Every 10 years, the United States reallocates seats in the House of Representatives based on demographic changes.

The situation of epidemic prevention and control has continued to improve, the steady economic recovery has been obvious, and the performance of employment and prices, which are closely related to the people's livelihood, has been generally stable.

As an artist, contact is very important to me.
Through my work of art, I try to make it clear that man is not separated from nature, but that everything is interconnected.
I went to Antarctica for the first time about 10 years ago, and I also saw icebergs for the first time.
I was in awe.
My heart slammed fast,my head giddy, trying to understand what it was in front of me.
Icebergs around me surfaced almost 200 feet. I can only feel very strange that this is a snowflake covered in another snowflake, formed year after year.
Icebergs are formed when they break apart from a glacier or break apart from an ice shelf.
Each iceberg has its own unique personality.
They interact with their surroundings and their circumstances in a distinct way.
Some icebergs refuse to compromise and stick to it, while others can't bear to burst into ice in a moment of intense passion.
When you look at the icebergs, it is easy to think that they are all isolated, they are independent, alone, more like the way we humans sometimes think of ourselves.
But the reality is much more than that.
As the iceberg melted, I breathed its ancient smell.
As the iceberg melts, it releases mineral-rich fresh water that nourishes everything.
I set out to photograph these icebergs as if I were photographing my ancestors, and learned that in these other moments icebergs existed in that way but never in that way again.
When they melt, it is by no means death; nor is it an end, but a continuation of the road to life.
Some of the icebergs I've photographed are very young-thousands of years old.
Some ice is more than 100,000 years old.
The last picture I want to show you is an iceberg I took on Kekertsuatsiak in Greenland.
This is a very rare opportunity for everyone to actually witness an iceberg tumbling.
So this is as shown in the figure.
On the left you can see a small boat.
It's a boat about 15 feet.
I want you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg, the deformation of it on the surface of the water.
Here you see it start to roll, the boat moves to the other side,and a man stands there.
This is an average size Greenland iceberg.
It surfaced about 120 feet high or 40 meters high.
This video was shot in real time.
(Music) Like these icebergs, they show people different aspects of their personality.
Thank you.
(Applause）

Beijing Qinghai Hainan July 26th theme: Qinghai Lake "flower live room": "sweet" with goods to help farmers increase income
Author Hu Guilong Pan Yujie
The high altitude, large temperature difference between day and night, less air pollution, strong light gave birth to the most tenacious and generous bee colonies, creating Qinghai Royal jelly high activity, high protein, rich in nutritional value, low sugar and low fat characteristics.”
On the 26th, Zhang Jianxun, deputy Director of the Bureau of Industry and Information Management of Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, said.
On the same day, the live live delivery of bee products was held on the banks of Qinghai Lake. Representatives of China Bee Products Association, entrepreneurs, beekeepers and other parties gathered to promote Qinghai's special bee products, selling nearly 10,000 bottles of Qinghai Plateau royal jelly online and offline, with a total of nearly 3.8 million yuan.
The picture shows the beekeepers on-site display of bee products.
It is reported that the live with goods activities with the help of Beijing Houdeli bee industry chain network, fast hand, Taobao and other domestic well-known bee product retail enterprises, live, e-commerce platform, to promote the“enterprise+beekeeper+grower”exchanges and cooperation, and through online and offline channels continue to issue“Qinghai Plateau spring pulp consumption coupons” to consumers, is expected to make a total profit of nearly 5.28 million yuan for the year.
In this regard, Wu Na, president of Beijing Houdeli Bee Industry Co., Ltd., believes that“it is worth it”:“This move can expand the visibility of Qinghai bee products, attract more consumers to understand, like natural bee products without adding, and drive beekeepers to increase income."”
At present, the company has signed a strategic agreement on production cooperation with Qinghai Yun Bee Industry Co., Ltd. and Qinghai Huabao Bee Industry Co., Ltd., hoping to jointly promote the rapid development of the local bee industry in Qinghai.
The picture shows the sea of rapeseed flowers on the banks of Qinghai Lake.
This spring, due to the need to set up road crossings for epidemic prevention and control, beekeepers“chasing flowers and honey”road is blocked, many bees miss the flowering period, lack of food and death, beekeepers ' income has been seriously affected.
"All year round, beekeepers follow the flowering period of the long journey, from Yunnan, Sichuan all the way north to the northwest, they eat and sleep, no place to live, very hard."
As businesses, we have a responsibility to help them.”
Wu Na said.
"Small bees are 'environmental scouts', and bees in heavily polluted areas cannot survive.Zhao Xiaochuan, executive vice president of China Bee Products Association, said that bee pollination is an important link in the ecological chain, to protect the diversity of plants and improve the ecological environment has an irreplaceable role.
At the same time, bee pollination can increase crop yield and improve quality, especially in a wide range of species and poor management conditions of the region, pollination of greater significance.
Research data show that pollination can increase the production of rapeseed by about 15% -30%.
The picture shows the executive vice president of China Bee Products Association Zhao Xiaochuan (right)to promote Qinghai bee products.
"The economic, ecological and social benefits of bee pollination are far greater than the value of bee products themselves, and the bee industry has great potential in human health, crop production, vegetation reproduction and ecological protection, and little has been known about it.”
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
Today, the number of beekeepers is dwindling, in addition to the year-round beekeepers, there are still many poor households with reduced mobility choose to beehive shares in cooperatives.
"The state has financial support, we contact technical personnel to help guide, beekeepers lack of understanding and judgment on the market environment, to open the market also need the help and coordination of the government, enterprises, industry associations."”
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
"Our bee products are also screened and controlled in strict accordance with national standards to ensure quality, and protect consumer rights and interests while helping beekeepers."”
Affected by continued rainfall,since July 22, the soil at the rear edge of the Zhongtai landslide in Lijing Village, Lujing Village, Wulong District, Chongqing, cracked, and a large area of slip deformation occurred, completely blocking the river along the Cang River, forming a weir plug with a water level of 13 meters in front of the dam and an estimated storage capacity of about 550,000 cubic meters.
In order to ensure the safety of navigation, the Chongqing Maritime Department decided to implement temporary traffic control on the waters between Shi Pan and Guanyin Beach on the Yangtze River boundary.
According to the monitoring of Chongqing meteorological and hydrological departments, since the 25th, the central and western parts of Chongqing and the northeast region of widespread rain to heavy rain, some areas of heavy rain, local heavy rain.
Fujiang Xiaohe Dam Station will appear on the evening of the 26th the highest water level, the highest water level close to the warning water level.
In order to ensure the safety of navigation, the Chongqing Maritime Department decided to implement temporary traffic control on the waters between Shi Pan and Guanyin Beach on the Yangtze River boundary.。
The Chongqing Flood Control and Drought Control Command decided to issue flood level III early warning information and start flood level IV emergency response.
The Chongqing flood Control and Drought Control Command requires that the districts and counties of Jiangbei, Shapingba, Tongnan and Wulong, Chongqing and the relevant member units of the Chongqing Prevention and Control Command, pay great attention to the rain conditions, especially the changes in the rising water of the Yangtze River, Jialing River and Wujiang River, analyze and judge in advance, issue early warning, strengthen patrol duty, resolutely and decisively evacuate and transfer the people in threatened areas, mobilize emergency rescue teams and materials in a timely manner, quickly and efficiently dispose of the disaster(risk)situation, and avoid the occurrence of mass deaths and injuries.
The minister Counsellor of the Embassy of Viet Nam in Laos, the Vietnamese Buddhist Association in Laos, the Lao Vietnamese General Association, the Vientiane Provincial government, the Lao Veterans Association and other representatives attended the ceremony.
The ceremony was held in a solemn and solemn atmosphere, and the representatives paid tribute to the heroes and their achievements and the special unity of the older people.
In his speech, Minister Counsellor Zheng Shixin said that this is an opportunity for the old Vietnamese and the Lao people to jointly commemorate the heroes of the revolution of the two countries and express their gratitude to the heroes who sacrificed their lives for the independence and freedom of the two countries, as well as a good opportunity for the two peoples to recall that the two countries work side by side against their common enemies, strive for national independence and national unity, jointly build national development and consolidate relations between the two countries.
74 years ago, on January 23, 1946, 28 soldiers of the Old Vietnam War Alliance died in an attack on the Phonehe stronghold.
The victory of this offensive became a historic victory for the two countries in the early stages of the revolutionary struggle for national liberation.
Ms. Zheng stressed that the people of the two countries will always remember the heroes who died for the cause of the struggle for national liberation of the two countries, while stressing that the young areas of the two countries will continue to carry forward the tradition of bravery and strength of their old predecessors, and make due contributions to the continued flowering of the relationship between the older countries and the prosperity and development of the two countries.

Greenland opens a new round of mixed reform Shanghai state Capital intends to transfer 17.5% of its shares-Economic Watch Net-Professional financial news website
Economic Watch Network reporter Rao Xianjun July 26, Greenland Holdings (600606.SH) Issued the "Suggestive Announcement on the Transfer of Some shares of the Company by means of an agreement between the state-owned shareholders and the Resumption of Trading by means of public Solicitation of the transferee".
In order to further deepen the reform of state-owned enterprises, optimize the restructuring of state-owned assets and improve the equity structure of Greenland, Shanghai Real Estate (Group) Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as“Shanghai Real Estate”) and Shanghai Urban Investment (Group) Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as“Shanghai Urban Investment”) intend to transfer some of the shares of the company held by way of an agreement through an open solicitation of transferees, the total share ratio of the shares to be transferred shall not exceed 17.5% of the total share capital of Greenland.
The price of the shares to be transferred is not lower than the higher of the following: the arithmetic average of the daily weighted average price for the 30 trading days prior to the date of the suggestive announcement (July 27, 2020); and the Company's audited net asset value per share for the most recent fiscal year.
At present, the new strategic investors of Greenland are still inconclusive, according to the announcement and public information estimates, the new strategic investors need to pay about 14 billion yuan in funds to win the 17.5% stake of Greenland's mixed transfer.
It is worth noting that after the completion of the share transfer, it is expected that Greenland still has no controlling shareholders and actual controllers, but the control structure may change significantly.

White House advisers " bite back”states to resume work prematurely
Local time on July 23, the number of confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia in the United States exceeded 4 million, accounting for 30% of global cases.
For months, US President Donald Trump has repeatedly asked states to return to work and to school, only recently to change their attitude and take the initiative to wear masks in public, and his advisers have”rebuked " some state governments to return to work too soon.
On the 22nd, White House Presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway said at a news conference that some state governments did not comply with the resumption of work standards, prematurely restart bars and other places.
Mr. Conway also cited earlier claims that the president had the“absolute power”to decide the state's resumption of work as a misinformation.
"The president is a federalist, and he believes in the autonomy of the states.”
She defended Trump.
However, the“rumor”in Conway's mouth was said by Trump himself at the White House briefing on the outbreak on April 13.
This self-face operation was ridiculed by netizens as " rewriting history."
Kellyanne Conway wants to rewrite history. She's a liar.
Trump called Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer a dictator because she followed medical guidelines and insisted on a shutdown.
Trump wants to push for a return to work so he can hold a rally.
This is not the first time Kellyanne Conway has caused controversy.
In an interview with Fox News on April 15, Conway blurted out: "This is COVID-19, not COVID-1, friends!”
She seems to understand”19 " as a version number, by netizens madly ridiculed: no common sense to read the newspaper!
Recently, we have seen the impact of cyberattacks on the business world.
Data breaches at companies like Jpmorgan Chase, Yahoo, Home Depot and Target have resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions of dollars, in losses.
A few more such attacks, the entire world economy will collapse.
The public domain is not immune.
From 2012 to 2014, there was a very serious data breach at the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.
Security clearance and fingerprint information were stolen, affecting 22 million employees.
You may also have heard that some government-funded hackers are trying to influence election results in some countries with stolen data.
The two most recent cases were a massive data theft in the German Bundestag and an email theft from the Democratic National Committee in the United States.
Cyber threats have affected our democratic process.
And there is a growing trend.
The more advanced computer technology is, the more vulnerable the means we use to protect our data.
In particular, a new computer technology, called quantum computers, uses microscopic particles from nature to significantly increase the computing power of computers.
Its computing power is powerful enough to crack many of the encryption systems we use today.
So are we hopeless?
Should we begin to pack up electronic survival gear to meet the coming data doom?
I don't think it's that far.
Quantum computers are still only in the laboratory, and it will take years for them to be used in practice.
What's more, there have been many major breakthroughs in the crypto space.
For me, this is a very exciting time in the history of secure communications.
About 15 years ago, I learned that we had unlocked new skills to create quantum effects that didn't exist in nature. I'm very excited.
The idea of using the basic laws of physics to advance the development of crypto technology excites me.
Today, a number of selected companies and laboratories, including mine, are pushing the technology to practical application.
That's right.
We're going to use quantum against quantum.
How to achieve it?
First, let's take a quick look at the world of crypto.
You need a briefcase, you have some important documents to give to your good friend, James Bond, to lock it up and keep it safe.
Because these materials are top secret, we're going to use a super-advanced briefcase.
It is equipped with a special password lock that, once locked, converts the contents of the file to random numbers.
So all you have to do is put the file in, lock it, and by this time the file has been converted to a random number, and you give the briefcase to James.
When the briefcase hasn't arrived, you call him and tell him the code.
Once he got the briefcase, entered the password, deciphered the file, it was perfect, and you managed to pass on an encrypted message to James Bond.
(Laughter) A fun example,but it illustrates the 3 key points of encryption.
Ciphers -- we call them encryption keys.
You can think of it as a password.
The phone call that gave James the code.
We call it key passing.
This ensures that we can safely send the key to the designated location.
And a lock used to encrypt and decrypt files.
We call it the encryption algorithm.
With a secret key, it converts the contents of the file into random numbers.
A good algorithm is able to do this, without the key it is difficult to crack the password.
The importance of the algorithm is that if someone gets a briefcase, opens it, doesn't have a secret key, doesn't know the encryption algorithm, you can't read the contents of the document.
All you get is some random numbers.
Most security systems rely on secure key delivery, passing the key to the right place.
However, the rapidly growing computing power jeopardizes many of the key delivery methods we currently use.
To take an example, we are now using a very wide range of systems-RSA.
When it was invented in 1977, it took about 4 trillion years to crack a 426-bit RSA key.
And by 1994, just 17 years later, the code had been cracked.
As computers become more and more powerful, the passwords we need are longer and longer.
Now we often use 2048 or 4096-bit passwords.
As you can see, the battle is going on between the encryptors and the decryptors, both trying to defeat each other.
In the next 10 to 15 years, the arrival of quantum computers will crack more quickly complex mathematical algorithms that underpin the encryption systems we use today.
In fact, quantum computers will turn our safe castle into a one-touch-down house of cards.
We have to try to protect our castle.
In recent years, there have been many research institutions studying how to use quantum effects to enhance encryption.
People have made some exciting breakthroughs.
Remember the 3 key points of encryption? High quality keys, secure key delivery and strong algorithms.
However, advances in science and engineering have jeopardized two of these priorities.
The first thing to bear is the key.
Random numbers are the basis for making up the key.
But to this day, they are no longer truly random.
At present, we generate the secret key, based on the frequency of random numbers, generated by software, we call pseudo-random numbers.
There will always be some, perhaps not so obvious, law in the numbers generated by programs or mathematical methods.
The lower the randomness of these numbers, or, in terminology, the lower the moisture content, the easier it is to predict them.
Recently, some casinos have been attacked, the way to attack is very creative.
They aim the slot machine to shoot for a period of time, and then analyze it.
Cybercriminals use reverse engineering to create pseudo-random number generators behind turntables.
In this way, they have a good chance of predicting the turn of the turntable, and thus make a lot of money.
Keys are equally insecure.
Having a true random number generator is important for generating secure passwords.
For several years, researchers have been trying to make real random number generators.
But most of the designs are either not random enough, not fast enough, or difficult to reuse.
But the quantum world is truly random.
It is important to take advantage of this true randomness.
Devices capable of measuring quantum effects can generate a continuous stream of random numbers very quickly.
The casino crime just said can no longer play.
Several universities and companies from around the world are focusing on making true random number generators.
In my company, our quantum random number generator was born out of an optical table that is 2 meters long and 1 meter wide.
After that we narrowed it down to the size of a box.
To this day, it is already possible to put it on a PCI card, plugged into an ordinary computer.
This is the fastest and truly random number generator in the world.
By measuring quantum effects, it can generate 1 billion random numbers per second.
Today it has been widely used around the world to enhance the security of cloud service providers, banks, and government agencies.
(Applause) But even with a real random number generator, we still face a second big cyber security threat: the secure transfer of keys.
Current key transfer technology cannot fight quantum computers.
The quantum solution to this problem, called quantum key distribution, or QKD for short, takes advantage of a fundamental counterintuitive property of quantum mechanics.
Observing the behavior of a microscopic particle changes the particle.
Let me give you an example to illustrate.
Let's go back and forth and give the code to James Bond.
But this time, we don't call him. We use quantum effects to carry the code with a laser beam and pass it to James through ordinary fiber.
Let's assume that Dr. Noh wants to get the code.
Fortunately, Dr. Noh will leave an electronic fingerprint in his attempt to intercept the quantum key, which James and you can detect.
So the intercepted key will be invalidated.
The secret key left behind can provide strong protection for the data.
Because this security mechanism is based on the fundamentals of physics, it is impossible for a quantum computer, or any future supercomputer, to crack it.
My team and I are working with many top universities and the defense sector to improve this exciting technology and develop the next generation of security products.
The Internet of Things heralds the advent of a highly connected era, with 25-30 billion devices expected to access the Internet by 2020.
Trust in these connected device systems is critical if our society is to function properly in the IoT world.
We believe that quantum technology will be very important to building this trust, it will ensure that we fully enjoy these amazing innovations, enjoy these innovations that will enrich our lives.
Thank you all.

Is it reasonable for a 3-year-old child to sue the school after being hit by a play on the college playground?
2020-07-26 05:01: 11 Source: Legal Daily Author: Wang Sishuo Responsible editor: Wang Sishuo
The playground was smashed,and the children were compensated and then sued the school
□ Newspaper correspondent Zhao Yifan
Xiaowen, 3, was accidentally hit in the head by Chen from the softball team while playing on a college playground.
After Chen's compensation, Xiaowen's father, Mr. Wen, as Xiaowen's legal representative, sued the school to the court, demanding that the school where the playground was located apologize, and pay a total of 20,000 yuan for medical expenses and psychological damage.
Recently, after hearing the case, the People's Court of Haidian District of Beijing held that the school had set up a protective net in the playground at the time of the incident and had fulfilled the appropriate safety and security obligations, and Chen had made compensation, and accordingly the judgment rejected the plaintiff's claim.
Mr. Wen claims that during the summer vacation of 2019, he took Xiaowen to play on the school playground while the softball team was training on the playground.
In order to avoid the risks, Siu Man, Mr. Man and many other children and parents are active in the safe areas designated by the softball team.
But then the softball team member Chen dropped the ball while pitching, causing the softball over the net to fly to the safety area and hit Xiaowen in the back of the head.
Mr. Wen immediately took Xiaowen to the hospital for treatment and was diagnosed with head trauma.
Mr. Man believes that the facilities of the school's stadium do not comply with the relevant safety regulations and do not manage the team and related facilities effectively.
The school's negligence led to the above-mentioned events, resulting in the small tattoo body suffered great pain,but also brought greater pain to his family, for which the school should bear legal responsibility.
In this regard, the school argued that the school has set up a protective net in the playground, and posted management regulations, training notice, telling to enter the playground must maintain a safe distance from the training site and remind attention to their own safety, the plaintiff can not prove that the school“failed to meet the obligations of safety and security”, so do not agree to compensation.
The court heard that the venue of the incident was a free venue open to the public by the university involved. Although the school has a safety and security obligation for the management of the playground, this safety and security obligation only needs to meet the general obligation to pay attention.
At the time of the incident, the school had set up a protective net in the playground, which had fulfilled the appropriate security obligations, and Chen also compensated Xiaowen for medical expenses, transportation expenses and other losses of more than 2,000 yuan in accordance with the compensation agreement reached earlier.
After that, Xiaowen's parents again claimed the school's compensation,and the court ruled that all the plaintiff's claims were dismissed.
After the verdict, neither party appealed,and the verdict is now in force.
According to Article 37 of the Tort Liability Law of our country, the school, as the administrator of public places, has the obligation of safety and security; in the case of damage caused by the actions of a third person, the third person shall bear the tort liability, but the administrator of public places who have not fulfilled the obligation of safety and security shall bear the corresponding supplementary responsibility.
According to the judge, as the administrator of a public place, he is most likely to understand the actual situation of the whole place, foresee the risks and damage that may occur, and thus is most likely to take the necessary measures to prevent the occurrence of loss or to mitigate the extent of the damage, and the cost of avoiding and mitigating the occurrence of the damage is minimal, so the law stipulates that he shall bear the corresponding safeguard obligation to engage in social activities.
In this case, the school's duty of safety and security should be commensurate with the social activities it engages in in the playground, which is open to the public free of charge. In particular, it should mainly take basic security measures and have the obligation to inform about hidden dangers.
In judicial practice, it is also not appropriate to impose excessive safety and security obligations on public place managers.
If the school has taken to set up a protective network and fulfill the obligation to inform, it can be found that the school is not at fault and should not bear legal responsibility.
In addition, even if the administrators of schools and other public places fail to fulfill their obligations of safety and security, their liability is also supplemented by compensation for damages. In accordance with the newly promulgated civil code, the administrators may also recover compensation from the third party after assuming the additional responsibility.
Therefore, in such an accident, the victim shall not extend the scope of the claim after he has received compensation from the direct infringer.
Today I want to show you how we will make things in the future.
I believe that soon our buildings and machines will be able to self-assemble, self-replicate and self-repair.
So I'm going to show you what I think is the current state of manufacturing, and then compare it with some natural systems.
So in the current manufacturing industry, we have skyscrapers-two and a half years, 500,000 to millions of parts, very complex, using new technologies in steel, concrete and glass.
We have exciting machines that can take us into space -- two and a half million parts in five years.
But on the other hand, if we look at the natural system, we have two million types of proteins that fold up in 10,000 nanoseconds, and we can replicate DNA with three billion base pairs in about an hour.
This is the complexity of our natural systems, but they are very efficient, more efficient than anything we build, more complex than anything we can build.
They are more efficient in terms of energy.
They rarely make mistakes.
They are able to repair themselves and maintain a long life.
There is a super interesting thing about natural systems.
If we can translate it into our built environment, there's a lot of potential in the way we build things.
I think the key is self-assembly.
If we want to use self-assembly in our own physical environment, I think there are four key factors.
The first is that we need to decode all the complexity of what we want to build-that is, our buildings and machines.
We need to decode them into simple sequences -- basically the DNA of how our buildings work.
Then we need the programmable part that can accept the sequence and use it for folding or remodeling.
We need some energy to activate, so that these parts of us can fold up in accordance with the procedure.
We need some type of error correction redundancy to ensure that what we successfully build is what we want.
Therefore, I would like to show you some of the projects that my colleagues and I are working on to achieve this future of self-assembly.
The first two projects are MacroBot and DeciBot.
These projects are large-scale reconfigurable robots-8-foot, 12-foot long proteins.
They are embedded in electromechanical devices, sensors.
You need to decode the way you want to fold into, into, a series of angles -- negative 120 degrees, negative 120 degrees, 0 degrees, 0 degrees, 120 degrees, negative 120 degrees-- that sort of thing; a series of angles, or turns, that can be passed through with a wire.
Each cell gets its own message -- say, negative 120. It rotates, checks to see if it rotates in place and passes the sequence to its neighbors.
There are many outstanding scientists, engineers,designers working for this project.
I think this project really reveals: is this really scalable?
I mean, it costs thousands of dollars a lot of people to build this eight-foot robot.
Can we really expand it?Can we really embed robots in every part?
The next question is to look at the passivity, or passively try to make the reorganization programmable.
But it goes a step further, and it tries to do the actual calculations.
Basically embedded in the basic building blocks of most calculations, digital logic gates, directly into the various parts.
This is with the non-door.
There is a tetrahedron on each gate to be used for the calculation, with two input tetrahedron.
One of them is input from the user, just like you're building bricks.
The other is the input of a brick that comes before the front is placed.
Then it will give the output of three-dimensional space.
This means that users pile up bricks the way they want.
It is calculated based on what you have done and your instructions.
Now it begins to move in three-dimensional space-up or down.
Looking to the left, the input of[1,1] is equal to the output of 0, which means down.
On the right, the input of [0,0] is an output of 1, indicating up.
So what this really means is that our structure now contains the blueprints we want to build.
So the information about what you want to build is all embedded in it.
This means that we have some form of self-replication.
In this case, I call it self-directed replication, because your structure contains precise blueprints.
If you encounter an error, you can replace a section.
All the local information is embedded in it, telling you how to fix it.
So you have something you can climb on, you can read it and output it one by one.
It is directly embedded;there is no external instruction input.
The last project I'm going to show is called the eccentric chain, and it's probably the most exciting example of the passive self-assembly system we're seeing right now.
Its reconfiguration and programmability make it a completely passive system.
Basically you have a chain of elements.
Each element is exactly the same, and they are eccentric.
Each chain, or element, wants to turn right or left.
If you want to assemble a chain, you need to program it.
Tell each unit whether to turn left or right.
When you shake the chain, it folds up to program whatever structure you code for it -- so in this case, a spirochete, a fire, two connected cubes.
Basically you can program in three-dimensional space -- or one-dimensional,two-dimensional -- and the chain is completely passive.
What kind of future does this foretell to us?
I think this tells us about this possibility of self-assembly, self-replication and self-healing in our body structures, our buildings and machines.
In these sections there are new programmability.
From this you can get new possibilities of calculation.
We will have space to calculate.
Imagine our buildings, bridges,machines, all the bricks that can actually be calculated.
What an amazing parallel and distributed computing power and new design possibilities.
This is an exciting potential.
I think these projects that I show you are just a small step towards the future if we implement these new technologies for a new self-assembled world.
Thank you.

Under the normalization of epidemic prevention and control, people's enthusiasm for exercise and fitness is high.
With the gradual liberalization of cross-provincial tourism business, the tourism market is also about to usher in a recovery.
Fujian Province resumed its cross-provincial tourism business on July 21,and Xiamen, a popular tourist destination, ushered in a peak of passenger traffic in the first weekend after opening.
As a popular tourist destination city, there are a lot of tourists arriving in Xiamen on weekends.
Xiamen Railway Station is expected to send 3.7 million passengers summer transport, airport passenger flow is mainly students, tourism, visiting relatives.
The tourism market gradually picked up. In July, Xiamen Airport operated 440 daily flights, and domestic flights have returned to 80% of the pre-epidemic levels.
Airlines have encrypted air express routes from Xiamen to Shanghai, Beijing, Kunming, Xi'an and other major cities to seize the recovered tourism market.
At present, a number of travel agencies in Xiamen have launched a number of summer domestic cross-provincial travel products, the team itinerary is mainly outdoor attractions.
In response to the summer passenger rush at railway stations and airports, the relevant units have deployed additional manpower to divert people in areas where check-in counters and security checkpoints are easy to gather. Fujian has also optimized and upgraded the“Eight Min Health Code”to achieve health data sharing and mutual recognition with 31 provinces, and promote the orderly recovery of the tourism market.
Andy Lau can Liu Qingyun "tear up" a new spark-Xinhua
"Bomb Disposal Expert 2" recently announced that it will be released on December 24,becoming the first film to be scheduled for the Lunar New Year.
The second is still directed by Yau Lai-tao,produced and starred by Andy Lau,and opens with a new story.
It is reported that the addition of the“nuclear bomb”element in the second part also makes the challenge facing the bomb disposal experts more difficult.
Three years ago,by the original production of "Bomb Disposal Expert", won the May Day box office champion of that year,and won 7 nominations in the Hong Kong Film Awards.
The "bomb disposal expert 2", but also make again look forward to the ace combination can wipe a new spark.
"Bomb Disposal Expert 2" tells a new story:former bomb disposal expert Pan Chengfeng (Andy Lau) fainted at the scene of the explosion,was listed as a suspect by the police.
In order to find the truth,he had to turn to Dong Zhuo Wen(Liu Qingyun), a friend who was also a bomb disposal expert, for help.
Pang Ling(Ni Ni ornaments), who is also the ex-girlfriend of Pan Chengfeng, is also involved in the case.
Still a bomb disposal expert,but from the set trailer can feel the complexity of Andy Lau's new role:broken a leg, wearing a prosthetic limb, while being chased by Liu Qingyun, who is also a bomb disposal expert,while being commanded by his ex-girlfriend Ni Ni.
What is the relationship between the three,what did Andy Lau do in the Xiang Island Hotel, what kind of cases were involved in,and what twists and turns his career as a bomb disposal expert has experienced,and all kinds of mysteries make people curious.
It is understood that the main event of the film is the scene of Hong Kong's world landmarks,coupled with the top special effects production team,bring shock and realistic visual impact.

Beijing, July 26, the integrated Russian satellite network reported that July 26 is the Russian Navy Day,the main parade to celebrate the Navy Day was held in St. Petersburg and Kronstadt.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, the supreme commander of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, arrived in Kronstadt for the celebration, where 15 ships and submarines were inspected.
On July 28, 2019 local time, a grand military parade was held in St. Petersburg, Russia, to celebrate the Naval Festival.
Putin reportedly congratulated navy officials on Navy Day and sailed in a dinghy in the Gulf of Finland next to the ships that were to take part in the maritime parade, before inspecting the troops at the main ceremony table.
Putin said the Russian naval fleet is equipped with the latest ships and special equipment, the level of equipment is constantly improving.
“The Russian naval fleet has warships equipped with high-precision weapons, strategic diving cruisers and multi-purpose submarines, the latest aircraft and other aircraft, unique weapons and special equipment, " Putin said at a military parade on Russian Navy Day.”
On June 24, local time, Russia commemorated the 75th anniversary of the victory of the Great Patriotic War Red Square parade was held.
He also said that the Russian naval fleet will rely on digital and effective defense means to gain a unique advantage.
The report said that the main naval parade to celebrate the Russian Navy Day was held in St. Petersburg and Kronstadt,a total of 46 ships participated, including the frigate“Admiral Kasatonov”,“Admiral Kulakov”large anti-submarine ship, as well as large landing ships, small missile ships, frigates, submarines and so on.
Among them, the series of ships on a static display next to the Hermitage bridge in St. Petersburg, the most notable of which is the replica of the first Russian battleship“Poltava”in the early 18th century.
To avoid the spread of the new crown virus, only local residents and special guests will be able to enter Kronstadt during this year's Naval Parade.
Every year, the last Sunday of July is the Russian Navy Day.
Yang Hongnian, founder of Beijing Philharmonic Choir, dies at 86-<url>
Beijing News(Reporter Liu Zhen)On July 26, the Beijing Philharmonic Choir published an obituary. Yang Hongnian, the founder of the Beijing Philharmonic Choir, a famous Chinese conductor and music educator, a tenured academic member of the Central Conservatory of Music and a professor of the Conducting Department, died on July 26, 2020 at 13: 55 in Beijing, at the age of 86, due to ineffective medical treatment.
Photo from the official website of the Beijing Philharmonic Choir.
Yang Hongnian was born in 1934, a native of Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, and loved music from an early age.
In the autumn of 1951, he was admitted to the Music Department of East China Normal University in Shanghai. He studied conducting under Professor Yang Jiaren and German conductor Heizmann, and studied music and polyphony with former Soviet expert Artzamanov.
In 1958, he taught at the Music Department of the Beijing Normal University of the Arts, and in 1973 he was transferred to the Composition Department and the Conductor Department of the Central Conservatory of Music.
Yang Hongnian founded the Beijing Philharmonic Choir in 1983.
For more than 30 years, he has led the choir around the world with the aim of“love and dedication”and won dozens of awards in important competitions at home and abroad.
He has conducted the performances of more than 30 groups such as the Central Orchestra Chorus, the Central National Song and Dance Troupe, the Oriental Song and Dance Troupe and the Shanghai Choir, and held a number of symphonic concerts and choral concerts.
His books include "Band Training", "Choral Training", "Two Songs Writing", "Children's Songs Collection" (Volume 1)and "On the Problem of Choral Intonation", "On the sound Level Layout of orchestral music", as well as translations of "Choral Instrument Method" and "Debussy's Harmonicative Language".
Do you know how many medium flowering plants there are?
There are 250,000 species -- at least as many as we know -- of 250,000 flowering plants.
And flowers are a nuisance.
It's really hard to get plants to breed.
It takes a lot of experience and a lot of resources.
Why is it so troubling?
The answer, of course, is, as with many other things in the world, sex.
I know what's going on in your head when you look at these pictures.
The reason why sexual reproduction is so important is that plants have many other ways to reproduce.
It can be cut by way of branching; it can reproduce with both sexes; it can pollinate with the same plant.
But they do need to spread their genes to mix with other genes in order for them to live in the environment.
That's how evolution works.
Now the way plants transmit this information is through pollen.
Some of you may have seen these pictures before.
As I said, every family should have a scanning electron microscope that can see these.
There are as many different types of pollen as there are flowering plants.
This is actually quite useful for forensic science and so on.
Most of the pollen that causes hay fever comes from plants that use wind to spread the pollen. This is a very inefficient process, which is why pollen always runs into our noses.
Because most of them have been abandoned, it is hoped that the germ cells contained in the pollen, the male germ cells, will happen to fall on another flower.
All grasses, which means all grains, and most trees rely on the wind to spread pollen.
But most species actually use insects to do this. In a way this is smarter, because this does not require too much pollen.
Insects and other species can carry pollen and transfer it directly to where it needs to be.
It is clear that we note the relationship between insects and plants.
This is a symbiotic relationship, whether it is a bird or a bee, they can be rewarded, usually the return is nectar.
Sometimes this symbiotic relationship can lead to wonderful adaptations-the red-dress moth is a beautiful adaptability.
Plants have also been harvested, and the sky has spread pollen elsewhere.
Plants have evolved, creating landing runways everywhere, and bees may get lost in them.
Some on many plants look like marks of other insects.
These are the pollen sacs of lilies, very clever, so when an unsuspecting insect falls on them, the pollen sac flips over and hits the insect's back with a lot of pollen, so that it can follow the insect to other plants.
There is an orchid that looks like it has a jaw. In a way, it does; it forces the insect to climb over, dip in the pollen, and take it somewhere else.
Orchids: There are at least 20,000 species of orchids -- an amazing variety.
They have all kinds of tricks.
They must try and attract pollinators to help them through the process.
This orchid, known as Darwin's orchid, because it was studied by Darwin and gave wonderful predictions when he saw it. You can see here a very long nectar tube hanging from the orchid.
Basically what an insect has to do is -- we come to the flower -- it pricks the mouthpiece into the middle part all the way down to the nectar tube to get the nectar.
Looking at the flower, Darwin said, “I guess something co-evolved with it."”
There is no doubt that it is insects.
I mean when it's usually rolled up, but when it's straightened, it looks like this.
Now imagine if nectar, such a valuable thing, was expensive for plants to produce and attracted many pollinators, then, as in human sexuality, people might begin to deceive each other.
They might say, " I have some nectar."Would you like to get some?”
This is a plant.
This plant is a favorite of South African insects. They evolved long mouthparts to obtain nectar at the bottom.
This is a copycat.
This plant is imitating the former one.
There is a fly with a long mouthpiece that does not get any nectar from the counterfeiters. Because the counterfeiters didn't give it any nectar.It thought it could get.
So not only do flies not get nectar from fake plants, but -- if you look very close to the top of the head, you'll see some pollen there that will be spread to other plants, if no botanist comes over and glues it to a blue card.
(Laughter) This lie spread throughout the plant kingdom.
This flower with black spots: They may look like black spots to us, but I tell you, to the male insects of the appropriate species, these look like two very, very sexy females.
(Laughter) When the insect arrives and lands on it, it immerses itself in the pollen, and of course, the pollen will be taken to other plants, and if you look at the scanning electron microscope images that every family should have, you can see that there are actually some patterns there, three-dimensional patterns.
It can even make insects feel comfortable and look good.
These electron microscope images -- this is an orchid disguised as an insect -- you can see that for our eyes, different parts of the structure have different colors and different textures, and insects may be able to perceive very, very different textures.
This orchid has evolved to mimic the shiny metallic surface seen in some beetles.
Under a scanning electron microscope you can see the surface -- it's very different from the other surfaces we've seen.
Sometimes the whole plant will imitate an insect, even if we look like an insect.
I mean, I think it looks like some kind of flying animal or beast.
It is a wonderful and magical thing.
That's the smart part of it.It is called obsidian.
I think it's crafty sometimes.
For the right kind of bee, this looks like another very aggressive bee, it will fly over and hit it with its head many, many times, try to drive it away, of course, it will get it stained with pollen.
Another thing it does is that this plant mimics another orchid rich in insect-favorite food.
But in fact there is nothing.
So it's cheating on two levels-it's unbelievable.
(Laughter) What we see is Ylang-ylang, the strong-scented part.
Actually, I've smelled it before.
These flowers don't actually have to be so gorgeous.
They give off a wonderful scent that attracts any interested insect.
The flower does not smell very good.
This flower actually smells very bad. Again, it's evolved and it looks like carrion.
So flies love it.
Flies fly in and help them pollinate.
This is the white star arrowroot, also known as the dead horse arrowroot.
I don't know what a dead horse smells like, but this flower may smell very much like it.
It was terrible.
The green-headed fly can't help it.
Fly into it, fly all the way into it.
Lay eggs on it, thinking it was a very good piece of carrion, not realizing that there was no food for eggs here, which would die here, but at the same time the plant would benefit, because the bristles loosened and the flies disappeared and pollinated to another flower-it was wonderful.
This is the calla plant, European calla, spotted-leaved Aro mother, in this country called trillium.
I shot this in Dorset last week.
This guy's heating up about 15 degrees higher than the ambient temperature -- incredible.
If you look inside it, behind the meat spike is something like a dam, and flies are attracted to heat -- a boiling volatile chemical, a bug -- and they're trapped under this container.
They drink the sweet nectar and then they all get a little slimy.
At night they are covered with pollen, sprayed down from them, and then the bristles we see on them wither to allow these pollen-covered bugs to escape -- it's incredible.
If you think it's incredible, this one is my favorite.
This is the spring feather cranberry velvet.
Everyone here from Brazil should know about this plant.
This is the most amazing thing.
Its stamens are about a foot long.
It has an ability that no other plant as far as I know, and when it blooms-this is in the middle of the meat spike-for about two days, it produces some sort of metabolic change, somewhat similar to that of mammals.
It doesn't have starch. It's plant food. It has something very similar to brown fat. It burns fat at a rate that burns it, metabolizes it, about the rate of a kitten.
By weight, it's twice the energy output of a hummingbird-absolutely amazing.
It also did something unusual.
Not only will it heat up to 155 degrees Fahrenheit, 43 or 44 degrees Celsius for two days, but it will remain constant temperature.
There is a temperature regulation mechanism for maintaining a constant temperature.
Why do you want to do this?I heard you ask.
As you don't know yet, some beetles like to mate at this temperature.
They got in and were covered with pollen.
(Laughter) Plants spread pollen on them and let them go and pollinate them.
What a wonderful thing this is.
Now we think that most pollinators are insects, but in fact in the tropics, many birds and butterflies pollinate as well.
Many tropical flowers are red, which is because butterflies and birds are similar to us, and we think they can see red very well.
But if you look at the spectrum, birds and us, we see red, green and blue to see this spectrum.
Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet rays, and they can see all kinds of light and dark ultraviolet rays.
There's some color behind this.
”Wouldn't it be nice if we could see those colors, " I heard you ask.
Yes, we can see.
So what do insects see?
Last week I took pictures of these desert lotus, a half-day flower genus, in Dorset.
As we can see, these are small yellow flowers, these little yellow flowers are everywhere.
In visible light it looks like this.
If the red color is removed it looks like this.
Most bees are unable to perceive red.
Then I put an UV filter in front of my lens and exposed it for a long time at a specific frequency of UV light.
It's like a real, wonderful bull's-eye.
Now we don't know exactly what the bees see, and when I call it red, you know what I'm looking at.
We have no way of knowing what's going on in it, whether it's in the minds of insects or other humans.
But the contrast looks probably like this. Stand out from the background.
This is another small flower-located in different UV frequency ranges, different filters to match different pollinators.
It probably looks like this.
To avoid you thinking that all yellow flowers have this property -- no damage to the flower during the shooting; just attach it to a tripod and not take it off -- under ultraviolet light, look at this.
This can serve as the basis for sunscreen, because sunscreen works by absorbing ultraviolet light.
So perhaps the chemicals are of some use.
Finally, this is a nocturnal incense sent to me by Bjorn Rorslett of Norway-a wonderful hidden pattern.
I like this way of hiding.
I think it's poetic. The pictures were taken with ultraviolet filters, which astronomers used to photograph Venus -- actually the clouds on Venus.
This is the main use of this filter.
Of course, Venus is the god of love and fertility, which is the story of flowers.
Just as flowers spend so much effort trying to attract pollinators to accept their invitations, somehow they also succeed in convincing us that they have a lot of meaning We send flowers to each other at birth and death, especially at weddings, and when you think about it, it's at this moment that genetic material migrates from one organism to another.
Thank you very much.

Beijing, Chongqing, July 26 (reporter Liu Xian)The Chongqing Development and Reform Commission released a news on the 26th that the city has so far retired 4,404 fishermen, accounting for 42.54% of all fishermen involved.
Li Daiguo, 53, told the Beijing News that his grandparents were fishing in the Longxi River. Since the age of 11, he had followed his father to fish, shook his boat and walked along the Longxi River, up to Liangping, Chongqing, and down to longevity. Every time he left home, it was ten days and a half, relying on fishing to maintain his family's life.
But since 1997, with the gradual influx of rural people to the town, there are more and more residents in Gaoanchang town, resulting in more and more environmental pollution is also becoming more and more serious.
Paper mills, chemical plants and farms have been built along the Longxi River, which also pollutes the river.
By 2007 and 2008, the Longxi River became a stinky ditch.
"All the fish scales caught were black,and the inside was black when they were cut.”
Mr. Li said it was becoming more and more difficult to fish after the river pollution.
Local efforts began to control Longxi River pollution, including drift, river patrol, aquatic resources management and so on.
Li Daiguo also retired from fishing to produce, became a member of the river patrol team, the protection of aquatic resources.
From January 1, 2020, the Chongqing Aquatic Biological Reserve and the relevant waters of the main urban area have been put into effect a comprehensive ban on fishing.
According to the Chongqing Development and Reform Commission, up to now, Chongqing has a total of 3,403 fishing vessels and 4,643 fishing vessels that have signed retirement agreements, accounting for 63.3% and 86.3% of the total tasks for three years.
4,404 fishermen have been retired, accounting for 42.54 per cent of all fishermen involved.
Of the 4,404 people who have retired from fishing, 4,267 are employed, accounting for 96.89 percent of the fishermen who have retired from fishing.
Old-age insurance coverage covers 2,691 people, accounting for 61.10 percent of retired fishermen.
In the next step, Chongqing will carry out in-depth special remediation actions,accelerate the cleanup and remediation of projects for the utilization of the shoreline of the main Yangtze River, complete a new round of the survey of the inlet and outlet of the Yangtze River and carry out corresponding remediation actions, basically complete the task of the remediation of“three phosphorus” ( referring to phosphate mines, phosphorus chemicals and phosphorus plaster reservoirs), clean up and rectification of small hydropower, promote the special action for afforestation and greening on both sides of the Yangtze River, strengthen the construction of green mines, consolidate the results of the special remediation of illegal docks and illegal sand mining on the main Yangtze River, and in-depth promote the work of banning and retreating fishing in the Yangtze River basin.

Israel strengthens prevention and control of repeated outbreaks
In the early days of the outbreak of new crown pneumonia, Israel's prevention and control measures have been effective.
However, with the gradual lifting of the ban on prevention and control measures, the number of confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia in Israel has risen significantly in recent years. The Israeli government has taken several urgent measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On February 28, the first case of new crown pneumonia was confirmed in Israel. It quickly closed all ports of entry and exit, suspended non-essential industries, changed schools to online classes, restricted public transport and non-essential social activities, blocked cities with severe outbreaks, and jointly maintained preventive and control measures by the military and police.
The series of measures quickly paid off, and by mid-May, new confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia in Israel had dropped to single digits in one single day.
Since June, the number of new confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia has gradually rebounded as the epidemic has been brought under control and all Israeli prevention and control measures have been lifted.
Especially after entering July, the spread of the epidemic has been accelerating.
In recent days, Israel has more than 1,500 new cases per day for eight days, and as of press time on July 25, 916 new cases have been added on that day.
As of 25 July, there were 59,745 confirmed cases and 448 deaths in Israel.
In the face of the rapid rebound of the epidemic, the Israeli government has repeatedly taken urgent measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On July 6, after the number of confirmed cases exceeded 30,000, the Israeli government closed gyms, swimming pools, bars, nightclubs and other public entertainment venues, and introduced a policy of restricting public transport, requiring a maximum of 20 passengers per bus.
On the 17th, the government announced a series of new restrictions, including the implementation of“city closures”on weekends, including the implementation of“city closures”between 17: 00 on Fridays and 5: 00 on Sundays.
During this time, people can go out, but shops, shopping centers, barbershops, beauty salons, libraries, zoos, museums, exhibition halls, swimming pools and tourist attractions will be closed, while basic services such as supermarkets and pharmacies will remain open.
At the same time, on all dates and time periods, gatherings of more than 10 people are prohibited, gyms, studios and other places will be closed, restaurants and cafes are prohibited from dine-in, only take-out services are allowed.
At the same time, the Israeli public has not paid enough attention to the severity of the outbreak and has not been able to work with the government to combat it.
After repeated outbreaks in Israel, many people took to the streets to protest against the government's control measures affecting their economic interests.
On July 11, tens of thousands of people staged a demonstration in Tel Aviv, arguing that anti-epidemic policies were affecting the economy.
On the evening of the 21st, thousands of protesters gathered in front of the official residence of Prime Minister Netanyahu in Jerusalem to protest against Prime Minister Netanyahu's promulgation of a ban on restaurants, cafes and other preventive measures without compensation.
In addition, many people do not comply with the requirements of wearing masks and maintaining a safe social distance of two meters when they are outdoors. In order to avoid being fined by the police for not wearing masks, many people only wear masks on their chin or hang them on their wrists.
During the repeated epidemic, schools are the hardest hit areas of the spread of the new crown virus, and according to reporters recently visited this kindergarten found that the kindergarten teachers and students did not wear masks as required by the government, did not maintain a safe social distance of two meters from each other, for a large number of teachers and students infected with the virus buried hidden dangers.
Professor Eli Waxman, a member of the Expert Advisory Group on combating the epidemic of the Israeli National Security Council, believes that Israel is moving towards a“dangerous situation”, noting that the current measures taken by Israel to prevent and control the epidemic are not enough and that all leisure and recreational activities and summer schools should be closed to control the further spread of the epidemic.
Waxman said Israel lacked an overall plan to combat the outbreak. Parliament and government departments should abandon their interests as soon as possible and agree on clear steps to combat the outbreak, including restrictions in different sectors.
Tel Aviv, July 25, our reporter Wang Jiong in Tel Aviv
Wu Fengfang, a farmer in Guyuan, Ningxia, couldn't beat his wife, Dai Tianfu, and two people took a car from their home 20 miles away to Liangyun Cultural Compound.
Despite the inconvenience of two years, 77-year-old Dai Tianfu is counting on“coming here every once in a while and having a fun game.”
This is a humble yard in the Yuanzhou District of Guyuan City. Unlike the general farm house, the yard often carries melodious Qin cavities, as well as wonderful shadow plays, embroidery works, traditional Qin cavities, Meehu dramas and so on.
The owner of the compound, Liang Yun, was a carpenter.
More than 10 years ago, the love of shadow shadow, singing, he began to plan the construction of cultural compound.
With Liangyun Cultural Compound, the cultural life of the villagers has become rich and colorful.
The reporter has not yet entered the Liang Yun culture compound, the tune of the Qin cavity has been passed out.
The villagers of the neighboring village, Bai Lixiang, are singing Qin excerpts for the townsfolk.
As long as she has free time, she will come to the cultural compound to perform programs for the townsfolk.
Recently, Bai Lixiang also played a webcast.
“It is a very happy thing to have a stage for more people to see themselves perform, " she said.”
On the stage, the singers were single-minded,the strummers a tune, and, despite being amateurs, the enthusiasm was unabated.
Just like the rustic style of the farm house, outside the Qin cavity, the“grass-roots”art and intangible cultural heritage in the Liangyun Cultural Compound fluttered.
The compound also houses more than 300 pieces of agricultural utensils from different eras, traditional and handmade tiles, paper-cutting, embroidery, shadow shadow and other objects.
Liang Yun led the reporter into the courtyard of the exhibition hall, which showed his collection of old objects,old wine jug,three strings, spinning car and so on.
Why did an ordinary farmer build a cultural compound?
"Shadow play is my family's craft, and I've been learning it since I was 15 years old.”
Founded in 2012, Liangyun Cultural Compound has become the first“Intangible Cultural Heritage Exhibition Hall”in Ningxia and the demonstration compound for the protection of intangible cultural heritage in Guyuan City.
In addition to Liangyun Cultural Compound, the Yuanzhou District of Guyuan City also emerged more than 120 cultural compound, 79 folk performance groups, of which, there are more than 50 cultural compound of a certain size, such as Shenjiahe Cultural Compound, Wang Yonghong Cultural Compound, Yang Lang Cultural Compound, covering the towns and streets of Yuanzhou District, the participation of more than 5,000 people.

"Liu's spy drama" returns again "odds" to see Liu Yunlong Li Liqun opponent "soaring drama" - Xinhua
The 40-episode spy drama "The Odds" will land on Beijing Satellite TV from July 16.
"Odds" is based on real historical facts, based on the dust for many years, the first appearance of the Soviet military archives.
Liu Yunlong, a well-known actor in the“Spy Drama”, broke through the image in the play and challenged a“stuttering agent”with a happy feeling.
In recent years,the popularity of such plays as "Pretender", "mask" and "kite" has proved that the spy war type drama has a strong vitality.
Unlike previous spy works, "Odds" looks at the world and extends the story to the Soviet Far East battlefield.
Set in the final stage of the Anti-Japanese War of 1944, it tells the story of Tang Fei (Liu Yunlong), a secret intelligence worker of the Communist Party of China, under the leadership of the secretary of the Linhe Provincial Party Committee and the director of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Bureau, carrying out the Soviet Far East Intelligence Bureau's“Mudanoula”strategic operation.
Many spy drama, the actor as a senior spy, a appearance is handsome, high iq, mature perfect image.
But in Liu Yunlong's view, such a person is not suitable for spying,“The spy should be the kind of person who can not be found in the pile of people, if the appearance is the kind of very handsome image, I want everyone to pay attention to you, can you still lurk?""Kite" has a line,’You don't come to catch me, I forget that I am a Kuomintang', the spy to elitist.”
So in“Odds”, Liu Yunlong ingeniously designed his hero Tang Fei as a "stuttering agent" with a sense of joy.
The other phalanx in "Odds" is supported by Fukuhara, a Japanese man played by Liang Guanhua, and Fang Shibao, the director of the police Department played by Li Liqun.
One south and one north of the two powerful drama bone, for the whole drama added a lot of master moves to see the point.
Director Yin Fei used the word”drag play“to describe the rival play of Li Liqun and Liu Yunlong in the play, " It is definitely drag play, they two special tacit understanding, their tacit understanding to me is very impactful."A lot of times their plays are’on-the-spot', for example, we only wrote half a page of length, when I do not stop the shooting, they can continue to play.”
When the actors are in the role and ensure their character status, they can not only shape the role from the character's point of view, but also bring more viewing possibilities to the audience. Yin Fei said that such a play is enough to make a difference.
In the play, you can also see a lot of“Liu's spy drama”in the familiar face,“kite”in the famous moment, majestic "mountain City F4", in the "odds" also gathered three.
Hou Yu and Liu Mingyang, who once played Song Xiaoan and Zhao Jianzhi, once again played Tang Fei's right-hand man.
Director Yin Fei introduced, " These two people have no inferior roots, they are just in that era, that environment drift with the current."”
Liu Yunlong also offered, " We have to have a human touch."This human touch means that the people around me must have good and bad, bad people are the enemy, but also to develop them,our team must also grow up.”
The ending of these two people in the play is also carefully designed by Liu Yunlong. He believes that he will give the audience a satisfactory answer.

The Lancet article commends China's anti-epidemic efforts and encourages countries to learn from their experiences-<url>
As a country with a population of 1.4 billion and a size similar to Europe or the United States, China has effectively controlled the new crown epidemic at this stage, without the widespread spread, and has largely controlled the domestic epidemic, the Lancet magazine said on the 25th.
China has invested heavily in domestic research and public health over the past decade, making it much more prepared for the new crown than it was for severe acute respiratory syndrome(SARS), the article said.
At the time of the SARS outbreak in 2002, China was initially unprepared, especially when the pathogen could not be identified, the authors said.
When the new crown virus was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists were quickly able to identify the virus species and shared genome sequencing data with the international community on January 11, 2020.
By the end of January, doctors from mainland China and Hong Kong had clarified the clinical features of the virus, warning the world of the threat of the new crown virus through a research paper published in the Lancet.
China has also been at the forefront of vaccine research, which has been carried out very quickly and rigorously through close domestic cooperation under a state of emergency, and in May and July, the Lancet published the results of early trials of the new crown vaccine developed by China, respectively.
China's experience shows that it is very important to invest in the national health and research system to effectively improve laboratory capacity.
This is the basis for a rapid and effective national response to health emergencies and global health security.
Other countries, especially low-and middle-income countries, are well worth learning from and learning from.
In addition, China's experience has proved that on the basis of strong research, there must be a strong high-level decisively and scientifically based to make the right decision, which can make the new crown epidemic is effectively controlled.
The article emphasizes that governments and their leaders must respect science, understand the value of science and act on it in the most beneficial way to society.
In the early stages of the outbreak, China's State Health and Construction Ministry sent three groups of infectious disease experts to Wuhan to investigate the risk and spread of the new crown virus. Their recommendations provided the basis for the decision to“seal the city”of Wuhan on January 23.
At the end of the article, it is emphasized that countries need to strengthen global cooperation and joint response to global health emergencies.

One winter morning a few years ago, in Johannesburg, South Africa, I was driving to work and found the city covered in smog.
I drive by there almost every day, but this time it's unusual. I've never seen anything like it before.
Johannesburg is famous for its distinctive and beautiful skyline, but it was barely visible that morning.
Soon I realized that what I was seeing was the severe smog caused by air pollution.
The contrast between the beautiful environment I had known in the past and the smog-shrouded skyline was surging in my heart.
I fear that there is a good chance that the once colorful sunset will be swallowed up by the dark haze.
At that moment, I felt a strong urge to do something, but I did not know what to do.
All I know is that I can't just sit back and watch.
The biggest challenge is that I don't know much about environmental science. Air quality management, or atmospheric chemistry.
I'm a computer engineer, and I'm pretty sure I can't code to solve the problem of air pollution.
(Laughter) In what capacity will I solve this problem?
I'm just a townspeople.
Over the next few years, I learned a very important lesson that we should all remember if we want to achieve a better future.
Even if you are not an expert in a particular field, your expertise may contain a solution to the problem in that field.
Sometimes the unique perspective you hold can inspire unconventional thinking to shape the situation, but you need to be bold.
Only then will you be able to know the result.
All I knew at the time was that if I wanted to try to change, I had to know enough about pollution first, so I went back to being a student.
I did some basic research and quickly learned that air pollution is the biggest environmental health risk in the world.
According to the World Health Organization, in 2012, almost 14% of deaths worldwide were caused by air pollution in and around households, especially in low-and middle-income countries.
Air pollution causes a higher mortality rate per year than malaria and AIDS.
In Africa, the untimely death of unsafe sanitation, or the death of children from malnutrition, appears to be futile in the face of air pollution, while it also carries huge economic costs: in 2013, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development estimated spending of more than 美元 400 billion.
In my work, I explore the cutting-edge achievements of artificial intelligence, including the symbiotic relationship between humans and machines, to find a useful foothold and help us make better decisions.
When I think about air pollution again, it becomes clear that we need to find better ways to make better decisions considering the size of the problem, and collaboration is very necessary.
So I decided to get to know some people who work in this field.
I started talking to officials in Johannesburg and other surrounding cities, I joined the local science community, and I made some phone calls to completely unfamiliar but relevant people.
These experiences that I set out to intervene helped me to gain a deeper understanding of the problem.
It also helped me avoid the trap that people in my line of work sometimes fall into when trying to innovate: quickly adopt a technology before they really get to grips with the problem.
I began to think, what can I do to improve the situation?
I began to ask myself how I could effectively combine my knowledge and skills in software engineering and artificial intelligence with the expertise of the people I contacted.
I want to create an online air quality management platform that will reveal future pollution trends and make predictions about what might happen.
I am sure that my idea can become a realistic solution, but also faced with uncertainty, I can not guarantee that it will succeed.
All I have is a specific set of engineer skills, the skills I have gained from my work. (Laughter) Of course, for someone who has been working in the field of air pollution for years, my skills are completely new.
I've come to realize that sometimes a novel perspective, a new skill set, can lead to something remarkable.
Our willpower and imagination are an indicator of how we move past obstacles and start a new chapter.
I had a better understanding of air pollution, looking for air pollution data over the past ten years, as well as meteorological data in and around Johannesburg. After that, I worked with my colleagues in South Africa and China to create an air quality resolution support system and upload it to the cloud.
This software is able to analyze historical and real-time data to reveal trends in pollution over time and space.
We then use the new machine learning technology to predict future pollution days in advance.
This means that residents can make better decisions about their daily trips and where to settle with their families.
We can predict adverse pollution events in advance, define the source of heavy pollution, so that the relevant authorities can give instructions to adjust their business activities.
By supporting situational planning, urban planners can also make better decisions about how to expand infrastructure, such as housing in industrial areas.
We have set up a leading pilot of the technology, running for 120 days, covering the whole of South Africa.
Our expected results have been verified. There is a close correlation between the forecast data we show and the data we collect in the field.
Through our management, we introduced the world's leading state-of-the-art instruments to predict atmospheric quality, with unprecedented resolution and accuracy, to benefit the city I drove into on a recent winter morning. Then I said to myself, " Something is wrong, I have to find a way to do something.""
So, the point is: What if I didn't delve into the problem of air pollution in the first place?
What if I don't pay attention to the state of the environment in my country, but hope that some place, some other person, will take care of these things?
What I have learned from this is that when it comes to advancing a cause that we all believe in, it is important to focus on the possibilities of success and consider the consequences of inaction.
We should not be distracted by opposition and resistance, it should motivate us to go further.
So no matter where you are in the world, the next time you find that your natural curiosity is aroused and that it matters what you want, you have some crazy or brave idea, even if it's not your area of expertise, ask yourself: Why not try it?
Why not go ahead and solve the problem? Do your best in your own way?
You may get unexpected pleasure.
Thank you all.

The largest earthquake in Taiwan this year occurred in the eastern waters of Taiwan-<url>
Taipei, July 26 (Xinhua) -- A magnitude 6.1 earthquake on the richter scale struck the eastern coast of Taiwan at 20: 52 on the 26th, with a maximum magnitude of 4.It was the largest earthquake in Taiwan this year.
Comprehensive Central News Agency, Times Electronic newspaper, ETtoday news cloud and other Taiwan media reported that the Taiwan meteorological department reported that the epicenter of the earthquake is located in the southeast of Yilan County government 86.5 kilometers, that is, the eastern sea of Taiwan, the depth of the source of 53 kilometers.
The China Earthquake Network measured the earthquake as a 5.5 magnitude.
The largest earthquake in Taiwan was 4 in Hualien County,3 in Yilan County, Taitung County, Nantou County, Yunlin County, and 1 to 2 in other counties and cities.
Taiwan's meteorological department pointed out that the earthquake is the largest in Taiwan this year, belonging to the plate junction of the hidden belt type earthquake, its epicenter in the past often have earthquakes, this year is also more active.
Aftershocks of magnitude 4 or more are not ruled out in the coming week.
Many people think that driving is something that only those who can see can do.
Blind people want to drive a car alone safely until now, is also considered an impossible task.
Hello everyone, my name is Dennis Hong, and for the freedom and independence of the blind, we have built a car designed for people with visual impairment problems.
Before I talk about this blind car, let me briefly describe another project I've worked on called the U.S. Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Urban Challenge.
It's about making a mechanical car that can drive on its own.
You press the start button, no longer touch anything, it can reach its destination completely automatically.
At the 2007 challenge, our team won 美元 500,000 to take third place in the competition.
Around that time, the National Society for the Blind, or the Society for the Blind, challenged the design team about who could design a car that would allow the blind to drive independently and safely.
We thought we'd try it, because we thought, hey, where's this going to be?
We already have an automatic car.
All we have to do is let the blind drive inside, and that's it, right?
(Laughter) But we were wrong and unreliable.
What the Blind Association wants is not a car that can carry the blind around, but a car that the blind can take the initiative to make a choice and drive.
So we had to give up everything we had and start from scratch.
To test this crazy idea, we designed a prototype of a small sand truck to test its feasibility.
In the summer of 2009, we invited a lot of blind youth across the country and gave them a chance to use the car for a ride.
It's definitely a cool experience.
But the problem with the car is that it is designed to allow blind people to drive in very limited circumstances, like a closed parking lot-even on a path made of red traffic cones.
So with this success, we decided to take the important next step, to build a real car that can travel on a real road.
So how does it work?
Well, it's a relatively complex system, but let me explain it and simplify it.
We have three stages.
We have the induction phase,the computational phase and the non-visual interface.
The driver is obviously invisible, so the system must be able to sense the surrounding environment and collect data for the driver.
In this regard, we use the initial metering element.
It measures acceleration, angular acceleration -- like the human ear, the inner ear.
I combined this information with the global positioning system to predict the location of the vehicle.
We also use two cameras to detect the path of the car.
We also use three laser rangefinder.
The laser scans the environment to detect obstacles -- vehicles passing from the front and back, as well as any obstacles that break into the road, and any obstacles around the vehicle.
All the massive information is then aggregated into the computer, the computer will do two things.
First of all, one thing is to process information to understand the surroundings-which are driving paths and which are obstacles-and to translate that information to the driver.
This system is also very intelligent to calculate the safest driving path.
We can also issue instructions on how to operate the operating procedures of the vehicle.
But the question is: How can we transmit information and instructions quickly and accurately to a blind person to ensure that he can drive?
To this end, we have designed many different non-visual user interface technologies.
The original three-dimensional flat sound system, vibration vests, voice-activated gears, leg straps, and even shoes that put pressure on the feet.
But today we are talking about three of these non-visual user interface technologies.
The first interface is called the driver's handle.
This is a pair of gloves, in the knuckles it has a vibration element, so that you can transmit instructions on how to travel-direction and amplitude.
Another device is called a velocity shock band.
This car chair -- actually, it's a massage chair.
We take it out, we reorganize the vibration elements of different modes. We let them to transmit speed information, but also have instructions on how to use the throttle and brake.
Here you can see how the computer understands its surroundings. Because you can't see the vibration, we actually put a red light-emitting diode on the driver so he can see what's going on.
This is the sensor data, which is transmitted from the sensor to the computer.
So these two devices, the driving handle and the speed shock belt, are very effective.
But the problem is that these are instruction-suggestive devices.
So it's not really freedom, is it?
The computer tells you how to drive -- turn left, turn right, accelerate,brake.
I call this the co-pilot problem.
So we are avoiding the command hint device, and focus more on the information device.
A typical example of such a non-visual information interface is called an empty graph.
Think of this as a display for the blind.
This is a small table top, with a lot of holes on it, compressed air is removed from it, so that it can be described as a picture.
So even if you're blind and you put your hand on it, you can sense the course of action and the obstacles.
In fact, you can also change the frequency of release in the air, and possibly the temperature.
This is actually a multidimensional user interface.
Here, you can see the cameras on the left and right sides and how the COMPUTER parses and transmits this information to the empty map.
In this way, we are showing a simulation program in which a blind man is driving with an empty map.
This app is of great help in training blind drivers and quickly testing different theories based on different kinds of non-visual user interfaces.
That's basically how it works.
But the car is a model car, and it won't hit the road unless it's proven to be as safe to drive as today's cars, or safer to say so.
I really believe this will happen.
But will society, and will they, accept this radical idea?
How will we deal with insurance?
How will we issue a driver's license?
There are many different obstacles behind the technical challenge that we need to address before it really becomes a reality.
Of course, the main purpose of this project is to design a blind-driven car.
But what is potentially more important than that is the enormous value in the byproducts of the project.
A sensor that can be used to see dark, rain and fog.
And with this new kind of interface, we can use these technologies to make them safer for visual people.
Or for the blind, the daily life of the household devices-educational facilities, office facilities application services.
Imagine that in class the teacher writes notes on the blackboard blind students can also use these non-visual interfaces to understand and read what the teacher has written.
This is extremely precious.
Today, what I'm showing you is just the beginning.
Thank you very much.
(Applause）
Marinichev said that the change in value is affected by the devaluation of the ruble and the epidemic, among other things.
“The cost of services is increasing, " he said.
As a result of the epidemic, people began to spend more time on the Internet.”
Marinichev did not rule out that Internet prices will rise sharply in the year, arguing that operators can provide customers with higher speeds and more services to offset people's dissatisfaction with the rise in prices.
"Chinese Doctors" prepares to pay tribute to anti-epidemic heroes-Xinhua
Recently, with the respect of Chinese filmmakers fighting the epidemic heroes, Bona Pictures Group chairman Yu Dong,director Liu Weiqiang (left) in Guangzhou and academician Zhong Nanshan, on the anti-epidemic theme film "Chinese doctors" shooting and production work had a discussion and exchange.
Bona Pictures hopes to use the "Chinese Doctor" to pay tribute to all the medical care and epidemic prevention workers fighting in the front line of epidemic prevention and control!
In 2021, the film will be released nationwide as a tribute to the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.
At present, Bona Pictures, under the arrangement and deployment of the Central Propaganda Department and the State Film Bureau, with the support of the Film Bureau of Guangdong Province and the Film Bureau of Hubei Province, organized the original team of the film "Captain China" to prepare for the film "China Doctor", which is a film reflecting the strong leadership of the party Central Committee, the people of the whole country united to fight the new crown pneumonia epidemic.
The film focuses on the fight against the epidemic in Wuhan. The film will use Wuhan medical staff and the medical teams of provinces and cities as the background of the characters, from the human point of view, using a unique narrative, as well as a very impactful lens language, to show the touching stories of Chinese medical staff who are full of dedication and sacrifice in the fight against the epidemic.
It is understood that the first time on the day of the lifting of Wuhan, Bona Company will overcome many difficulties, sent a team to the scene of the epidemic, and hundreds of medical workers face-to-face exchanges to understand and collect information, has already interviewed including academician Zhong Nanshan himself, the first person in Guangzhou to help Wuhan, Guangdong to help Hubei medical team, as well as Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan Union Hospital, Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan Central Hospital and other front-line white angels, took a large number of precious first-hand video information.
Academician Zhong Nanshan also put forward expectations and hopes for the filming of the film at the symposium: "I am looking forward to it. I hope that you will not only visit some of the more exposed experts, but also interview more medical personnel who are working hard on the front line, most of them."”
He said he had seen "Me and My Motherland" and "Captain China" before and thought it would be a good way to tell the big story from the perspective of ordinary people.
"Now some foreign friends still have some misconceptions about China.”
Speaking about the spread of the film, academician Zhong Nanshan said that at present, some people in foreign countries like to label the virus politicized, he hopes that the film can impress the audience from the perspective of human nature:“ This film in addition to screening in China, it is best to be shown abroad, in a way that both domestic and foreign audiences can understand, with a real human spirit to impress the audience."”
Academician Zhong Nanshan also fondly recalled the film“People to Middle age "in the 1980s." After so many years, I was most impressed with the film after the reform and opening-up is "People to middle age", when doctors and friends outside China were watching and crying, if "Chinese Doctors" can play such a role, it would be great."”
Academician Zhong Nanshan said that if "Chinese Doctors" can resonate with foreign audiences, it would be very successful.
During the discussion, Academician Zhong Nanshan also shared his views and suggestions on the prevention and control of the current international epidemic.”
Academician Zhong Nanshan said that although the virus is difficult to predict, but from the primitive society to the present day, human beings have survived a thousand difficulties and risks,and now modern society has developed medical technology and social management measures, coupled with medical personnel around the world, and even the common people have a basic understanding of the scientific response to the new crown pneumonia epidemic, people will no longer be as passive as before,“the next thing to pay attention to two aspects of work, one is to study how to strengthen cooperation around the world, the second is to pay attention to the comfort of people's hearts”.

Cultural Tourism”Red fruit " gathered in Shaoshan-The first Red Bo meeting in Xiangtan-Today's news-Hunan Daily Network-Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily * New Hunan Client reporter Jiang Rui correspondent Xiao Yan
Jiaxing Red ship mold,Shaoshan Mao Zedong bronze statue, Yan'an cloth Duihua crafts, Xiangxi Yongshun bacon...... July 25, 2020 Hunan Red Tourism and Culture Festival opened in Shaoshan.
As one of the main activities, the first Red Cultural Industry Expo in Xiangtan was carried out in Shaoshan Global Tourism Consulting and Distribution Center.
The exhibition area is full of red cultural and creative products, local products of the revolutionary Old District, attracting tourists from all over the world to buy.
"The Red Expo is not only a display of the achievements of the national red cultural industry, but also an important platform for exhibitors and enterprises to exchange experience and discuss the development path.”
With the theme of“promoting the red culture to boost the warming of the cultural tourism”, the exhibition has a total area of nearly 3,000 square meters, and has set up an atmosphere building area, a scenic exhibition area and a red cultural tourism online shopping experience area.
Invited Zhejiang Jiaxing, Guizhou Zunyi, Shaanxi Yan'an and other 8 provinces and cities, as well as my governor Sha, Zhuzhou, Yueyang, Chenzhou and other places 137 enterprises, units exhibited a total of 768 kinds of exhibits, including red cultural relics, handicrafts, food specialties, tourism routes, red training courses, red cultural and creative products.
The exhibition area will be open until July 29.
As the host of the Red Expo, the Xiangtan exhibition area is full of highlights.
According to the person in charge of the exhibition area, the Xiangtan Exhibition is divided into two parts: red industry and red cultural industry.
The Red Industrial exhibition area exhibits 31 exhibits from 6 enterprises, such as Valin Xianggang, Valin cable and Xiang Electric Power, and nearly 200 products from 27 units, such as red series of books, red series of food and red series of cultural and creative products, are on display in the red cultural Industry Development exhibition area.

At the same time, they invited the national intangible cultural heritage protection project“Anse paper-cutting”,“folk songs of Northern Shaanxi”and the provincial intangible cultural heritage project Yanchuan cloth Dui painting inheritors, focusing on promoting Yan'an folk characteristics of products, and took the opportunity to communicate with other exhibition units and enterprises, promote cross-regional cooperation.
More than 30,000 Confirmed cases of New crown in Japan-Xinhua
According to statistics, there were 239 new confirmed cases in Tokyo on the 26th, more than 200 new cases in a single day for six consecutive days, and a total of 11,214 cases have been recorded.
In addition, there were 141 new confirmed cases in Osaka Prefecture, 90 in Fukuoka Prefecture and 80 in Aichi Prefecture.
Telecom network fraud crimes rose 70% in the first half of the year -- New York, March 15, 2013 / Prnewswire / --
Beijing, July 26, according to the highest prosecution website news, in the first half of this year, the national procuratorial organs prosecuted a total of 58,101 fraud crimes, an increase of 35% year-on-year.
In particular, among the crimes that hinder the prevention and control of the epidemic, fraud crimes are frequent, and the number of fraud crimes prosecuted by the procuratorial organs accounts for 43.4 percent of the total number of crimes that hinder the prevention and control of the epidemic.
The Supreme People's Procuratorate has carried out targeted guidance.Of the 10 typical cases of epidemic prevention and control that have been issued, there are nine cases involving the crime of fraud.
From the case-handling situation of the procuratorial organs in the first half of the year, the number of crimes involving fraud ranged from the macro-policy of the state to the people's clothing, food and housing, including fraud involving the epidemic epidemic,“medical trust”fraud,“health care products”fraud,“enrollment intermediary”fraud,“routine loan”fraud, fraud against state subsidies, national assets thawing fraud, etc., and constantly“introduced new innovations”, covering education, medical care, employment, old-age pension, social security, land acquisition and demolition, precise poverty alleviation, financial credit and other fields, not only causing economic losses to the victims, but also seriously affecting economic and social development.
In particular, some telecommunications network scams break through the limits of national borders, regions and personnel, with stakeholders, cross-border, remote, electronic payment and other characteristics, do not specify the number of victims of the group, the harm is great.
For example, some set up special companies, rent high-end office buildings, set up multiple departments or positions, the use of legal network platform publicity, recruitment, training and assessment of recruiters, the use of enterprise mode of operation management, wearing a“legitimate coat”, more confusing.
It is the duty of the procuratorial organs to punish and prevent crimes according to law, and to issue early warning to the public and relevant departments in a timely manner.
In handling judicial cases, procuratorial organs conscientiously perform their duties, not only insisting on maintaining a high-pressure situation against fraud crimes, but also refining various law enforcement measures in a targeted manner, and promoting social governance through the formulation and issuance of procuratorial recommendations.
The procuratorial organs strictly control the facts, evidence, procedures and the application of law in the arrest and prosecution of fraud cases, taking the facts as the basis and the law as the criterion, so as to be worthy of the task.
Especially for telecommunications network fraud crime, pay attention to the core role of electronic data in the identification of facts, and strive to build a chain of evidence between electronic data, verbal evidence, documentary evidence to confirm each other.
For example, the Procuratorate of Yinzhou District, Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, handled a case of epidemic-related fraud, the procuratorate first intervened in advance, from the occurrence of the case to the completion of only 5 days, reflecting the attitude and determination to handle quickly and strictly, to maintain the overall stability of the society.
In the process of examining arrests and prosecuting prosecutions, attention has been paid to the work of prosecuting missing criminals in cases, and the public security organs have corrected 733 missing persons and 1,113 co-offenders who have been omitted by the public security organs to examine and prosecute cases.
In the first half of the year, procuratorial organs throughout the country issued 298 procuratorial recommendations on fraud crimes, promoting joint efforts to prevent fraud crimes and promote deep-level governance.
For example, in view of the loopholes found in the supervision of telecommunications networks, such as communications enterprises, banks and intermediary organizations, the Guangzhou Procuratorate and the Dongguan Procuratorate of Guangdong Province put forward timely procuratorial recommendations, urging the relevant units to strengthen supervision and improve the mechanism, so as to promote the construction of long-term systems.
Fourth, to do a good job in the recovery and damage.
Procuratorial organs around the country seize important links such as intervening in investigation, guiding evidence collection, examining and prosecuting, and urge the investigation organs to actively recover the stolen money, cooperate with the relevant departments to do a good job in the recovery and damage of the stolen money, and strive to minimize the economic losses caused by fraud and crime to the people.
In the case where the real estate may be disposed of first in other cases, the first "letter of suspension of execution" shall be issued and served to the relevant courts in a timely manner. It is recommended that the previously sealed court suspend the execution of the real estate involved in the case until the facts of the crime are ascertained, so as to make the best efforts to recover the real estate involved in the case and recover the losses of the victims.
Prosecutors remind everyone to be very vigilant about fraud crimes, do not expect“pie in the sky”, do not think cheap credulity, keep their“money bag”.
Pinna Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province: Dwarf apple trees widen the road to poverty alleviation-<url>
2020-07-26 11:42: 58 Source: China Economic Network Author: Zhu Yanjing Editor: Zhu Yanjing
Hot heat, economic Daily-China Economic network reporter into Guizhou Province Weining County, the town of the town in the sea village.
In the hot sun, Li Yuanzhong, a villager, weeded grass in the base. Although his face was red, he hummed a few songs in his mouth from time to time.
Weining County, where the town is located, because of the low latitude,high altitude, plenty of light, large temperature difference between day and night, the apple produced high sugar content, good taste, has a certain popularity in the surrounding area, but also because of the small size, spots, has not been able to sell a good price, failed to form an industrial scale.
Pinna Town was once a”Baogu potato spring and autumn " poor township, 10 years ago the local poverty rate was as high as 25.8%.
It is urgent to change the traditional planting habits, adjust the industrial structure and increase the income of farmers in the critical period of poverty alleviation and decisive victory.
Chen Chao, party secretary of the town, and a group of people in the town, after many visits, believe that the industrial development can no longer go the old way.
To this end, the town of Pinna introduced leading enterprises, in a modern way to grow apples.
Hou Jianwen, deputy general manager of Weining Chaoyue Agriculture Co., Ltd., came to the town from Shaanxi Province in 2015 to investigate, and looked at the local planting conditions at a glance, and began to plant apple trees locally in 2016.
At first, the village mobilized Li Yuanzhong to transfer the land out to plant apple trees. Li Yuanzhong and his wife muttered: "After planting apples for so many years, they did not see who planted apples in the village and made a fortune."”
"All apples are dwarf apples that do not make the apple tree grow too tall.”
What Li Yuanzhong did not expect was that this apple planting adopted a new method,irrigation pipes spread under each apple tree,water and fertilizer poured together to the roots of the tree,when the fruit is collected in the autumn, the tractor directly into the orchard, standing can pick fruit.
At present, the Apple base has gradually entered the period of abundant production, the market is also as expected by Hou Jianwen, Apple does not worry about selling, loved by Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other urban consumers.
The growing apple industry has made a new change in Li Yuanzhong's life. Although he is still farming, he has a new source of income.
The Li Yuanzhong family has more than 9 acres of land transferred to the apple base. Each year, in addition to the guaranteed land transfer fee, there is a profit dividend after hanging the fruit. The couple usually work in the base,“a person can get 80 yuan a day, and have work all year round.”
Li Yuan advised reporters that last year the profit dividend received more than 2,800 yuan, plus land transfer fees and the couple's income from migrant workers, a family income of more than 80,000 yuan,“eat and wear do not worry, well-off days have passed.”
The annual output value of 1 mu apple is more than 15,000 yuan, which is about 10 times that of maize.”
Chen Chao told reporters that the whole town is currently planting 20,000 acres of apples, only in the sea village there are 6,000 acres, covering 4,056 households, 17,200 farmers, including 656 households, 2,952 people, a year salary of more than 6 million yuan, really realized the base is built in front of the door, do not have to go out to work.
Li Yuanzhong, who is growing up in the fanny pack, also began to realize his "wish".
This year's Lunar New Year, Li Yuanzhong bought an off-road vehicle,and now drives a car to and from work every day.“There are more than a dozen acres of land in the family, and when the next step is to expand the scale of the Apple base, all of them will be transferred to them, and the income will be more."”

Membrane separation technology helps crack the " greenhouse effect”
Schematic diagram of new mixed substrate membrane preparation technology
Today, the atmospheric environment and bioenergy team of Tianjin University has made significant progress in the“membrane separation method to capture carbon dioxide " and successfully developed a new hybrid substrate membrane preparation technology to significantly improve the carbon dioxide capture performance of membrane materials.
Related results have been published as the cover article of the international journal "Greenhouse Gases: Science and Technology".
The "greenhouse effect“is a major environmental problem plaguing human development, and carbon dioxide emissions are the culprit of the”greenhouse effect".
How to efficiently capture and use the carbon dioxide emitted by humans is the focus of scientists ' attention.
"Membrane separation method" is a new carbon dioxide capture technology, it separates carbon dioxide gas with the help of membrane materials, with high efficiency and energy saving, simple operation.
How to make the membrane material "deep breath", improve the efficiency of gas separation, is the use of membrane separation method to capture carbon dioxide bottleneck difficulties.
Through repeated experiments, the research team of Tianjin University explored the influence of different solvents on the separation properties of membrane gas.
Experimental results show that N-methylpyrrolidone as the preparation solvent, the resulting membrane material carbon nanotubes are more uniform distribution“ "more breathable", effectively enhance the membrane material gas separation efficiency and rate.
The carbon dioxide separation performance of the mixed substrate membrane prepared by this new technology is close to the theoretical separation limit of such membrane materials.
"The new technology provides new ideas for the capture of carbon dioxide by membrane separation.”
Li Run, a member of the atmospheric environment and bioenergy team at Tianjin University, said:“ We hope that this technology will provide strong support for the treatment of flue gas in future coal-fired power plants and chemical companies, and play a significant role in controlling greenhouse gas emissions.”
What is a professional grade difference before volunteering to fill in the report-<url>
2020-07-27 02: 22: 36 Source: Chongqing Morning Post Author: Yu Xiao Editor: Yu Xiao
Before you volunteer, figure out what a professional difference is.
Every year, there are students or parents who do not understand the terms involved in the volunteer application, and thus affect the volunteer application.
This year, Beijing Jiaotong University,Beijing University of Science and Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, five universities jointly issued the 2020 enrollment policy, eliminating the professional grade difference.
What is the meaning of professional grade difference,and what is the significance of voluntary filing?
There are three ways of professional assignment rules
Experts remind, before filling in the volunteer, be sure to read the "admissions charter" of your favorite school, understand the admission rules of colleges and universities, including the ratio of adjustment, professional allocation rules and so on.
Professional allocation rules, refers to the college after the shift, for the major admission there are three major priority, score priority, professional grade difference.
The specific method used by colleges and universities will be clear in the "Admissions Charter".
But there are also some colleges and universities admission principle is the overall score priority,there is no difference between the major.
When the score does not reach the first professional volunteer admission score line, then see whether to reach the second professional volunteer admission score line, and so on until the admission to the last professional volunteer, there is no difference between the professional volunteers.
The so-called”professional grade difference“is when colleges and universities arrange candidates for majors, according to one or more of the score values published in the admissions regulations, to determine the admission of candidates for different professional voluntary candidates, this score value is”professional grade difference".
That is, the difference between the scores of the institutions in the admission of candidates in the first professional volunteer and non-first professional volunteer, the difference between the professional volunteer scores, such as 3 points, 2 points, 1 point and so on.
For example.
Suppose the student Xiaoming reported A university, the test of 560 points, their professional volunteers are: computer, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering,e-commerce, A university's professional admission practice professional grade difference method, the difference is divided into 2 points, 1 point, 1 point, 0 points.
If the computer is not accepted, then his score will be subtracted by 2 points, according to the score of 558 points and the first professional volunteer to apply for“international trade”candidates, to determine whether the professional admission requirements are met; if still not met, the score is subtracted by 1 point(i.e. 557 points)for the third professional volunteer“automated”admission; if still not met, the score is subtracted by 1 point(i.e. 556 points)for the fourth professional volunteer“automated”admission If the subsequent major is still unable to meet its professional volunteers, it will no longer reduce the points, and so on.
Different university professional grade difference settings are different
With the popularity of parallel volunteering, many colleges and universities have canceled the professional grade difference, but some colleges and universities still retain this method this year, from the "admissions charter" published by the schools, this year there are mainly more than 20 universities set the professional grade difference.
For example, Sichuan Agricultural University,Shandong University of Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Jiangxi Normal University, Chengdu Medical College, Northeast Electric Power University, Jimei University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing University of Technology, Ningxia University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, China Civil Aviation Flight College, etc.
In these colleges and universities, each university set a different professional grade difference.
Some colleges and universities have a grade difference in each major, such as Ningxia University. Candidates who have been submitted to the university in the file are admitted according to the order in which candidates fill in the professional volunteers and then decrement by 1 point in order to be admitted according to the score.
And some universities have set up different professional grades between different majors.
For example, Jimei University, professional volunteer grade difference is 4 points, that is, the difference between the first professional volunteer and other professional volunteer grade is 3 points, there is no difference between other professional volunteers, regarded as parallel volunteers, other professional volunteers and transfer professional volunteers professional grade difference is 1 point.
When filling out the volunteer application, candidates and parents must carefully read the admission policy of the school to see if there is a professional grade difference and what is the form of the grade difference. While taking full account of the scores, they should also rationally analyze the proposed school and major. If institutions explicitly adopt the grade difference method for admission in the admissions charter, candidates should pay attention to the gradient between the majors and improve the chances of admission.
