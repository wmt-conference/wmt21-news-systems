Xinhua Commentary: Make Outstanding Returning Peasant Workers into Rural Revitalizing Force - Xinhua
Rural revitalization, talent is the key.
Where to find Talent?
Outstanding groups of migrant migrant workers are indispensable forces.
Xinhua News Agency Fashang Hai Chun
Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 26: Make outstanding returning migrant workers into villages to revitalize the army
This year, 34-year-old Zhang Xiongjia was in the Orchard Village of Meishan City, Sichuan. In 2010 he quit Beijing's monthly salary of tens of thousands of jobs to go home.
After several years of hard work, now he operates a wine-growing family farm with an annual income of more than one million yuan, becoming a small famous leader in getting rich, and has been selected to enter the village “two committees” team.
In recent years, under the encouragement of a series of pro-agricultural policies such as national poverty alleviation, rural revitalization and other incentives, more and more outstanding migrant workers like Zhang Xiong have chosen to go back to their homes to start business and activate a pool of spring water in the countryside.
Sichuan, a major province of western China's population and labor export province, because of snob guided implementation of “excellent migrant workers back training project”. In 2019 alone, more than 8,000 village party branch secretaries were generated from the outstanding migrant workers cited, cultivating 61,000 village reserve forces, development party members more than 20,000, to win the fight against poverty and fight against poverty. The implementation of the Village Revitalization Strategy provides a strong guarantee.
Well-not well, the key to see the fellow.
Since the reform and opening up, a large number of young and young laborers in China's rural areas have increased their income, and some have created their own businesses through hard work.
However, objectively, it has also led to the emergence of “hollowization” in rural areas to varying degrees. In particular, rural grass-roots organizations have weakened, and village party branch secretaries and party members both show a “old and low” feature, namely, aging age and low education, and the lack of strong leadership of village party organizations, and the lack of green and yellow problems.
If factors such as rural talent have been flowing unidirectional to cities, and the countryside is in a state of “blood loss” and “anaemia” for a long time, revitalization is an empty word.
To attract those migrant workers who have the ability, consciousness, and aspire to serve their hometown, guide them to return to their home businesses to become rich leaders, from which they are cultivated into party members and rural cadres, and enrich grass-roots cadres. This is a cure policy for solving the problems of rural party members and grass-roots party organizations.
Excellent migrant workers are brought back, and they must also keep them and do well.
In recent years, starting with the establishment of the Peasant Labour Party, Sichuan, on the basis of strict criteria for candidates, has set up institutional mechanisms such as targeted return, service guarantee, training, and use of training, enabling them to improve their abilities, have security at work, and have prospects for their lives, and truly take root in rural areas. Officers have a sense of achievement in entrepreneurship.
This year is the year of the end of the battle against poverty, and the linkage between poverty and the revitalization of the countryside. Talent is the key factor.
Party committees and governments at all levels should attach great importance to the group of outstanding returning migrant workers, and through comprehensive measures, they will be built into a task force that can fight and take without taking away, providing strong organizational security and talent support for rural poverty alleviation and development and revitalization.
Because of the epidemic, this year's university graduates is a very special session, on the evening of July 11, bilibili summer graduation song for the graduates bring a special live performance, wolf, park shu, Li Yuchun, Mao and other musicians send singing and blessing to the new graduates.
The well-known up master SealWu Yifan also brought a “wild grass”, a rapper style song that he created based on Lu Xun's episode of prose poems, extremely popular among young people.
As a result of the epidemic, many graduates did not experience the sense of ceremony of the spot, and they transferred the sense of ritual to the line.
Data show that the 2.5-hour song, live popularity peaked over 35 million.
“Follow your heart, seize the opportunity, regardless of the consequences, sometimes there will be unexpected gains.”
Although it is a graduation song, many songs also touched non-recent graduates.
“Look down really want to cry, whoever's youth are full of beauty and regret, but are worth remembering, have to go brave.”
Beijing natural ecology continues to attract more than 500 species of wildlife city “settlement” - Chinane.com

The capital's natural ecology continues to attract wildlife city “settlement”
More than 500 species of wildlife in Beijing
This newspaper (Reporter Wang Bin) The Beijing Youth Daily reporter learned from the Municipal Landscaping Bureau that in recent years as the natural ecological environment of the capital continues to improve, the species and number of wild animals have continued to increase.
At present, the number of terrestrial spine wildlife inhabited in Beijing has increased to more than 500 species, including brown horse chicken, black stork and other national protection animals at the national level, such as plaque, swan, gray crane and mandarin duck.
Whether it's a city forest in the second ring, or a tiny wetland embedded between buildings, not only brings nature to the capital's citizens, but also attracts wildlife to “settle” in the city.
In the middle of summer, Songshan National Nature Reserve is located in the Yanshan Mountains in the northwest of Yanqing District.
A raccoon plays leisurely beside the mountain stream, and two dog badgers beat each other.
Looking back, a wild boar can not help the body “thickling”, is rubbing the bark. By the end of 2019, the green sea with a total area of more than 6,200 hectares was living in 178 species of wild animals, including national conservation gold carving and national secondary protection animal spoon chicken, plaque, nearly one-third of the city's wildlife,” said Hu Qiaoli, director of Songshan National Nature Reserve Management Office All kinds can see traces here.
“In Matsuyama, wildlife is the real 'owner', and our staff can only be the bodyguard at best.”
Hu Qiaoli said that in order to understand the wildlife situation in the protected area, more than 30 professional patrols every day patrol along 16 carefully crafted protection routes, and there will be a “big circle” every month, taking a whole day to almost the entire reserve.
“During the inspection, not only to check the recording of biodiversity, but also the installation of artificial bird nests, rescue injured wildlife, installation of field infrared cameras, and so on.”
More than 200 infrared cameras have been installed in the Songshan National Nature Reserve to record the living conditions of wildlife in the forest.
Hu Qiaoli explained that with the abundance of biodiversity in the reserve over the years, more and more wild animals appear in the camera, leopard cats, raccoons and pig badgers have become “resident guests”, and the “mirror rate” of national secondary protection animal springaurus is getting higher and higher.
Zhang Zhiming, Director of Wildlife and Wetland Conservation Department of Beijing Municipal Bureau of Landscaping Bureau, said that Beijing's terrestrial spine wildlife has increased from 461 species in 1994 to more than 500 species now.
The growing number of wildlife in cities is closely related to the upgrading of urban greenery in the capital in recent years.
In particular, the new round of millionacre afforestation, which began in 2018, proposes to reinvent the urban ecological environment, enhance the ecological function of woodland greenery and highlight the concept of “near-nature”.
Planning aims to interconnect with the surrounding green areas, facilitate wildlife “visit friends and family”, planted trees are also animal favorite honey, food plants.
I am committed to helping computers communicate with the world around us.
There are many ways to do this, and I like to focus on assisting computers to talk about what they see and understand.
Given such a scenario, a modern computer vision algorithm that can tell you that there is a woman and a dog.
It can tell you that woman is smiling.
It can even tell you that this dog is very cute.
I deal with this question and think about how humanity understands and coexistence with the world.
Those thoughts, memories, and stories in such scenes may arouse human attention.
Interlinkages of all connected situations.
Maybe you've seen such dogs before, or you've ever spent time running on such a beach and further evoking memories and ideas of past holidays, previously spent time running with other dogs, running around with other dogs.
One of my guiding principles is that by helping computers understand what kind of experience this is, in order to understand what we believe and feel in common, then we have the ability to start developing computer technology in a way that complements our experience.
So digging deeper into this, I started working a few years ago to help computers produce human-like stories from image sequences.
So, one day, when I was working on a computer, asked it about my trip to Australia.
It looked at the picture and saw a tree bag bear.
It doesn't know what a tree Wombat is, but the computer says it thinks the tree Wombat looks very interesting creatures.
Then I shared with the computer a series of images about the house burned down.
The computer looked at the picture, and it said, “This is an amazing landscape! It's spectacular!”
It chills my spine back.
The computer sees a terrible, life-changing and life-destroying event and considers it a positive thing.
I realized that the computer recognized the contrast between red and yellow and thought it was something worthy of positive evaluation.
Part of the reason is because the majority of my input computer are positive images.
That's because people tend to share positive images when they talk about their experiences.
When was the last time you saw a selfie at the funeral?
I realized that in the process of improving AI, it was the task of the task, datasets grouped into datasets, creating huge gaps, flaws and blind spots in the understanding of computers.
While doing this, I'm coding for various biases.
Prejudice reflects a limited view, stems from a data set — which reflects the same human being, such as stereotypes and stereotypes.
I think back on that technological development that brought me to the point where I was that day — the first color image was calibrated for the color of the skin of a white woman, which means color photography deviates from the black face.
And the same deviation, that blind spot continued into the 90s.
Even today, the same blind spots still exist in the application of facial recognition technology, how to identify different people's faces.
In today's research, I think of the most advanced technologies that tend to limit our ideas to one dataset and one problem.
By doing so, we are creating more blind spots and biases that will be amplified further when using artificial intelligence.
And then I realized that we had to reflect on how we invented the creation technology today, five to ten years later.
In the interaction between humans and the environment, humans use time to correct problems, so evolution is slow.
Artificial intelligence, in contrast, is evolving at an incredible rate.
That means it really matters, and we need to think about it now — to reflect on our own blind spots and biases, and how they affect the technology we create now, and discuss today's technology, what it means for the future.
CEOs and scientists, have weighed their thoughts about the future of AI development.
“Artificial intelligence will kill humans,” warned Stephen Hawking.
Elon Musk warned that this is an existent risk and one of the greatest risks we face as a civilized society.
“I don't understand why people are less worried about AI,” says Bill Gates.
But these views — are just a part of the story.
That mathematics, models, the basic components of these artificial intelligence, are what we can all get and use.
We have source code tools that are open to the public to learn machines and make our own contributions at the same time.
In addition to that, we can also share our experience.
We can share the place in terms of technology and its relationship with us, and how we can enliven us.
We can discuss what we love.
We can communicate with the foreseeable future, which may be more beneficial in terms of technology, or more problems may arise over time.
If we are all focused on opening up the discussion on AI to the future, it will help create a regular conversation and awareness about what is AI? What can it be? And all we need to do to achieve the results that best suits us.
We've seen and understood this in the technology used today.
We use smartphones, digital assistants and automatic vacuum cleaners.
Are they evil?
Maybe sometimes.
Are they beneficial?
Yes, they are too.
They are not exactly the same.
There you have seen the light of the future.
The future will continue to start with what we build and create now.
We launched the domino effect, which unveiled the path of evolution of artificial intelligence
In our time, artificial intelligence is shaping tomorrow.
so that we can immerse ourselves in augmented reality, revive the world of the past,
When people have difficulty communicating, technology helps them share each other's experiences.
Technology built on online visual media can be used in autonomous vehicle driving.
Technology generates language based on image understanding and can evolve into technology that helps people with visual impairment to better own the visual world.
We also see how technology is causing some problems.
We have technology today to analyze the physical characteristics of our birth — like the color of our skin or the expression on our faces to determine if we are criminals or terrorists.
We have the technology to process data that processes data about gender or race to determine if we have access to a loan.
Everything we see now, is just a snapshot of the evolution of artificial intelligence.
Because where we are now, it is a moment of evolution.
This means that what we do now will affect the future of things and extend to the world of the future.
If we want artificial intelligence to help humanity to develop, we need to define strategies and goals, and start that path right away.
What I want to see is the direction that suits the culture and the environment.
Technology helps us cure patients with neurological diseases or other disabilities, making life as challenging as everyone.
The operation of technology does not take into account your characteristics or skin color.
My focus today is technology tomorrow and ten years later.
Artificial intelligence can come up in many different ways.
But in this case, it is not a driverless car without any destination.
This is a car that we can drive at the same time.
We choose when to accelerate and when to slow down.
We choose whether we need a turn.
We choose what artificial intelligence will be of the future.
There will be a vast arena. Allow artificial intelligence to be everything.
It turns into a lot of different things.
It's up to us to figure out what needs to be implemented to ensure that the result of artificial intelligence is better for all humans.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Black Land “Seed” Out of Agriculture Modernization - Xinhuan.com
Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 26th Telegram: Black Land “Seed” Out of Agriculture Modernization
In the midsummer, two spraying agent aircraft from the second operation station of Friendship Farm Fifth Management Zone 2 mu high-yielding demonstration fields, forming two white lines, green fields with black rice seedlings out of the “world first” several big characters are particularly striking.
Kong Lingqiang, the station director of the station, said that this aircraft can spray agents on more than 6,000 acres of arable land a day, about 8 times more efficient than drones, hundreds of times the manual.
This farm is located in the territory of Youyi County, Heilongjiang Province, China's first grain-producing province. From the sound of cut rice in the past to the motor sound of today, the traditional Chinese farming and farm transform on this black soil belt.
In addition to aircraft, satellites are also used in the modern agricultural production of Friendship Farms.
Kong Lingqiang explained that, on the one hand, they use satellite remote sensing technology to achieve accurate fertilization, reduce agricultural inputs and reduce pollution. On the other hand, satellite navigation technology can improve the level of standardization of farm machinery field operations.
During this year's rice production, the farm expanded the operating area of satellite-based unmanned rice transplanting technology from 3,000 acres last year to 30,000 acres.
This technology makes seedlings more uniform, maximizes the use of sunlight and arable land resources, and saves 16 yuan of labor costs per mu.
The farm tried new technologies such as informatization and intelligence in agricultural production, forming the largest agricultural machinery group in China from the ground to the sky.
According to statistics, the total farm farm ownership capacity of 49,000 units (pieces), field comprehensive mechanization rate of 99.8%.
Agricultural machinery operation to achieve GPS satellite navigation 100%, dry field precision seeding 100%, dry field horsepower Locomotive operation 100%.
“Green agriculture, smart agriculture, digital agriculture are the way to modernize agriculture.”
Friendship Farm Director Liu Hua-lian said.
The key to modernization of agriculture lies in scientific and technological progress.
Agricultural reclamation in Heilongjiang, represented by farms, has played a leading role in modern large agriculture “aircraft carrier” demonstration and leading role, initially establishing a modern agricultural industrial system led by large-scale planting, standardized production and industrialization management.
On the outskirts of Youyi County, there is an area of 350,000 square meters of agricultural machinery exhibition park.
Here, more than 140 (pieces) agricultural tools have been introduced and used in Heilongjiang agricultural reclamation over the years.
These agricultural tools and farms witness the modernization of our country's agricultural development.

French Nantes Church Fire: parish volunteers admit that arson is usual and unspoken - Chinese.com
Chinane.com, July 26 - According to foreign media reports, on July 18, the treasures of religious historical buildings in Nantes, France, and the famous Cathedral of St. Peter and Saint Paul, were severely damaged in a fire, and the large pipe organ was completely destroyed.
On the 26th local time, Nantes prosecutor announced that a parish volunteer in charge of defending the cathedral has been charged for “arson destruction”.
He has admitted that it was himself ignited in the church.
According to the report, local prosecutor Senas said the 39-year-old parish volunteer from Rwanda admitted that he ignited three places in the cathedral at night.
For his part, his lawyer said that the arsonists now regretted doing such things.
A few years ago, he entered France by means of refuge, where he was sheltered in the parish in the area of the fire and received in the church.
The prosecution stated that he had recently attempted to renew his visa and was communicating with the police station on this issue.
But the church said that he still could not believe that the usual very kind, smiling believer, but not speaking much, would destroy the church he loved so much.
On the day of the fire on July 18, the volunteer had been questioned by the police for reasons of logic in the narrative, but he was later released.
Firefighters rescue at the scene.
On the evening of the 25th, he was summoned again as a professional engineer at the Paris Central Police Laboratory obtained new evidence.
This time, the man confessed to his act of arson.
It was reported that the suspect could face 10 years' imprisonment and a fine of 150,000 euros if the offence of intentional arson and destruction was found.
The fire caused serious damage to St. Pierre and St. Paul's Cathedral, the organ inside the church was completely burned, and the stained glass windows behind the organ were also badly damaged, the report said.
Brunet, the chief architect of the French historical preservation building, conservative estimates that the restoration of Nantes Cathedral will take at least three years.
Comprehensive News: US Unilateralism Sabotage Relations Between the Two Countries, International Public Opinion Support of China's Reaction Against the US - Xinhuan.com
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 - Xinhua News Agency reporters abroad reported: On the morning of July 24, the Chinese Foreign Ministry informed the US embassy in China that the Chinese side decided to revoke the authorization for the establishment and operation of the US Consulate General in Chengdu and put specific demands on the consulate-general to stop all operations and activities.
International public opinion believes that the unilateralist measures taken by the United States cause serious distress to Sino-US relations, and that China responds to unjustifiably provocations by the US side, and that it is legitimate and necessary to take countermeasures.
Andrés Borquez, director of the Center for Chinese Studies at the University of Chile Institute of International Studies, said that the unilateralist measures of the United States had destroyed bridges of understanding between the two peoples and caused a crisis in relations between the two major Powers.
China has informed the US that the closure of its consulate general in Chengdu is a counteract to the unilateral measures of the United States and is in keeping with diplomatic practice.
Patricio Giusto, a professor at the Catholic University of Argentina and director of the ACC Research Center, believes that the above Chinese decision is a legitimate and necessary countermeasure against the United States earlier provocation, not against ordinary American citizens.
The US tries to divert the attention of the American population by pressuring China to hide its lack of response to COVID-19.
Bambang Sulyono, Chairman of the Asian Innovation Research Center of Indonesia think tank, said that the United States has taken a provocative diplomatic gesture, causing serious problems to Sino-US relations and facing serious challenges.
China's notification that the closure of its Consulate General in Chengdu is a normal countermeasure, conforms to diplomatic practice, and reflects both China's principled position that firmly defends its own interests, and reflects the reasonable and beneficial nature of Chinese diplomacy.
Tanzanian current affairs commentator Francis Semwinza said China's decision was a legitimate and necessary response to US provocations.
Sino-US relations should return to normal. The US side should take the initiative to improve its relations with China and stop interfering in China's internal affairs.
The US should focus on how to achieve economic and political win-win with China, and how to benefit the people of both countries and the international community as a whole.
Ali Yusuf, Executive Director of the Federation of Arab-China Friendship Associations, headquartered in the Sudan, said that the countermeasures that China had been forced to take were a legitimate and necessary response to the unjustified actions of the United States, in accordance with international law and the basic norms of international relations, and in accordance with diplomatic practice.
Earlier, the US demand for the closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston was a serious violation of international law and the basic norms of international relations.
He hoped that the United States would rescind its previous decision and create the necessary conditions for the return of relations between the two countries to normal.
Singapore's United Morning Post editorial said that America's greater strategic intention is to siege China and prevent China from continuing to rise.
Faced with the urgency of the US, although China is very reluctant to see Sino-US relations continue to deteriorate, it has to take countermeasures.

Hurricane “Hannah” landed in USA or triggered river floods and floods - Chinese.com
Chinanews, July 26 - Comprehensive foreign media reports that hurricane “Hannah” landed in Texas, USA at 5:00pm local time on 25th, will bring strong storms to Texas, river water surge, may also trigger life-threatening torrents.
The National Hurricane Center said Hurricane Hannah is expected to take torrential rains, sweep over parts of southern and northeastern states, or cause some streams to rise and life-threatening flash floods.
The report said hurricane “Hannah” was most affected by the city of Corpus Christi south to the estuary of the Grande River, while the Rio Grande Valley could erupt a large flood.
“Any hurricane is a huge challenge,” said Texas Governor Abbot on the 25th.
There are 32 counties in the state that have entered a disaster emergency as a result of hurricanes.
The city of Corpus Christi, a city with a population of over 320,000, has closed its libraries and museums.
Abbot also said that the hurricane can no longer cause more casualties in Texas as it is hit by COVID-19.
Precipitation in southern Texas is expected to reach 6 to 12 inches on the night of 26th, with 3 to 5 inches in northern Texas and the coast of Louisiana, reportedly.
Hannah was formed earlier than the previous Atlantic hurricane season due to factors such as global warming.
In general, the first hurricane in the Atlantic usually takes place until mid-August.
Poland to withdraw from European treaty on the prevention of violence against women
Poland will take steps next week to withdraw from the European Treaty on the Prevention of Violence against Women, the Polish Ministry of Justice said on Saturday.
Poland's right-wing government cabinet said the treaty required schools to teach students about gender issues, violating the rights of parents.
Polish Justice Minister Giablo held a press conference saying that his Ministry of Justice on Monday would submit a request to the Ministry of Labour and Family to start withdrawing from the treaty.
That treaty is also known as the Istanbul Convention.
“The treaty contains elements of an ideological nature that we consider to be harmful,” says Joblo.
Poland's ruling Law and Justice Party and its governing coalition partners have close alliances with the Roman Catholic Church to promote a conservative social agenda.
Polish President Dudda made hostility to gay rights one of the main topics during this month's successful re-election campaign.
On Friday, thousands of Poles, most of them women, held protests against withdrawal from the Convention in Warsaw and a number of other cities.
One of the organizers of the protest, Lempat, said in a protest march in Warsaw that “the purpose of withdrawal from the treaty is to legalize domestic violence.”
Some protesters held banners saying “The Law and Justice Party is the hell of women”.
The Law and Justice Party has long complained about the Istanbul Convention.
Poland's former central government ratified the Convention in 2015.
The Government of the Law and Justice Party stated that the treaty did not respect religion and called for liberal social policies to be taught in schools.
To date, however, the party has not decided to withdraw from the Convention.

Upgraded Russian helicopter gunships card - 52M first factory at the end of the year - Xinhuan.com
Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 25 - According to the plan of the Russian Defense Ministry, the upgraded version of the Russian gunship helicopter (hereinafter called Wudai) Ka-52M will be completed in December this year for the first time and factory, the model will have a big improvement in reconnaissance, communications and weapon performance.
According to the report of the Russian newspaper News a few days ago, Vuzhika-52M is called “super alligator”. Its development contract was signed last April by the Russian military and military units. Currently, the first batch of two upgraded Vuzheng is undergoing renovation at the Far East Helicopter Factory of Russian “Progressive” Aerospace Group Company. The completion of national testing and improvements will be completed by October 2022.
According to the Russian experts who understand the above upgrade work, “super alligator” “senior” - - Vuzhika-52 was officially listed in November 2011, the model exposed some weaknesses in use, the transformation and upgrade is to “fill the board”.
Reports say that the card -52M will partially adopt new protective material that does not add weight, its pilot cockpit will be reinforced, equipped with new equipment to withstand missile attacks, thereby increasing the battlefield survival probability; assemble more power generators for more complex airborne electronics Power supply; photoelectric system upgrade, able to reconnaissance, identify farther field targets; equipped with main attack armored combat vehicles and reinforced concrete fortifications, with a range of 20 km, approximately 1 times the range of similar missiles used in active force in Russia; and its defensive weapons and communications equipment will be used to the maximum extent possible with the Mi-28NM helicopter gunship capable of attacking air targets, thus maintaining the relevant maintenance It becomes simple and economical.
In addition, CAR-52M will have more advanced electronic guidance systems, weapon targeting systems and navigation equipment.
Russian experts also said it is worth noting that the Ka-52M will be equipped with communication equipment to link with the drones, thus obtaining real-time information on nearby drones transmitted in the air, such as showing images taken by drone on the cockpit screen of the helicopter.
It is planned that Ka-52M pilots can directly control the drone they work with, thereby improving the pilot's mastery of the battlefield situation and the guidance of long-range missiles.
According to Russian media reports, Russian Defense Minister Krivoruchko said last December that the Russian Ministry of Defense plans to buy more than 110 Vuchika-52M by 2027.

Hebei River Lake Ecological Water Replenishing 1.75 billion cubic meters since this year - Chinane.com
Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, July 26 (Reporter Wang Kun) - The reporter learned from the Hebei Provincial Water Conservancy Department that since this year, Hebei Province has coordinated the use of the water of the river and local reservoir water, and has implemented ecological hydration to 28 rivers and Baiyangdian, including the Tuo River, Tang River, and Juma River. Cubic meters.
Hebei Province tightly seizes the favorable opportunity of the project to increase the flow of water flow and implement ecological water replenishment to the Tanghe, Shahe and Zhulong rivers, and other rivers.
At the same time, nine large and medium-sized reservoirs, including the Western Ocean, Tobu Shi and Baiyangdian, were used to rehydrate the Xiangyang River and Qinglong rivers, forming a cumulative water surface area of more than 90 square kilometres.
In order to do ecological hydration work, Hebei Provincial Department of water conservancy actively organizes water supply river hazard identification, remediation and reinforcement and river cleaning work, refine practical measures, strengthen inspection and care.
Through supervision and inspection and centralized undervisit, solve all kinds of problems in a timely manner, to ensure the safe and orderly water supply of the river.
According to the head of the Water Resources Department of Hebei Province, the orderly implementation of river and lake ecological hydration has effectively repaired the ecological environment of rivers and lakes in Hebei province, promotes the recovery and conservation of coastal groundwater, greatly improving the habitat environment and economic development environment along the line, and to realize “water, green, river smooth, beautiful” rivers. Lake management protection goals are important.
You should all know what I'm going to say.
I think the intuition that inequality can cause social divisions and corruption existed before the French Revolution.
The difference is that we can now find evidence that we can understand the impact of inequality by comparing societies, societies with different levels of equality.
I'm going to show you some data and explain why that data really correlates.
But first, let's see how bitter our lives are.
(Laughter) I want to start my speech with a contradiction.
This graph shows how our average life expectancy is relative to gross national income, which measures the country's average affluence.
You can look at the countries on the right, like Norway and the United States, which are twice as rich as those on the left — Israel, Greece, and Portugal.
But this does not affect the average lifespan of their nationals.
There are no signs of correlation.
But if we look at society, we can see that there are huge differences in their health conditions within their entire society.
This figure shows the average lifespan.
These are towns in England and Wales — the poorest on the right and the richest on the left.
There is a great difference between the poor and the rest of the population.
Even those who are just below the top, their health is worse than those at the top.
So income means very much in our society, but comparisons between societies don't make sense.
The paradoxical explanation is that, in our society, we look at relative income or social status, identity — that is, the relationship between us and the size of the gap between people.
Once you have that idea, you should think right away: what happens if the gap widens? What if you close the gap? What about widening or reducing the income gap?
That's what I'm going to tell you right away.
I'm not using any hypothetical data.
My data comes from the United Nations — like the World Bank — about the income gap between these rich, developed market democracies.
The method we use, easy to understand, and you can download, is to compare the top 20% to the next 20% of each country's income gap.
As you can see, the countries on the left are more equal — Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden — their top 20% is roughly 3.5 to four times as rich as the latter 20%.
But on the other side of more inequality — the United Kingdom, Portugal, the United States, and Singapore — the income gap is doubled.
In this comparison, our country (UK) is twice as high as that of other equally successful democratic markets.
Next, I'm going to show how this affects our society.
We collect data on issues arising from differences within society, which are more prevalent at the bottom of society.
Internationally comparable data include life expectancy, mathematical and linguistic performance of children, infant mortality, suicide rate, prison population ratio, teenage pregnancy rate, degree of mutual trust, obesity, psychological illnesses — all of which meet standard diagnostic classifications including drug and alcohol addiction — and social mobility rates.
We put all this into one coefficient.
They are weighted equally.
A country's score is the average of these factors.
As you can see, these scores are related to the inequality comparison I just showed, and I'm going to show this data over and over again.
The more unequal countries are more poorly represented on various social issues.
Very correlated.
But if you look at the comparison of the same health and social problems with per capita GNI and the index of GNI, you'll find nothing, no more correlation.
We have a little fear that people might think that we are picking specific questions to cater to our theory and then create artificial evidence. So we also published a paper on the UNICEF Child Welfare Index in the British Medical Journal.
It contains 40 different sections, a summary from others.
It includes whether children can talk to their parents, whether they have books at home, how much immunization is, and whether there is bullying in schools.
All included.
This is how the index relates to the same level of inequality.
In the more unequal societies, the worse the child behave.
Relationships and their significant.
But again, if you look at the relationship between child welfare and per capita national income, you will get nothing. There are no signs of association.
All the data that I present to you now reveal is the same thing.
The average welfare of our societies is no longer dependent on national income and economic growth.
They are important in poorer countries, but not for rich, developed countries.
And the differences between us and our position relative to others seem very important today.
Below I'm going to show you some segments of our index.
This is the mutual trust index.
It refers to the proportion of people agreeing to the number that most people are trustworthy.
This is the data from the World Values Survey.
As can be seen, on the less equal side, about 15% of people feel they can trust others.
In more equal societies, however, this percentage has risen to 60 per cent or 65 per cent.
If you look at community engagement or assessment of social capital, there is a very similar correlation to inequality.
I would say that we have repeated this work twice.
For the first time, in these wealthy, developed countries, we changed the test, and repeated the test for 50 states in the United States — look into the same question: Do the more unequal states do worse on all these assessments?
This is the relationship between mutual trust and inequality that the federal government has found in a general social survey.
Very similar scatter points are spread over similar levels of trust ranges.
The same thing continues.
Basically, we find that almost all factors related to mutual trust reflected in international surveys are equally reflected in the 50 states we investigate separately.
This is no coincidence.
This picture is a mental illness.
The World Health Organization (WHO) uses the same diagnostic interviews to collect data through random sampling, allowing us to compare the rates of mental illness in each society.
This is the rate of the population suffering from any kind of mental illness in the previous year.
It ranges from 8% to more than 24% — suggesting that society as a whole is three times more likely to suffer from mental illness than in other societies.
Again, these are closely linked to inequality.
This graph is the crime rate.
Red dots represent states in the United States, and the Blue Triangle means Canadian provinces.
But look at the difference in their number.
Murder rates range from 15 to 150 per million.
This is the rate of prison inmates.
This is a 10x gap, and exponential functions magnify that gap.
However, the number of incarceration varies from 40 to 400.
Crime is not the main reason for this relationship.
In some places, the crime can explain part of the cause.
But more severe trials, or more demanding trials.
The more unequal society is more inclined to retain the death penalty.
This chart shows the dropout status of children in high school.
Again, the gap is wide.
If we discuss the selection of talents in society, we will find that the dangers of this gap are very serious.
This chart is the rate of social mobility.
It is actually calculated based on the liquidity rate of income.
Basically, what it asks is: Does rich daddy have rich children, poor dads have poor children, or have nothing to do with them?
On the less equal side, dad's income is more important — for example, in the United Kingdom, the United States.
And in Northern Europe, dad's income is less important.
There are more social strata moving there.
As we often say — and I know there's a lot of American listeners here — Americans should go to Denmark if they want to realize their “American dream”.
(Laughter) (Applause) What I've already shown here is marked in italics.
I can show some other questions as well.
Those problems are more prevalent at the bottom of the social gradient.
But there are endless problems with social gradients, which seem worse in unequal countries — not just a little worse, but twice as much as 10 times worse.
Think about the cost, the cost of manpower.
I want to go back to this diagram that we've shown earlier, and we put it all together to illustrate two points.
First, by one chart, we find that the countries that have underperformance, whatever, seem to be the more unequal ones, but the ones that are doing well seem to be Northern Europe and Japan.
So what we see is the relationship between widespread social disorder and inequality.
Not just one or two things went wrong, but almost everything.
Another important point I want to point out on this chart is that if you look at the bottom, Switzerland and Japan, they show in all respects they are very different countries.
The status of women, their adherence to small families, is at two extremes in affluent and developed countries.
But another important difference is how they achieve greater equality.
Sweden has large differences in income, but it uses taxes, state benefits, generous relief, and so on to narrow the gap.
Japan is quite different.
First, Japan's pre-tax wage gap is relatively small.
It has a lower tax.
It also has fewer benefits.
And in our study of states in the United States, we found a stark contrast.
Some states have done well through redistribution, while others do well because of the small pre-tax income gap.
So it is not important that we conclude how to achieve greater equality, but it is important that it be achieved.
I'm not talking about full equality, I am talking about what really exists in rich, developed market democracies.
Another unexpected thing about this figure is that not just poor people are affected by inequality.
The words of John Donne (English poet) seem a bit of truth: “No one is an island.”
Through a series of studies, we are able to compare the behaviour of people in every social strata in different countries with greater or less equality.
This is just an example.
This chart shows the infant mortality rate.
According to the UK's general socio-economic classification records, some Swede are very kindly classified as many infant deaths.
This is a non-contemporal classification based on the position of fatherhood, so single mothers form a set of data.
But we look at the so-called “social lower class,” which is manual work without technology.
The middle is skilled manual work, to senior non-manual work, up to professional work — doctors, lawyers, managers of large companies.
It can be seen here that Sweden is doing better than Britain and better at every social class.
The biggest difference is at the bottom of society.
But even at the top, living in a more equal society has some advantages.
We showed 5 different sets of data including U.S. and international educational results as well as health status.
In general, it seems that more equal societies show the most significant differences at the bottom of society, but there are also advantages at the upper levels of society.
I should explain what's going on.
I think I'm showing and discussing the impact of inequality on psychosocial.
More is concerned about superiority and inferiority, being valued and disregarded, respected and devalued.
Of course, the perceptions that arise from the competition for status have driven the consumptionism of society forward.
But it also leads to uncertainties of status.
What we are more worried about is how others judge and see us, whether we look attractive, smart, or so on.
Social value assessments reinforce fear of these social values.
Interestingly, similar work is being done in the social psychology field: some reviewed 208 different studies; in the study, volunteers were invited to a psychological testing centre to test their stress hormones and their response to stress tasks.
In this observation, scientists are interested in which type of stress best increases the level of cortisol, and most importantly stress hormones in the body.
The result is precisely those tasks that include social evaluation threats — those that threaten self-esteem and social status — in which others can negatively evaluate your performance.
These pressures have a very special effect in stress physiology.
We have now accepted criticism.
Of course, some people don't like this, and others find this unexpected.
And yet I should tell you that when people criticize us for picking data, we've never done that.
We have an unconditional provision if our data source contains data from the countries observed, then we will include it in the analysis.
Our data source determines whether the data is valid, not us.
Otherwise there will be a deviation.
What about other countries?
In academic peer-reviewed journals, 200 studies relate to the relationship between health and income and equality.
This is not confined to these countries here, hidden a very simple proof.
The same countries have the same inequality measurement methods, questions one by one.
Why don't we control other factors?
I have shown you that per capita national income has not had any impact.
Of course, others have applied more complex methods in the literature to exclude factors such as poverty, education and so on.
What about causation?
Relevance alone does not prove causation.
We took quite a while.
Indeed, people have a good understanding of the causality of our results.
The biggest change in our understanding of the drivers of long-term health in rich, developed countries is how important long-term stress from society is how important it affects immunity and the cardiovascular system.
Or, for example, the reason why violence is becoming more prevalent in less equal countries is because people are very sensitive to being descended.
I would say that in order to solve this problem, we should address a series of post-tax and pre-tax issues.
We should limit income and curb the bonus income culture at the top.
I think we have to do everything we can to hold our leaders accountable to our employees.
The last thing I want to summarize is that we can improve our real quality of life by reducing our income gaps.
In this way, we will find that we suddenly solved the social mental health problems of society, and that's awesome.
Thank you.
(Applause)
(Deutsche VoiceChinese) In the past two weeks, the coronary coronary cases in Spain have risen sharply, with thousands of new cases in several days.
On Saturday (July 25) evening, the British government decided to remove Spain from the safe travel list from 0:00pm local time, and people entering the UK from Spain must be quarantined for 14 days.
British tourists on vacation in Spain heard of the decision to be surprised, worried, and even angry because the news came suddenly and unsurprisingly.
British Transport Secretary Grant Shapps is also reportedly on vacation in Spain.
Before the British release of the quarantine measure, Norway also announced that those returning from Spain to Norway would be held for 10 days.
France and Belgium advised their residents to abandon their plans to leave ahead of Barcelona and the surrounding areas.
Beaches in these areas are overcrowded and social distant between people cannot be maintained, and the police once needed to take steps to reduce the number of beach visitors.
Tourism is a key pillar of Spain
Spain: This is safe
In response to a decision made by the UK, the Spanish Foreign Ministry said on Sunday that the outbreak in the country was under control.
Spanish Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya told the media: “Spain is safe, not only for Spaniards, but also for tourists.”
The Spanish government will try to convince the British government to exclude Balearic Islands and Canary Islands from isolation measures.
The reason is that the infection rates in these two destinations are much lower than in the UK.
In order to prevent the spread of the epidemic, Spain's Catalonia region has also reactivated the “foot ban”.
Tourism is a key pillar of Spain, one of the most popular resorts for British tourists.
The British decision is expected to have a major impact on Spanish tourism.

Engine may turn off FAA rush to check 2000 Boeing airliners - Xinhuan.com
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an emergency airworthability directive on the 24th, requiring an emergency inspection of about 2,000 Boeing 737NG and 737Classic aircraft registered in the United States, due to the erosion of the air check valve of the aircraft, which may cause the engine to stop in the air.
According to the FAA, four reports of aerial parking of the 737NG and 737Classic passenger aircraft engines have been received to date, resulting in urgent inspection requests for passenger aircraft that have been parked for 7 consecutive days or more, and for those with fewer than 11 flights to date after re-entry.
The FAA warns that the Class 5 check valves for all two engines of the passenger aircraft may get stuck in the open position if they are corroded, resulting in total loss of power and inability to restart the engine.
The aviation regulator ordered that, once the check valve is found to be corroded, the aviation operator must replace this critical component before the passenger aircraft is re-operational.
Boeing responded later that day, the coronavirus outbreak led to reduced travel demand, many passenger aircraft were sealed or less used, “check valves are more susceptible to corrosion.”
Boeing also said that air operators have been advised to check the aircraft involved in the instruction, and if it finds problems, Boeing will help with overhauling and replacing the check valve.
The Associated Press reported that the major US airline operators usually fly several times in a day, but after the COVID-19 outbreak, large numbers of passenger aircraft were grounded; as demand for passenger travel has recently grown slowly, some airliners are back into operation.
The FAA did not publish details of the four air parking reports.
Alaska Airlines disclosed one of the incidents later on the 24th.
The airline operator said in a statement that one of its airliners from Seattle, Washington, D.C., to Austin, Texas on July 15, an engine suddenly went out, and the passenger plane finally landed in an emergency at Austin Airport.
Alaska Airlines said it had replaced the engine of the passenger aircraft and had checked the engines of six airliners in accordance with the FAA directive.
American Airlines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines said on the 24th respectively that their aircraft did not have the engine flameout situation associated with the air check valve.
Four American Airliners will be inspected and 28 United Airlines will be inspected.
Delta Air Lines said it would inspect its 20 airliners, but did not say if there had been an engine flameout.
A number of media reports that the FAA emergency airworthworthism directive is yet another shock to Boeing.
A Boeing 737MAX airliner, Indonesia Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines, killed 346 people in October 2018 and March 2019 respectively.
The series was subsequently grounded worldwide, ceased production in January this year and resumed production in May.
Federal Aviation Administration Director Steve Dixon admitted in June that on 737MAX passenger aircraft, the FAA “made a mistake” in the regulation of Boeing.

There are new Variety Arts on the line.
Interactive knowledge sharing program “dingdong online! “Good Teacher”, will be broadcast on Hunan Satellite TV from July 20.
It is understood that the program will create a new class for all ages, and a group of talented and talented teachers will fight to challenge interesting knowledge output.
With the previous teacher group in the hearts of the public serious impression, “Ding Dong online! “Good Teacher” is a group of knowledge representatives of both Yan value and talent.
They are both role models of youth knowledge from various disciplines, or a group of all-rounder “piecers” who will shake their burden and are good at teaching.
In the program, the group of outstanding youth knowledge role models will challenge interesting knowledge classes as “knowledge-sharing officers”.
They need to impress the audience with an attitude of knowledge output that shows the most interesting side of their discipline.
The “question group”, composed of all ages, will raise changing questions, making the teaching of “knowledge sharing officers” more difficult and adding a little stimulating atmosphere to the program.
Among the “knowledge-sharing officers” are Li Yongle, a physics teacher at the high school affiliated to Renmin University of China, Zhang Xuefeng, and a history teacher with 10 years of experience. They will show the “hard core” knowledge of various disciplines to the audience in an unexpected way. Knowledge.
In addition, the program invited economics professor Xue Zhaofeng as the “knowledge initiator” of the program, together with “Ding Dong Assistant Teachers” Du Haitao and Jin Mengjia, to talk to the audience about youth and create a “public class on youth for all.”
Chief Secretary for Administration of the HKSAR Government: The situation is grim and fully resistant to epidemic - Chinane.com
Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 26 - Chief Secretary for Administration of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government Zhang Jianzong said on the 26th that the situation of COVID-19 in Hong Kong continues to be serious. If the outbreak deteriorates, the SAR government will decisively take tougher control measures to further restrict the operation of business premises and reduce the space for citizens to go out.
At this stage, however, the SAR Government does not intend to introduce a Home Order or a Foot Ban Order to restrict the public from going out.
Zhang Jianzong published a journal entitled “The situation is serious and fully resistant to the epidemic”.
He said the outbreak was the worst in half a year, and the next two weeks would be critical, and efforts should be made to prevent further spread of the virus in the community.
In addition to the necessary measures taken by the Government of the Special Administrative Region, self-regulation and cooperation among citizens is also very important.
He urged the public to stay home as much as possible, reduce social contact and eat out.
Members of the public should cooperate with mandatory measures to wear masks to protect themselves and others, pay attention to personal and environmental hygiene and handwashing.
He said that the central government has been very concerned about the changes in the outbreak in Hong Kong and supports the SAR government's efforts to prevent and combat epidemic, and actively respond to the Chief Executive's latest request to assist in increasing testing capacity and adapting AsiaWorld-Expo to similar “cabin hospital” work.
Cheung said that free virus testing for selected high-risk groups, namely staff of RCHDs, handicapped homes and nursing homes, restaurant staff, taxi drivers and property management staff, has been fully conducted, involving up to 400,000 people.
He is concerned about the cases of infection in RCHEs, and the HKSAR Government has arranged specific temporary quarantine centres for the elderly.
He said the SAR government is building a quarantine facility near Penny's Bay Quarantine Centre in Lantau Island, New Territories. It is expected to provide an additional 700 units of isolation by the end of September.
The Chief Executive also announced on the 19th that the SAR government will build more than 2,000 separate rooms at Penny's Bay Quarantine Centre, which will be completed by the end of this year.
With the 800 units already in operation, the Penny's Bay Quarantine Centre is expected to provide a total of 3,500 quarantine rooms by the end of the year.
There are currently four operational quarantine centres in Hong Kong, providing about 2,600 isolation rooms.
In addition, the HKSAR Government reopened the Lei Yue Mun Park Resort on Hong Kong Island on 24 as a community isolation facility for independent patients under 50 years of age.

US first anti-subsidy investigation against China with “renminbi undervaluation”
In response to the US Department of Commerce recently announced its decision to launch anti-dumping countervailing investigation against Chinese origin tie (harness belt) products, and launch an investigation on the “RMB exchange rate underestimation” project.
China's Ministry of Commerce pointed out that this is the first time that the United States is in a countervailing case to investigate the so-called “renminbi exchange rate underestimation” project, and China firmly opposes this.
The Chinese Ministry of Commerce issued a special press release on the evening of the 23rd that China implements a regulated floating exchange rate system based on market supply and demand, with reference to a basket of currencies, and the market plays a decisive role in the formation of exchange rates.
The press release stressed that, overall, the renminbi exchange rate was at a reasonable equilibrium level and had not been underestimated.
Since 2005, the renminbi has accumulated appreciation of more than 17% against the dollar.
According to data released by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), from early 2005 to May 2020, RMB nominal effective exchange rate appreciation of 38%, real effective exchange rate appreciation of 49%, is the strongest currency in the G20 economies, and one of the largest in the world.
The Ministry of Commerce noted that exchange rate issues were beyond the competence of members to conduct countervailing investigations in accordance with World Trade Organization rules.
The US amended its legislation in February to conduct countervailing investigations against the exchange rate of other countries, which has been suspected of violating WTO rules and has been opposed from many sides.
The press release said that even under US regulations, there were numerous errors in the content of the petitioner's complaint and did not have countervailing essential elements such as financial support, grant of interest, and specialization.
China urges the US side to abide by existing international rules and stop its countervailing investigation against the so-called “renminbi exchange rate underestimation”.
Affected by further rising tensions in Sino-US relations, the offshore and onshore RMB exchange rate against the US dollar on the 22nd traded sharply, and both fell below the $1 dollar against the RMB 7.0 mark.
It is a matter of concern whether the US Commerce Department's move is intended to push the renminbi up.
The RMB spot pair against the dollar rose to break the 7.0 level on the 23rd, closing at 6.9961.
The RMB exchange rate against the dollar under official control, the mid-price of the exchange rate, on the 24th down 17 basic points, reported 6.9938.

To raise the level of grass-roots governance, adhere to the leadership of party building, by strengthening political leadership, building a fighting fortress, uniting red forces, pushing the party's political advantage, organizational advantage and the advantages of mass work into a governance advantage, and passing the party's power and assertion to the “nerve endings” and the “last kilometer”.
Focus on calcium casting soul, strengthen political leadership.
To strengthen the political leadership of grass-roots governance, it is necessary to implement the “Calcium Cast Soul” project.
To learn to understand the idea of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era of Xi Jinping as the first task, make “not forget the initial heart, remember the mission” as the eternal topic of Party building and the lifelong topic of party members and cadres, and strengthen the reading of the original literary and literary principles, through thematic training, batch training, discussion exchange, and hold big Lecture Hall, etc., continue to promote the Party's innovative theories to move toward the truth, and promote further enhancement of the “four consciousness” , firmly “four self-confidence”, “two maintenance”, better discharge of duty.
Through the combination of online and offline learning methods, broadening the channels of learning and education, guiding grass-roots party organizations and party members and cadres to truly integrate learning and education into everyday and regular.
Emphasis on practice and exercise, during the process of resolving key difficult issues in the field of grass-roots governance, solve the troubles and troubles of the masses concerned well, and hammer Party nature and ability.
Grab the specification to upgrade, build a battle fortress.
Grassroots party organizations are both an important part of the grass-roots governance system and an important vehicle for their ability to demonstrate governance.
To promote the normalization of grass-roots party organizations, starting with grabbing the work regulations of the Party branch, focusing on issues such as weakening and weakening party organization leadership, etc., by establishing a mechanism of up-and-down linkage, setting up forms of innovative branches, normalizing the weak and weak, establishing a sound decision-making mechanism and a mechanism for serving the masses, etc. Base, short board, promote development.
In rural areas, strengthen the standardization of village party organizations, and standardize organizational forms, learning activities and management mechanisms against the standards for standardized construction of party branches, and effectively promote the implementation of systems such as “three sessions, one lesson” and themed party day activities.
In cities, focus on street communities, explore the form of innovative branch setting, focusing on weak areas, “clogging points” “pain points”, actively constructing the city party building alliance, so that the Party's work can achieve effective coverage.
At the same time, the establishment of a governance system mechanism for grass-roots governance, improve the decision-making mechanism of major events, facts co-ordinate, resolve matters, urgent consultations, difficult issues, and decision-making and procedure mechanisms led by grassroots party organizations, improve the mechanism for contact and service to the masses, gather hearts and minds in the service of the people and enhance the sense of acquisition of party members and masses, happiness, honor, pride, so that grassroots governance has more temperature.
Play a pioneer role to unite red forces.
Grassroots party members and cadres are the cornerstone of grass-roots governance.
To enhance grass-roots governance capabilities, focus on enhancing the governance capabilities of grassroots party members and cadres, focusing on playing the role of “red cells” in grass-roots governance as a demonstration and leading role in grass-roots governance, and gathering red forces at the forefront of reaching out to the masses.
To improve governance capacity as a compulsory course for grass-roots party members and cadres, continue to strengthen ideological quenching, professional training, practical exercise, and promote the spirit of responsibility in their positions and in urgent and difficult tasks, and contribute to promoting the modernization of the national governance system and governance capacity.
“Community whistle, party member reporting” activities should be widely carried out, and party members should participate in community building, management and service through participation in theme party day activities, contact people in need, identify service items, receive micro-wishes, and make reasonable proposals, so that party members can play a role in community governance.
To fully play the role of non-functional party members in rural areas, by setting up a pioneer post of unemployed party members and the formation of a task force for unemployed party members, etc., to guide grass-roots party members to actively participate in various tasks such as poverty eradication, ecological construction, maintenance of letters and visits, and straw banning burning, so as to better integrate red forces and serve the people.
Foundation solid building solid.
Grassroots party organizations are the foundation of the ruling building.
Only by insisting on keeping close relations between the party groups and increasing the welfare of the people as their focus, and taking party leadership as the fundamental way to promote innovation and development of grass-roots governance, can we build the foundation so that grass-roots party organizations can pull out and get up. Grassroots party members and cadres can catch up and rush up, and promote grass-roots governance. “Soul”, orderly, powerful, effective.

Coco Tibetan antelope enters the return season - Xinhuan.com
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 25 (Reporter Wang Jinjin) - The reporter learned from the Wudaoliang Protection Station of Coco Sicily Management Office of Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration Administration, Changjiangyuan Park Administration, the monitoring shows that the Tibetan antelope who had migrated to the Zhuonai Lake region in the heart of Coco Sicily is ending production of their children and began to return to their original children. habitat.
Surveillance pictures near the Wudaolang protection station show that on July 25, about 40 female Tibetan antelope led three Tibetan antelope young children through the Qinghai-Tibet Highway 3002 km, the North Bridge of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway Wudaoliang, and Tibetan Antelope has begun to relocate.
Experts analyze that in recent years, the number of Tibetan antelope young children in the relocated flock accounts for one-quarter to one-fifth of the total number of Tibetan antelope flocks.
Lian Xinming, deputy researcher at the Northwest Plateau Institute of Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: “Tibetan antelope faced a higher risk of predation, so the number of young children in the flock will be relatively small and may even have no young children.”
According to the Coco Sicily Management Office of Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration, the number of Tibetan antelope replacements has increased year by year. In 2019, the number of Tibetan antelope replacements was 4860, an increase of 338 over 2018.
Lian Xinming said: “The return of Tibetan antelope is expected to end in early September this year, and the number of relocations is expected to continue to increase.”
Tibetan antelope is a national protection animal.
At the end of May each year, Tibetan antelopes from Qinghai Sanjiang sources, Tibet Qiangtang, Xinjiang Alkin Mountain and other places go to Zhuonai Lake lambs in the hinterland of Kekesiri.
China's Tibetan antelope protection expert Wu Xiaomin, a researcher at the Shaanxi Institute of Animals (Northwest Institute of Endangered Animals), said: “The return of Tibetan antelope is the process of returning the female Tibetan antelope to their habitat after the end of birth. Initially, a large group of returnees leaving the land was larger, but the Tibetan antelope would then return to their respective habitats based on different geographical populations, along different paths.
In order to ensure the safe return of Tibetan antelope flock, the reporter learned that the Coco Sicily Management Office of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration of the Yangtze River Source Park has arranged staff to carry out continuous video surveillance and patrols in the main relocation areas.
If Tibetan antelope flock is found attempting to cross the road, the pilgrimsman will conduct temporary traffic control at the first time to allow the flock to pass through the wild animal passage safely to ensure that they are as little human disturbance as possible during the return journey.
So, how to solve the heat in everyday life?
Experts recommend that summer out try to avoid the high temperature period, it is best not to walk in the hot sun or work before and after noon, because this time period of sun is the most intense, the probability of heat stroke is high.
If this time must go out, be sure to do protection work, such as playing parasol, wearing sun visor, wearing sunglasses, the best conditions apply sunscreen to prevent sunburn.
Try to choose light color, breathable cotton, linen, silk texture, less wear chemical fiber clothing, so as to avoid a lot of sweating can not timely heat dissipation, cause heat stroke.
When hot and hot weather, prepare plenty of water, drink in time, do not wait for thirst before drinking water, because once feeling thirsty indicates that the body has been dehydrated, every time you drink water control at 150 ml to 200 ml, drink warm water, do not drink ice water.
General staff drink 1.5 liters to 2 liters of water per day, high temperature workers drink 3 liters to 5 liters of water per day, depending on the temperature.
When sweating more, some saline can be properly supplemented, make up for the loss of salt caused by sweating.
In addition, the body is prone to lack of potassium in summer, which makes people feel burnout and tired, potassium tea is an excellent summer drink.
Summer eat fruits and vegetables with high moisture content, such as lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, etc.; fresh fruits, such as peach, apricot, watermelon, melon and other moisture content of 80% to 90%, can be used to replenish moisture; dairy products can both hydrate and meet the nutritional needs of the body.
In addition, people working in high temperatures should supplement drinks containing elements such as potassium and magnesium.
Summer days and nights, high temperatures, strong metabolism, consumption is also large, easy to feel fatigue.
Adequate sleep can relax the brain and body systems, both for work and study, as well as a heatstroke prevention measure.
Experts say the best bedtime is from 22:00 to 23:00, and the best time to get up is 5:30 to 6:30.
Be careful not to lie under the air conditioning outlet and fan when sleeping, so as not to suffer from air conditioning and heat wounds.
Experts recommend that people in outdoor activities or high temperature work, can carry ten drops of water, human Dan, Agatum gas water or Agatum gas pills, or placed in the nearest workplace, at any time to prevent heat stroke.
I hope you take a moment to think about the very simple fact that, so far, much of our understanding of the universe has come from light.
We stand on Earth looking at the night sky and see the stars in the sky with the naked eye.
Strong sunlight is so dazzling,
We can see the light reflected from the moon,
Ever since Galileo directed his shabby astronomical telescope to the celestial bodies in the universe, and to this day, the universe we know is presented to us through light.
With the help of modern astronomical telescopes, we have been able to collect dazzling, silent images of the universe — a series of images dating back to the Big Bang.
However, the universe is not a mimitation, because the universe is not really silent.
I want to tell you that the universe has its own soundtrack and that the universe itself is playing. Because space can vibrate like drums.
So when something big happens, it can make a series of sounds to the universe.
Today, we want to be able to match this magnificent visual work of the universe with sound.
While we never heard from outer space, we should be able to turn the volume up and hear what's going on there in the next few years.
For the ambitious goal of capturing cosmic sounds, we have focused our focus on black holes and the prospects it presents, because black holes can hit time and space and make very special sounds like drumsticks hit the drum surface, and I am very happy to show you some of the sounds we predicted.
One day in the future, we may see a shadow, a black hole that leaves a shadow on a very bright background, but it has not been observed.
Although black holes are not visible, they are likely to be heard because they hit time and space like drums.
The idea that the universe can make drum-like sounds comes from Albert Einstein, and many of our thoughts come from him.
Einstein realized that if the universe was empty, if the universe was empty, it would look like this photograph, except those of the auxiliary lines painted on it.
But if we are free fall in the universe, even without these guides, our trajectory will draw these lines, because we will find that we move along straight lines, along lines that do not bend through the universe.
Einstein also realized — that's really the most critical part (matter also means “matter”) — that if you put energy and matter into the universe, the universe will bend. Free fall objects will be deflected along bent paths in space as they pass through objects like the sun.
This is Einstein's great generalized relativist theory.
Even the path of light will be bent.
When the bend is large to a certain extent, it turns around the sun's motion, like the earth turns around the sun and the moon turns around the earth.
This is the natural curve in the universe.
But Einstein didn't realize that if you squeeze the sun into a ball of 6 kilometers in diameter — that is, you compress material equivalent to a million times the mass of the planet into a ball of 6 kilometers in diameter, you will make a black hole, and the density of this object is so large that if the light is too close to it, it would be nothing. Law Escape - leaving a huge shadow in the universe,
But Einstein has always thought that black holes are just a mathematical singularity.
He didn't believe that there was a black hole.
He believes nature will prevent the formation of black holes to protect us.
It took decades to use the term “black holes” and realized that black holes were real celestial bodies — in fact, they were the state of death after a catastrophic collapse of some of the stars of great quality at the end of their lives.
Our sun does not collapse into black holes.
Its quality is not large enough.
But if we do some thought experiments — Einstein really likes to do it — we can imagine crushing the sun within six kilometers, and then put a tiny Earth in orbit around it, like, on a orbit 30 kilometers away from the black hole sun.
The Earth will light itself, because now that the sun is gone, we have no other light sources — so our little Earth has to glow itself.
You'll find that you can even put the earth on a track 30 kilometers away from the black hole and let it run around the orbit happy.
This black hole is actually just as big as Manhattan.
Before it destroys the earth, it may swell into Hudson Avenue.
But basically that's what we're talking about.
We're talking about an object that is compressed to half the size of Manhattan.
So we moved the earth closer to the black hole — 30 kilometers — and we noticed that it ran along the perfect track around the black hole.
There are rumors that black holes will devour everything in the universe, but in fact you have to be very close to really fall into it.
But impressively, from our point of view, we always see the Earth.
It can't hide behind the black hole.
A part of the light emitted from the earth falls into a black hole, but another part is bent by the black hole.
So you can't hide anything behind a black hole.
If this is the story in the Galactica space fortress and you are fighting the Syons, don't hide behind the black holes.
They can see you.
Our sun will not collapse into a black hole; it is not large enough, but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
If one of them is devouring the galaxy, it will look like this.
We will see the shadow of a black hole cast on hundreds of billions of stars in the galaxy and dust belts illuminated by stars.
If we fall into this black hole, we'll see light refracted around the black hole, and we don't even feel that some huge changes are occurring quietly when we start entering the shadow.
If we try to start the rocket and get out of there, the result will not be good because we cannot flee, nor even light.
Although black holes look dark from the outside, this is not the case inside, as the light of all galaxies can fall into the black hole with us.
And even so, our clock seems to be slower than the time of the galaxy due to the relativistic time-bloating effect, which looks as if the outer galaxies were accelerating change, just before we were destroyed by black holes.
It's like experiencing the feeling of death, and you see the light at the end of the tunnel, but it's a complete death experience.
(Laughter) There's no way to tell anyone that you see the light at the end of the tunnel.
So far, we have never seen the shadows left by such a black hole, but black holes can be heard even if they can't be seen.
Imagine in a real astronomical scene — imagine two black holes that have been together for a long time.
Perhaps they used to be stars collapsed into two black holes — each 10 times the mass of the sun.
Now we'll compress them to 60 kilometers.
They can be rotated hundreds of times per second.
At the end of life, they approach each other at the speed of light.
You can cross thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second. In the process, they not only bend the space, but also cause space vibration in the tail stream behind it, a real time and space wave.
Black holes make space squeezed and stretched when they hit the universe.
These vibrations spread in space at the speed of light.
This computer simulation was done by the Relativist Group of National Aeronautics and Space Administration Goddard.
It took almost 30 years to solve this problem.
This is one of many groups.
It shows two black holes that rotate around each other, these are the curves imagined.
And as you can see — maybe some blurry — you can see that the red waves are emitted, and these are gravitational waves.
They are real sounds of the universe, which will spread out from the black holes at the speed of light as they blend together, until the two black holes are integrated into a quietly rotating black hole.
If you stand close enough, your ears will resonate with the squeezing and stretching of these spaces.
You can really hear these sounds in your ears.
Of course, you will helplessly find that your head is also squeezed and stretched, so you may not be able to understand exactly what is going on.
But I would like to play the sound we predicted for you.
This is the result of my group's research - a relatively brief computational model.
Imagine a smaller black hole falling into a larger black hole.
The sound you hear comes from the collision of small mass black holes with space as they approach large black holes.
If they are far away, the sound will be very small.
But the gradual sound becomes like a drumstick beating space, making the space vibrate like a drum.
We can predict what this sound will look like.
We know that small quality black holes get faster and louder in the process of falling.
Ultimately, we will hear the small black hole completely fall into the big black hole.
I never felt that sound so loud — here it's actually amplified.
When listening at home, I feel that this sound is a little less powerful.
Sounds like, Ding, Ding.
This is another sound that we study the group simulates.
I'm not going to show you images here, because black holes leave no useful trail, and the real space will not show you those virtual curves.
But if you hear this when you're on vacation in the universe, I suggest you run quickly.
(Laughter) Better get away from this sound.
Both black holes are moving.
Two black holes are close to each other.
In this case, they are all shaking violently.
They will then blend together.
That sharp sound is the hallmark of black hole fusion — a sharp sound when the fusion ends.
This is what we predict about what we will see.
Fortunately, we are very safe in Long Beach, California.
There is no doubt that somewhere in the universe two black holes have fused together.
It is also unquestionable that the space around us can feel the vibrations that crossed a million light years, or a million years ago, that spread at the speed of light and eventually meet us.
But these voices are too small to hear.
Some experiments in the world take a lot of hard work to build up — one called LIGO — that will detect spatial vibrations at a distance of less than one atomic nucleus every four kilometers.
This is a very bold attempt, its sensitivity will not be overtaken in the coming years - it will be used to detect spatial vibrations.
Another research project on the universe is expected to be launched in the next decade, called LISA.
LISA will be able to see black holes of supermassive mass — black holes that are millions or billions of times the mass of the sun.
From the Hubble Telescope, we see these two galaxies.
Looks like they're still hugging together.
There may be a huge super black hole in their center.
But they are not static, and they are actually converting.
The two black holes will collide, and their fusion will take billions of years.
So collecting their voices is beyond the limits of our human perception.
But LISA can see the final stage of two supermassive black holes that began to blend long ago, that is, 15 minutes before they blends.
This detection is not limited to black holes; it can also be used to detect any big disturbance in the universe — the biggest of which is the Big Bang.
When the word was created, some people mocked — “Oh, who would believe the Big Bang?”
This animated short film with my friend in Proton Studios shows the big bang from the outside.
We would never really want to be true; we want to be inside the universe, because there is no situation outside the universe.
So, imagine you're in the Big Bang.
The universe is everywhere, everything in the world surrounds you, and space swings out of order.
14 billion years have passed, and that voice is still lingering around us.
Galaxy is gradually formed, and a batch of stars form in the galaxy. On one planet, there is at least one such planet, suitable for life.
Here we build experiments frantically, do calculations, write computer code.
Imagine two black holes collided a billion years ago.
This sound has always been in time and space.
We didn't even appear here.
It's getting closer - 40,000 years ago, we still painted on the stone walls of the cave.
If the sound we were going to get was from the Big Bang, it would sound like this.
Strictly speaking, it is noise.
It's a white noise, a chaotic ringtone.
But it's everywhere around us, as long as it is not offset by some other process in the universe.
If we could detect these sounds, it would be like music for our ears, because this quiet echo comes from the moment we were created, from the universe we looked up.
So in the coming years, we're going to be able to turn the volume of these soundtrack a little bit, so that the universe is presented to us in the form of audio.
But if we can detect the earliest moments, it will take us a step further from understanding the Big Bang, allowing us to ask some of the most difficult and at the same time the most elusive questions.
If we play the course of the universe upside down, we can know that there was a big bang in the past, and we can even hear its noisy voice, but is our Big Bang the only big bang in the universe?
I mean, we can't help but ask, have there been a similar explosion before then?
Will it happen again in the future?
I would like to say that if we raise the significance of this question to the level that TED advocates for rethinking, at least in this last minute, we can ask questions that we may not answer forever.
But we can't help but ask: will our universe be just an episode of a larger history?
Or, would we be just a branch of the multiverse — each of them has experienced its own big bang — maybe some of them have buzzing black holes, some not — maybe some of them have conscious lives, maybe some don't — they don't belong to our past and does not exist in our future, but in some way to associate with us?
So we can't help but guess that if there is a pluralistic universe, in other branches of this multidimensional universe, there is life?
This is life in our multidimensional universe.
Are there other lives in the multiverse, and are they also guessing our existence and thinking about their own origins?
If this is the case, I can imagine them doing calculations, writing computer code, building experimental instruments, trying to detect the faint sounds that come from their origins, and wonder who else is there.
Thank you. Thank you all.

Australian University Develops New Drug Promise to Treat Blood Vascular Clogging - Xinhuan.com
Xinhua News Agency, Sydney, July 26 (Reporter Chen Yu) Researchers at Monash University in Australia are developing a new drug that helps prevent heart disease and stroke, and hope that this drug will be used to treat blood vessel blockages caused by coronavirus.
Researchers found that an enzyme in platelets accelerates platelet coagulation before a heart attack or stroke attack.
As a result, they developed a drug that temporarily inhibits platelet coagulation, avoiding blood vessel clogging and preventing heart disease and stroke.
Researchers say the drug inhibits the coagulant effect of platelets only when signs of heart disease or stroke appear.
As studies have shown similar vascular clogging is one of the leading causes of death in patients with COVID-19, researchers hope that the drug can be used in the future for the treatment of such severe patients.
Currently, the drug has achieved good results in animal model experiments, and researchers prepare for the next phase of clinical trials in humans.
The research results have been published in the American Journal of Science Translational Medicine.

China News Agency, July 26, Xinjiang Hami: Xinjiang deep plowing “sunflower fields” with clean energy
More than 6,000 pentagonal sunglasses, 48 square meters each, arranged in a circle, such as a silver “sunflower field”, with the sun rotating, reflecting the sun to the center of more than 200 meters high heat absorption tower, to achieve power generation.
The reporter saw this scene at the Hami molten salt tower photothermal power farm in Nao Maohu Town, Yigu County, Hami City, Xinjiang on the 25th.
“The so-called molten salt tower photothermal power generation is the solar light reflected in the mirror to the heat absorption tower to form thermal energy, and then convert heat into electricity through traditional power generation technology.”
Zhang Yong, deputy general manager of China Power Hami Solar Thermal Power Co., Ltd. said that the design principle is similar to the solar stove used in rural areas of northwest China, all have to gather the sun light together.
The farm began construction in October 2017 and was connected to the grid at the end of last year, covering an area of 6,600 acres, and a total of 14,500 fixtures are planned to be installed.
“Compared to conventional solar power generation technology, the biggest advantage is that the aggregate heat can be stored and power generation at night.”
Zhang Yong said the project's 13-hour heat storage system can keep the generator set running continuously and stable, not affected by changes in light. It can also quickly participate in grid peak regulation according to the demand of the grid load peak.
Once completed, the project can achieve an annual power generation of 198 million degrees, saving more than 60,000 tons of standard coal per year, more than 60 tons of sulphur dioxide, 60 tons of nitrogen oxides, 20 tons of smoke and dust, and 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide, providing a continuous source of clean energy.
In addition, there is another silver “sunflower field” in Shicengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park in Hami City.
The Hamiver photovoltaic photovoltaic plant covers an area of more than 2,300 acres. The 714 power generation equipment has been built to follow the solar rotation, always keeping the sun light and the condenser face at 90 degrees right angles.
“We use dual-axis tracked condenser power generation technology, and through unified integrated control, all power generation equipment will adjust the angle to the height of the sun to maintain power efficiency.”
Duan Mengqi, director of the power station, said the power generation technology can improve the efficiency of conventional photovoltaic power generation by about 20% in light weather conditions.
In the first half of this year, the plant has produced more than 7 million degrees of electricity, supplementing local electricity demand.
Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park is currently the largest monomer in Xinjiang, the most complete photovoltaic module type a photovoltaic industry demonstration park, a total of 38 photovoltaic power projects, a total of 82 million kilowatts installed.
In the first half of this year, power generation was over 110 million degrees, up 6% from the same period in 2019.
Hami is one of the best solar resources in China.
The average annual total solar radiation is more than 6,200 MJs per square metre and approximately 3200 hours of sunshine throughout the year.
In recent years, the city vigorously developed photovoltaic industry, good “sunflower field”.
It has built more than 2.5 million kilowatts of solar power generation scale, the city's photovoltaic power generation exceeded 1.4 billion degrees in the first half of this year, up about 14% year-on-year.
At present, Xinjiang grid-connected photovoltaic power plant more than 330 seats, installed capacity of more than 10 million kilowatts.
PV power generation is expected to reach 15 billion degrees this year, which can replace more than 6 million tons of standard coal.

US media unveiled the truth that the US side demanded that China close its Consulate General in Houston - Chinese.com

US media unveiled the truth about the US side's unprodukable demand that China close its Consulate General in Houston
On the 24th, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the US Embassy in China that China decided to revoke the authorization for the establishment and operation of the US Consulate General in Chengdu and put specific demands on the consulate-general to stop all operations and activities, as a countermeasure against the US side's sudden demand that the Chinese side close the Consulate General in Houston on the 21st.
This action by the United States government has attracted many concerns, and its political motives have been questioned by foreign media and scholars.
Why is it asking the Chinese side to close the Consulate General?
A number of foreign media said that it is not clear why the United States will choose the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, but for the purpose of this move, foreign media said frankly: for the general election.
The US Cable News Network (CNN) reported on the 23rd that the US side asked the Chinese side to close the consulate general in Houston caused public questioning of its political motives.
The article said that the US government's disastrous response to COVID-19 caused President Trump's poll support rate before the election was lower.
White House officials privately claimed that the tough strategy against China was to save Trump's support rate, but also to divert responsibility for the White House outbreak's failure.
According to the article, the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is a “politically driven, very cautious” goal chosen by the US government to “create a tough attitude while avoiding the risk of major conflict.”
The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) also believes that in the US election season approaching, the US economy is severely hit by the epidemic, Trump believes that “playing the 'Chinese card' has a political advantage.”
The current situation is “a spiral, tit-for-tat struggle,” driven in part by the US government from a domestic perspective, and will only exacerbate tensions between China and the United States.
The US Columbia Broadcasting Corporation (CBS) reported that Trump's re-election prospect was under pressure due to the outbreak, he repeatedly accused China for the outbreak.
Almost every day, the United States has new actions against Trump's absurd rhetoric of “China's exploitation of America.”
“The Consulate General of Houston is important in establishing ties between the two countries”
The Associated Press commented that the US demand for China to close its consulate-general in Houston has exacerbated tensions between the two largest economies in the world.
If the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is closed, in addition to diplomatic implications, Chinese citizens in the south of the United States face difficulties in obtaining consular services, as do US citizens seeking visas and other services.
A business group in Houston regretted the US demand that China close its Consulate General in Houston, saying that the Consulate General played an important role in establishing trade, investment and cultural ties between the two countries.
The Associated Press believes that this reflects the importance of China's economy.
The US Foreign Policy website believes that this move “is part of a series of provocative initiatives that will only worsen US-China relations.”
Reuters quoted Jonathan Pollak, an expert on East Asia at the Brookings Institute in the United States, saying that since the establishment of full diplomatic relations between the US and China in 1979, he could not imagine anything comparable to the US action against the Chinese Consulate-General in Houston.
Hong Kong's South China Morning News reported that this move by the US side was unprecedented in the diplomatic relations between China and the United States for more than 40 years.
Analysts believe that this move could cause persistent damage.
Built in 1979, the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is the first Chinese consulate-general to open in the United States.
Currently, China has one embassy and five consulates general in the United States.

Chinese government is a staunch maintainer of cyber security - China.com
Chinane.com, July 26 - According to information from the website of the Chinese Embassy in the UK, on the 25th, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in the UK answered the reporter's question about the wrong remarks about cyber attacks.
The spokesman stressed that the Chinese government is a staunch defender of cybersecurity and has always firmly opposed and combated any form of cyber attacks and cybercrime.
A reporter asked: According to the media, hacking groups linked to China had interfered with a British company's network system, launched an attack on British and American technology companies with patent data, and invaded EU government networks.
The spokesman said that the Chinese government is a staunch defender of cybersecurity and has always firmly opposed and combated any form of cyber attacks and cybercrime.
Cyberspace is virtual, traceable and diverse actors. When investigating and characterizing cyberincidents, there should be sufficient evidence and no guesswork.
The spokesman said that a series of incidents such as the “prism door” proved that the United States has been carrying out the world's largest cyber stealing operations.
It is in the common interest of all States to maintain peace and stability in cyberspace.
The spokesman pointed out that China's achievements in science and technology innovation are not stolen, not robbed, but through self-reliance and hard work.
In 2019, China filed about 59,000 patent applications through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), with an annual growth rate of 10.6%, making it the largest number of international patent applications.

Free nucleic acid testing in Urumqi has basically completed secondary testing in high-risk areas - Chinane.com
Chinane.com, Urumqi, July 26 (Reporter Sun Tingwen Zhao Yamin) Zhang Wei, director of the Sanitary Health Committee of Urumqi City on the 26th, said in his briefing on the latest outbreak and nucleic acid testing situation in Urumqi, that at present, most of the free nucleic acid testing in Urumqi city have been basically completed.
The State Council expert group and experts from the Autonomous Region and Urumqi Municipality are making further assessments of the development of the epidemic based on the results of nucleic acid testing and epidemiological investigations.
The press office of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region held a press conference today to report on the outbreak and control situation in Xinjiang.
According to him, between 000-2400 hours on 25 July, 22 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 (of which 5 were reconfirmed cases of asymptomatic infection) and 38 new asymptomatic infections were added in Urumqi city.
As at 24:00 on 25 July, there are 135 confirmed cases and 147 cases of asymptomatic infection in Urumqi city.
The new asymptomatic infections on the 25th were basically screened through free nucleic acid testing throughout the city.
Zhang Wei, director of the Urumqi Municipal Health and Health Committee, said on the 26th that most areas of free nucleic acid testing in the whole city of Urumqi have been basically completed.
He added that, from experience in other parts of the country, there are many factors influencing nucleic acid test results, such as the sensitivity of the test reagent, the time of infection and detoxification time of the person being tested, the cooperation of the person being tested at the time of the sample (poor fit may result in not being taken), and the testing environment, testing Proficiency in the operation of personnel, etc.
For a variety of reasons, nucleic acid tests also produce false negative results.
False negative means that the person tested is indeed an infected person, but the nucleic acid test result is negative.
In addition, people who have had close contact with confirmed or suspected cases usually require two nucleic acid tests to exclude.
For those who have traveled to high-risk areas in the epidemic, if they have fever and respiratory symptoms, a negative nucleic acid test may be false negative, so two nucleic acid tests are also required to exclude.
He said, in view of the above, for the health of the people of all ethnic groups in the city, from today, Urumqi will carry out two free nucleic acid testing in key areas such as Tianshan District, Shaybak District and other key areas, while carrying out “check the missing”.
It is reported that Tianshan and Shaibak district are high-risk areas of the outbreak.

White House Epidemic Expert Foch: Cautiously optimistic about vaccine development in early 2021
Foch made the statement at a web-based video conference hosted by the International Leaders Foundation on Monday.
He warned that it was not clear how COVID-19 would develop in the autumn and winter, nor what the eventual impact of the outbreak would be, “and the only way to end it is that each of us chooses to be part of the solution.”

US-China trade representatives meet in August
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post quoted an anonymous informed person reported on the 25th that Chinese trade negotiation team leader Liu He and US team co-leader Lai Haizhe are expected to hold formal talks in August to assess the implementation of the first stage of the Sino-US trade agreement.
The report said that although China has significantly increased its procurement of US agricultural products in the past few months, due to coronavirus and other factors, China's procurement volume is still a distance from the number promised in the trade agreement.
Analysts say that the recent closure of each other's consulates between the US and China, together with other disputes, could undermine any progress in trade between the two sides.
The first stage trade agreement between China and the US came into force one month after January 15. The agreement stipulated that a high-level trade framework group between the two sides should hold talks every six months.
The meeting will be “an important turning point”, allowing both sides to assess the progress of the agreement, sources said.
But this person also said that if US-China tensions lead to low willingness to talk at this time, the two sides may agree that Lai Haizhe and Liu He's telephone conference on May 8 will have met the terms of the semi-annual talks in the trade agreement.
Since this year, Sino-US relations have deteriorated rapidly. The disputes between the two sides include issues such as the origin of the coronavirus, trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the South China Sea and ideology.
US President Donald Trump boasted his achievements in the first phase of the deal at the beginning of the year, but his attitude has changed recently.
He said at a White House press conference on the 23rd that although China recently purchased a record number of US maize on a single day, also bought a lot of soybeans, “but this trade agreement is now less meaningful to me than it was when it was reached.”
An anonymous Beijing government advisor also believes that a new round of trade talks is unlikely to take place due to poor US-China relations, “trade issues have lost weight in Sino-US relations.”
But he revealed that China's economic and trade related units still met on the 23rd to discuss a number of issues, including how to increase imports from the United States, “we have tried our best to buy, so any additional purchases will be difficult.”
Peng Jiining, vice chairman of the US-China Trade National Committee, said that maintaining the momentum of the first phase agreement is “more important than ever,” and said China has made progress in further opening up financial markets to US companies this year.
“Talk is better than nothing, though it may only be treated as a routine,” said analysts at plenum independent research firm.

Commentator of People's Daily: Concentrate on doing their own things to build new advantages in future development — on learning and implementation General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the entrepreneur forum - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 25 - People's Daily July 26th commentator article: Concentrate your efforts to do their own things to build new advantages in future development
At present, the global epidemic and the world economic situation remain grim and complex, and the development challenges facing our country are unprecedented.
Keeping strategic strength, building confidence in winning, and concentrating our efforts on doing our own things is the key to responding to various risks and challenges.
At the recent Entrepreneurs Symposium, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed that under the external environment of the current rise of protectionism, the world economic downturn, and the shrinking global market, we must concentrate our efforts to do our own business, fully play the advantages of domestic hyperscale markets and gradually form a domestic cycle The new development pattern of mutual promotion of body, domestic and international double cycle, to enhance the modernization of the supply chain in the industrial chain, vigorously promote Technological innovation, accelerate key core technology, build new advantages for future development.
Wise, the harnessing win.
In the external environment of deepening economic globalization, markets and resources “both sides” play an important role in the rapid development of our country.
Now, the world under the impact of the epidemic is undergoing profound changes, facing more uncertainties of instability, and economic globalization is facing downwinds and backwinds.
To prepare for a longer period of time to cope with changes in the external environment, and to promote China's economy to thrive and stabilize. One of the most important aspects is to make the expansion and satisfaction of domestic needs a strategic basis for development, give full play to its own advantages, and to flourish the domestic economy and smooth the country through prosperity of the domestic economy. The big cycle adds impetus to China's economic development, driving the world economic recovery.
We should be deeply aware that building a complete system of domestic demand is related to the long-term development and long-term security of our country.
During the review of the situation, the Party Central Committee clearly proposed to firmly implement the strategy of expanding domestic demand. This is the need to cope with the impact of the epidemic. It is the need to maintain the sustained and healthy development of our economy in the long term, and to meet the needs of the people's growing and better life.
The advantage of large economies is internal circulation.
China has the world's most complete and largest industrial system, strong production capacity, perfect supporting capacity, has more than 100 million market subjects and more than 170 million people with higher education or all kinds of professional skills, and a large scale of 1.4 billion people, including more than 400 million middle income groups In-mold demand market, is in the rapid development stage of new industrialization, information, urbanization, agricultural modernization, The potential for investment demand is enormous.
The common development of the public ownership system, multi-ownership economy, distribution of labor as the main subject, multiple distribution modes coexist, and socialist basic economic systems such as the socialist market economy system can both stimulate the dynamism of various market subjects, liberate and develop social productivity, but also promote efficiency and fair and organic unity, Continuously achieve common prosperity.
We need to firmly grasp the strategic base of expansion of domestic demand, so that production, distribution and distribution will rely more on the domestic market to achieve a virtuous circle, clarify the strategic direction of supply-side structural reforms, and promote a dynamic balance of total supply and demand at a higher level.
To accelerate the construction of a complete domestic demand system, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation and other aspects of innovation, accelerate the development of strategic emerging industries such as digital economy, intelligent manufacturing, life health, new materials, and form more new growth points, growth poles, and gradually form a domestic and international double cycle New patterns of development that mutually reinforce each other.
Openness brings progress, closure is bound to lag behind.
General Secretary Xi Jinping has repeatedly stressed that China's open doors will not close, it will only become bigger.
The main theme of the domestic cycle is not closed to closed doors, but rather to achieve stronger and more sustainable development by harnessing the potential of domestic demand, making better access to both domestic and international markets and two kinds of resources.
At the same time, there is no contradiction between expanding domestic demand and opening up. The smoother the domestic cycle, the more conducive to the establishment of a new pattern of openness, the more conducive to developing new advantages for participation in international cooperation and competition.
Although protectionist thinking at the international level is rising, we need to stand on the right side of history, insist on deepening reform, expanding openness, strengthening open cooperation in science and technology, promoting the construction of an open world economy and promoting the establishment of a community of human destiny.
The Chinese nation has experienced many tribulations in its history, but has never been overwhelmed, but rather the more frustrating, growing up in the tribulation and rising up from the tribulation.
On the way forward, there are strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Xi Jinping at its core, with significant advantages of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, strong mobilization ability and strong comprehensive strength, and the unity and struggle of the people of all nationalities of the whole Party and the whole army, and we will surely be able to overcome all difficult and dangerous obstacles. China's economic and social development momentum, fully built a well-off society, successfully opened a comprehensive socialist modernization A new journey to the country!

France increases military investment in space - Xinhuan.com
French Defense Minister Florence Palley said on the 24th that France will add hundreds of millions of euros space defense budget to develop military forces in space to prevent other countries to carry out “unfriendly moves” in outer space.
Pali told the newspaper Provence that day that the budget for French military space projects would increase from €3.6 billion ($4.2 billion) to 4.3 billion euros ($5 billion) between 2019 and 2025.
Under the French Military Planning Act 2019 to 2025, approved by the French Parliament in 2018, France is expected to update its existing observation and communications satellites, launch three electromagnetic listening satellites and modernizing space surveillance radars.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced last July that the French Air Force will set up a military command of space and an “aviation and space force”.
Pali said she would officially announce the establishment of this space force when she visited a military school in Salon in Provence later.
Parley said the space force is part of the air force, which reached 500 people by 2025.
“The idea that space serves the common good of science is gone,” she said. “Now space is the place where nations compete for global hegemony.”
Palley reiterated Macron's previous statement, saying that the French side had no intention of provoking an arms race.
“We are by no means engaged in an arms race. But it is my duty to fully understand the threats we may face.”
Pali reopened the surveillance of a French and Italian military satellite in 2017.
“Voyeur” was a Russian satellite, she said.
The Russian side denied this claim.
France “soon” will have small patrol satellites capable of reconnaissance and lock “the black hands behind those unfriendly moves”, Palley said.

Experts say immigrant data collected through the US census for use in house seat allocation is unconstitutional
Civil rights organizations and several US cities and counties have filed prosecutions against the United States federal government, claiming that Trump's Office's attempt to exclude undocumented immigrants from the US census is unfeasible and unconstitutional.
The US census will determine the allocation of seats in the US House of Representatives.
Sarah Blannon, executive lawyer of the Civil Rights and Freedom League of America, said to VOA, “This is not possible.”
She went on to say that Trump's request to determine the citizenship of those subject to the census in the census was difficult and “not very reliable.”
Another civil liberties organization Common Cause filed a lawsuit on Thursday challenging Trump's executive order.
A number of cities in New Jersey and Georgia joined the lawsuit.
Arlington County, Virginia, also joined the lawsuit on Friday.
“The US Constitution requires an accurate inventory of our population every 10 years,” said Gavi, chairman of the Board of Management of Arlington County. We must accurately count everyone living in Arlington County, and this illegal attempt to scare away and squeeze our immigrant communities cannot succeed.”
Other organizations and individuals praised President Trump's executive order.
Alabama Attorney General Marshall said the executive order was a “victory” for the state.
“The allocation of seats in the House of Representatives and electoral colleges in each state must be based on the number of residents living in each state and the number of legally residing residents,” he said.
The US Supreme Court last year prevented the Trump administration from including citizenship in the 2020 census form.
President Trump signed an executive order earlier this week directing the US Census Bureau Commerce Secretary Ross to submit data on the undocumented population from the census so that the administration can exclude these undocumented populations from state census figures, as a means of determining whether each state is increasing Add or reduce or keep seats in the House of Representatives.
The United States redistributes seats in the House of Representatives every 10 years in the light of demographic changes.

Being an artist, contact is very important to me.
Through my work of art, I try to make it clear that humans are not separated from nature, but that everything is connected.
I first went to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and I saw the iceberg for the first time.
I feel awe.
My heart swings quickly and dizzy, trying to understand exactly what this is in front of me.
The iceberg around me surfaced almost 200 feet. I can only feel strange. This is what one snowflake is covered in another, formed year after year.
The icebergs are formed when they break from the glacier or from the ice shelf.
Each iceberg has its own unique personality.
They have a distinct way of interacting with their surroundings and their circumstances.
Some icebergs refuse to compromise to the end, while others can't stand the cracking of water under a surge of intense passion.
When you see the icebergs, it's easy to think that they are all isolated, they are independent, separate, and more like what we humans sometimes think of ourselves.
But reality is far more than that.
As the iceberg melts, I breathe into its old scent.
As the iceberg melts, it releases mineral-rich fresh water that nourishes everything.
I started shooting these icebergs as if I was photographing portraits of my ancestors and learned that in these individual moments the icebergs were in that way but never again.
When they melt, it is never death; nor is it an end, but a continuation of the road to life.
I've photographed the iceberg, and some ice are very young — thousands of years old.
Some ice is over a hundred thousand years.
The final picture I want to show you is an iceberg I took on Kekertsuatsiak in Greenland.
This is a very rare opportunity for everyone to actually witness an iceberg rolling.
So that's as shown in the picture.
On the left you can see a boat.
This is a boat of about 15 feet.
I want you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and its deformation on the water.
Here you see that it starts to roll, the boat moves to the other side, and a man stands there.
This is an average size Greenland iceberg.
It surfaced about 120 feet tall or 40 meters tall.
This video is shot in real time.
(Music) Like this iceberg, they show you different aspects of their personality.
Thank you.
(Applause)

“One year round, beepeasants follow the flowering long journey, moving from Yunnan and Sichuan all the way north to the northwest, they have a meal and stay in no place, very hard.
As a business, we have a responsibility to help them.”
Wu Na said.
“Bees are 'environmental scout, 'and bees cannot survive in heavily polluted areas.” Zhao Xiaochuan, Executive Vice President of China Bee Products Association, pollination of bee is an important link in the ecological chain, and plays an irreplaceable role in protecting plant diversity and improving the ecological environment.
At the same time, pollination of bees enhances crop yields, especially in areas where widespread and poorly managed conditions, pollination is even more significant.
Research data show that pollination can increase the production of rapeseed by about 15% - 30%.
Zhao Xiaochuan (right), Executive Vice President of China Bee Products Association, introduced Qinghai bee products.

Greenland opens a new round of mixed reform of Shanghai state capital to transfer 17.5% shares - Economic Watch
On July 26, Reporter of Economic Watch Network Rao Xianjun, Greenland Holdings (600606.SH) issued the “Promptive Notice on the Proposed Transfer of Part of the Company's Shares and Resurrection by means of public solicitation of transferees by means of public solicitation of transferees”.
The announcement shows that in order to further deepen the SOE reform, optimize the structural adjustment of state-owned state-owned assets, improve Greenland equity structure, Shanghai Real Estate (Group) Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “Shanghai Real Estate”) and Shanghai Urban Investment (Group) Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “Shanghai Urban Investment”) Agreement to transfer part of shares held in the company by way of set transferee, the total proportion of shares to be transferred does not exceed Greenland 17.5% of total share capital.
The price of the proposed transfer is not less than the arithmetic average of the daily weighted average price for the 30 trading days prior to the indicative announcement date (27 July 2020); and the audited net assets per share of the company for the last fiscal year.
At present, the new strategic investors in Greenland are still inconclusive. According to the announcement information, it is estimated that the new strategic investors will need to pay about 14 billion yuan to reclaim the 17.5% equity transfer in this mixed change.
It is worth noting that after the transfer of shares, Greenland is expected to have no controlling shareholder and actual controller, but the control structure may change significantly.
Greenland Holdings has carried out a number of institutional reforms since its inception: 1992-1997, in accordance with the rules of market under the pure state-owned system; 1997-2013, the establishment and continuous improvement of state-owned holding and employee-holding shareholding system; 2013-2015, the introduction of strategic investors, forming state-owned and non-public capital Cross-shareholding, mixed ownership; 2015 Since now, as a whole listed, become a public company.
Greenland's current hybrid plan is similar to Gree. In December 2019, Hillhouse Capital led Zhuhai Mingjun to take over 15% stake in Gree Electric Appliances (000651.SZ) to take over 15% stake in Gree Electric (000651.SZ), Gree Group retired from small shareholders. After the mixing, Gree Electric implemented executive incentive plan, no physical controller structure and other modern enterprises. Industry management method.
Shanghai Real Estate and Shanghai Urban Investment are state-owned enterprise groups wholly owned by the Shanghai Municipal SASAC. Zhang Yuliang, chairman and president of Greenland Holdings, said that the Greenland move is an important move in Shanghai to promote comprehensive reform of state-owned state-owned enterprises in accordance with the requirements of the Party Central Committee and accelerate the next phase of SOEs reform. Reforms tailored to local conditions, by introducing new outstanding strategic shareholders to listed companies, support enterprises Further improve the degree of marketization, increase the freedom of management, and accelerate the full release of the vitality of reform.

US White House advisor “anti-bite” states return to work prematurely - Chinane.com
U.S. White House advisors “anti-bite” states return to work prematurely
On July 23 local time, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the United States exceeded 4 million, accounting for 30% of global cases.
For several months, US President Donald Trump has repeatedly asked states to return to work in the country until recently changed their attitude and took the initiative to wear masks in public, while his advisors “bite back” said that some state governments return to work prematurely.
On the 22nd, White House presidential adviser Kelly Ann Conway said at a press conference that some state governments failed to comply with the standards of resumption of work, prematurely restarted such places as bars.
Conway also mentioned that the previous assertion that the president had “absolute power” to decide on the resumption of work in the states was a misleading rumor.
“The president is a federalist and he believes every state has autonomy.”
She defended Trump.
However, the “rumor” in Conway's mouth was made by Trump at the April 13 White House outbreak briefing.
The operation of this self-playing face, was taunted by Internet users as “rewriting history”.
Kelly Ann Conway wants to rewrite history, she's a liar.
Trump called Michigan Governor Gretan Whitmer a dictator because she followed medical guidelines and insisted on stoppage.
Trump wants to push for a return to work so that he can hold rallies.
This is not the first time that Kelly Conway has been controversial.
On April 15, Conway in an interview with Fox News, blow out: “This is COVID-19, not COVID-1, friends!”
She seems to understand the “19" as a version number, being frantically ridiced by Internet users: look at the newspapers without common sense!
Recently, we have seen the impact of cyberattacks on the business world.
Data breaches by companies like JPMorgan Chase, Yahoo, Home Depot and Tagit Department Store have resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars, even billions of dollars in losses.
In a few more such attacks, the entire world economy will collapse.
The public domain is not immune either.
From 2012 to 2014, the US Personnel Management Office had a very serious data breach.
Security permits and fingerprint information were stolen, affecting 22 million employees.
You may also hear that some government-sponsored hackers are trying to influence election results in some countries with stolen data.
The two most recent, one was a massive data theft in the German Bundestag and one was the US Democratic National Committee email theft.
Cyber threats have affected our democratic processes.
And there is a growing trend.
The more advanced the computer technology, the more fragile the means we use to protect data.
In particular, a new computer technology, called quantum computers, leverages the microparticles of nature to dramatically increase computer computing power.
Its computing power is so powerful that it can crack many of the encryption systems we use today.
So are we hopeless?
Should we start packing up electronic survival gear to meet the upcoming data end?
I think that hasn't been there yet.
Quantum computers still exist in the lab, and it takes years to be used.
More importantly, there have been many major breakthroughs in the field of encryption.
For me, this is a very exciting time in the history of secure communication.
About 15 years ago, I learned that we unlocked new skills to create quantum effects that do not exist in nature. I'm very excited.
I am thrilled by the idea of leveraging the fundamental laws of physics to advance the development of cryptography.
Today, a number of selected companies and labs, including mine, are moving this technology into practical applications.
That's right.
We're going to use quantum against quantum.
How to achieve it?
First, let's take a quick look at the world of encryption.
You need a briefcase and you have some important documents to give to your good friend, James Bond, to lock it up and ensure safety.
Because these materials are the highest secret, we're going to use a super advanced briefcase.
It comes with a special password lock that converts the contents of the file into a random number once it is locked.
So you just put the file in, lock it, and this time the file has been converted to random numbers, and you give this briefcase to James.
When the briefcase has not yet arrived, you call him to tell him the password.
Once he got his briefcase, entered the password, and the file was decipherable, it was perfect, you successfully passed an encrypted message to James Bond.
(Laughter) A fun example, but it illustrates the three points of encryption.
Passwords — we call it encryption keys.
You can think of it as a password.
The phone call to tell James the password.
We call it key passing.
This ensures that we can safely deliver the key to the designated location.
and locks used to encrypt and decrypt files.
We call it encryption algorithms.
By key, it converts the contents of the file to a random number.
A good algorithm is able to do this, it is difficult to crack the password without a key.
The importance of the algorithm is that if someone gets the briefcase, opens it, without a key, does not know the encryption algorithm, it can't read the contents of the document.
What gets is just some random numbers.
Most security systems rely on secure key delivery methods, passing keys to the right place.
However, the rapid growth of computing power has jeopardized many of the key delivery methods we use today.
As an example, we now use a very wide range of systems — RSA.
When it was invented in 1977, it took about 4,000 trillion years to crack a 426 bit RSA key.
And in 1994, only 17 years later, the password was cracked.
As computers become more and more powerful, the passwords we need are getting longer and longer.
Now we often use 2048 or 4096 digits.
As you can see, the battle between the crypto and the decryptor is going on and both want to defeat each other.
In the next 10 to 15 years, the arrival of quantum computers will be cracking complex mathematical algorithms that are the foundation of the encryption system we use today.
In fact, quantum computers will turn our safe castle into a one-touch house of cards.
We have to try to protect our castle.
In recent years, many research institutions have emerged to study how to enhance encryption with quantum effects.
People have made some exciting breakthroughs.
Remember the 3 key points of encryption? High quality keys, secure key passing and strong algorithms.
However, advances in science and engineering have jeopardized two of these priorities.
The first thing to do is the key.
Random numbers are the basis of the key.
But today, they are no longer really random.
Currently, we generate keys based on random numbers frequency, generated by software, which we call pseudo-random numbers.
Programs or mathematical methods generate numbers, there are always some, perhaps not so obvious rules in it.
The lower the randomness of these numbers, or, in terms, the lower the moisture they contain, the more likely they are to be predicted.
Recently, some casinos have been attacked, and the way to attack is very creative.
They shoot at the slot machine for a while and then analyze it.
Cybercriminals use reverse engineering to create a pseudo-random number generator behind the turntable.
This gives them a great chance to predict the rotation of the turntable and earn a large amount of money.
Keys are also unsafe.
Having a truly random number generator is important to generate secure passwords.
For years, researchers have been working hard to create truly random number generators.
But most of the designs are either not random enough, or fast enough, or hard to reuse.
But the quantum world is truly random.
It is important to take advantage of this true randomness.
Devices capable of measuring quantum effects can generate continuous random digital streams very quickly.
The casino crime just said is no longer possible.
A number of universities and companies from around the world are concentrating on creating truly random number generators.
At my company, our quantum random number generator was born on an optical table 2 meters long and 1 meter wide.
After that we narrow it down to a box size.
To date, it is already possible to install it on a PCI card and plug it into a regular computer.
This is the fastest, truly random number generator in the world.
By measuring quantum effects, it generates 1 billion random numbers per second.
Today is widely used around the world to enhance the security of cloud service providers, banks, and government agencies.
(Applause) But, even with a true random number generator, we also face the second big cybersecurity threat: the safe delivery of keys.
The current key transmission technology cannot fight quantum computers.
And the quantum solution to this problem, called quantum key distribution, or QKD for short, takes advantage of the anti-intuitively nature of quantum dynamics.
Observing the behavior of microscopic particles will change the particle.
Let me give an example to illustrate.
Let's recall again, to give the password to James Bond.
But this time, we don't call him. We use quantum effects to carry this code with a bunch of lasers and pass it to James through an ordinary fiber.
Let's assume that Dr. Noir wants to get this password.
Fortunately, Dr. Noro leaves an electronic fingerprint while trying to intercept this quantum key, which James and you can see.
The intercepted key will be void.
And the keys left behind provide powerful protection for data.
Because this security mechanism is based on the fundamentals of physics, quantum computers, or any supercomputer of the future, can't crack it.
My team and I are working with many top universities and defense departments to improve this exciting technology and develop next-generation security products.
The Internet of Things (IoT) signalled a highly connected era, with 25 to 30 billion devices expected to be connected to the Internet by 2020.
Trust in these connected device systems is critical if our society is to function properly in the IoT world.
We believe that quantum technology will be very important to building this trust, and it will ensure that we fully enjoy these amazing innovations and those innovations that make our lives colorful.
Thank you all.

Is it reasonable to sue the school after 3 year old child's college playground play was smashed, after being compensated?
2020-07-26 05:01:11 Source: Legal Daily Author: Wang Sishuo Responsibility Editor: Wang Sishuo
The playground was smashed, the child was compensated before the school.
□ The newspaper correspondent Zhao Yifan
The 3-year-old Xiaowen was accidentally hit by softball team Chen mu while playing in a college playground.
After Chen's compensation, Xiaowen's father, Mr. Wen, as the legal representative of Xiaowen, brought the school to the court, asking the school where the incident was in place to apologize for compensation and pay medical expenses, mental damages, etc., a total of 20,000 yuan.
Recently, after hearing the case, the Beijing Haidian District People's Court held that the school had set up a protective net in the playground at the time of the incident, and that Chen had already paid compensation, and that Chen had made compensation, and accordingly dismissed the plaintiff's claim.
Mr. Wen claimed that he took Xiao Wen to play at the school playground during the summer of 2019, when the softball team was training in the playground.
In order to avoid the risks, Mr. Xiao Wen, Man, and many other children and parents are active in safe areas designated by the softball team.
But then, softball team member Chen mu left his hand while pitching, causing the softball to fly across the protective net to the above safe area and hitting the small man behind the head.
Mr. Wen immediately took Xiao Wen to hospital for treatment and was diagnosed as a head trauma.
Mr. Man believes that the facilities of the school stadium do not comply with the relevant safety requirements and do not effectively manage the team and related facilities.
The negligence of the school has led to the events mentioned above, causing immense physical and psychological suffering to the small literary and psychological, and at the same time inflicting greater suffering on their families, for which the school should bear legal responsibility.
In response, the school argued that the school had set up a protective net on the playground and had posted regulations and training notices informing that access to the playground must be kept safe from the training site and reminded that it was safe, and that the plaintiff could not prove that the school had “failed to meet its safety obligations” and therefore did not agree to compensation.
After the hearing, the court held that the site of the incident was open to the public free of charge by the university and that although the school had an obligation to ensure the management of the playground, such a duty of safety was only required to meet the general duty of care.
At the time of the incident, the school set up a protective net in the playground, and had already done its proper safety and security obligations, and Chen also compensated Xiaowen for damages such as medical expenses, transportation costs and other losses in accordance with the compensation agreement reached earlier. The two sides agreed to resolve the dispute at one time.
After the incident, Xiao Wen's parents once again argued for school compensation, and the court ruled out all the plaintiff's claims.
Since the judgement was delivered, neither party appealed, and the judgement is now in force.
According to article 37 of our law on tort liability, schools as administrators of public places have security obligations; in cases where the actions of third parties cause damage to others, the third party is liable for infringement, while the administrator of a public place who fails to meet the security obligations shall bear the corresponding additional liability.
According to the judge, as the administrator of a public place, it is most likely that the actual circumstances of the site as a whole, foresee the risks and damage that may occur, and thus to take the necessary measures to prevent or mitigate the extent of damage and the lowest cost of avoiding and mitigating damage, the law (b) The obligation to guarantee the exercise of social activities shall be imposed on them.
In the present case, the safety obligations of the school should be commensurate with the social activities carried out by the school in respect of unspecified entrants in the playground open to the public free of charge, in particular the adoption of basic safety measures and the obligation to inform about hidden risks.
In judicial practice, it is also not advisable to impose excessive security obligations on managers in public places.
If the school has adopted a protective net and has met its obligation to inform, it can be concluded that the school is not at fault and is not legally liable.
In addition, in the case of third party infringements, even if the administrator of public places such as schools fails to meet their obligations of safety and security, the liability is supplemented by damages, which, under the recently promulgated Civil Code, can be recovered from third parties.
Thus, in such incidents, the victim should not extend the scope of the claim after having received compensation from the direct infringer.
Today I want to show you how we make things in the future.
I believe that soon our buildings and machines will be self-assembled, self-replicated and self-healing.
So I'm going to show you what I think is the current state of manufacturing, and then compare it with some natural systems.
So in the current manufacturing industry, we have skyscrapers — two and a half a million parts — half a million parts, very complex, using new technologies in steel, concrete, and glass.
We have exciting machines that can take us into space — five years, two and a half million parts.
But on the other hand, if we look at natural systems, we have two million types of proteins that folds up in 10,000 nanoseconds, and we can replicate DNA with three billion base pairs in about an hour.
That's the complexity of our natural systems, but they are very efficient, more efficient than anything we build, more complex than anything we can build.
They are more efficient in terms of energy.
They rarely make mistakes.
They can repair themselves and stay longevity.
There's a super interesting thing about natural systems.
If we can convert it into our built environment, there is a lot of potential for the way we build things.
I think the key is self-assembly.
If we want to take advantage of self-assembly in our own physical environment, I think there are four key factors.
The first one is that we need to decode all the complexity of what we're building — that is, our buildings and machines.
We need to decode them into simple sequences — basically the DNA that our buildings operate.
And then we need a programmable part that accepts this sequence and can be used to fold or reinvent.
We need some energy to activate so that our parts can be folded according to the procedure.
We need some type of error correction redundancy to ensure that we build successfully is what we want.
So I want to show you some of the projects that I and my colleagues are working on to realize this self-assembling future.
The first two projects are MacroBot and DeciBot.
These projects are massive, reprodumable robots — 8 feet, 12 feet long proteins.
They are embedded in electromechanical devices, sensors.
You need to decode the way you want to fold into a series of angles — minus 120 degrees, minus 120 degrees, 0 degrees, 120 degrees, minus 120 degrees, minus 120 degrees, — such things; a series of angles, or steering, you can pass this order over with wires.
Each unit gets its own message — for example, minus 120. It rotates, checks if the rotation is in place and passes the sequence to its neighbors.
There are many outstanding scientists, engineers, designers working for this project.
I think this project really reveals: is this really scalable?
I mean, it costs thousands of dollars to make this eight-foot robot.
Can we really expand it? Can we really embed bots in every section?
The next question is to look at the reactivity, or passitively try to make the reorganization programmable.
But it goes a step further, it tries to do the actual calculations.
Basically embedded most computing infrastructure blocks, digital logic gates, direct access to the various parts.
This is with non-doors.
Each door to be used for calculation has a tetrahon and two input tetrahons.
One of them is input from the user, just like you're building bricks.
The other is the input of a brick that was placed before coming.
Then it gives the output of the three-dimensional space.
This means that users build bricks the way they want.
It is calculated based on what you did before and your instructions.
Now it's going to move in three-dimensional space — up or down.
Look at the left, the input of [1,1] equals 0 output, indicating down.
On the right, the input for [0,0] is 1 output, indicating up.
So what this really means is that our structure now contains the blueprint we want to build.
So the information about the things you want to build is all embedded in it.
That means we have some form of self-replication.
In this case, I call it self-directed replication because your structure contains precise blueprints.
If you encounter an error, you can replace a section.
All the local information is embedded in it, telling you how to fix it.
So you have something to climb, can read it and output one by one.
It is directly embedded; there is no external instruction input.
The last project I'm going to show, called Eccentric Chain, is probably the most exciting example of the passive self-assembly system we've seen now.
Its refactorability and programmable make it a completely passive system.
Basically, you have a chain of elements.
Each element is exactly the same, and they are eccentric.
Each chain, or each element wants to turn right or left.
If you want to assemble the chain, you need to program it.
To tell if each unit is going to turn left or right.
When you shake the chain, it folds up and program whatever structure you code for it — so in this case, a spiral, fire, two connected cubes.
Basically you can program in three-dimensional space — or 1D, 2D — this chain is completely passive.
What kind of future does this indicate to us?
I think this tells us about the possibilities of self-assembly, self-replication, and self-healing in our body structures, our buildings and machines.
There are new programmable in these sections.
From which you can get new possibilities for computing.
We'll have space to calculate.
Imagine our buildings, bridges, machines, all bricks can be actually calculated.
What a surprising parallel and distributed computing power and new design possibilities.
This is an exciting potential.
I think these projects I present to you are just a small step towards the future, if we implement these new technologies for a new, self-assembled world.
Thank you.

Under the normalization of epidemic prevention and control, people's enthusiasm for sports and fitness is rising.
With the gradual liberalization of the cross-provincial tourism business, the tourism market is about to usher in a recovery.
Fujian Province has resumed its cross-provincial tourism business on July 21, and the first weekend after opening, Xiamen, as a popular tourist destination, ushered in passenger traffic.
As a popular tourist destination city, there are a lot of tourists arriving in Xiamen on weekends.
Xiamen Railway Station is expected to send 3.7 million passengers by summer, and airport passenger flow is mainly based on students, tourism and family visits.
The tourism market gradually recovered, and in July, Xiamen Airport operated 440 times a day, and domestic flights had recovered to 80% before the outbreak.
The airline has encrypted the air express line from Xiamen to Shanghai, Beijing, Kunming, Xi'an and other major cities, seize the recovery tourism market.
At present, a number of travel agencies in Xiamen have been on-line a number of summer domestic cross-provincial tour products, the team's main outdoor attractions.
In response to summer passenger traffic spikes in railway stations and airports, relevant units sent more manpower in areas where people can gather at check-in counters and security channels. Fujian also optimizes the “eight min health code”, realizing health data sharing and mutual recognition with 31 provinces, promoting tourism The market recovered in an orderly manner.
Liu Dehua Liu Qingyun Can “Disassemble” a New Spark - Xinhuan.com
“Demolition expert 2" recently announced that it will be released on December 24, become the first file file of the new year.
Part 2 is still Director Qiu Litao, Producer and starring Lau Tak Wah, with a new story.
It is reported that the addition of the elements of the “nuclear bomb” in the second part also makes the challenge faced by the demolition experts this time even more difficult. Several shots of a glimpse of glimpse in the forecast have already shocked the scene of the big explosion of mushroom clouds, and the airport engulfed by the fire.
Three years ago, the “Demolition Expert”, produced by the original men, won the box office champion of the year, and won seven nominations at the Hong Kong Film Awards, and Yau Lau Tak Wah also became the gold medal partner in the audience's mind.
This time “Demolition Expert 2", it is also expected that this pair of ace combination can wipe out a new spark.
“Demolition expert 2" tells a new story: former bomb demolition expert Pan Chengfeng (Liu Dehua ornaments) fainted at the scene of the explosion, was listed as a suspect by the police.
In search of the truth, he had to ask for help from Dong Zhuo-wen (Liu Qingyun), his friend, who was a bomb demolition expert.
The female inspector who was eager to break the case, but also Pan Cheng Feng's former girlfriend Pang Ling (Ni Ni Ornaments) was also involved in it.
Still a bomb demolition expert, but from the prosthetic notice, Liu Dehua can feel the complexity of Liu Dehua's new role: broken a leg, put on a prosthetic limb, while being chased by Liu Qingyun, who was also a bomb demolition expert, and was commanded by former girlfriend Ni Ni.
What kind of relationship was the three people, what exactly did Liu Dehua do at the Hong Island Hotel, and what kind of cases were involved in, and what kind of twists his career as a demolition expert went through, and all sorts of mysteries were intriguing.
It is understood that the highlights of the film are the world landmarks in Hong Kong, together with a top-notch special effects production team, bringing a stunning and realistic visual impact.

Chinane.com, July 26 - Integrated Russian satellite network reports that July 26 is Russia Navy Day. The main military parade to celebrate Navy Day was held in St. Petersburg and Kronstadt.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, supreme commander of the armed forces of the Russian Federation, arrived in Kronstadt for the celebration, where 15 ships and submarines were examined.
On July 28, 2019 local time, St. Petersburg, Russia held a grand military parade to celebrate the Navy Festival.
According to reports, Putin congratulated naval officers and soldiers on Navy Day and sailed by dinghy in the Gulf of Finland next to the ship that will take part in the maritime parade, and then examine the receiving troops at the subjective stage.
Putin said that the Russian naval fleet had loaded the latest ships and special equipment, and the level of equipment continued to improve.
“The Russian naval fleet has warships equipped with high precision weapons, strategic diving cruisers and multi-purpose submarines, state-of-the-art aircraft, unique weapons and special equipment,” Putin said at the parade on Russian Navy Day.
On June 24, local time, Russia commemorated the 75th anniversary of the victory of the Patriotic War Red Square military parade.
He also said that the Russian naval fleet will rely on digital and effective defensive means to gain a unique advantage.
The report said that the main naval parade to celebrate the Russian Navy Day was held in St. Petersburg and Kronstadt. A total of 46 ships participated, including “Admiral Kasatonov”, “Lieutenant Admiral Kurakov” large anti-submarine ship, as well as large landing ships, small missiles, frigates, submarine Boat, etc.
Among them, the series was statically displayed next to the Hermitage Bridge in St. Petersburg, most notably the replicated Russian battleship Poltava in the early 18th century.
To avoid the spread of the coronavirus, only local residents and special guests will be able to enter Kronstadt during this year's naval parade.
The last Sunday of July each year is Russian Navy Day.
Yang Hongnian, founder of the Beijing Philharmonic Choir, died at the age of 86 - Chinese.com
Xinjing News (Reporter Liu Zhen) On July 26, the Beijing Philharmonic Choir published an obituary, founder of the Beijing Philharmonic Choir, famous Chinese conductor, music educator, lifelong academic member of the Central Conservatory of Music and professor of command department. He was ineffective in cure due to illness, at 13:55 on July 26, 2020 in Beijing died at the age of 86.
Photo from the official website of the Beijing Philharmonic Choir.
Yang Hongnian was born in 1934, Jiangsu Nanjing, love music since childhood.
In 1951, he was the director of the Nanjing People's Radio Chorus. He was admitted to Shanghai East China Normal University Music Department in autumn 1951. The division learned from Professor Yang Jiaren and German conductor Hezman, and from former Soviet expert Arzamanov to learn the manoeuvre and remix.
In 1958, he taught in the Department of Music, Beijing Normal University of Fine Arts, 1973 to the Central Conservatory of Music, Composer Department and Conductor Department.
Yang Hongnian founded the Beijing Philharmonic Choir in 1983.
For more than 30 years, he has led the choir all over the world and won dozens of awards in important competitions at home and abroad.
He has conducted performances by more than 30 groups including the Central Orchestra Chorus, the Central Folk Song and Dance Company, the Oriental Song and Dance Company and Shanghai Choir, and held a number of symphony concerts and choir concerts.
The works include “Band Training”, “Choral Training”, “Writing Two Songs”, “Children's Songs Collection” and Papers “On Choral Pronunciation Problems”, “On the Acoustic Hierarchy of Orchestral Orchestral Orchestral”, as well as translations of the Chorus Assembly Act and “Debussy's harmonic language”.
Do you know how many flowering plants are there?
There are 250,000 species — at least we know so many — 250,000 flowering plants.
And flowers are a troublesome thing.
It is really difficult to make plant breeding.
It requires a lot of experience and a lot of resources.
Why is it so bothered?
Of course, the answer is, like many other things in the world, gender.
I know what you think when you look at these pictures.
There is a reason why sexual reproduction is so important — there are many other ways in which plants can reproduce.
Can be used in the way of interpolation; can be multiply with strains; pollination can be the same strain.
But they do need to spread their genes mixed with other genes so that they can be ecologically.
That's how evolution works.
Now the way in which plants pass this message is through pollen.
Some of you may have seen these images before.
As I said, every family should have a scanning electron microscope that can see these.
There are many different types of pollen as many flowering plants.
This is actually quite useful for forensic science and so on.
Most of the pollen that causes us to get hay fever comes from plants that use the wind to spread pollen. It's a very inefficient process, which is why pollen always runs into our nose.
Because most of them are abandoned, it is hoped that the germ cells contained in pollen, male germ cells, will happen to fall on another flower.
All grass, which means all grains, and most trees spread pollen by wind.
But most species actually use insects to accomplish this process. In a way this is smarter, because it doesn't require much pollen.
Insects and other species can carry pollen and transfer pollen directly to where it is needed.
Obviously, we note the relationship between insects and plants.
This is a symbiotic relationship, whether it's birds or bees, they all get in return, usually the return is nectar.
Sometimes this symbiotic relationship leads to a marvelous adaptability change — a pretty adaptive change in the Red Skirt moth.
Plants also have harvest, Tian e spread pollen to other places.
Plants have developed, everywhere to create landed runways, bees may be lost among them.
Many plants have some markings that look like other insects.
These are the pollen capsules of lilies, very clever, so when unknowingly insects fall on them, the pollen capsules flip over and hit the back with a lot of pollen, so you can follow the insects to other plants.
There is an orchid that looks like it has a jaw. To some extent, it does; it forces insects to climb over, dip pollen, and take pollen somewhere else.
Orchid: There are at least 20,000 kinds of orchids — the variety is amazing.
They have a variety of tricks.
They must try and attract pollinators to help them through the process.
This orchid, known as Darwin's Orchids, because it was studied by Darwin and gave fantastic predictions when he saw this orchid. You can see a long nectar tube hanging from the orchids here.
Basically what the insects had to do — we came to the flower — it pierced the mouthpiece into the middle part of the way and knew the nectar tube down to get the nectar.
Darwin said, look at the flower, “I guess some things have developed with it.”
There is no doubt that it is insects.
I mean, usually it's all rolled up, but after it straighten, it looks like this.
Now imagine that if nectar, such a valuable thing, is expensive for plants and attracts many pollinators, then, as in human sex, people may start deceiving each other.
They might say, “I have some nectar. Do you want to come and get some?”
This is a plant.
This plant is loved by insects in South Africa. They have developed long mouthers to get nectar at the bottom.
This is an imitator.
This plant mimics the former plant.
There is a flies with a long mouth that doesn't get any nectar from the impersonator. Because the impersonator did not give it any nectar. It thought it could get.
So not only do flies not get nectar from fake plants, but — if you look very close to the top of the head, you'll see there's some pollen that will spread to other plants, if no botanist comes to stick it to a blue card.
(Laughter) This lies all over the plant kingdom.
This flower with black dots: they may seem like black spots in our view, but I tell you, for the proper species of male insects, it looks like two very, very sexy females.
(Laughter) When the insects arrive and land on it, dip themselves in pollen, and of course, these pollen will be taken by it to other plants, and if you look at the scanned electron microscopy that every family should have, you can see actually some patterns, three-dimensional patterns there.
It even makes insects feel comfortable and looks good.
These electron microscopy images — this is an orchids disguised as an insect — you can see that for our eyes different parts of the structure have different colors and different textures, and insects may perceive very, very different textures.
This orchid has progressed to mimic the metallic glossy surface seen on some beetles.
You can see this surface under a scanning electron microscope — this is very different from the other surfaces we've seen.
Sometimes the whole plant mimics an insect, even if we seem to be an insect.
I mean, I think this looks like some kind of flying animal or beast.
Is a wonderful and magical thing.
That's what it's clever. It's called Obsidian.
I think it's sometimes cunning.
For the kind of bee, this looks like another very aggressive bee, which will fly over and hit it many times with its head, try to drive it away, and of course, it will stick it with pollen.
Another thing it does is that this plant mimics another orchid rich in the food that insects love.
But in fact, nothing.
So it deceives on two levels — really incredible.
(Laughter) What we see is Ylang, a part with a strong scent.
I actually smell it before.
These flowers don't actually need to be so gorgeous.
They emit a wonderful scent that attracts any insects that are interested.
This flower doesn't smell so much.
This flower actually smells very unpleasant again, it's evolution, and it looks like carrion.
So flies like it.
Flies fly in and pollinate them.
This is White Star Arum, also known as Dead Horse Taro.
I don't know what a dead horse smells, but this flower may smell very much like.
It's terrible.
Green-headed flies cannot be restrain.
Fly into it, all the way into it.
Spawn eggs on top, think this is a very good carrion, without realizing that there are no eggs, these eggs die here, but at the same time the plant will benefit, because the hair loosens the flies disappear and pollinate to another flower — so wonderful.
This is the taro plant, macarum, spotted Aramus, called Trillium in this country.
I shot this last week in Dorset.
This guy heats up about 15 degrees higher than the ambient temperature — incredible.
If you look inside it, behind the spike is something a bit like a dam, and flies attract heat — this is a boiling volatile chemical, small bugs — they're trapped under this container.
They soared sweet nectar and then all became a bit slimy.
They are covered by pollen at night, sprayed down from them, and the hard hairs we see on it become withered, allowing these pollen bugs to escape — really incredible.
If you think it's incredible, this one is my favorite.
This is the spring feather Philodendron.
Those who come from Brazil should know this plant.
This is the most amazing thing.
Its stamens are about a foot long.
It has a capability that I do not know any other plant has, and when it blooms — this is a spike in the middle — for about two days, it produces some degree of metabolic change somewhat similar to mammals.
And there is no starch, this is the food of the plant, it has something very similar to brown fat burns it at the rate of burning fat, metabolized, about the speed of a kitten.
By weight ratio, twice the energy output of a hummingbird — absolutely amazing.
It also did something unusual.
Not only is it going to heat up to 155 degrees Fahrenheit, 43 or 44 degrees Celsius for two days, but also it will keep constant temperature.
There is a temperature regulation mechanism to maintain a constant temperature.
Why do you want to do this? I hear you guys ask.
You don't know yet, some beetles like to mating at this temperature.
They are drilled, stained with pollen.
(Laughter) Plants fill them with pollen, let them leave and pollinate.
This is a wonderful thing.
Now we think most pollinators are insects, but actually in the tropics, many birds and butterflies also pollinate.
Many tropical flowers are red, because butterflies and birds are similar to us, and we think we can see the red very well.
But if you look at the spectra, birds and us, we see red, green and blue see this spectrum.
Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet rays, they can see a variety of light and dark UV rays.
There are some colors behind this.
“Wouldn't it be nice if we could see those colors,” I heard you ask.
Yes, we can see.
So what do insects see?
Last week I took pictures of these desert lotus, Half-Day, in Dorset.
As we can see, these are small yellow flowers, which are everywhere.
It looks like this in the visible light.
If you remove the red looks like this.
Most bees do not perceive red.
And then I put a UV filter in front of my lens for a long exposure at a specific frequency of ultraviolet light, and I got this picture.
It's like a real marvelous bullseye.
Now we don't know exactly what bees see, and when I call it red, you know what I'm looking at.
We can't know what's going on, be it insects, or in other human brains.
But the contrast looks like this. Highlight from the background.
This is another type of flower — located in different UV frequency zones, with different filters to match different pollinators.
It looks like this.
To avoid thinking that all yellow flowers have this property — there is no damage to the flower during the shooting; just stick it to the tripod and not take it off — in UV light, look at this.
This can serve as a basis for sunscreen, which works by absorbing UV light.
So perhaps the chemicals are useful.
Finally, this is a twilight that was sent to me by Norwegian Bjorn Rorslett — the wonderful hidden pattern.
I like this hidden way.
I think it's poetic. These photos are taken with UV filters, which are primarily used by astronomers to shoot Venus — actually clouds on Venus.
This is the main use of this filter.
Of course, Venus is the god of love and fertility, this is the tale of flowers.
Just as the flowers spent so much effort trying to attract pollinators to accept their invitations, somehow, they managed to convince us of the rich content that we send flowers to each other at birth and death, especially at weddings, and when you think of it, in this moment, the genetic material is migrating from this moment. organisms to another.
Thank you very much.

Chinane.com, Chongqing, July 26 (Reporter Liu Xian) (Reporter Liu Xian) The Chongqing Development and Reform Commission said on the 26th that the city has so far returned 4404 fishermen, accounting for 42.54% of all fishermen involved.
In an interview with China New Network reporter this year, Li Daiguo, 53-year-old Li said that his grandfather was fish in the Longxi River. Since the age of 11, he fishes with his father, shaking a small boat, going along the Longxi River, up to Liangping, Chongqing, down to longevity. Every time he left home for ten days and a half months, relied on fish to maintain family life.
However, since 1997, as the rural population gradually flocked into the town, the number of residents in Gao'an farm town is increasing, and environmental pollution is becoming more serious.
Along the Longxi River, paper mills, chemical plants and farms have been built and polluted the river water.
By 2007 and 2008, the Longxi River became a stinky ditch.
“The scales of fish caught are black, and the inside is black after the split.”
Li Daiguo said that it is more and more difficult to fish after water pollution.
Local efforts began to control pollution in the Longxi River, including drift, river patrol, aquatic resources management and so on.
Li Daiguo also reversed from fishermen and became a member of the river patrol team, managing aquatic resources.
From 1 January 2020, the Chongqing Aquatic Life Reserve and related waters of the main urban areas have been fully banned.
According to data from the Development and Reform Commission of Chongqing, so far, Chongqing has accumulated 3403 fishing vessels, 4643 fishing vessels signed a return fishing agreement, respectively accounting for 63.3% and 86.3% of the total tasks for three years.
4404 fishermen were returned, accounting for 42.54 per cent of all fishermen involved.
Of the 4404 people who had been refunded, 4267 were employed, representing 96.89 per cent of the fishermen who had been returned.
Pension insurance covers 2691 persons, representing 61.10 per cent of fishermen who have returned.
Next, Chongqing will carry out various special remediation actions, accelerate the utilization of the Yangtze River dry shoreline project, complete a new round of survey and carry out the corresponding remediation action, basically complete the “three phosphorus” (refers to phosphate mine, phosphorus chemical and phosphate gypsum bank) remediation tasks, small hydro Rectification work, promote afforestation and green action on both sides of the Yangtze River, strengthen green mine construction, consolidate the dry flow of the Yangtze River The results of the special rectification of illegal wharf and illegal sand mining, and furthering the work of banning and fishing in the Yangtze River basin.
Israel strengthens prevention and control of recurring outbreaks - Chinan.com

Israel Strengthens Prevention and Control of Recurring Outbreaks
In the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak, Israel's prevention and control measures have been effective.
However, with the gradual lifting of prevention and control measures and the recent increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Israel, the Israeli government has taken urgent measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic on several occasions.
On 28 February, the first case of COVID-19 was diagnosed in Israel, with the aim of quickly closing all ports of entry and exit, suspending non-essential trades, shifted schools into online teaching, restrictions on public transport and non-essential social activities, blockade cities with severe epidemics, joint military and police maintenance initiatives.
This series of measures quickly yielded positive results, and by mid-May, new confirmed cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) in Israel had dropped to single digits.
As the outbreak was brought under control, Israel's prevention and control measures were completely unsealed, and since June, the number of new cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) has gradually rebounded.
In particular, after entering July, the spread of the epidemic continues to accelerate.
In recent days, there are more than 1500 new daily cases in Israel for 8 days. As of July 25, the number of new cases reached 916.
As of 25 July, there were 59745 confirmed cases and 448 deaths in Israel.
Faced with the rapid rebound, the Israeli government has repeatedly taken urgent measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On 6 July, after the number of confirmed cases exceeded 30,000, the Israeli government closed public entertainment venues such as gymnasium, swimming pools, bars, nightclubs, and introduced a restricted public transport policy to limit the maximum number of passengers per bus to 20 passengers.
On the 17th, the Israeli government announced a series of new restrictions including the implementation of “Fengcheng” on weekends, stipulating that the “Fengcheng” will be implemented every Friday from 17:00 to 5:00 on Sunday.
During this period, people can go out, but shops, shopping centers, barber shops, beauty salons, libraries, zoos, museums, exhibition halls, swimming pools and tourist attractions will be closed, while basic services such as supermarkets and pharmacies will remain open.
At the same time, gatherings of more than 10 people are prohibited on all dates and periods, gymnasium, studios and other venues will be closed, restaurants and cafes are forbidden, and only takeaway services are allowed.
At the same time, the Israeli population has not paid enough attention to the severity of the outbreak and failed to join forces with the government in fighting the epidemic.
After repeated outbreaks in Israel, many people went to the streets to protest over government measures affecting their own economic interests.
On 11 July, tens of thousands of people held a demonstration in Tel Aviv, arguing that the anti-epidemic policy affected the economy.
On the evening of 21, thousands of protesters gathered in front of Prime Minister Netanyahu's residence in Jerusalem to protest against Prime Minister Netanyahu's ban on restaurants, cafes and other preventive measures without compensating them.
In addition, many people do not observe the rules of wearing masks and maintaining a safe social distance of two meters while outdoors. In order to avoid being fined by the police for not wearing masks, many people only wear masks on their chin or hanging on their wrists.
During the recurring outbreak, schools were a major disaster area for the spread of the coronavirus. According to a recent visit to kindergarten here, the teachers and students of kindergarten did not wear masks as required by the government, nor did they maintain two meters of safe social distance from each other, creating a hidden danger for a large number of teachers and students infected with the virus.
Professor Ellie Waxman, a member of the National Security Council's National Security Council Counter Epidemic Expert Advisory Panel, believes Israel is moving towards a “dangerous situation”, pointing out that Israel's current measures to prevent and control the epidemic are not enough and that all leisure and recreational activities and summer schools should be closed to contain further expansion of the epidemic scatter
Waxman said that Israel lacks an overall plan to combat the epidemic. Parliament and government departments should abandon their own interests as soon as possible, reach agreement on the fight against the epidemic, and formulate clear steps including related restrictions in different departments.
This newspaper, Tel Aviv, July 25 - Reporter Wang Jiong in Tel Aviv
Wu Fengfang, a guyuan farmer in Ningxia, can't but old companion Dai Tianfu. The two people took a car, from their home 20 miles away, rushed to the Liangyun Cultural compound.
Despite these two years of inconvenience, 77 years old wear Tianfu is still counting on “three forks to come here, trick addiction”.
This is a humble yard in Yuanzhou district of Guyuan City, unlike the general farm yard, the yard often spread the flourishing Qin cavity, as well as wonderful shadow plays, embroidery works, traditional Qin cavity, meihu opera, etc.
Yun Liang, the owner of the compound, was a carpenter.
More than 10 years ago, he passionate about shadows and singing plays began planning to build a cultural compound.
With Liang Yun Cultural compound, the cultural life of villagers has become colorful.
The reporter has not entered the Liang Yun Cultural compound, and the tunes of the Qinqian have been passed out.
The Qinqian section is singing Qinqian section for the folks is neighboring villagers Parklane.
She has loved Qinqian since childhood, and now has a little fame in the local area. As long as she has free time, she will come to the cultural compound to perform programs for folks.
Recently, Parklane also played live webcast.
“It is a very happy thing to have a stage for more people to see their performance,” said Parklane.
On stage, the singers glance and the players are tuned, despite being amateurs, but enthusiasm is unabated.
Just like the rustic style of the farm house, outside Qinqian, Liang Yun Culture compound “grassroots” art and non-legacy culture flutter.
The compound also houses more than 300 pieces of farming tools of different years, traditional and hand-made tiles, decoupage, embroidery, and shadows.
Liang Yun led the reporter into the exhibition hall in the hospital, which showed his collection of old objects, old wine bottles, samplets, spinning cars, etc.
Why does an ordinary farmer build a cultural compound?
“Shadow play is my homemirical craft, and I started learning it from the age of 15.”
Liang Yun Cultural College was established in 2012, became the first rural “intangible cultural heritage museum” in Ningxia and is also a demonstration compound for the protection of intangible cultural heritage in Guyuan city.
In addition to Liangyun Cultural Complex, Yuanzhou District of Guyuan City has also emerged more than 120 cultural compounds, 79 folk performances groups, including 50 cultural compounds of a certain scale, such as Shenjiahe Cultural Complex, Wang Yonghong Cultural Complex, Yanglang Cultural Complex, etc., covering all towns and streets of the original state district. Up to 5,000 people.
These grassroots artists are active in the field, enriching the cultural life of the masses and satisfying their spiritual needs.
“As life gets better, traditional culture can't be left behind.”
“Liu's Spy War Drama” returns again to see Liu Yunlong Li Liqun rival “drama” - Xinhuan.com
The 40 episodes of the spy battle drama “win” will be on July 16 in Beijing Satellite TV.
“Winning odds” based on real historical facts, based on the dust for many years, the first available Soviet military archives.
Actor Liu Yunlong, known as the “Spy War Drama”, has challenged a very happy “stuttering agent” in the play.
In recent years, “camouflage” “mask” “kite” and other drama red, all prove that the spy war type drama has a vigorous vitality.
Unlike the previous spy war works, “the odds” look to the world, the story will be extended to the Soviet Far East battlefield.
In the context of the final phase of the 1944 anti-Japanese war, it tells the story of Tang Fei, a clandestine intelligence worker of the Communist Party of China (Liu Yunlong), under the leadership of the secretary of the Chinese underground Party Linhe Provincial Committee and the Director of the Far East Intelligence Agency of the Soviet Union, carrying out the tactical action of “Mudan Ula” of the Soviet Army's Far East Intelligence Agency.
A lot of spy war play, the main character as a senior spy, a appearance is handsome, high IQ, mature perfect image.
But in the view of Liu Yunlong，Such people are not suitable for spy，"Spy should be the kind of people who can not find people in the pile of people，If the appearance is the kind of very handsome image，Hate all people have to pay attention to you，Can still lurk? There is a line in “Kite”, 'You don't come to catch me, I forgot that I'm a KMT, 'spy is going to elite.
So in the “winning odds”, Liu Yunlong intrigued his role as the master Tang Fei designed as a “stuttering agents” with a sense of joy.
The other side of the camp in “The odds” is supported by the police department of the police department, Tako Shibo, played by the Japanese Fukuhara and Li Liqun played by Leung Koan Hwa.
One south and one north two strength to play bone, adding many master tricks to the whole play.
Director Yin Fei used the word “drama” to describe Li Liqun and Liu Yunlong's rival play in the drama. “Absolutely a drama, the two of them were particularly tacit, and the tacit understanding on them was very impulsive for me. Many times their play is “hanging”, for example, we only write half a page of paper, and I don't shout when shooting, and they can play it all the time.”
Mastors do not rob each other, the director does not cheat, when the actors are in the role and ensure their character status, not only from the perspective of the character to shape the role, but also to bring more viewing possibilities to the audience, Yin Fei said such a play is good enough.
In the drama, you can also see many “Liu's spy war play” familiar face, “kite” in the famous, majestic “mountain city F4”, also gathered three in the “winning odds”.
Hou Yu and Liu Mingyang, who played Song Xiaoan and Zhao Jianzhi, again played Tang Fei's left arm.
Director Yin Fei introduced, “These two people have no bad roots, they are only in that era and in that environment.”
Liu Yunlong also took the initiative, “We need to have a human touch. This human sense means that people around me must have good and bad, bad people are enemies, but also to develop them, our team should also grow up.”
The ending of the two people in the drama is also carefully designed by Liu Yunlong, he believes that he will give the audience a satisfactory answer.

4 students drowning dead in Inner Mongolia: The incident sounded the alarm bell - China.com
Chinane.com, Hulunbeir, July 26 (Reporter Li Aiping) On the evening of the 25th, reporters learned from the government of Arongqi in Hulunbuir City, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, that four local students died unfortunate because of drowning.
At 1550 hours on July 24, Aronqi Public Security Bureau 110 received an alarm saying there were six junior high school students drowning in the area.
After receiving the police, the local civilian police rushed to the scene for the first time, rescued two students on the spot. Then local emergency bureau, water conservancy bureau and other units rushed to the scene to participate in the rescue throughout the whole process.
According to the introduction, a total of 80 people, including public security police, forest police, fire, medical care, etc., sent three rubber boats to continuously salvage the surrounding waters, and hired a professional rescue team to arrive at the scene and carry out underwater searches through sonar detection.
The reporter learned that local rescuers found the first student killed at 6:40 on July 25. The second student was killed at 11:30 on 25th. The third student was found at 1240 on 25th. The last student was found at 13:34 on the 25th. The last student was killed. The above four people were salvaged after they were salvaged by the local community. 120 The first aid centre identified no vital signs.
Officials said that the drowning incident sounded alarm bells to the whole society.
At present, local government departments are collating some knowledge on preventing drowning, hoping that the tragedy will not happen again.
Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 25 - Mr Xu Zhengyu, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury of the HKSAR Government, said that Hong Kong's financial markets remain active and functioning in an orderly manner.
He expressed optimism about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
Speaking at a webinar organized by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Toronto and the Hong Kong and Canada Chamber of Commerce (GCA) on the 24th (Toronto time), Xu said that Hong Kong is experiencing a difficult situation due to the “storm of regulations” and the COVID-19 outbreak.
The Hong Kong dollar is stable and biased towards the guaranteed level of the strong exchange.
The banking system has no obvious signs of capital outflow; on the contrary, more than $11 billion has been in inflows since June.
Total bank deposits have also increased over the past few months, with a series of public equity raising activities in the stock market, and market transactions are frequently rising.
Xu said that the COVID-19 has put pressure on the global economy and financial markets, but Hong Kong's fundamental strengths remain unchanged.
Hong Kong's many advantages, including geography, rule of law, high-speed communication, free flow of information and capital, and a simple, low-tax system, make Hong Kong a leading international financial centre.
Xu Zhengyu noted that the HKSAR Government set aside HK$6 billion in the Epidemic Prevention and Prevention Fund and created about 30,000 time-bound jobs in the public and private sectors over the next two years covering diverse skills and qualifications.
To support the development of Fintech, the HKSAR Government has also launched the “Thousands of People Program” to support local fintech companies, start-ups and other fintech-related businesses to create 1,000 new jobs, recruit local talent and enrich the Fintech talent pool in Hong Kong.
Looking forward to the future, Xu Zhengyu expressed optimism about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
He encouraged Canadian companies to take advantage of Hong Kong's strengths and its position as an international financial centre, international asset and wealth management centre and global offshore renminbi business hub to develop and invest in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and its vicinity.
“The Lancet” publication praises China's efforts to combat epidemic encourage countries to learn from their experiences - Chinese.com
As a country with a population of 1.4 billion people, the size of which is similar to Europe or the United States, the COVID-19 has been effectively controlled at this stage, and there is no further large-scale spread, largely contained the outbreak in the country, according to the Lancet magazine 25.
The article said China has invested heavily in domestic research and public health construction for nearly a decade, which has made China more prepared for the coronavirus than it was for SARS.
At the time of the SARS outbreak in 2002, the authors said, China was initially underprepared, especially the pathogen could not be identified.
When the coronavirus was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists were soon able to identify the virus species and shared genome sequencing data with the international community on January 11, 2020.
By the end of January, doctors from mainland China and Hong Kong clarified the clinical features of the virus, warning the world of the threat of coronavirus through research papers published in Lancet.
China has also been at the forefront of vaccine research. The results of early trials of the coronary vaccine developed in China were announced in May and July, respectively, in the Lancet, through close cooperation at the national state of emergency.
China's experience shows that it is important to invest in national health and research systems to effectively improve laboratory capacity.
This is the basis for a rapid and effective national response to health emergencies and global health security.
Other countries, especially low- and middle-income countries, are well worth learning.
In addition, China's experience has shown that strong research is based on strong leadership and determination to make the right decisions based on science to enable COVID-19 to be effectively controlled.
The article emphasizes that governments and their leaders must respect science, understand its values, and act on it in the most beneficial manner for society.
In the early days of the outbreak, China's State Sanitary Construction Commission sent three groups of infectious disease experts to Wuhan to investigate the risk and spread of the coronavirus. Their recommendations provided the basis for the decision of “Fengcheng” in Wuhan on January 23; when some experts proposed the necessity and urgency of building a hospital class, the government made a decision soon and rapid implementation; and the broad participation of communities and the masses has also enabled the outbreak to be brought under control quickly and effectively.
The article concludes by emphasizing that countries need to strengthen global cooperation and joint responses to global health emergencies.

Police said several parts of the crash aircraft were found around the scene of the accident.
The German Criminal Police is investigating the cause of the accident with the Duisburg prosecution and the German Federal Aviation Accident Investigation Agency.
The reporter learned from the Chinese Consulate General in Düsseldorf on the same day that the museum had contact with the local police and fire department. According to the scene judgment, there were no Chinese citizens among the casualties.
Singapore's Ministry of Health announced on the 26th that as of 12:00 on the same day, Singapore had 481 new coronary confirmed cases, 50369 confirmed cases; and 27 cumulative deaths.
The data showed that five of the newly confirmed cases were local community cases, 4 were imported cases, and the remainder were foreign workers living in dedicated dormitories.
The Singapore Ministry of Health said 98 per cent of the new confirmed cases were related to known infections.
Currently, 173 coronavirus patients are still being treated in hospitals, most of whom are stable or improved, and none are in ICU.
In addition, 4648 people were isolated in community facilities.
Foreign workers account for the vast majority of COVID-19 people in Singapore.
According to statistics, 200,000 foreign workers in Singapore live in 43 dormitories for foreign workers, and about 100,000 foreign workers live in other types of dormitories.
The Singapore Interdepartmental Working Group on Immunization Resistance has recently said that the Singapore government is stepping up testing for the last few dormitories for foreign workers with high coronavirus infection rates.
The vast majority of foreign workers will be able to return to work after the testing of all dedicated dormitories, but they are still subject to regular testing of the new crown.
Dapeng Director “Auspicious Ruyi” shortlisted for Jin Jue Award - Xinhuan.com
On July 18, the twenty-third Shanghai International Film Festival announced the official film list of Jin Jue Award.
Director Dapeng's first real-life film, “Good Fortune”, was successfully shortlisted for the Golden Jue Award of the last film festival, while the film officially released its first poster.
Poster Square for Figure
The film Auspicious Ruyi is Director Dapeng's first real-life work, and is also his second association with the Jin Jue Award.
The film tells the story of a comedy director who returned to her hometown in Northeast rural areas, hoping to make the family a new year into a literary film, as a result of a series of accidents.
The family members gathered for filmmaking, completed the final party.
In a movie poster released today, Wang Jixiang, a member of the family, sits in the center of the picture and smoked smoke in the middle of the picture, in the background of the Northeast black land covered in silver, and the prospect is a red lantern that the Chinese must hang on every year.
The red lantern symbolizing festive and reunion formed a huge contrast with the lonely figure of Wang Jixiang, and seems to reveal the complexity and entanglement of this big family relationship.
It is reported that in the film, in addition to the daughter of “Three Uncle” Wang Jixiang played by actor Liu Lu, the rest of the drama was performed by the real director's family. The film's experimental audio-visual style broke the boundary between drama and real, bringing the audience a new immersive viewing experience.
According to the director Dapeng, the creation of “auspicious Ruyi” originates from “a heaven will”, during the shooting family suddenly a series of changes, so that the original shooting plan had to change, no script life was eventually recorded into a movie, but released beyond the design tension.
How does director Dapeng face this “God will”, and how can we continue to meet the changes brought about by this God's will?
There is no doubt that “auspicious and good luck” is full of experimental, almost full of people's lineup and innovative audiovisual style turns life in front of the camera into a movie. Under the package of real images, the audience will also find their own and family shadow from the family presented by the film. The end, evokes a series of reflections.
NEWS.GOV.MO: Enquiry Hotline Statistics of Coronavirus Response Coordination Center (25 July 08H00-7 26 08H00)
From 25 July 08H00 to 26 July 2020 08H00, a total of 292 telephone enquiries were received from to 26 July 2020.
291 enquiries concerning the outbreak have been immediately referred to representatives of relevant departments to follow up as follows:
Health Bureau 271 cases (Involved: enquiries about isolation; search for nucleic acid testing; check two cards; health code; others.)
17 cases of Public Security Police Station (Involving: enquiries on immigration measures; enquire about the immigration measures of Guangdong and Macao two brand vehicles; enquire about Zhuhai Government Hotline; Enquiry on document stay issues.)
MGTO 1 case (involved: enquire about quarantined hotels.)
Education and Youth Bureau 1 case (Inquiries on how Macau students returned to study in the UK.)
1 case of Marine and Water Bureau (Inquiries on whether Hong Kong fishing vessels need to declare to the Marine and Water Bureau and nuclear acid testing.)
At the Barong Cheuk Kang outpost, row chief Yu Wang and a soldier were on duty.
In a place where the average annual temperature is less than a dozen degrees, a simple row of barracks stands at the mountain exit, not far from the barracks, a flag flying in the wind, soldiers are on duty daily in the wind, while regularly patrolling at higher altitudes.
The warriors climbed rocks and steep slopes, need hands and feet.
It was in late July, when flowers were lush in low-altitude areas, while in Parong Chokang, only the ravine behind the barracks had relatively dense green.
The warrior Gao Peng, who has been stationed at the outpost for six years, pointed to the ravine, said that it was their back garden, only in July and August each year to see grass growing slowly, soon after all yellowing and covered with snow.
Walking patrols can take about 9 hours.
In harsh plateau conditions, the soldiers stationed here are always accompanied by snowy mountains and glaciers, and they regularly patrol the higher-altitude pass.
A few days ago, a patrol consisting of eight soldiers, led by instructor Liang Yixin, went on the patrol road again.
Each warrior weighed about 30 pounds, advance to the target point early in the morning.
On the way a warrior, comrades emergency ambulance.
In addition to patrols, the fighters at the Baron Chokang outpost conduct tactical and physical training on a daily basis.
Time is a minute and a second, rising altitude, lower oxygen content and physical overdrafts test the will of the patrols.
They insisted, crossed several landslides, across several emergency beaches.
At 16:00, it was lunchtime for the patrols, they took out their own dry food, sat on the ground at an altitude of more than 5,700 meters, accompanied by rain and snow, and replenished with food.
The fighters at the Batong Chokang outpost undergo tactical and physical training.
During the break, they play cards together, losers have to do push-ups, both entertaining and exercising.
After a short break in the cold winds, they climbed the target point of the patrol, took a national flag at the entrance and solemnly sworn.
Behind the snowcapped mountains, they are tens of kilometres of unmanned zone in front of them, they are the safest guardians of the gates.
Beijing consumption season restart - Xinhuan.com
Beijing city restarted the Beijing consumption season activities in accordance with the principle of “full restart, focus planning, orderly promotion and strict organization”.
July 26th issued 1.5 million government and enterprise vouchers, including 1 million offline food and beverage shopping vouchers, 500,000 smart product vouchers, consumers can receive in JD APP.
Liu Meiying, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce, introduced at a media briefing meeting held on the 25th that the re-start of the consumer season will further reduce the allocation of enterprises on the basis of maintaining preferential subsidies for existing consumer coupon card packages.
Beginning in early August, the government and corporate capital allocation is adjusted to 2:1. For example, if the original consumer receives a card package to the store, if the original consumer can enjoy 120 yuan discount, of which the government subsidized 60 yuan, enterprise profit 60 yuan; after the adjustment government subsidies 80 yuan, enterprise profit 40 yuan.
During the consumer season, the three operators will subsidize traffic and terminal around 5G consumption, further promoting the Beijing 5G new infrastructure and 5G consumption.
Chen Maobo refers to Hong Kong's economy hit by another outbreak - Chinan.com
China News Agency, Hong Kong, July 26 - Hong Kong SAR Financial Secretary Chen Maobo said on the 26th that Hong Kong is facing a new wave of coronavirus (COVID-19), and the commercial contacts and economic activities of the recovery were also hit.
The Government of the Special Administrative Region has reiterated its appeal to owners of all sizes and sizes to reduce their rent and spend time with retailers, restaurants and SMEs.
Chen Maobo published an online article entitled “The Rugged Way of Recovery”.
He said that the recent high number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Hong Kong, the situation is grim, affecting the livelihood of society and also plaguing the economy.
In the case of repeated outbreaks, the first priority is to prevent incoming cases and to process and interrupt the chain of transmission of the virus as quickly as possible; once the outbreak is controlled, economic activity should be resumed accordingly.
He pointed out that in the face of a new wave of outbreak shocks, commercial dealings and economic activities were also hit.
In addition to the spirit of contract, social responsibility is equally important for the business community, especially those groups that receive significant government subsidies under the Employment Protection Scheme.
He mentioned that Hong Kong's economic situation in the second quarter of this year is still very serious, but the contraction seems to have slowed slightly.
On the export side, he believes that Hong Kong's peripheral situation remains grim.
Chen Maobo said Hong Kong's development history over the past decades shows that every crisis hides new opportunities and every difficulty hides the key to future development.
A winter morning a few years ago, in Johannesburg, South Africa, I drove to work and found that the city was shrouded by haze.
I drive through there almost every day, but this time is unusual and I've never seen such a scene before.
Johannesburg is known for its distinctive beautiful skyline, but barely seen that morning.
Soon I realized that what I saw was the serious haze caused by air pollution.
The contrast between the beautiful environment I knew old days and the haze of the skyline at the moment surging in my heart.
I fear that it is possible that once colorful sunset scenery will be swallowed by the dark haze.
At that moment, I felt a strong urge to do something, but I didn't know what to do.
All I know is that I can't just stand idly by.
The biggest challenge is that I don't know about environmental science. Air quality management, or atmospheric chemistry.
I'm a computer engineer, and I'm pretty sure I can't rely on coding to solve the air pollution problem.
(Laughter) What will I do to solve this problem?
I'm just an Ichii people.
Over the next few years, I've learned an important lesson that we should all keep in mind if we want to achieve a better future.
Even if you are not an expert in a particular field, your expertise may contain a solution to the problem in that area.
Sometimes, the unique perspective you hold can inspire unconventional thinking to shape the situation, but you need to be bold to try.
Only then can you know the results.
What I knew at the time was that if I wanted to try to change, I had to know enough about pollution first, so I was back as a student.
I did some basic research and quickly learned that air pollution is the biggest environmental health risk in the world.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), almost 14% of deaths worldwide were caused by atmospheric pollution in households and surrounding areas in 2012, especially in low- and middle-income countries.
Air pollution causes higher annual mortality than malaria and AIDS.
In Africa, premature deaths due to unsafe sanitation, or child malnutrition, are pale in the face of atmospheric pollution, and it also carries enormous economic costs: according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, spending exceeded $400 billion in 2013.
In my work, I explore the technological frontiers of artificial intelligence, including the symbiotic relationship between humans and machines, to find useful foothold and help us make better decisions.
When I think again about atmospheric pollution, things become clear about how to deal with it, and we need to find better ways to make better decisions, given the magnitude of the problem, and synergy is necessary.
So I decided to meet some of the people who work in this field.
I started a conversation with officials in Johannesburg and other surrounding cities, and I joined the local scientific community, and I made some calls to completely strange but relevant people.
These experiences I started to intervene helped me to understand the issue more deeply.
It also helped me avoid the trap that people in my line sometimes fall into when trying to innovate: quickly adopt a technology before they really grasp the problem.
I started thinking, what can I do to improve this situation?
I started asking myself how to effectively integrate my knowledge and skills in software engineering and artificial intelligence with the expertise of the people I contact.
I want to create an online air quality management platform to reveal future pollution trends and make relevant predictions to determine what can happen.
I am sure that my idea can be a realistic solution, but also faced with uncertainty, and I cannot guarantee that it will succeed.
All I have is a specific set of engineer skills, skills acquired from my job. (Laughter) Of course, for those who have been working in the field of atmospheric pollution for years, my skills are entirely new.
I've come to realize that sometimes a novel perspective, a new skill set can spawns something great.
Our willpower and imagination is an indicator that instructs us to cross obstacles and open a new chapter.
I've got a deeper understanding of atmospheric pollution, looking for data on air pollution over the past decade, and weather data from Johannesburg and surrounding areas. After that, together with my colleagues in South Africa and China, I created the Air Quality Resolution Support System and uploaded it to the cloud.
This software analyzes historical and real-time data to reveal trends in pollution over time and space.
We then use new machine learning technologies to predict future pollution days in advance.
This means residents can make better decisions about their daily itineraries and where to settle with their families.
We can anticipate adverse pollution events in advance, define major sources of pollution, so that relevant authorities can direct their operations to adjust their operations.
Through supporting scenario planning, urban planners can also make better decisions on how to expand infrastructure work, such as residential settlements in industrial areas.
We have set up an advance pilot of the technology, running for 120 days, covering the whole of South Africa.
Our expected results have been verified. The predictions we show are closely correlated with the data we collect in the field.
Through our management, we introduced the world's leading, cutting-edge instruments to predict atmospheric quality with unprecedented resolution and accuracy rates, benefiting the city I drove in the recent winter morning. And I said to myself, “Something isn't right, I have to find ways to do something.”
So, the point is: What if I didn't go deep into the problem of atmospheric pollution?
What if I don't focus on the state of the country, but rather hope to be in some places, others, to take care of these things?
What I learned from this is that, as we are fully committed to advancing a cause that we all believe in, it is important to focus on the possibilities of success and consider the consequences of inaction.
We should not be distracted by opposition and resistance; it should inspire us to go further.
So no matter where you are in the world, next time, when you find that some kind of curiosity you are born into is stirred, and it's about what you care about, you have some crazy or brave ideas, even if it's not your field of expertise, ask yourself: why not try it?
Why not brave to come straight to solve the problem? Do your best to your own way?
You may get unexpected joy.
Thank you all.
(Applause)
Taiwan's largest earthquake in the eastern waters of Taiwan this year - ChinaNew.com
China News Agency, Taipei, July 26 - An earthquake of 6.1 magnitude on the Richter scale occurred at 20:52 on the 26th of Taiwan's eastern sea area, the largest seismic level 4, and the whole Taiwan has a sense of seismic. It is the largest earthquake in Taiwan this year.
The Central News Agency, Zhongshi e-News, EtToday News Cloud and other Taiwanese media reported that the epicenter of the earthquake was located 86.5 kilometers southeast of Yilan County Government, that is, the eastern waters of Taiwan, the depth of 53 km.
The Chinese seismological network measured the earthquake to 5.5.
The largest earthquake across Taiwan is: Hualien County Level 4, Yilan County, Taitung County, Nantou County, Yunlin County, Level 3, and other counties and cities measured 1 to 2 seismic levels.
Taiwan's meteorological department pointed out that this earthquake is the largest in Taiwan since this year. It is an invisible belt type earthquake at the border of the plate. Its epicenter has often occurred in the past and has been relatively active since this year.
In the next week, there is still a scale of 4 or more aftershocks.
Many people think that driving is a thing that only those who can see it can do.
Blind people want to drive a car safely alone until now, is also considered an impossible task.
Hello everyone, my name is Dennis Hung, and we built a car designed for people with visual impairments for the freedom and independence of the blind.
Before I talk about this car for the blind, let me briefly say another project I've done is called the U.S. Department of Defense Advanced Research and Planning Bureau Urban Challenge.
It's about making a mechanical car that can drive itself.
You press the Start button, no longer touching anything, and it can reach its destination completely automatically.
In the 2007 Challenge, our team won $500,000 to win the third place in the competition.
Probably then, the National Association of the Blind, or the Blind Association, challenged the design team about who could design a car that would allow blind people to drive independently and safely.
We think we need to try it, because we think, ah, this will be difficult to go.
We already have an automatic car.
We just let the blind man drive inside, then we don't finish it, right?
(Laughter) But we're wrong.
What Blind wants is not a car that can carry blind people around, but a car that the blind can take the initiative to make choices and control.
So we had to give up everything we had to do from scratch.
To test this crazy idea, we designed a prototype car of a small sand truck to test its viability.
In the summer of 2009, we invited many young blind people across the country and gave them a chance to use this car for a ride.
It's definitely a cool experience.
But the problem with this car is that it is designed to allow blind people to drive in very limited environments, like a closed parking lot — even on roads made of red traffic cones.
So with this success, we decided to take the important next step, making a real car that can drive on real roads.
So how does it work?
Well, this is a relatively complex system, but let me explain it, to simplify it.
We have three stages.
We have induction stages, computational stages and non-visual interfaces.
The driver is obviously invisible, so the system must be able to perceive the surroundings and collect data for the driver.
For this point, we use the initial metering element.
It measures acceleration, angular acceleration — just like the human ear, the inner ear.
I combine this information with GPS to predict where the vehicle is.
We also use two cameras to detect the path of the road.
We also use three laser range finder.
Laser scans the environment to detect obstacles — the vehicle passing from the front and rear is accompanied by any obstacles that break into the road, any obstacles around the vehicle.
All the massive information is then aggregated into the computer, and the computer does two things.
First, one thing is to process information to understand the surroundings — which are driving paths, which are obstacles — and transforming that information to the driver.
This system is also very intelligent to calculate the safest driving path.
We can also issue instructions on how to operate the operating procedure of the vehicle.
But the question is: How can we pass information and instructions quickly and accurately enough to make sure he can drive?
To this end, we have designed a number of different non-visual user interface technologies.
The initial three-dimensional flat sound system, vibrating vest, voice gear, leg strap, and even pressure shoes on the foot.
But today we're talking about three of these non-visual user interface technologies.
The first interface is called the driver handle.
This is a pair of gloves, which has vibrating elements in the knuckles so that you can transmit instructions on how to travel — direction and amplitude.
The other device is called the speed shock belt.
This car chair — actually, it's a massage chair.
We disassemble it, we reassemble the vibrating elements of different modes. We let them transmit information about speed and also have instructions on how to use throttle and brakes.
Here, you can see how the computer understands the surroundings. Because you can't see the vibration, we actually installed a red LED on the driver, so he can see what's happening.
This is the sensing data, which is transferred from the sensor to the computer.
So these two devices, the driving handle and the speed shock belt, are very effective.
But the problem is that these are the instructions implied devices.
So that's not really freedom, right?
The computer tells you how to drive — turn left, turn right, accelerate, brakes.
I call this a copilot problem.
So we are avoiding instructions suggesting devices and focusing more on information devices.
A typical example of this non-visual information interface is called empty diagrams.
Think of this as a display for the blind.
This is a small table with a lot of holes on it, and compressed air is excluded from it, so that it can be described as a picture.
So even if you're blind, you put your hands on it, you can sense the path and obstacles.
In fact, you can also change the frequency of release in the air, and possibly the temperature.
This is actually a multidimensional user interface.
Here, you can see the cameras on the left and right sides and how the computer parses and sends this information to the empty image.
So, we're showing a simulation program where a blind man is driving with an empty figure.
This program is very helpful in training blind drivers and quickly testing different theories based on different kinds of non-visual user interfaces.
That's basically how it works.
But this car is a model car, and it won't go on the road unless it's proven to be as safe as today's car, or safer.
I really believe this will happen.
But do societies accept this radical idea?
How will we deal with insurance?
How will we issue a driver's license?
There are many different obstacles behind the technological challenges that we need to address before they really become a reality.
Of course, the main purpose of this project is to design a car driven by the blind.
But the potential more important than this is the great value of the by-products in this project.
A sensor that can be used to see dark, rain and fog.
And this new kind of interface, we can use these technologies to make them safer vehicles for the visual population.
Or for the blind, daily life on household devices — educational facilities, office facilities application services.
Imagine that teachers write notes on blackboard in class, blind students can also use these non-visual interfaces to understand and read what teachers write.
This is extremely precious.
Today, what I have shown to you, is just the beginning.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Marinichev said the change in value was affected by the depreciation of the ruble and the outbreak.
“Service costs are increasing,” he said.
People start spending more time on the Internet due to the outbreak.”
Marinichev does not rule out that annual Internet prices will rise seriously, believing that operators can provide customers with higher speeds and more services to offset dissatisfaction with price increases.

Academician Zhong Nanshan said that if the “Chinese doctor” resonates with foreign audiences, it would be very successful.
During the discussion, Academist Zhong Nanshan also shared his opinions and suggestions on the current international epidemic prevention and control. “I believe people will always be smarter than the virus.”
Academician Zhong Nanshan said that although the virus is difficult to predict, from the primitive society to date, humans have passed a lot of risks. Today, modern society has developed medical science and technology and social management measures, plus medical personnel and even ordinary people around the world have a basic understanding of scientific response to the COVID-19 epidemic. People will no longer be as passive as before, “Next, look at two aspects of work, one is to study how the world has to do. To strengthen cooperation, the second is to focus on the comfort of people's hearts and minds.”

Culture travel “red fruit” poly shaoshan - Xiangtan's first Red Expo - Today's News - Hunan Daily - Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily · New Hunan Client Reporter Jiang Rui Correspondent Xiao Yan
Jiaxing Red Boat Mould, Shaoshan Mao Zedong bronze statue, Yan'an cloth piled flower crafts, Xiangxi Yongshun bacon... July 25, 2020 Hunan Red Tourism Culture Festival opened in Shaoshan.
As one of the main activities, Xiangtan's first red cultural industry expo was held in Shaoshan all tourism consulting center.
The exhibition area red cultural and creative products, revolutionary old local products, and so on, attracted tourists from all over the world to buy.
“The Red Expo is an important platform for exhibitors and enterprises to exchange experiences and explore the development path.”
Xiangtan's first Red Expo executive committee, the Red Expo to “promote red culture to promote the heat up of the Tweet Brigade” as the theme, the total area of the exhibition is nearly 3,000 square meters, set the atmosphere building area, scenic display area and red culture tourism online shopping experience area.
Invitation to Zhejiang Jiaxing, Guizhou Zunyi, Shaanxi Yan'an and other provinces and 137 enterprises and units in Changsha, Zhuzhou, Yueyang, Chenzhou and other places, exhibited 768 kinds of exhibits, including red artefacts, handicrafts, food products, tourist routes, red training courses, red cultural and creative products.
The exhibition area will be on display until July 29.
As the host of the Red Expo, Xiangtan exhibition area highlights.
In charge of the exhibition area, Xiangtan exhibition area is divided into two major parts of red industry, red cultural industry development.
Red Industrial Zone exhibited 31 exhibits from 6 enterprises such as Valin Xiang Steel, Valin Cable, Xiang Electric Power, and Red Cultural Industry Development Zone, Red Cultural Industry Development Zone exhibited red series books, red series of food, red series of cultural and creative products and nearly 200 units.

More than 30,000 cases of new coronavirus confirmed cases in Japan - Xinhuan.com
According to statistics, 239 new confirmed cases in Tokyo on the 26th, more than 200 new cases per day for 6 consecutive days, totals 11214 cases.
In addition, 141 new confirmed cases were added in Osaka Prefecture, 90 in Fukuoka Prefecture and 80 in Aichi Prefecture.
Telecom network fraud crime rises 70% in the first half of the highest inspection summary features - Chinane.com
Chinane.com, July 26 - According to the Supreme Inspection website, in the first half of this year, the national procuratorial authorities prosecuted 58101 people for fraud crimes, up 35% year-on-year.
In particular, fraud is more prevalent in the prevention and control of the epidemic, and the prosecution of fraud perpetrators accounts for 43.4 per cent of the total number of persons responsible for the prevention and control of the epidemic.
The Supreme People's Procuratorate has carried out targeted guidance. Of the ten typical cases involving epidemic prevention and control, there are 9 cases involving fraud offences.
From the case of the prosecution offices in the first half of the year, it appears that there are a wide range of names involving fraud crimes, ranging from national macro policy to the general population, including outbreaks fraud, “medical care care” fraud, “health care products” fraud, “recruitment intermediary” fraud, “routine loan” fraud, fraud in obtaining State subsidy, fraud, and public Family assets thawing fraud, etc., continue to “push out new”, covering education, health care, employment, pension, social security, Many areas such as land expropriation, demolition, precision poverty alleviation and financial credit have not only caused economic losses to the victims, but also seriously affect economic and social development.
In particular, some telecommunication network fraud breaks across national borders, geography and personnel restrictions and are characterized by interlocational, cross-border, remote, electronic payments, and so on.
For example, some set up specialized companies, rent upscale office buildings, set up multiple departments or positions, use a legitimate network platform to publicize, recruit, train and examine recruiters, adopt enterprise operating mode management, wearing “legitimate cloak”, and more confusing.
It is the responsibility of the procuratorial authorities to punish and prevent crimes in accordance with the law and to issue early warning to the public and relevant departments in a timely manner.
In judicial cases, the procuratorial organs carefully carry out their duties, both insisting on maintaining high pressure on fraud crimes, and refining law enforcement initiatives in a targeted manner, and promoting social governance by issuing prosecutorial recommendations, etc.
The procuratorial authorities strictly deal with arrests, prosecutions of fraud cases, evidence, procedures and the application of laws on the basis of facts, and the law as the norm.
In particular, in the case of telecommunication network fraud offences, the central role of electronic data in the determination of fact is being pursued and efforts are made to build a chain of evidence between electronic data, verbal evidence and documentary evidence.
For example, in the case of an epidemic fraud case handled by the Yinzhou District Procuratorate of Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, the procuratorial office intervened early in the first time, from the case to the completion of the case, it took only five days to reflect the attitude and determination to handle strictly and maintain the stability of the society in general.
In reviewing arrests and reviewing prosecutions, focusing on the prosecution of omissions in cases, correcting the omission of 733 people by the public security organs, and correcting the omissions of public security organs, examining and prosecuting the co-perpetrators of 1113 persons.
In the first half of the year, the national procuratorial authorities issued 298 prosecutorial recommendations for fraud offences, promoting joint efforts to prevent fraud and promote deep governance.
For example, in response to the loopholes in the regulation of telecommunications networks, such as telecommunications enterprises, banks and intermediary organizations found in the case, the Guangzhou Procuratorate of Guangdong Province and the Dongguan Municipal Procuratorate promptly put forward procuratorial recommendations, urging the relevant units to strengthen supervision and improve mechanisms to promote long-term system building.
Four is to do a good job of recovering and recovering damage.
Procuratorate departments in various places seize important links such as intervening in the investigation, guide evidence, review and prosecution, and urge the investigating authorities to actively collect stolen money, cooperate with the relevant departments in recovering and recovering damage, and strive to minimize the economic losses caused by fraud crimes to the masses.
If the Beijing Municipal Procuratorate handled by the Beijing Municipal Procurator's Office, the case involved 22 sets of properties waiting for seizure. If the property may be previously disposed of in other cases, the first “suspended execution letter” was issued to the relevant court in a timely manner, suggesting that the court would suspend the execution of the property involved in the case before the crime. Unitary disposal after identification, maximum efforts are made to recover the property involved and recover the damage to the victims.
Prosecutors warned everyone that there is a high level of vigilance against fraud crimes, do not expect to “drop pie in the sky”, nor do you think it is cheap and keep your “money bag”.
Yina Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province: a short apple tree wide out of poverty - Chinan.com

Heat heat, economic daily - China Economic Network reporter went into the village of Yina Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province.
On the sun, villagers Li Yuanzhong hoe grass in the base, although the face was red, but the mouth from time to time hummed a few small songs.
Weining County, where yina town is located, because of low latitude, high altitude, plenty of light, day and night temperature difference, the apple is high sugar content, good taste, in the surrounding area has a certain visibility, but also because of a small head, many spots, has not been able to sell a good price, failed to form an industrial scale.
Yina Town was once a poor township of “Baogu Taro Spring and Autumn”, with a local incidence of 25.8% a decade ago.
In the critical period of fighting against poverty, it is urgent to change traditional farming habits, adjust the industrial structure and increase farmers' incomes.
Chen Chao, party committee secretary of Yina town and a group of people in town after many visits, believes that industrial development can no longer go old.
To this end, Yina Town introduced leading enterprises and modern ways to grow apples.
Hou Jianwen, Deputy General Manager of Weining beyond Agriculture Co., Ltd. from Shaanxi in 2015 came to Yina town research, at a glance at a glance the local planting conditions, starting in 2016 to the local planting of apple trees.
At first, the village mobilized Li Yuanzhong to transfer the land to plant apple trees, and Li Yuanzhong couple committed muttering in their hearts: “We planted apples for so many years, nor saw who kind of apple in the village was rich.”
“All apples are dwarfed apples and will not make the apple tree grow too high.”
What Li Yuanzhong did not expect is that this time apple planting uses a new method, irrigation pipes are paved under each apple tree, water and fertilizer poured together to the root of the tree. When the fruit is collected in autumn, the tractor directly into the orchard, standing can pick fruit.
At present, Apple base has gradually entered the productive period, the market is also as Hou Jianwen expected, Apple is not worried about selling, popular among consumers in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other cities.
Growing Apple industry, let Li Yuanzhong's life have changed, although still planted, but a new source of income.
Li Yuanzhong family has more than 9 acres of land transferred to the apple base. In addition to the guaranteed land transfer fee every year, there are profit dividends after hanging fruit, the couple usually work in the base, “one person can get 80 yuan a day, every year to work.”
Li Yuanzhong told reporters that the profit dividend of more than 2,800 yuan last year, together with the land transfer fee and the work income of both spouses, a family income of more than 80,000 yuan. “Eat and wear without worries, good days have passed.”
“At present, the first results have been achieved, the annual output value of 1 acre of apples is more than 15,000 yuan, is about 10 times the type of corn.”
Chen Chao told reporters that the whole town of Yina currently planted 20,000 acres of apples, 6000 acres in the Zhonghai Village alone, covering 4056 households, 172,000 peasants, including 656 poor households, 2952 people, a year to pay more than 6 million yuan, really realized the base is built at the doorstep, not to work Go outward.
Li Yuanzhong, who is increasingly drum up, began to realize his “wish”.
This year's Lunar New Year, Li Yuanzhong bought a SUV, such as today drove a car to commuting to work, “There are more than a dozen acres of land at home, and the next step to expand the size of the Apple base, all flow to them, income will be more.”

Membrane Separation Technology Helps Crack “Greenhouse Effect” - Chinane.com
Membrane separation technology helps crack “greenhouse effect”
Schematic diagram of new hybrid matrix membrane preparation technology
This news reporter shangrui reported: recently, Tianjin University's atmospheric environment and bio-energy team made significant progress in “membrane separation method to capture carbon dioxide”, successfully developed a new hybrid matrix membrane preparation technology, greatly improve the carbon dioxide capture performance of membrane material.
The results have been published as a cover article in the international journal Greenhouse Gases: Science and Technology.
The “greenhouse effect” is a major environmental problem plaguing human development, and carbon dioxide emissions are responsible for the “greenhouse effect.”
Scientists focus on how to efficiently capture and utilize carbon dioxide emissions from humans.
Membrane Separation Method is an emerging carbon dioxide capture technology that separates carbon dioxide gas with the help of membrane materials, which is energy-efficient and simple to operate.
How to make membrane material “deep breathing”, improve gas separation efficiency, is the bottleneck of carbon dioxide capture using membrane separation method.
The research team of Tianjin University innovative ideas, through repeated experiments to explore the effect of different solvents on membrane gas separation properties.
The results show that the carbon nanotubes are distributed more evenly and “more breathable” in the membranes using N-methylpyrrolidone as the preparation solvent, and effectively improve the gas separation efficiency and rate of membrane material.
The carbon dioxide separation properties of hybrid matrix films prepared with this new technology are close to the current theoretical separation limit of such film materials.
“New technology provides new ideas for capturing carbon dioxide by membrane separation.”
Li Run, member of the Atmospheric Environment and Bioenergy team at Tianjin University, said: “We hope this technology will provide strong support for future coal-fired power plants and chemical companies in handling flue gas, and play a major role in controlling greenhouse gas emissions.”
Before volunteering to fill out, understand what is a professional grade difference - China.com

Before volunteering to do so, understand what is a professional grade difference
Every year, students or parents are not aware of the terminology involved in the voluntary application, and thus affect the voluntary filing.
This year, five universities from Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing University of Science and Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing Forestry University and Beijing University of Chemical Technology jointly issued 2020 admissions policy, eliminating professional grade difference.
What does professional-grade difference mean, and what is the significance of volunteering?
There are three ways to assign professional rules
Experts remind that before filing a volunteer, be sure to read the “Admissions Charter” of your favorite schools, to understand the admission rules of colleges, including regulation ratio, professional allocation rules, etc.
Professional allocation rules, refers to the university after the profile, for professional admission are mainly professional priority, score priority, professional grade difference three ways.
The specific method used by universities will be specified in the Admissions Charter.
But there are also some universities where the principle of admission is the total score priority, there is no grade difference between majors.
That is to say, candidates within the admission range are queued according to the total score, when the score does not reach the first professional volunteer, then see if the second professional volunteer has reached the second professional volunteer, and so on until admission to the last professional volunteer, there is no grade difference between each professional volunteer.
The so-called “professional grade difference” is that when an institution arranges a candidate's profession, according to one or more points published in the admissions charter, to determine the admissions of volunteer candidates from different specialties. This score value is “professional grade difference”.
That is, the difference between the scores of students enrolled in the first professional volunteer and non-first professional volunteers, such as 3 points, 2 points, 1 point, etc.
For example.
Assuming that students are enrolled in college A, 560 points, their professional volunteering are: computer, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering, e-commerce, professional admissions of A colleges to implement professional grade difference, grade difference is 2 points, 1 point, 1 point, 0 points.
In professional assignment, if Xiaoming's first professional volunteer meets the professional admission requirements and the professional planned balance, then Xiaoming is admitted to the “computer” professional; if the computer is not accepted, his score will be subtracted by 2 points, according to the score of 558 as the first professional volunteer for “International Trade” Easy” sorting candidates to determine whether they meet the criteria for professional admission; if still not, score minus 1 point ( (557 points) for the third professional volunteer “automated” admission; if still not met, the score is subtracted by 1 point (i.e. 556 points) for admission to the fourth profession, the subsequent profession will not be reduced if it still fails to meet its professional volunteer, and so on.
Different college professional level difference set
With the popularity of parallel volunteerism, many universities have now abolished professional grade difference, but some universities still retain this method this year. Judging from the “Admissions Charter” published by each school, this year, mainly over 20 universities have set professional grade difference.
For example, Sichuan Agricultural University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Jiangxi Normal University, Chengdu Medical College, Northeast Electric Power University, Jimei University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing University of Technology, Ningxia University, Shandong University of Technology, China Civil Aviation Flight College, etc.
In each of these universities, each university has a different level of specialization.
Some universities have grade differences in every major. For example, Ningxia University, the files of candidates who have been put to the school, decreasing one point in order according to the order in which candidates are enrolled in the professional volunteer order.
Some universities set different professional grade differences between different disciplines.
For example, Jimei University, professional volunteer level difference is 4 points, that is, the first professional volunteer and other professional volunteer level difference is 3 points, no difference between other professional volunteers, is considered parallel volunteer, and the difference between other professional volunteers and the spin-off professional level is 1 point.
When filing a volunteer, candidates and parents must carefully read the admission policy of the reported school to see if there is a professional grade difference, what the form of the grade difference is, while fully considering the score, also have a reasonable analysis of the proposed school and profession, if the institution explicitly adopts a fractional difference in the admissions charter For admission, when choosing a profession, pay attention to the gradient between the major, improve the chances of admission.
