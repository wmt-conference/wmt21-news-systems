Novák helped Trabzonspor to finish in second place, Škoda scored too
Defender Filip Novák helped Trabzonspor to clinch the title of vice-champion by scoring in the last round of the Turkish football league.
His team won 2:1 on Kayserispor pitch and hold behind Besiktas in the 3rd place.
After his transfer from Slavia in January, striker Milan Škoda have scored his 10th goal for Rizespor that escaped although they had been beaten 1:3 on Fenerbahce pitch.
Novák confirmed his excellent striker productivity by scoring the 7th goal in this league season.
In the 63th minute, the Kayserispor goalman only striked fiercely and the Czech football player scored a goal from an angle.
The home team managed to equalize 5 minutes before the end of the match, but Trabzonspor pulled off victory in the 6th minute of the additional time, when successfully finishing a four-on-one break.
Škoda equalised to 1:1 after a solo run at the beginning of the second half-time of the match against Fenerbahce.
Rizespor did not held the tie game for a long time but they did not have to feel annoyed as, due to the opponents' results, they left behind 3 points over the relegation zone.
The competition will be finished by Sunday's duel of Basaksehir champion on Kasimpasa pitch.
Well-hidden Hermit's Cave in forests at Nový Bor was not habitable in fact
In northern Bohemia, located at the foothills of the Lužické Mountains, not far from Nový Bor in Českolipsko, in the forests through which the Count's Path lead, there are hidden a few sandstone rock formations.
Both of natural and artificial origins.
And we will go to a one of them made by human beings.
The place is called the Hermit's Cave.
But in fact, no hermit ever lived there and the cave served as a shelter, or more precisely as a storeroom used probably for keeping corn.
The cave is sculpted from the side of the rock promontory and accessible by stairs from above.
But in fact, you can hardly see it till the last minute.
It is not visible until you see narrow stairs leading to somewhat of a rock gallery from which you can enter the rock itself.
Although it seems as if the storeroom was located far away from people's dwellings, at the time of its formation, there might have been a field where there is the forest now.
"The fact that there is neither a window in the object nor furnaces situated at traditional places, proves definitely that no hermit could ever survive the winter here," historian Kamil Podroužek from the Faculty of Arts of Jan Evangelista Purkyně in Ústí nad Labem explains.
In the one-room object, there is only a stone bench at the back, which probably served for placing dishes.
"I think it was a storeroom where people stored some food or field products," Kamil Podroužek adds.
There are visible tool marks along the caves walls.
Breaking sandstone by a pick was for those in the know quite fast and simple.
One just needed to use chinks effectively and break sandstone off gradually.
We can estimate a date of the formation of the cave on the basis of the length of the chink marks and the way how sandstone was broken off.
It is probably dated at the end of the 18th century, according to the historian.
The cave is free accessible and obviously, judging by the mess inside, someone stays overnight there from time to time.
If you come to the cave from above walking on one of the forest paths and your attention will be atracted by a brooklet flowing below the cave and the nearby Count's Path, then you will surely find also a path leadind downwards.
And on your way from the forest you may be enthralled by the nearby Raven Rocks as well.
Jockey Minařík in induced coma after heavy fall in Germany
"Filip is in good hands now.
The Institute is well-prepared for such cases, aditionally most of the family members are in Hannover.
That makes my situasion and also the care of our daughter Finja much easier," Jezdci.cz quoted Minařík's wife Katja.
"Everyone does their best, Filip needs time to recover now.
There is no use in giving any progosis.
Anyone who has every faced head injuries and patients in induced coma issues knows that the situation can change.
Filip is a big fighter.
We all must be patient now and give him time," the 45-year-old jockey's wife said.
A message calling on financial support of injured Minařík has been posted on twitter by star Frankie Dettori, who won the 7th race King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in Ascot on Saturday, by which he matched legendary Lester Piggott.
Nearly 70,000 EUR have been collected up to now on Gofundme.
The taget amount is 100,000 EUR (2,6 million CZK).
Sassuola's players disallowed four goals by video assistant referee, losing 0:2
Although Sassuola's football players scored a goal four times during Saturday's match in Napoli, they had to accept 0:2 defeat in the end.
All their goals were disallowed for offside by the referee after the consultation with VAR.
According to Italian media, this has been the ultimate technology misfortune, there have never been a team with so many goals taken away by VAR.
"VAR was stricter than a road radar on Sassuolo and they have been punished like no other team before.
New technology breaks records, Gazzetta dello Sport commented.
"Festival of Sassuola's disallowed goals.
Never before had been VAR so strict on a team," Corriere dello Sport added.
Napoli took the lead in the 8th minute on Saturday but after the first half an hour of the match, Sassuolo seemed to equalize.
However, Filip Djuričič's goal was disallowed for offside after the intervention of VAR.
For the same reason, Djuričič's other strikes followed by Francesco Caputa's and Domenico Berardi's efforts were ruled out.
The home team, on the contrary, scored another goal.
Electric vehicles break new record.
There have been most rechargings in history in Czech Republic
"The growth has been caused by 30% rise in the number of charging stations in our network and the trend in more frequent recharging at public stations, and also a faster progress in new e-cars registrations," Tomáš Chmelík, the Head of Clean Technologies department in ČEZ, said.
Other big players demand for their market shares, e.g. PRE or E.ON, electric vehicles producer Tesla, but also supermarkets Billa and Lidl.
Company MOL, on the other hand, represents standard petrol stations operators.
However, the company has not had any numbers so far.
"We only started to build our electric vehicles network last year," the company spokeswoman Jana Jusková explained.
But the Deník's editors exclusively obtained data from all 216 electric stations just operated by company ČEZ.
They show that drivers have taken 13,5 kWh from the stations on average.
That corresponds to about 100 kilometres range with a small electric vehicle.
If we ignore small recharging up 1 kWh, an average recharging lasts two and a half hours.
Overwhelming majority of recharging was made under a free of charge tariff then.
If drivers paid for offtakes, their standard expenses would be around 330 crowns.
Electrical vehicles are popular mainly in the capital city.
In Prague, there are located two of five most used charging stations of company ČEZ, which are even much more popular than regional towns.
Olomouc is a leading town within regions.
On the contrary, the least popular are out-of-the-way charging stations in border areas, for example in Bohumín or Prachatice, which are hardly used all day long.
There have been registered more than 4,000 electrical vehicles in the Czech Republic up to now.
There have been 1,274 new e-cars only during the first six months of this year.
In Deník's large survey called "Moving Czechs", 8% of its readers said that they were thinking of buying a family electronic vehicle.
However, only one third of the respondents know where they could find the nearest charging station in their vicinities.
Not only for better watr retention.
Ecological activists protested in Prague
According to the organisers, government's steps in the field of protection and recultovation of the Czech environment and the climate crisis solutins have been insufficient up to now, the speakers called on the state to solve things more vigorously.
The event called Poslední kapka was participated by the representatives of big organisations, such as Duha Movement, Greenpeace or the Green Party, as well as small local associations.
"We have for example people who have been protesting against Turów mine expansion for a long time, there are people who protest against sandy gravel mining at Uherský Ostroh, there are people who protest against nonsense bulding of reservoirs," Marika Volfová said on behalf of the organisers.
She stated that the protesters' main requirements include creation of a plan to retain water in the landscape, radical change of agriculture policy and subsidies system to support sustainable agriculture and change from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy as quick as possible.
"The government should protect people's interests, not careless and devastating business," she said.
A stand was placed on the Lesser Town Square, with a petition calling on the Czech heads of the state to push through the decrease of emission intensity and recultivation of the Czech soil and landscape.
The participants had banners with mottos such as "Stop feeling blue from rape" or "Less coal, more newts".
Jan Škoda from the association Za vodu pro lidi, who protests against the project of mining sandy gravel in Hodonínsko, arrived at Prague from southern Mravia.
"It is a threat to the source of drinking water for 140,000 people," he said.
He added that the water wells are the 5th largest source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
The place of mining sandy gravel is, according to him, located only about 500 metres from the wells and as the expert opinions say it is sure that the quality of water will be endangered.
Vojtěch Veselý on behalf of the so-called agroecological farmers came from a village in Karlovasko.
He pointed to benefits of small farms which do not prefer high revenues and profits but they supply inhabitants with water directly on the spot.
"Small agroecological farms are capable to feed the whole population, aditionally they do not have such impacts on country life and environment," he said.
Three people died after plane crash in house in Germany
Three people died and two other were injured after an ultralight plane crash in residential building in western Germany today.
According to the regional rescue service, who reported on the accident, there were probably two plane crew members and one woman who had lived in the house among victims.
The aircraft crashed on the roof of the building in Wessel, North-Rhine Westphalia.
Afterwards, the fire spread in the loft appartment which was one of five housing units in the building.
Firefighters managed to put out the flames later.
Deputy commander of the local fire rescue services Robert Meyboom said that both aircraft crew members had probably died.
According to the police, the third victim was a woman living in the house.
The Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ), referring to the Mayor of Wesel, wrote that the woman was a single-mother, whose 2-year-old daughter was rescued with mild injury from the appartment.
Near the accident, there was found an emergency parachute, which probably served as a break parachute system.
The police believe it to comes from the crashed aircraft.
There was the capacity of two people on the aircraft.
The aircraft took off from the airport in nearby Marl.
The Rheinische Post, referring to eyewitnesses, wrote that the aircraft had collided with a hot-air balloon before the crash.
However, this information has not been confirmed so far.
The WAZ, referring to other witnesses, wrote that the aircraft had broken up before the crash.

The bank's spokesman does not know the exact number of the clients whose card payments were double-charged, the problem may relate to just a few thousands of transactions, according to his estimation.
The bank is investigating the root cause of problems.
"That may have been a combination of more factors," Kropík said.

Vojtěch to introduce three-level anti-coronavirus system on Monday
"The levels will be divided region-by-region depending on the strength of the community spread.
We are cooperating with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics on this matter," Vojtěch said at ČT.
It will be the so-called traffic lights, individual regions will be marked in green, orange or red colours depending on the risk of coronavirus occurence.
The Minister added that he was going to discuss regions classification with epidemiologists.
He admitted that currently only Moravskoslezský region would correspond with the orange level and Prague would be close to it as well.
On the map, there will also be measures available for regional public health offices, hospitals, social care facilities and employers.
"We want to solve this on a regional basis as the situation varies region-by-region," Vojtěch said.
Water goblin and Karolínka
When the water goblin Jonáš and the miller's daughter Karolínka falls in love with each other, their lifes are not simple at all.
Jonáš's father, the rude water goblin Hastrbuch, does not approve of their love, Karolínka, on the other hand, does not have a clue that her beloved one Jonáš is not a human being.
What's more, the mill foreman Libor does everything to protect the whole village, and especially Karolínka, against the water monster.
What's wrong with the fact that he will intigue and lie?
The main thing is that he will make Karolínka to leave Jonáš and prefers him, brave Libor.
Shortly after that, everyone in the village knows who's fault is the drowning of the night watcher Konvička, spoiled flour, the fire in the mill and other villainies.
Angry village people organises the water-goblin hunt, and aditionally Jonáš is cursed irreconcilably by a water-goblin curse.
And now Konvička's soul may Karolínka advise!
How to melt the old Hastrbuch's heart, convince village people about Jonáš's innocence, find Jonáš and free him from enchantment?
The fairy tale was made in September 2010, at ČT film studios and outdoor scenes by pond Brzina, in Obděnice, Sedlčansko, and in a beautiful surroundings of the historical mill in Hoslovice.

Disease progress is mostly mild, only 3 % of infected must go to hospital
Either a slighter form of coronavirus has spread across the Czech Republic, or the summer sunshine has improved our immunities significantly.
Isolation wards in hospitals are half-empty, although the number of infected people is increasing.
"The situation today and in April is very different, which is done mainly by the number of people in hospitals," Adam Vojtěch, the Minister of Health, confirms.
It is worth remembering that on 11th April, when the first pandemic wave culminated, everyone was wearing a face mask, the army was testing people, the republic was closed and the Czech people used up dezinfectants a year ahead.
However, 10 people died every day.
Now the number of confirmed cases has increased, but 2 people die of Covid-19 at maximum per day.
The highest number of infected people has still been in Karvinsko, the similar situation is also in Jihlava due to en epicentre of coronavirus in Alzheimer Disease Centre with 57 infected people - 40 clients and 17 employees.
Other old people's home has been closed by hygienists in Černožice, Královéhradecko.
On of the female nurse had a positive test.
"We are tracing contacts, we have restricted movements, we have all hygienic measures," Martin Scháněl, the old people's home director, says.
According to him, none of the home's clients has had symptoms of the disease.
Hygienists are starting with the whole area testing tomorrow, and after that they will make a decision on other measure.
Also hospitals are reacting to the increasing number of infected people.
Today, Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute in Brno has started to operate an automatic camera system at the entry of the hospotal, which can recognise whether people wear face masks.
Hygyenists in southern part of the country have reported a record number of 25 confirmed coronavirus cases - most of which are foreign employees of a firm in Prachatice.
There were 131 new confirmed cases in total on Saturday - that is half of the Friday's number - however, less tests are carried out during weekends.
Debutant champion!
Van den Bergh finished writing fairy tale, he smashed Anderson
Dimitri van den Bergh, the tournament's big surprise, showed en excellent performance also in a duel with the player who won the second most prestigious PDC event in 2018.
The beginning of the duel was mutually equal, the turn happened at 8:7 for the Belgian darts player.
Van den Bergh took a break by 13-dart leg and he got the upper hand since then.
He was virtually crushing his opponent by his play and the much more experienced "Flying Scotsman" could hardly hit doubles.
The way how the "Dreammaker" had him in his pocket was also showed by the fact that disconcerted Anderson hit his first maximum no sooner than in the 24th leg.
Aditionally, the young Belgian managed checkouts excellently.
Last time he was loosing in the 11th leg, but he "caught a big fish" in an unfavourable situation and closed 170.
Anderson was obviously very much frustrated at the end of the duel.
He was rather throwing the darts away while his opponent was sailing to a triumphal victory.
Van den Bergh promptly turned first of three match darts and lived up to his name - he wrote his big dream.
The gain of the trophy named after Phil Taylor is for the Belgian darts even more valuable victory as this has been his first major win.
Still the last player who managed to beat van den Bergh was Karel Sedláček.
Man charged with Nantes Cathedral fire confessed
The fire broke out in the Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul in the heart of Nantes last Saturday and the fire badly damaged original stained glass windows dated from the 16th century and destroyed the organ.
The investigators suspected arson as the fire had spread from three different places in the cathedral.
Police also did not find any signs of burglary in the cathedral.
The accused man, the 39-year-old immigrant from Rwanda, is a voluntary church assistant.
He was arrested by police shortly after the fire breakout but was released afterwards without being prosecuted.
The prosecution office informed that the man, based on new evidence, had been arrested on Saturday again, had confessed and faced the charge with arson.
In case he is found guilty, he faces up to ten years of prison and a large fine.
The man regrets his action, according to his lawyer, and he decided to cooperate fully with police, Le Monde wrote.
Vojtěch: We are to introduce "traffic lights" model for anti-epidemic measures
New system shall be equivalent to a pandemic plan which has been lacking so far, and because of which the goverment and the Ministry of Health have been criticised for.
"The levels will be set out according to the strength of the community spread," the minister explained.
He added that Moravskoslezský region and Prague would be in the middle level of risk currently.
The system has been designed on a regional basis because the situation varies in different regions significantly, he added.
When developing the system, the Ministry of Health cooperated with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (ÚZIS).
According to the minister, the levels will be separate and will include specific measures, either obligation to wear face masks or organising special hospital units.
It was the Minister of the Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) who had called for creating a pandemic plan in TV show Prima Partie, according to which people should be given clear information about what measures they can expect in case the pandemic situation gets worse.
Daily increase in covid confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has risen lately, although the number of people in hospital is still low.
Vojtěch commented that the situation was not much serious and that there was no need to declare a state of emergency or call the crisis team again.
Regarding increasing number of infected people, the government made mandatory the obligation to wear face masks at indoor events with more than 100 people in the whole country again as of Saturday.
From Monday, participation in such events will be limited up to 500 people, now it is allowed for up to 1000 people.
The government's acting got under fire when it was not clear what measures and since when they will be valid or published until the last moment.
"I think that in a situation which is quite tense the heads of the state should, on the contrary, make people feel secure and settle the turmoil," Senator Marek Hilšer said in Otázky.
Measures can differ depending on a region now, for example in Prague the obligation to wear face masks in all health facilities has been aplied since Sunday, e.g. in drugstores or doctors' waiting rooms.
The obligation to wear face masks when going to health and social care facilities or drugstores has been also applied in Liberecký and Ústecký region since Friday.
It has been obliged to wear face masks in Vysočina, Jihlavsko, in indoor public spaces, public transport and health facilities since July 14th.
On the other hand, anti-epidemic measures have been eased in Moravskoslezský region, as well as in Středočeský region in Kutnohorsko.
At the beginning of June, the Czech government also approved the so-called traffic lights for travelling in Europe in which European countries are divided into three groups depending on the level of risk of getting infected with the coronavirus and the rules of entering the Czech Republic from these countries are also specified accordingly.
For countries with medium or low risk, the authorities do not require either negative tests for the coronavirus from Czech citizenships or mandatory quarantine instead as of 15th June.
Those are mandatory upon arrival of the Czechs from the countries with a high risk of getting infected.
At the moment, all EU member states are in the low level of risk now.
Technoparty in Benešovsko continues.
It is playing on one-third capacity, was supposed to end at noon
Hlaváčkova Lhota (Benešovsko) Technoparty at Hlaváčkova Lhota in Benešovsko is still continuing on Sunday evening.
One-third of original 12 music systems are still playing.
As police had estimated at night, about 500 people stayed here after 8 p.m., first rough estimates were three hundred people, there were about 900 people in the morning, Lucie Nováková, the police spokeswoman, said.
Originally, the technoparty was supposed to end on Sunday afternoon, some of the music systems went really mute at that time.
"Some people have left and others are going to leave.
Musical performance is partly still going on.
We expect that music systems will be unpulged and taken down gradually," Nováková said.
"Policemen are still thoroughly checking leaving participants of the technoparty in order to prevent drivers with alcohol or drugs in blood from driving.
Drivers can take preventive breath tests before their departure," she added
Tens of policemen are checking the event, there are also immigration police at the scene, transport and riot police and canine officers with dogs are also standing by.
"During today, policemen checked 470 people moving at the scene and 485 vehicles, 270 drivers took breath tests, six of whom were driving with alcohol in blood," Nováková said.
Altogether, 95 drivers were tested for the presence of narcotic drugs or psychotropic substance in blood by policemen, one of which was positive.
Policemen were also solving 14 driving offences.
On technoparty participants requests, policemen took 300 preventive breath tests and four preventive tests for the presence of narcotic drugs or psychotropic substance in blood.
There were about 2000 people at the scene on Saturday morning.
If the number of the participants did not decrease, police would intervene there.
The Minister of the Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) said that in TV show Prima Partie.
However, the number decreased to 1000 people according to the participants, and police did not consider it necessary to intervene, nor the public health office or the Ministry of Health required any intervention.
On Sunday, the Czech Televison (ČT) reported that the technoparty had spreaded on the neighbouring areas whose owners did not approve of their using for the technoparty.
It is possible that the owners of the neighbouring areas will ask for indemnities.
Techno supporters arrived at the grassland at Hlaváčkova Lhota on Friday evening.
On Friday, police originally guarded the grassland at Blažim in Benešovsko, where a technoparty took place last year.
Blažim is located ca 30 km away from Hlaváčkova Lhota, where the techno supporters gathered finally.
According to Nováková, no one arrived at Blažim.
Viper bite: Girl taken to hospital!
"The first case in this year happened in Železnorudsko.
A girl, born in 2010, was bitten on her foot by a viper and taken to the local emergency by her parents," Mária Svobodová, the regional spokeswoman of the emergency service, told the Deník and added that the child was taken to hospital in Klatovy subsequently.
Viper is the only venomous snake in the Czech republic and it is mainly in Šumava where these animals occur in large numbers, so people should be careful when walking.
However, these snakes are not very dangerous for people.
It is not very probable that a viper will bite you, it is scared itself during the contact with humans.
And if the snake can, it prefers to crawl away with a loud hissing.
A viper only attacks you if it feels very threatened - for example when you step on it.
But even in case that it bites you, it is not a disaster, however its poison can paralyze small mammals very effectively, but it does not kill humans.
This can only happen when a person's body is weakened or if a person suffers from allergy.
Therefore, especially children, elderly people or allergy sufferers are at higher risk.
"After a snakebite, a person often has a feeling of vomitting, sweating, fever, thirst, abdominal pain and diarrhea, debiliated people and especially allergy sufferers can suffer from anaphylactic shock," Miriam Gredová from the hospital in Klatovy said to the Deník.
Man threatened to throw baby out of window
He was pouring wine over a policewoman and hitting her with dishes
A police team entered the appartment and arrested the man after 11 p.m.

The man refused to cooperate with police, he was hitting a police negotiator with dishes, knives and he was pouring wine over her.
He demonstrated his threats by leaning over the window with the baby in his arms several times during the negotiation.
Once he even climbed the window sill where he was staggering.
Police is still investigating the man.
They do not want to publish any further information.

Sapa market place: meat, fish and eggs with unidentified origins found during police raid
"One of the vehicles entering the area was transporting 1320 pieces of quail eggs with unidentified origins, and in unsuitable conditions.
Also these eggs will be eliminated in the rendering plant," the State Veterinary Administration said.
It was found during the inspection of the live fish stand that the seller does not have the certificates of foodstuff origin and that he is not registered for the sale of live fish.
The market place has been considered problematic from a veterinary point of view for a long time.
For example, last autumn veterinarians found an illegal grocery store, with almost half a ton of unlabelled foodstuff without certificates of origin.
It was not possible to identify expiry dates at most of the foodstuff, some products reached their expiration dates and were spoiled.
Five kilograms of cuttlefish passed the expiration date by three years.
Last May, veterinarians and police officers seized 80 kilograms of foodstuff without certificates of origin, among others dried fish, squid or frozen ducks, some of which were moldy.
Putin calls Zelensky before beginning of ceasefire in Donbas, Kreml criticises planned elections
The Russian president Vladimir Putin called his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky about the situation in Donbas, where a new ceasefire is to come into force at midnight.
Putin, according to Kreml's statement, criticised, among others, the Ukrainian Parliament's decision on organising the local elections; Kyjev informed that Zelensky had called on the release of the Ukrainians from the arrest.
The new ceasefire was agreed by Ukraine and Russian's negotiators on Wednesday evening, supported by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OBSE).
The ceasefire is to begin after midnight on Monday, it shall be "full and general" and open the way for implementation of other peace agreements' provisions.
During the discussion with Zelensky, Putin said that the Ukrainian Parliament's decision on organising the local elections went againts the Minsk peace agreement and threatened expectations in the settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
Last week, the Ukrainian Parliament decided that the local authorities elections would not take place in the areas controlled by pro-Russia militants.
Under the Minsk Agreement, it is expected that Kyjev will take the full control of the border of Ukrainian regions under the occupation of pro-Russian separatists again after Kyjev will have provided those regions with broad autonomy and held the local elections.
According to Unian, Zelensky cabinet stated that both politicians had agreed both on benefits of upcoming ceasefire in Donbas and the necessity of taking other measures to support peace in the region, such as battle areas mine clearance or withdrawal of the part of the troops from the frontline area.
Zelensky also asked Putin to release the Ukrainians from the arrest in eastern Ukraine, on the  occupied Crimean Peninsula and even in Russia.
The Minsk Agreement helped stop fighting, however, people are still being killed during occasional gunfights and artillery attacks on both sides of the frontline area.
Since the spring 2014, more than 14,000 people have been killed during the conflict in Donbas.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of military support of the separatists, which has been denied by Moscow.
Zelensky has made the end of war in Donbas his priority, however, there has not been an essential breakthrough in the negotiations so far.

But the championship makes me very happy, I'm grateful mainly for that I set my new personal record by 30 centimetres in long jump.
Then I was happy with my results in pole vault and I was most disappointed by discus throw, in which I was second-rate," he admitted on the association's Facebook profile.
Kateřina Cachová won with more than 100-point dominance on the first day of heptathlon, although she suffered from a wounded ankle on the athlete's foot.
However, she only jumped 570 cm in long jump, she did not throw a javelin 40 metres and she did not join the final 800 metres.
Novotná achieved 5878 points and she beat Kateřina Dvořáková by 241 points.
She succeeded in long jump, 631 cm is the best Czech performance of the year.
"I wished so much those 630 points.
Yesterday, my calf started to make me trouble, anyway I'm very glad that I didn't feel it anyhow and that I wasn't limited by that," Novotná posted on the association's Facebook profile.
Bio LPG arrived in Czech Republic, it guarantees ecological traffic
Liquefied Petroleum Gas, abbreviated as LPG, is a well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
It is popular especially for its significantly lower price compared with petrol or diesel, which is fixed by considerably lower consumption tax, and its another benefit is reduced CO2 emissions per kilometre.
Like petrol and diesel, it also has its ecological alternative - "bio LPG".
However, it is something quite new - it was launched to the European markets two years ago and it arrived in the Czech Republic a few days ago, according to the press release of the Czech LPG Association.
"These days, we have received the first 15 tons of LPG, which will be distributed in the mixture with standard fosile LPG to our petrol stations," Jiří Karlík from company Primagas was quoted by the Association.
However, bio LPG cannot be considered as bioethanol or bio diesel.
According to the Association, from chemical point of view it is similar to standard petroleum LPG, which is refueled by many car drivers nowadays.
That is why it is possible to mix both versions as you choose.
"The only difference between bio and standard LPG is their production," Ivan Indráček, the Association chairman, says about bio LPG.
This emphasises also one of great benefits of bio LPG compared with other alternative fuels.
It can be transported and stored easily, and also distribution infrastructure is relatively good, e.g. compared with hydrogen or electricity.
Currently, the gas is the main by-product during the production of bioethanol from food and sugar cane lefts.
In future, it should be produced itself, e.g. from cellulose biomass, which means wood waste.
Compared with standard petroleum LPG, it comes partly as a by-product during petroleum refining and partly by separtaion during natural gas mining.
As a result, a car operation with bio LPG, on the basis of the production technology and source, is by 40-70% more ecological from the point of view of carbon presence than a petroleum LPG car operation and up to 90% compared with diesel.
Not only CO2 emissions from exhaust pipes is important, but also ecological production of the fuel, the so-called "well-to-tank", (in Czech "od zdroje do nádrže").
One of the current biggest bio LPG producers are petrochemical companies Eni, Total and Neste.
According to the latest update of the National action plan (NAP ČM), also Unipetrol consider the possibility of such a production in its Litvínov refinery.
According to the Association's estimation, about 170,000 vehicles in the Czech Republic use LPG; the Ministry of the Environment estimates a bit higher number in NAP ČM, about 200,000.
According to the Ministry of Transport's statistics, about 6,000 vehicles started to use LPG drive only in the last year.
People can refuel LPG from various operators at about 950 petrol stations in the Czech Republic.
Vojtěch revises numbers of infected people, reproduction number decreases by 1,775 cases
Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch (ANO) ordered the Ministry of Health to revise numbers of people infected by coronavirus.
New statistics were published on the Ministry of Health's website on Sunday.
The reproduction number decreased from 5,254 cases on Saturday to 3479 cases on Sunday afternoon, which makes 1,775 infected people less.
Currently, there have been 3,422 ill people in the Czech Republic.
"Sharp increase in the numbers of cured people has been caused by data revision that hygienists have not managed to update lately," the head of health statistics Jaroslav Dušek said.
By Sunday afternoon, 15,212 people were infected by coronavirus in the Czech Republic, 11,419 people recovered and unfortunately 371 people died of Covid-19.
Mobile voting units or correspondence voting.
Politologist and sociologist searching for better option during pandemic
According to Jan Hamáček (ČSSD), the deputy prime minister and the Minister of the Interior, it is necessary to change the law so that people being in quarantine due to the coronavirus could vote in regional and Senate elections in Octobre, too.
The Parliament could discuss this matter in August or Septembre in a speeded-up negotiations.
He said that in Partie on TV Prima on Sunday.
On Tuesday, he wants to discuss possible solutions with the Parliament parties deputies at the ministry premises.
"Whatever we do, it will in every case mean the change of the election law," Hamáček said.
On Wednesday, the Senate called on the government to find a solution within the valid legal regulations.
However, the minister said that they would have to adjust the law regulations according to which people being in quarantine cannot vote during their health conditions.
The ban on voting shall remain for example for patients suffering from open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop said in TV programme OVM that the possibility of correspondence voting has been posponed since 2004.
Even the current bill, being in the house of reperesentatives, includes its implementation for voting from abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
At the same time, Prokop considers ANO or ČSSD worries (as, based on abroad experience, it would be beneficial rather for other kinds of political parties) about correspondence voting as overestimated.
He is personally against the possibility of electronic voting, which can be misused easily.
Michal Klíma said that now it is necessary to think up ad hoc rules (of voting), which might take place this year already and with as low health risk as possible.
In his opinion, the most important thing is to be prepared for year 2021, when the Parliament elections are to take place in the Czech Republic.
Correspondence voting (whether abroad only or in the Czech Republic as well) is, according to him, one of the working methods.
Another is the above mentioned voting units or for example the possibility of voting by proxy within families.
He added that we had a chance to learn more about how the similar situation - elections during the coronavirus pandemic -⁠ had been solved in Croatia, Poland or France.
This year, elections have been postponed due to the spread of the coronavirus infection in 67 countries all over the world.
Protests in Bulgaria: Demonstrators threw pig ears at government building
The participants of the demonstration against Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov and his cabinet threw pig ears at the government building.
These were other series of protests against "mafia government", which have been taking place in Sofia and other cities for almost four weeks.
The organisers are planning a nationwide blockade on Wednesday, DPA said.
According to Rádio Svobodná Evropa/Rádio Svoboda, in today's 18th consecutive daily protest there were less demonstrators then in the previous one.
At about 8.00 PM, about 300 people gathered, a few streets had to be closed to traffic.
The demonstrators performed a story in front of the government building, acting out a symbolic imprisonment of the Prime Minister Borisov and Prosecutor General Ivan Geshev in connection with arrest of two advisors of President Rumen Radev, who is the Prime Minister's strong political opponent.
Resignation of both men is one of the main protesters' demands.
They also called for abolition of announced health care reform and putting an end to corruption in construction projects on the Black Sea coast.
Today Nikolaj Hadžigenov, the organiser of protests, announced on the state radio that "the culmination of the escalation" in the form of "a nationwide manifestation in Sofia and blockade accross the whole country" will take place on Wednesday.
He repeated the demand for resignation of Borisov and his government, and also the demand for early voting.
The general elections should take place in March 2021.
Borisov had refused to resign.
He explained, among other things, that it was necessary to lead Bulgaria during Covid-19 pandemic and related economic crisis.
However, he replaced five members of his team on Friday, but this concession did not calm the demonstrators either.
Early this week, Borisov's government survived a vote of no confidence in parliament.
Bologna coach Mihajlovič refuses other games without spectators
Bologna football coach Siniša Mihajlovič is fed up with the Italian league's matches taking place without spectators.
The Serbian coach hopes that spectators will return as of the start of the new season.
"What we are performing at the moment is not football.
I am fed up with matches which take place without spectators.
This football is asexual, it brings no emotions, no joy.
The matches are worse than training.
It is terrible to play like this and I think that I am not the only one who thinks that," Mihajlovič said before today's match against Lecce.
The coronavirus pause is followed by Serie A matches in rapid succession, and althgouh they are played no sooner than in the evenings, the players suffer from the heat.
"We play in extremely hot weather every three days.
In such conditions, we can hardly know how the teams are doing.
I wish this season was finished.
We had to take these measures in order to complete the competition but I hope that spectators will be back in September," the coach, who also led Fiorentina or AC Milan in the past, said.
For Mihajlovič, this season is also unusual because he was absent on the bench due to his leukemia treatment for four months.
"Despite my illness, suspension of the league and all other matters, we have managed to take our team's performance to the next level.
We want to grow further and thus we need that the players were mentally stronger," he said.
We are cyber attack target from foreign countries, Iran says
Since the end of June, there have been reported fires and explosions by Iranian military, industrial and nuclear facilities, but also by oil refineries, power plants, factories and businesses.
Some of Iranian authorities said that the fire which had bursted in the uderground space of the nuclear plant in Natanz this month might have been caused by a cyber attack.
The cause of many other incidents has not been explained so far.
Abbás Musáví, the spokesman of the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said, according to Iranian media, to journalists that the infrastructure of the Islamic republic faces "thousands of cyber attacks" on a daily basis.
He added that this had not happened for the first time and that they had managed to fend off most of the attacks.
According to Musáví, there have occured a few large cyber attacks in the past few months, which, based on analysis, have been initiated by "some governments and groups".
However, he did not say any details about possible offenders, according to Reuters.
Musáví also added that the fires in forests, refineries and other places are not rare during summer months.
This month, the Iranian state agency IRNA's article wrote that Iran's enemies, such as Israel and the USA, might have initiated the latest incidents.
None of the countries, however, was blamed for concerete attacks directly by the article.
Iran and the USA broke diplomatic relations shortly after the revolution in 1979, when Iranian militant students had attacked the American embassy in Teheran and had taken 52 Americans captive for 444 days.
Long-term tense relations between both countries escalated in 2018 after that Washington withdrew from the nuclear deal closed in 2015 between Iran and the world powers and imposed sanctions against Iran, which have had hard impacts on its economy.
Another significant escalation occured this year after that on 3rd January the US army had killed Iranian general Kásem Solejmání and Abú Mahdí Muhandi, a member of the Iranian militia leadership.
Then on 8th January, Iran carried out a number of ballistic missiles on the bases in Iraque, where the Americans have been active.
The USA admitted finally that tens of American soldiers had been injured.
Israel considers Iran its arch-enemy and the Prime Ministre Benjamin Netanjahu is the main opponent of the international nuclear deal with Iran closed in 2015.
According to Israeli Prime Ministre, Iran is trying to get an atom bomb, which has been denied by Iran.
Car factory TPCA to extend shutdown period until 25th May
Car factory Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile (TPCA) in Kolín has extended shutdown period due to the coronavirus again.
The production lines will be restarted again on Monday 25th May.
The run-up will be accompanied by tens of hygienic measures, Tomáš Paroubek, the car factory's spokesman, said.
The shutdown has lasted due to the coronavirus pandemic since 18th March evening.
The company originally intended to restart the production on Monday 18th May.
According to Paroubek, the reason of the extended shutdown period is closed borders and dealerships, no one can sell cars.
In Paroubek's opinion, the company will work 100% from the beginning, which means working 2 shifts in one day.
The key firm's markets have been affected by the coronavirus, for example in Italy, Great Britain or Spain.
The Mayor Michael Kašpar (Změna pro Kolín) said that the shutdown in TPCA has not impacted the town life.
"At first, it was obvious that there was no living soul in the town.
But the streets are getting crowded gradually, especially from this Monday, when measures have been released substantially.
So the town is crowded," Kašpar said.
According to him, there have been no troubles with foreign workers staying at hostels.
"We haven't had to solve any trouble matter over the past two months," Kašpar said.
For example, Škoda Auto In Mladá Boleslav, which also had stopped the production due to the coronavirus crisis, restarted the production on 27th April in all three production plants in the Czech Republic.
None of the plants work 100%.
The restart of the production in Škoda has been accompanied by more than 80 hygienic measures.
From Monday night until Tuesday morning, the plant worked on the 3rd, that is night shift, for the first time after the production restart in Mladá Boleslav and Kvasiny.
TPCA have about 2500 employees currently and the company is one of the biggest exporters in the Czech Republic and also employers in Kolínsko.
Bride died of cancer shortly after wedding: Message left to her family
Gemma Sisson fight with insidious cancer for more than two years and when she seemed to overcome it, the illness appeared again.
The 39-year-old woman, who was keen on bodybuilding, was finally taken to a hospice where she married the love of her life.
Unfortunately she was struck down by the illness.
A few hours after her death, a shocking message addressed to her closest ones appeared on her social media Facebook profile.
Gemma Sisson came from Leeds, England, and she loved bodybuilding.
She and her boyfriend Ricky Moore, with whom she lived for more than 16 years, travelled and participated competitions all over the world.
The 39-year-old woman was into sports and lived a healthy lifestyle, however she was diagnosed with cancer in April 2018.
Gemma started with an exhausting treatment, radiotherapy, hoping to recover.
After a few months of treatment it did seem that Gemma managed to fight off cancer succesfully, however in August 2019 cancer came back again and spreaded to her spine this time.
According to the Daily Mirror, the bodybuilder and personal coach had a 10-hour operation of her spine and after that she started with a drastic treatment again.
But everything became vain.
Early this year, on her 39th birthday, she was informed by doctors that she only had been given a few months to live.
In April, the beautiful blond girl decided to go to the hospice in Leeds where her family, who often visited her, even ensured a wedding with her love Ricky.
The marriage lasted for two months.
Ricky took Gemma to a restaurant to celebrate their 2-month wedding anniversary for the last time.
Four days later Gemma died in his arms.
Only a few hours after her passing away, a post on social media written by Gemma to her family appeared on her profile.
"If this was published, that means I had died finally after so many weeks of too long fighting.
Although my heart is broken that I am leaving my beloved alone here, I will be happy that I cannot bear anymore everything what this terrible illness has caused to me.
I cannot thank Ricky enough that he stood by my side all the time and that he gave me so much love and support during that terrible period," she posted on social network adding that pain and suffering ended finally and she found peace.
"I am also grateful for all support which I got from all my followers on social media," she wrote and added that everyone should value and live their lives to the fullest.

Salaries in health service to rise by 5% at maximum next year.
Higher payrise is not realistic, according to Vojtěch
Salaries in health services are supposed to rise by 5% at maximum next year, Adam Vojtěch (ANO), the Minister of the Health, said that in Otázky Václava Moravce in the Czech Televison.
He does not think that the union members' requirements for up to 15% payrise are realistic.
He also said that the state should try to be independent in ensuring protective aids.
Hospitals, according to him, have enough of them in stock now.
"I think that the payrise might be by 5% somewhere," the minister said.
According to him, it is necessary to reflect the current situation, when the coronaviru pandemic and the government's anti-pamdemic measures have had an impact on the collection of health insurance payments since March.
The incomes of the insurance companies decreased at that time.
"In my opinion, payrise by 15% is not realistic at the moment, " Vojtěch said.
An intensive unit care doctor's average month salary will probably reach 88,312 crowns, according to the data of the Institute of Health Information and Statistic of the Czech Republic (ÚZIS), a nurse salary will reach 47,498 crowns.
The difference between salaries of nurses in hospitals and other health care facilities will be up to 7,000 crowns.
It also follows from ÚZIS data that there has not been a lack of hospital nurses any more.
The average wage in the Czech Republic was 34,125 crowns in 2019, according to the data of the Czech Statistical Office.
In June, union members representatives stated that they were going to ask for a minimum payrise by 10% in year 2021, opimaly by up to 15%.
For a long time, they have criticised a significant difference between doctor and state hospitals nurses salaries, where the salaries must follow the salary tables, and by contract wages in town, regional or private hospitals.
That is why they also require that the salary tables for medics would be unified.
The difference between nurses salaries will reach up to 7,000 crowns per month this year.
But e.g. doctors' wages increase faster than salaries last year.
According to Roman Šmucler, the president of the Czech Dental Chambre, union members should be aware of the current situation of the state.
Due to the coronavirus pandemic impacts, the Chambre of Deputies approved increase of the this year's state budget deficit by record 500 billion crowns a short time ago, 1,75 billion of which is to be given as renumerations for hospital and social care services medics.
According to Šmucler, the Health Care Providers Board does not approve of a blanket salary increase next year.
Renumerations, according to him, should be divided by hospitals and health care facilities themselves and extra money should be given by a reimbursement decree.
Vojtěch also said that hospitals had enough protective aids currently.
Pavel Švagr, the president of the Administration of the State Material Reserves (SSHR), said this week that the SSHR does not have a single protective aid at the moment.
It is waiting for completing competitive tenderings.
According to Vojtěch, global suppliers are now capable to deliver goods in better terms than in March, when there was lack of goods.
The state, in his opinion, should try to be as self-sufficient as possible and purchase from Czech firms as well.
Not working smart quarantine to be taken over by army
We are prepared, they say
"The smart quarantine is working, but, of course, there is always something to improve.
We are going to discuss it with the army this evening.
The army works perfectly and it is a question if they should manage everything again," the Prime Minister posted in his Facebook show Čau lidi on Sunday.
According to him, the efforts to connect IT systems and public health offices have failed, they must use more modern methods of working gradually.
The problems, according to the Prime Minister, occured in Moravskoslezský region, which has been on of the main pandemic epicentre currently.
Jan Pejšek, the Ministry of the Defense's spokesman, said to ČTK that he had no information about Sunday's meeting and that the government is to discuss the matter on Monday.
The army is prepared for such a step, according to him.
The smart quarantine project was taken over by the Ministry of Health on 25th May.
Until then, the smart quarantine had been led by the 90-member central management team established as the government's advisory body, which was led by Roman Prymula, the former deputy minister.
The not working project was criticised by the Minister of the Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) on Sunday.
He also poited out that the project might be taken over by the army again.
The shortcomings of the project were also admitted by Vladimír Dzurilla, the government IT and digitalisation representative, who is in charge of it.
"The system is working but we are still working on it.
It developed individually and non-systematically for 20 years, now we are trying to integrate it within just a few months.
It cannot be done quickly.
People working on the hoof, poor hygyenists adapting the new systems and, in fact, debugging on the hoof," he said.
Ostrava Mayor Macura not to candidate again, he does not want to "go stupid in politics"
The current Mayor of Ostrava Tomáš Macura (ANO) will not candidate in the next municipal elections.
The reason is that he does not want to "go stupid in politics," he said to Respekt.cz.
Macura, who is a board member of ANO political movement at the same time, has been the Mayor of Ostrava since Novembre 2014.
The ANO ballot led by him got almost one third of votes in Ostrava in the municipal elections in 2018.
Macura originally wanted to act as the Mayor for four years only.
"I said to myself that I was going to stay for one election period and that, with my business experience, I would try to change everything and put it together," he said to Respekt.
He added that to a certain extent he had been persuaded to candidate in the second election period.
"But it is maximum to me.
I do not want to go stupid in politics," Macura, who in the discussion called himself a bit of an introvert, who dislikes getting often in touch with people, added.
According to Respekt, there have been rumours a long time that Macura might quit ANO movement.
They reminds that Macura have criticised ANO several times, for example for the alliance with SPD movement or for supporting Miloš Zeman in the presidential elections.
He was one of the few of ANO representatives who supported Zeman's opponent Jiří Drahoš.
Macura does not intend to leave ANO movement, which he joined in 2017.
"Until I have a feeling that I can change anything in the movement, that it is not a useless effort and no one tells me what I should or should not do, I do not have an instant motivation to quit," he said to Respekt.
The 56-year-old Macura studied at Prague University of Economics.
Among others, he had worked as the production director of the pharmaceutical company Walmark before he became the Mayor of Ostrava in 2014.
He was a board member in other companies, too.
Uber offering transport services to return to Brno
Uber, the company offering transport services, will return to Brno at the end of July.
It is the consequence of the change of the law, Petr Kratochvíl (ODS), Brno's councillor for transport, stated in the press release on Thursday.
Taxi drivers protested against Uber in Brno, they pointed out that Uber did not meet requirements such as taxi vehicle mark or missing taximeter.
However, the change of the law in July has changed the requirements for running both standard and alternative taxi vehicles business.
Kratochvíl participated in a few negotiations with Uber's representatives in the last few weeks.
"On the basis of them, the company offering services has decided to return to Brno at the end of July.
This step is the consequence of the change of the law, which enables runnig such business by the company legally.
The city was informed about the change and we believe that the company will provide with their services within agreed limits," Kratochvíl said.
Uber operated in Brno in the past.
Taxi drivers protested agaist the company for not marking vehicles as taxi or missing taximetre.
The court issued a preliminary injunction according to which Uber was prohibited to run business in the city.
Brno supported taxi drivers originally, however Markéta Vaňková (ODS), the Mayor of Brno, said at the end of the year that the city would like to take steps to enable Uber to operate in the city.
According to later court decisions, Uber was allowed to run business in Brno but the company did not use the opportunity.
Now it will return on the basis of the change of the law.
Since July, it has been valid that, besides standard taxi vehicles with a light and taximeter, running trasport services only ordered and paid via mobile applications is easier.
Too hilarious party in Brno: chair fell down one meter away from pedestrian on pavement
An office chair was thrown out of a window of an apartment situated on the fourth floor of a block of flats and fell down about one meter away from the pavement in Brno on Saturday evening.
At the same time, a pedestrian, who called police immediately, was walking on the pavement.
The police patrol, just after their arrival at the address in the western part of the city, noticed an opened window, under which the chair was still lying and a few cans and cigarette butts next to it.
"The noise coming out of the fourth-floor room indicated a hilarious party taking place inside.
The policemen entered the hallway outside the apartment and asked three present young men at the ages from 26 to 29 to explain the situation," police spokesman Jakub Ghanem said.
Babiš to discuss request for recall of Rafaj with ČSSD
Prime Ministre Andrej Babiš (ANO) is planning to discuss the request for recall of Petr Rafaj, the head of the Anti-trust Authority (ÚOHS), with social democratic coalition partners on Monday.
The require for the recall of Rafaj has been raised by non-profit institutions at the anti-trust meeting of the government advisory board and also by Ústecký region.
The Social Democrats say that is is utterly necessary to change the head of the authority.
According to information from ČTK, Rafaj was not invited to join the government's meeting on Monday.
His second mandate will end by the middle of next year, he cannot be nominated the third time under the law.
His recall falls within President Miloš Zeman authority.
Apart from the appeal of non-profit institutions, the Prime Ministre received a letter of similar request from Ústecký region.
The reason might be, among others, Rafaj's recent affairs.
In the last week, the Prime Ministre refused to comment the request saying that he would study the materials and the government parties would "take a stand" to the matter.
He also said that he had not discussed the requests with the President, they had not agreed on a meeting anytime soon.
According to the ÚOHS comment, there is no reason for the recall because Rafaj has not been accused of anything.
Last week, portals IHNED.cz and Aktuálně.cz wrote that police were investigating Rafaj's meetings with region representative Jiří Čunek.
They associate the meetings with, among others, the decision on the competition for the project of new controversial hospital in Zlín worth 8 billion, which is being strictly pushed through by Čunek.
Čunek has admitted his participatin at the meetings, they discussed his "senate activities", according to him.
Rafaj says the same things.
The Municipality of Ústecký region called on the government to recall Rafaj at the end of June.
They have also asked for the authority decision-making mechanism reform.
The decision-making of the ÚOHS concerning public orders is not, according to deputy council representative for trasport Jaroslav Komínek, transparent and has signs of wilfulness.
Last March, police intervened at the anti-trust authority due to the competitive tendering for collecting tolls.
This June, Aktuálně.cz informed that Rafaj used the appartments owned by a company of influential backstage ČSSD player Alexandr Čuba.
However, the prepayment fot an apartment in Brno in the amount of 3,5 million was paid from Rafaj's bank account.
Rafaj has been the head of the Anti-trust Authority since 9th July 2009, the former Social Democrat deputy was nominated the second time by the President in June 2015.
So Rafaj's second 6-year mandate will be up in less than a year.
The Anti-trust Act says that the President can recall the head of the Authority on the basis of the government's proposal.
He can be only recalled in case that he does not perform his job more than 6 months or seriously undermines the dignity of his job position or the authority independence and impartiality.
Library employees collapsed due to hot weather in Blansko
Air-conditioning to help.
The new equipment will cost 740,000 CZK and will start to work in the second half of August.
"It is good news to me.
I go to the library with my three children in the centre of Blansko on a regular basis.
But we could hardly stay there during hot months.
There was terrible hot and bad air in the library.
Even air ventilation was useless.
That is why I am grateful for air-conditioning," Petr Novotný, one of the readers in Blansko, said.
According to Lukáš Dlapa, the library's director, the temperatures in the building were often up to 30 degrees.
The southern wall of the building is made of glass and it is like a greenhouse on sunny days.
"Besides, the Sun shines on it due to the curve of the building most of the day.
And it is a big trouble to ventilate individual departments, as all windows must be closed overnight due to safety reasons.
So there is often almost 30 degrees in the library from early morning," Dlapa said.
The highest temperfatures were in the study room and reading room on 3rd floor.
And then in the exhibition rooms and director's office on the upper floor.
There was unpleasant air in the children's department, too, which is located under the roof of the building.
"It happened a few times that the librarians collapsed at work and had to go on sick leaves.
Problems also occured in the culture room during lectures, which have been participated by tens of people.
After a few minutes, one could hardly breathe there," Dlapa commented.
Originally, the town representatives intended to install air-conditioners in all library rooms this year.
Finally, only three of five circuits will be implemented.
"Because of a tight budget, air-conditioners will only be installed in the hottest rooms.
In the study room and reader room on 3rd floor.
Further in the culture rooms and children's department on a higher floor," Jiří Svoboda from the financial division in Blansko informed.
He added that last autumn workmen have installed air-conditioning and have adjusted the wiring in the above mentioned rooms in the first phase.
It cost about 360,000 CZK.
The town library in Blansko has nearly 3,000 registered readers.
From whom about 900 are younger than 15 years.
Chicago support drove coronavirus out.
Crawford to return to game
Not all infected sportsmen reveal the truth.
Especially not players at NHL, which is discreet about the players' health conditions and do not publish anything.
Crawford is one of the few that stood out in a crowd.
The 35-year-old native of Montréal took only place in the first training and after that he was absent in the line-up.
"I would like to inform you all that I have had a positive test for Covid-19, that is why I have spent the last fourteen days in quarantine at my home," he revealed the reason of his absence.
Sports fans needn't worry about his health condition any more.
Crawford is prepared to get into a heavy workload again.
"It is great that I am back.
I will do my best to get fit again as soon as possible," he added.

Thousands protested against Israeli Prime Minister
Thousands of Israelis in a few areas of the country prostested against unemployment, corruption and the way how Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjahu is solving coronavirus crisis.
Manifestations took place, among others, in front of Netanjahu's private family house in Caesarea, near his official residence or in the park in Tel Aviv.
Protests have been taking place regularly for several weeks in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
The participants of the protests call for Netanjahu's resignation because of the trial in which he is accused of bribery and fraud, and also beacase of the way how the government is solving another wave of coronavirus pandemic.

However, after gradual easing of restrictions at the end of April, there was a significant increase in coronavirus cases again at the end of June.
Netanjahu's critics say that the government did not help enough, e.g. the self-employed impacted by the quarantine measures.
The protesters also did not like that the governemnt issued contradictory guidelines in the fight against coronavirus.

End of wasting and spewing out one collection after another
Pietro Filipi to cancel discounts and bet on sustainability
Czech clothes brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and starts to change the strategy radically.
They cancel discounts and do not intend to spew out one collection after another.
The fact that fashion industry belongs to one of the most polluting industries is nothing new.
Billions pieces of clothes end up in incineration plants and rubbish dumps every year.
However, viewing of slow fashion, often disrespected way how people dress up, has been changing quite rapidly over the past years.
About half of Pietro Filipi's goods was sold at full price.
However, they will not just buy the second half which was sold thanks to discounts.
The company do not want to spew out one collection after another and sell products below cost of production at the end of each season.
Aditionally, Naccording to the owner Michala Mičky, the good times of new and old collections and blind following of rapid change in fashion trends have gone.
"Most businessmen count on discounts when buying goods, so the full price includes a much higher margin.
So it is a bit of a cheat actually," Michal Mička, the owner of Pietro Filipi, says.
Aditionally, the company wants to support local business by their attitudes.
"Each of our product is made from carefully selected quality fabrics and designed by local designers.
We put emphasis on that a huge part of our collection would be made up from the so-called basic pieces of clothes - that is clothes which is timeless and seasonless.
The lack of discounts in the segment of premium brands is typical wolrdwide, the product price simply conforms to its quality and thus no discount is needed," Mička adds.
Giant graffiti represents RAF pilot Kurt Taussig
"The task was to create something to commemorate the anniversary of the end of the Second World War.
And I remembered our fighter pilot who fought with the British Royal Air Force in the World War II.
The town managers liked the design," Vacek, who had finished his artwork after fourteen days of intensive work, said.
He used up about 300 litres of paint and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in Teplice-Šanov in 1923.
He left the town at the age of 15.
During the war, the Nazis dragged him to the internment camp due to his Jewish origin, where he was kept for several weeks.
However, he and his brother avoided being taken away to a concentration camp thanks to Nicolas Winton's organisation.
In 1939, Taussig came to Great Britain, where he joined the Royal Air Force (RAF) as a volunteer, and after that he went through pilot training in Southern Rhodesia, Africa, and Palestine.
He joined military campaigns in early 1945.
After the Velvet Revolution, he repeatedly visited the Czech Republic and his native town Teplice, from which he was awarded honorary citizenship.
The 46-year-old Kamil Vacek, who is popular in the field of street graphic arts under the nickname Camo, has been working with sprays in the streets of Teplice for more than 20 years.
He started with graffiti in areas set aside by the then Mayor Jaroslav Kubera (ODS) for this purpose.
Hurricane Hanna reached Texas coast
Hurricane Hanna reached south-west coast of the American state Texas on Saturday afternoon local time (before midnight CEST during night and this morning).
It reached Texas Padre Island, ca 24 km north to the small town Port Mansfield, and weakened to a tropical storm while moving across the land.
According to meteorologists, however, it can pose a great danger for coastal areas inhabitants.
That is because it brought a strong wind and heavy rain; according to AP, together with local floods, there have been reported blackouts and various damaged properties, among others damaged ships as well.
Greg Abbott, the govenor of Texas, issued a disaster declaration in 32 counties in south-west Texas on Saturday and recommended people voluntary evacuations.
The strongest form of warning was issued to people living in the coastal zone between Port Mansfield and Mesquite Bay, but the storm is supposed to affect whole area which is long nearly 500 km before its gradual moving over north-east Mexico.
"Although Hanna is in the category of a tropical storm now, heavy rain and wind, water level rises, dangerous tides and sporadic tornadoes might be threatening," the American National Hurricane Center (NHC) warned.
This morning local time (afternoon CEST) the storm was moving in the area of US-Mexico border accompanied by wind of 85 kph.
On Saturday, Hanna became the first hurricane of this year's hurricane season in the Atlantic Ocean.
Over the Gulf of Mexico it was accopmanied by wind of up to 145 kph, however the wind decreased to 112 kph gradually when moving towards the land, which weakened Hanna from the hurricane category again.
Authorities made an appeal to people to stay at their homes during the storm and continue on keeping health measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
Texas is among the American states which have been impacted by Covid-19 the hardest.
Given the current safety measures and the importance of keeping distance, possible evacuations is a big challenge.
Hotels, schools and gymnasium were turned in temporary shelters.
In Texas Hidalgo County, there was also one of the buildings turned in a shelter for evacuated people who had positive coronavirus tests or were exposed to coronavirus infection in other way.
Local authorities asked all evacuated people to take face masks and desinfection gels with them, if possible.
"It is not over us yet at all.
We are expecting catastrophic floods," Chris Birchfield, who works for the National Weather Service (NWS) in Brownsville, was quoted by AP.
Forecasts say that there migh be up to 300 mm of rainfall in just a few hours in some areas, in some cases almost 500 mm, which, together with sea level rise, could cause flooding of many coastal settlements.
Zeman to grant rank of general to Colonel Lipka
President Miloš Zeman is going to grant the rank of general to Colonel Pavle Lipka on Wednesday.
The estimated events overview of The Ministry of Defense shows that.
The reason for granting the rank of brigade general to Lipka is his deputy commander appointment in Alliance's Multinational Division Northeast in Poland in August.
Lipka has been working as a deputy commander of the Czech Land Forces so far.
It is the Czech government who suggested that Zeman should grant a rank to him.
At the end of August, Lipka is going to replace brigade general Karel Řehka in his position as deputy commander in Alliance's Multinational Division Northeast in Elblag, Poland, which commands the Alliance's advanced presence troops in Poland and Baltic.
In March, Řehka became director of the National Cyber and Information Security Agency (NÚKIB).
The government suggested that President grants Lipka the rank of brigade general.
According to the Act on Professional Soldiers, a higher rank can ge granted to a soldier for a period of his or her performing an elective position or for a period of performing a service duty which requires a higher rank to be granted.
The rank of general is equal to the rank of a deputy commander of the Alliance's division.
A soldier who is granted a rank has the same rights and obligations as if he or she was appointed the rank.
However, he or she is not entitled to a salary adjustment which would correspond to such a rank.
Granting a rank lasts until the end of a reason for which he or she has been granted the rank.
"Colonel Lipka is profesionally prepared and he serves as an example for his subordinates.
He participates in performing duties of the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic significantly, including cooperation with foreign allies and ensuring the participation of the Army in campaigns abroad," the Ministry of Defense commented the promotion proposal in June.
The promotion ceremony will take place at Prague Castle on Wednesday at 12.30 PM, the Minister of Defense Lubomír Metnar or Chief of the General Staff of the Czech Armed Forces Aleš Opat will participate.
EU member states have coronavirus standards for air travel
EU member states have agreed on common hygienic standards for air travel which might help reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The German Minister of Transport Andreas Scheuer informed about it.
The agreed standards include keeping social distancing or wearing face masks when travelling on planes and at airports, middle seats in planes, however, will not have to stay unoccupied.
Reuters informed about it.
"I am glad that my co-workers have approved the German proposal for Europe and that we were able to agree on those common standards," Scheuer said at the European air travel conference.
The German Ministry of Transport added that the agreement had been closed by officers and that it would have to be formally approved by ministres subsequently.
The agreed measures include requirements for wearing mouth and nose protection by passengers who are 6 years and older, keeping recommended distance during safety checks and check-ins at the airport.
There must be guaranteed enough fresh air in planes and all information must be available in several languages.
Airlines will also be allowed to sell middle seats.
Common standards, which have been agreed on by the officers, keep at least some of airlines' requirements.
Since there used to be confussions caused by different standards.
Record-breaking temperature in arctic Svalbarg, nearly 22 degrees measured
"There was a 41-year-old record temperature in Longyearbyen," Norwegian Meteorological Institute posted on Twitter.
The temperature reached 21,7 degree Celsius early in the evening, which was a record-breaking temperature by 0,4 degrees compared with the temperature measured in 1979, they added.
Longyearbyen with about 2,000 inhabitants is the largest town in Svalbarg, it is located about 1,300 kilometres away from the North Pole.
Svalbarg is getting warmer faster than almost any other place on the Earth.
This fact significantly intesifies the danger arising form warming of other Arctic areas  -⁠ from Alaska to Siberia, it is stated in the last year's report of the Norwegian Centre for Climate Research.
The average temperature in Svabarg, according to them, has increased by three to five degrees since the 70s.
It might increase even by ten degrees by 2100 if the emissions of greenhouse gases will not decrease.
The temperature rise can cause thawing of permanently frozen soil in Svalberg, which will threaten the stability of many buildings, roadways or airports and may cause even more avalanches and landslides.
The climate warming is also treatening the Arctic fauna, such as polar bears or selas, which are dependent on the ocean ice cover.
British travellers from Spain to have 2-week quarantine
The British cabinet also called on citizenships to avoid all travels to Spain which are not necessary because of a high risk of the spread of Covid-19.
The restriction does not mention Canary and Balearic Islands, however people have to isolate themselves for two weeks after returning from these destinations, too.
The new rule will go in force at midnight.
"It is our highest priority to protect the public health.
We have made the decision to prevent from possible spread of the coronavirus in Great Britain," the British diplomacy stated in their statement.
"We have always made it clear that in case it is necessary we will remove a country from the list of safe destinations," they added.
As the British newspaper Metro wrote, the newest announcement will affect travel plans of thousands of the British.
Actually, Spain belongs to very popular holiday destinations.
The British are, among others, worried if they will receive sick leave payments in case they will have to isolate themselves for 14 days after returning from their holidays.
For example, Neil Hunter from Sittingbourne booked a 10-day stay in Lanzarote, the family should have flown on Tuesday.
They ordered the package tour in Decembre.
"The whole family should have left, my wife Amanda and daughter Bethany, but honestly, I don't have a clue what there will be after this announcement.
I work as a engine driver and I don't think that my employer will accept the fact that I spend two weeks in isolation after my return," Hunter was quoted by Metro.
In connection with Spain, there exist worries that the country is at the beginning of the second wave of the pandemic.
There have been confirmed over 900 new cases per day over last two days.
Some local authorities have made coronavirus measures stricter, e.g. Catalonia is trying to restrict the whole night life and prevent people from gathering.
The Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs has newly pointed out to an increased risk of infection in Catalonia, Aragon, Basque and Madrid area.
Governemnt to discuss model for electricity purchase from Dukovany
The government is going to discuss a model for electricity purchase from new planned block of the nuclear plant in Dukovany on Monday.
The bill involves that in case the purchase price is higher than the market price of generated electricity, the difference will be paid by all consumers via tariffs.
In the second case, if the purchase price is lower than the market price, the impact on cusumers will be different.
Generated electricity is non-regulated part of the total electricity price for consumers.
Both Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry Karel Havlíček (ANO) and energy company ČEZ stated earlier that the more probable possibility was that people would save money thanks to electricity construction.
On the other hand, analytics point out that the electricity prices long-term outlook on markets is always unsure, which has been shown a few times.
The intention had been critised by ecological organisations.
"The purchase price can be both below and over the price of generated electricity.
The total impact when the regulation will be applied might be both negative and positive.
The impact will be divided among customers based on circuits breakers - at lower consumption or based on electricity consumption - at higher electricity consumption," as it is written in the background materials of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MPO).
In May, Havlíček said that he supposed that the wholesale electricity price would rise and people would profit from Dukovany building.
Otherwise, the impact will be in tens of crowns per family per year, which, according to him, is far less than people pay by invoices for electricity to support the so-called supported sources every year.
He estimated earlier that the purchase price would be between 50 to 60 EUR (ca 1320 to 1600 CZK) per MWh.
Estimated material is not included in any amount proposal, it will be included in a purchase agreement.
The current price for electricity on Prague Energy Exchange in year 2021, to which traders are stocking up the most now, is about 45 EUR (ca 1190 CZK) per MWh.
"At the difference between purchase price and the generated electricity price in the amount of 10 EUR, the surcharge of an average household consuming 3,3 MWh per year - which may corresponds to a 4-member household, standardly equipped with electrical appliances including an electric hob and oven, which, however, does not use electricity for heating vytápění and cold water heating - might be nearly 100 CZK/year," it was written in the MPO's backgroung materials for the government.
"We live in a very turbulent period.
The coronavirus pandemic has shown how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider a long-term market prediction of market prices as an utter speculative matter," the Executive Director of Energy financial group Tomáš Voltr said to ČTK earlier.
The bill estimates that the purchase would be done by the MPO, or, to be more precise, an appointed legal person owned by the state for an advance agreed amount.
An agreement between an investor and the state, guaranteeing conditions of electricity purchase, would be closed for at least 30-year period, with a possible prolongation up 10 years, and repeatedly, but no longer than as of the end of operating low-carbon production.
A low-carbon production plant is defined by the bill as an electricity production plant with a nuclear reactor which is connected electric with installed capacity of minimum electric power 100 MW after 2030.
Havlíček said earlier that the new Dukovany block should have electric power of 1200 MW and produce 9 TWH of electricity per year, which would correspond to one tenth of estimated consumption in the Czech Republic.
The block should be activated in 2036.
The model of financing new Dukovany block was approved by the government on Monday.
The equipment should be funded interest-free by the state, it is calcukated with a 2% interest rate after the activation.
The opposition do not approve the model of financing, they are not also glad with the possibility that Dukovany would be constructed by Russian or Chinese firms.
The state should contribute to the construction by 70%.
The rest should be funded by company ČEZ, which will also pay all other possible expenditures.
The CEO of ČEZ Daniel Beneš said to ČTK in May that he would expect the total amount of the block construction would be, considering current prices, about 6 billion EUR (approximately 162 billion crowns).
Agreements between the state and ČEZ on the new Dukovany block construction will be signed on Tuesday.
Ministry for Regional Development withdrew travel industry support material in media in amount of 2 billion
The material according to which the Ministry for Regional Development (MMR) planned to spend 2 billion crown for advertisements on holidays in the Czech Republic in media, on the Internet and billboards, has been withdrawn from the comment procedure by the authority.
Minister Klára Dostálová (ANO) told SeznamZprávy.cz they they were still working on the material.
Portal Zdopravy.cz pointed to the document in eKlep (electronic library of legislative process) on Friday.
The Ministry justified the plan because of the slump of travel industry due to the coronavirus.
Also media have suffered losses during the corinavirus crisis.
The proposal has been criticised by both the opposition and travel industry representatives.
According to the proposal which is available on webpage hlidacstatu.cz, the MMR planned to give money for commercials on television, radio stations, press, Internet, billboards or advertising spaces at railway stations via the state agency for support of travel industry CzechTourism.
Television would get the largest amount of money, namely 700 million crowns.
Most of it would receive private televisions Nova and Prima.
Printed daily and weekly newspapers would get 400 million and the same amount would the MMR give for PR articles, advertising banners and videos on the Internet webpages.
Radio stations would be given 350 million for media campaing, most of which would be given to private stations as well.
The ramaining 150 million  would be used for outdoor advertisements on billboards, LED displays and advertising spaces at railway stations or the underground.
The campaign for support of travel industry in teh Czech Republic Kampaň was supposed to start in mid-August and last one year.
"We are still working on the matearial, for sure it has not still the form in which we could present it," Dostálová said without any details to portal SeznamZprávy.
The material has been criticised by the opposition, according to the leader of TOP 09 Markéta Pekarová Adamová the media from trust funds of the Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO) would profit from the campaign.
"I strongly believe that this pretentious contempt will be punched in autumn elections," she posted on twitteru.
Dostálová denies that it is not, in fact, support for media impacted by the crisis.
"It can be also a coincidence, I don't know anything about media support," she told to Deník N on Friday.
According to her, the budget of 2 billion is indicative.
"We are, of course, still counting that, it can be more or less.
It is a working material," she added.
The media campaign for support of home travel industry does not make any sense to the initiative Zachraňme turismus.
"We want 2 billion for firms in the field of travel industry, not a useless advertising campaign," head of the initiative Tomáš Barčík said on Sunday.
If there are the 2 billion crowns in the state budget, they should be given to firms, not to media, the initiative writes in an open letter to the government.
Bouillon of life, cock of beers and death as culm
Also the third album called A smrt je stéblo trávy is posthumous by a Brno poet, unflagging organiser of cultural events and editor of Jaroslav Erik Frič, who also died a year ago, on 24th May.
It is the 5th item in Frič discography and like the previous titles, also in this one the main emphasise is put on Frič poems of which he is an excellent interpreter himself.
Frič, born in 1949, was, of course, influenced by the American beat generation, however, he found also his own inspiration, originally narrated experiences and also very inward manifestations of faith.
But he was miles apart from any campaigning, if he spoke or wrote about faith, the God, he was always very discreet, nonaggressive, absolutely tolerant.
When speaking of this, I recall Bohuslav Reynek (in contrast to e.g. Jan Zahradníček), masters will forgive me.
Frič album offers author reading records from 2006, but also performances with musicians, who always accompanied him very sensitively, whether violoncellist Josef Klíč or Honza Bartoň and Vítězslav Holata.
I will help myself - gladly - by words of Ostrava poet Petr Hruška about Frič long poetry compositions.
"It could be felt proud and never ending bitterness," Hruška writes, "with our world endangered by Armageddon.
The world that si more and more falling into apathetic consumer vainness and greediness, that is more and more receding from what its soul was made from - from the secret of faith, humility and human presence.
It was heard nostalgia from the one who knew that hardly anoyne cared the values for which it had been created for, but who also knew that it was just due to common lack of interest that it was impossible to give up of them.
The poems reminded that perhaps one would have to lose all what was valuable to him or her, but it was not important how they would lose it.
If they sell their souls to common decadence, resign sceptically, fall silent fearfully or stay in calm and proud standing on what they believe and love till the last moment."
Paroubek is not my advisor, Hamáček says
Former Prime Minister and chairman of the Czech Social Democratic Party (ČSSD) Jiří Paroubek is not the social democrats' paid advisor.
Tha party's chairman and Minister of the Interior Jan Hamáček only communicates with him and reads his opinions and articles.
Hamáček stated that on today's televison show Prima Partie.
The information that Paroubek is Hamáček's advisor appeared on SeznamZprávy.cz on Friday.
"We send a text message to each other from time to time, he sometimes sent some material to me and I read it," Hamáček said today.
He added, however, that this was not a kind of any official and paid co-operation.
According to him, ČSSD do not have funds to waste them for similar purposes.
"Well, I sometimes read his opinions, but there are many people like that," he said.
In the following discussion with ODS deputy Jana Černochová the Minister said that lots of ODS members still "listened to the various Václav Klaus's points of view bluntly".
According to him, this is all right because he (Klaus) is an experienced politics and former party chairman, and the same is true for Paroubek.
He said that the fact that the media was making too big of a deal out of it was the sign of that year's cucumber season.
SeznamZprávy.cz wrote on Friday that Paroubek acted as Hamáček' unofficial consultant.
It also wrote that Petr Benda, the former chairman of the local party section in Ústecký region, who was in touch with Paroubek and acted as vice-charmain of his political party LEV 21, was trying to achieve the fourth post in the ballot.
Today Hamáček said that he would not comment on the composition of the ballot until it was ready and approved.
Duplantis is one mile ahead, it is kick in pants, Swede's challenger laments
It is the 22-year-old American pole vaulter who has ambitions and potential to belong to the new winner's biggest opponents.
He knows yet what it is like to beat 2 years younger Duplantis, he beat him at the NCAA's meeting last year.
"We already fought last year when he was the winner and I was the second one, then we switched.
Both were very good fights," Nilsen, who won by making 5,95 metres performance, describes.
But Duplantis has been rising to fame since then and he is hasn't a serious opponent among pole vaulters at the moment.
Aged only 26, he became a world champion, he jumped over 6,17 metres in Torun on 8th February this year, and he jumped 1 centimetre more in Glasgow a week later.
"He was able to jump 6 metres at the age of 18 when he finished college," Nilsen, who is the same age, told the World Athletics web.
"It was evident that once he would grow up, he would increase all his potential and talent ten times.
20 years is a good age to achieve the world record," he thinks.
Although the number of Nilsen's successes is considerably lower than those of Duplantis, the American has similar aims.
He showed his possibilities at NCAA's competitions, which he won regularly, he achieved his personal record with 5,93 metres at one of them this February. Last August, he got the gold medal at the Pan American Games in Lima, in 2017 he made it to the American team at the World Championship, where he was placed 13th.
His next milestone is trying the Diamond League for the first time.
"For sure, my priority is to get to the professional range and compete as much as possible at the Diamond League, because you can get a reputation there," he realises.
"If you are able to get success at this level, then you can undoubtedly have results also at events such as the Olympic Games, the World Championship or the Pan American Games."
However, these events have been postponed due to the pandemic, which has given Nilsen and other pole vaulters time to improve themselves.
But will that do to catch up with Duplantis, who is able to change easily the Olympic Games info just trying hard to achieve a silver medal?
"We all are trying to catch up with him, but I don't think that it will be possible anytime soon," Nilsen thinks.
"That guy has been jumping since he was 16 and he is one mile ahead of everyone in training."
And he will want to be even more ahead before the Olympic Games in Tokio in 2021.
Woman spent thousands of her son's disabled pension.
She is to be brought to justice
The money, which the 33-year-old man is given as state disabled pension, is mainly for the improvement of his life's quality.
The woman charged of embezzling faces up to 8 years in prison.
The man was placed uder judicial interdiction by the court for his bad health condition and his mother was appoitned the curator, who, among others, was supposed to manage her son's money.
"The woman used a part of her son's money to her own need from half of Novembre 2013 till this January and robbed her son of 440,000 crowns," Dana Ladmanová, the police spokeswoman, said and poited out that it was is an aggravating circumstance that the woman had a specific obligation to defend the injured's interests as his curator.
The woman had opened a bank account for her son according to the court's decision but she let his disabled pension send to her account.
"After she had paid all necessary expenses related to her son's stay at hospital and purchase of essential medicines, she used the money left for the purchase of a vehicle, electrical aplliances and housekeeping," it is written in the indictment.
The woman confessed that she could not use the son's money to her own need.
She argued anyway that she used the money to manage to pay household expenses.
"It was hard for us to manage to pay all things related to housekeeping.
We never bought anything above standard.
I always bought things which my son would approve.
I considered the money as the money of the whole family.
I did not know that I had commited a crime," the woman explained to police.
She promised to return the money to her son.
North America has been settled for 30,000 years, scientists say after tools found
The founds from cave Chiquihuite in state Zacatecas, Mexico, include 1,930 tools made of limestone, including smooth blades which may have been used for cutting meat, and sharp articles which might have served as spear or lance points.
Scientists found that the oldest articles are old 33,000 to 31,000 years.
"There are only a few such old articles.
But they are here," an archeologist Ciprian Ardelean from the University of Zacatecas and the main author of on of two studies on this topic, which have been published in the magazine Nature, said.
The youngest tools is old 12 500 years.
According to experts, the people from cave Chiquihuite, located at high altitude, lived fo long 20,000 years there.
So far wildely accepted scientific theory said that the first humans of Homo sapiens walked accross a land bridge from today's Russia to Alaska about 13,500 years ago.
Archeological discoveries, including spear points used for killing mammoths and other prehistoric animals, have found that this Clovis culture spread out accross the most area of North America afterwards.
However, there have appeared flaws in this model, after finding a few ancient settlements, which were two or three thousand years older.
In the second study published in the magazine Nature there was written 42 different sites accross the entire North America, which prove human presence on the continent even before 26,000 to 19,000 years.
Scientists think that  a small group of people might have come to North America earlier than they had thought up to now.
Some of the people may have arrived by ships.
"It is obvious that people were in America long before the growth of the so-called Clovise culture," Ruth Gruhn, an anthropologist from the University of Alberta in Canada, commented the new discoveries.
Demand for air tickets fulfilling optimistic scenarios so far, sellers say.
Prises are decreasing gradually as well
Air tickets sales are increasing in the Czech Republic every week.
Compared with last summer, the demand has still been about 50%, however it is increasing every week by up to 20%.
According to sellers, the development after the crisis is fulfilling the most optimistic scenarios.
Prises of air tickets are decreasing gradually as well.
According to sellers, especially the countries located in southern Europe belong to the most popular destinations.
According to Kiwi.com, Spain, Italy and Greece are among the leading countries.
Letuška.cz portal's best sellers are flights to Split, Croatia.
Greta Britain is another very popular country, which, of course, has always belonged to the most frequented destinations.
The average price of air tickets is also decreasing.
The average price on Letuška.cz portal was about 6,250 crowns in the middle of the month, by 3,000 crowns less year-over-year.
This has been caused mainly by increasing demand for European destinations, which now makes up about 85% of sales.
But the prices of flights to some European destinations are decreasing as well, for example the prices of flights to Spain or Italy have decreased by about one fifth over the past weeks.
The crisis has also affected customer behaviour, who are now buying air tickets much earlier than before, because they are afraid of the next coronavirus situation development.
Accroding to previous information from Kiwi.com, the period of buying an air ticket before the flight has become shorter by approximately ten days year-over-year.
"This confirms the future trend that people will book air tickets in much shorter periods, they will require much more flexibility, they will take lower risks," Michal Šindelář, the Vicepresident of Products in Kiwi.com, said.
The current average booking period before the flight is 21 days.
Together with the growth, the number of renewed airlines flying from the Czech Republic is increasing, too.
At Prague Airport, airlines are operating regularly scheduled flights to more than 60 destinations at the moment.
This includes about half of the destinations compared with the last summer season.

Indoor air is up to five times worse than outdoor air
Both air refreshers and deodorants are bad for our health
Not only poor quality of outdoor air but also the quality of indoor air are threats to our health.
This fact was poited out by Carol Abraham, an Israeli expert on people's health, who was quoted by The Jerusalem Post.
According to Abraham, who contributed to the establishment of the Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection, it is necessary to focus on indoor pollutants right now as many people are spending more time working at their homes.
Abraham mentioned the American Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) research, according to which the quality of indoor air is up to five times worse than the quality of outdoor air.
The World Health Organization (WHO) thinks that about 3,8 billion people die early of poor indoor air quality every year.
"Due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has been making many people work at their homes, people have to spend more hours at their homes than they used before, it is time to focus on indoor air quality," Abraham said.
According to her, hardly anyone concerns the quality of "home air" in Israel.
Nevertheless, things that people get in touch at their homes can be dangerous - paints, air refresheners, dezinfectants, deodorants or pesticide.
"Even clothes that we take to the dry cleaner's regularly release toxic gass," Abraham said.
Children, old people and people with respiratory diseases belong to high risk groups.
Also people in good health conditions may suffer from health problems such as headache, unconsciousness, nasal sensitivity, nose bleeding, vomitting or skin allergies.
Long exposure to toxic substances can harm organs in your body and your central nervous system.
But not every toxic substance comes from household items, their source may be also materials which houses are built from.
A quizz on Václav Havel: How much time he spent in prison and what made him to write Charta 77 (chybný nadpis - nesouvisí s článkem, pozn. překladatelky)
Fuenlabrada lost the chance to reach their promotion to the top Spanish league because of an outbreak of coronavirus in the team.
The competition management cancelled previously postponed final-round game at the second-division league in which the team could ensure their playoffs participation.
On Saturday, Fuenlabrada announced 12 more infected people, which took the total number of COVID-19 cases at the club to 28.
Because of the infection in the team, Monday's match against La Coruña, in which Fuenlabrada would need just one point to reach the playoffs promotion, was suspended.
The management of the competition said today that the duel aganist La Coruña has been cancelled definitely due to force majeure and because there would be no other chance to play it.
Fuenlabrada accepted the decision.
On the other hand, La Coruňa is protesting against the decision.
Given the results of their opponents, not even the final victory over Fuenlabrada would help La Coruňa to save them, but they consider it unfair that the final round would not take place by rules, full and in a single term.
The management of the former elite Spanish club is threatening legal action due to the fall in the third-division league.
The first two teams in the Huesca and Cádiz tables have the certainty to reach the promotion to the elite.
The remaining teams Zaragoza, Almería, Girona and Elche will compete in the third place playoffs.
Karel Gott did not like Václav Havel?!
His daughter Dominika reveales
"My Dad was not much into him for many years," Karel Gott's oldest daughter Dominika said to Aha! and added that Master could not stand Havel whenever they spoke about him and Karel seemed to be always angry.
It is hard to say what had happened between them, but according to Dominika the dispute began sometime in the mid 90s.
"After the Revolution, my Dad mentioned in some article that Havel's life was easier than his.
That Havel could write 'drawer stories' in the dark times, but if he (Karel) resisted anyhow, his career would end," Gottová said.
But she added that both great Czech men were able to reconcile finally.
"I know that he was absolutely allergic to name Havel until he was 60.
However, then Mr. President sent a letter congratulating him on his birthday and suddenly Dad's relationship with him started to change," Dominika remembers.
After all, ten years later Gott even invited the former president to celebrate his 70th birthday at the Ambassador Hotel on Wenceslas Square.
"And it was there where a new era of their relationship began, because Dad invited Mr. Havel many times to our house in Bertramka since then," the blond girl, whose father died last October, added.
It is also said that the Czech Nightingale felt annoyed that he was never given a State decoration from Václav Havel.
However, he was given it finally in 2009, although he received it from Václav Klaus (79), Havel's successor for the position.
He will receive further in memoriam honors, current president Miloš Zeman (75) is to award him the White Lion and thus honor his memory.
