Novák’s goal helped Trabzonspor claim second place; Škoda scored too
The Czech defender Filip Novák’s goal in the last round of the Turkish Football League helped Trabzonspor to the vice-champion title.
The team won 2-1 on Kayserispor’s home ground, leaving Beskitas behind on the third place.
Since his transfer from FC Slavia, the forward Milan Škoda has scored ten goals for Rizespor, which was saved from relegation despite losing 1-3 in an away match to Fenerbahce.
Scoring his seventh goal in this year’s league, Novák reaffirmed his excellent productivity on the pitch.
As soon as Kayserispor’s goalkeeper kicked off the ball in the 63rd minute, the Czech football player shot it right into the goal from the corner.
The home team managed to even the score five minutes before the end of the match, but Trabzonspor secured its victory in the sixth minute of the additional time, capitalizing on a four-to-one break.
At the start of the second half of the match against Fenerbahce, Škoda’s solo effort evened the score at 1-1.
Although Rizebospor failed to hold the draw for much longer, they didn’t have to feel too bad about it, since the results of their opponents left the club sitting three points above the drop zone.
The competition will be concluded on Sunday, with Kasimpasa hosting the champion Basaksehir on its pitch.
The well-hidden Hermit’s Cave near the Czech town of Nový Bor wasn’t inhabited after all
In northern Bohemia, at the foothills of the Lusatian Mountains, near the town of Nový Bor in the Česká Lípa District, there are several sandstone rock formations hidden in the forests through which the so-called "Earl’s Path" used to pass.
Some are natural, others man-made.
We’ll be taking a look on the one created by humans.
The place is known as the Hermit’s Cave.
In reality, no hermit has ever lived here; the cave served as a storage place, or rather a place for the storage of corn, it seems.
The cave is carved into the rock’s side, its entrance situated at the bottom of a set of stairs.
Yet, it stays out of view until the very last moment.
The only clue to its location is the stairway, which leads into a kind of rocky gallery revealing the entrance.
Although the storage room is seemingly too far away from human settlements, there might well have been a field on the now forest-covered high ground above.
“The fact that there’s no window in the object, nor a conventionally situated fire place, proves that no hermit would have ever been able to survive the winter here,” explains Kamil Podroužek, a historian from the Faculty of Arts at Jan Evangelista Purkyně University in Ústí nad Labem.
The one-room object contains a mere stone bench, apparently used for crockery storage.
“The way I see it, this was a storage room for food and crops,” Kamil Podroužek adds.
The walls bear marks of tools.
Breaking sandstone with a pickaxe was fast and easy for those in the know.
One simply had to use the fissures and the sandstone would gradually break off.
Studying the length of the pickaxe marks and the very mode of cutting, it’s possible to outline the time of the cave’s origin.
The historian dates it back to the late 18th century.
The cave is open to the public and, judging by the mess inside, someone sleeps in it from time to time.
If, taking one of the forest trails, you ever come down close to this place, drawn by the brooklet flowing underneath or the Earl’s Path passing nearby, it won’t take you long to discover the stairway down to the cave.
Leaving the forest, you might want to make another stop to admire the so-called “Rook Rocks” nearby.
After a bad fall, Jockey Minařík lies in an artificially-induced coma in Germany.
At the moment, Filip is in the best hands possible.
The institute is equipped for similar cases and what is more, we luckily have some family in Hannover.
This really helps make the situation and the care of our daughter Finja more manageable, Minařík's wife Katji, was quoted as saying by the server Jezdci.cz.
Everyone is doing the utmost that they can as Filip now needs time to recover.
There is no point in offering a prognosis.
Anyone who has any experience with head trauma and patients in artificially-induced comas, knows that the situation can change.
Filip is a big fighter.
All of us must now be patient and give him time, stated the wife of the forty-five year old jockey.
Prize-winning Frankie Dettori, who on Saturday won the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot for the seventh time, thereby equalizing with legendary Lester Piggott, announced on Twitter a challenge to raise financial support for the injured Minařík.
As of today, the server Gofundme has collected around 70 thousand euro.
The goal is to raise 100 thousand euro (2.6 million Crowns.)
Sassuolo had four goals disallowed by VAR in 0-2 defeat
In the game against Napoli, footballers of Sassuolo had the ball in the opponent's net four times, but they ultimately had to come to terms with a 0-2 defeat.
All their goals were ruled out for offside by the referee after consulting the VAR screen.
According to Italian media, no team has ever faced such adversity due to technology, having so many efforts chalked off by VAR.
"VAR was harder on Sasuolo than a speed camera would be and punished it more than it ever did any other team.
The new technology is breaking records," the newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport wrote in a live text commentary.
"It was a festival of disallowed goals scored by Sassuolo.
VAR has never been so strict with just one team," the newspaper Corriere dello Sport added.
On Saturday, Napoli took the lead in the eighth minute, but it seemed like Sassuolo tied it after half an hour of the game.
However, Filip Đuričić saw his strike denied after VAR ruled it out for offside.
Another Đuričić's effort as well as a finish by Francesco Caputo and a strike by Domenico Berardi were cancelled out for the same reason.
Meanwhile, the host team swept home yet another goal.
Electric cars are setting a new record.
Czechs have been using charging stations more than ever before
"The growth is powered by a 30% increase in the number of charging stations within our network and by the upward trend of frequent charging at public stations as well as by the faster registration of new electric cars," said the head of ČEZ Clean Technology Department, Tomáš Chmelík.
There are also other big players trying to take a bite of the Czech market, for example, PRE, E.ON, car manufacturer Tesla as well as supermarkets Billa and Lidl.
Regular petrol stations operators are represented by the company MOL.
But so far, the company doesn't have any data.
"We've started building our e-mobility network just last year," explained the company's spokesperson, Jana Jusková.
However, the editorial staff of Deník newspaper managed to get exclusive data from all 216 charging points operated by ČEZ.
The data show that drivers' average charge is 13,5 kWh per session.
That should be enough energy for a smaller electric car to cover up around 100 kilometers.
Putting aside small recharges of up to 1 kWh, the average charging time is two and a half hours.
The vast majority of recharges were carried out for free.
In cases when motorists paid for charging their vehicles, the average cost was around 330 CZK.
E-mobility is trending mostly in the capital city of Prague.
The five busiest charging stations of ČEZ are all located in Prague, and their popularity easily outshines many regional cities in Czechia.
Among other Czech regions, Olomouc holds a leading position.
On the other hand, people show the least interest in the border area, for example, in Bohumín or Prachatice, where it often happens that a whole day passes by, without anyone using the remote charging stations.
There are currently over 4,000 electric cars registered in Czechia.
Just in the first half of this year, the number of electric cars has increased by 1,274.
In an extensive survey called "Czechs, keep it moving" conducted by Deník, 8% of the readers stated that they are considering purchasing an electric car for the family.
But only one third of the respondents knew where to find the closest charging station in their area.
Not just better water conservation
Ecological activists protested in Prague
According to organizers, the government's current steps in response to demands to protect and heal Czech's nature as well as its solutions to the climate crisis are insufficient, as speakers called upon the state to take on a tougher approach.
Representatives from large organizations such as the Rainbow Alliance, Greenpeace, or The Green party, as wells as smaller local collectives, participated in the event called, "The Last Drop".
For instance, we have people here who have long been protesting against the expansion of the Turów Mine, there are protestors here taking a stand against gravel mining in Uhersky Ostroh as wells as protestors opposing the construction of pointless damns, said Marika Volfová, speaking for the organizers.
She stated that the protestors' main demands are the conception of a plan for water conservation in the countryside, a drastic change to agricultural politics, a subsidies system focused towards sustainable agriculture, and a transition as soon as possible from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.
The government is supposed to protect the interests of the people, not that of callous and devastating business, she said.
A booth was set up on Malostranské Square with a petition calling upon representatives of the Czech state to commit to lowering greenhouse gas emissions as well as the rehabilitation of Czech land and countryside.
Attendees were equipped with banners with slogans such as "The End of Depression from Rapeseed" or "Less Coal, More Newts".
Jan Škoda, representing the collective "For water for the People", travelled from southern Moravia to Prague to protest against plans for gravel mining in the Hodonín area.
This threatens a drinkable water source that serves 140,000 people," he said.
He added that the wells represent the fifth most productive source of drinkable water in the Czech Republic.
According to Škoda, the planned gravel mine is to be located about 500 meters from the wells and it is understood that it will most certainly threaten the quality of the water.
Vojtěch Veselý, representing the so-called agro-ecological farmers, came from the village Valeč in the Karlovarsky region.
He pointed out the advantages of small farms, which are not driven by yields and profits and are able to serve residents directly on site.
Not only are small agro-ecological farms able to fully supply the whole population, but they do not cause such devastation to the countryside and environment,' he said.
A plane crashed onto a house in Germany, killing three people.
An ultralight plane fell onto a house in western Germany today, killing three people and injuring another two.
According to local emergency services, two of the dead were most likely flight crew members, and the third, a resident of the house.
The plane crashed on the roof of the house in the town of Wesel, in Northern Rhine-Westphalia.
A fire subsequently broke out in the attic apartment, one of five apartment units in the house.
Firefighters have already been able to bring the flames under control.
Robert Meyboom, the deputy chief of the local fire department, said that it appeared that the two members of the flight crew had both died.
According to the police, the third victim is a woman who lived in the house.
The newspaper Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ) citing the mayor of Wesel, wrote that the woman was a single mother whose two-year old daughter was rescued from the apartment and suffered only minor injuries.
An emergency parachute was found close to the accident and apparently served as a brake during the landing.
The police believe it comes from the crashed plane.
The airplane could seat two people.
The plane took off from a nearby airport in the town of Marl.
The newspaper Rheinische Post stated that according to eyewitnesses, the plane collided with a hot-air balloon before the crash.
However, this information has not yet been confirmed.
WAZ, citing other eyewitnesses, writes that the airplane broke apart in the air before falling.
Česká spořitelna mistakenly double-charged some card payments on Saturday.
The error has already been rectified
The Czech bank Česká spořitelna mistakenly double-charged some card payments on Saturday afternoon.
The bank's spokesperson, Lukáš Kropík, said the problem could apply to thousands of transactions.
Česká spořitelna has already corrected the error and refunded the customers.
The bank noticed the problem of double-charged card payments on Saturday afternoon.
"We updated our system last night (Saturday) and promptly refunded our customers for the double-charged payments.
Everything is running smoothly at this point," said Kropík on Sunday afternoon.
He didn't know the exact number of costumers that the bank had charged twice, but he estimated that it had been a few thousand transactions.
The bank has been looking into what could have caused these problems.
"It could have been a combination of several factors," said Kropík.
Česká spořitelna is the biggest Czech bank in terms of the number of customers.
In late March, it had 4,6 million clients.
The bank is owned by the Austrian financial services provider Erste Group Bank, which is a key player on the banking market of Central and Eastern Europe.
On Monday, Vojtěch will introduce a three tier emergency system against coronavirus.
The tiers will be determined by the strength of the community spread at the regional level.
We are working on it together with epidemiology and the Institute for health information and statistics, Vojtěch told ČT.
This will be the so-called traffic light, according to which, regions will be marked green, orange, or red as determined by risk of coronavirus incidence.
The minister added that there would be further discussion with epidemiology regarding the inclusion of individual regions.
He admitted that at the moment, only the Moravian-Silesion region would qualify for the orange designation, although Prague is approaching the orange level.
The map will also include individual measures for regional hygienic stations, hospitals, social services, and employers.
We want to address this at the regional level because the situations are not uniform between regions, stated Vojtěch.
Hasterman and Karolinka
When Hasterman Jonáš and the miller's daughter, Karolinka, fall for each other, they do not have an easy time of it at all.
Jonáš's father, the sullen Hasterman Hastrbuch, is against the couple's love, while Karolinka has no clue that her dear Jonáš is actually not a human.
To top it off, young Libor will do anything to protect the whole village, and especially Karolinka, from the watery villain.
So what if this means that he is going to engage in deceptions and lies?
Especially when it appears that Karolinka rejects Jonáš in favor of the valiant Libor.
Soon enough, it is obvious to the whole village who is responsible for the Night Watchman Konvička, the spoilt flour, the fire in the Mill, and other mischief.
The infuriated villagers go after the Hasterman and to top it off, Jonáš ends up the target of an irreversible water curse.
And now Konvička's spirit likes Karolinka!
How to appease Old Hastrbuch, convince the neighbors that Jonáš is innocent, find Jonáš, and free him from the curse?
The fairytale was filmed in September 2010 at ČT's studios with the exteriors filmed around the Brzina Pond, in Obděnice na Sedlčansko, as well as in the beautiful environs of the historic mill in Hoslovice.
Most racetrack is launching a new e-shop
A new e-shop is now available to the customers of a motor racing track in the Czech town of Most.
This allows for an online purchase of tickets for car and motorcycle track-day drives on the long racing circuit, which were previously only sold by the racetrack staff on site.
“We’ve improved our e-shop to be more user-friendly, at the same time extending the range of products and services available online.
We’ve also decided to use this occasion to reward our customers with a discount of 1,000 Czech crowns on all safe-driving courses we offer.
Discount coupons can be obtained at the link: www.autodrom-most.cz,” says Jana Svobodová, the Sales and Marketing Director of AUTODROM MOST racetrack.
According to her, the e-shop’s webpage is now well laid-out and easy for the customers to navigate through.
“Users can select the desired option from the menu bar.
Those include sports, safe-driving or sports-driving courses, training, experiential programs, gifts and gift certificates, children’s activities and so on,” says the Director.
The new products and services available on the e-shop include a Racing Legends T-shirt with a surprise, a racetrack, a driving in poor visibility conditions course, promotional and gift products from the Czech professional racing team Buggyra Racing, or the limited-edition Engelmuller driving gloves from the BOHEMATIC watchmaking manufacturer, produced in honor of the 1949 historic victory in the prestigious 24 Hours of Le Mans race.
“We offer a wide range of products and services, allowing our customers to choose from more than 2,000 options,” Jana Svobodová added.
When ordering a product or service, customers can choose from four payment methods.
Prepayment (bank transfer), cash on delivery, cash on collection, or online via a payment gateway.
Majority of COVID-19 cases are mild, only 3% of cases are hospitalised
Either Czechs are faced with a milder variant of COVID-19, or the dose of summer sunshine greatly boosted our immune system.
While COVID-19 cases keep soaring, infectious disease wards at hospitals remain empty.
“The situation today is entirely different than in April and it is mostly due to the number of hospitalised cases,” Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch confirms.
Let us not forget that at the peak of the first wave, on April 11, the whole population wore face masks, the army assisted with testing, the whole country was under lockdown and its population had used a year’s worth of disinfectants.
In spite of this, ten people died on average every day.
At the moment, while the daily increases in cases are higher, only up to two people die of the virus each day.
The district of Karviná still accounts for the highest number of cases, followed by the town of Jihlava with a cluster of already 57 positive cases in a care home for patients with Alzheimer’s disease (40 clients and 17 employees).
Hygiene experts decided to isolate one more retirement home in Černožice in the region of Králův Hradec.
One employee tested positive for the disease.
“We are tracking the cases, restrict movement and apply all the necessary hygiene measures,” Martin Scháněl, the facility’s director, says.
None of the patients has developed symptoms so far.
Blanket testing of clients and staff will begin tomorrow and the hygiene stations then decides on the next steps.
In view of the soaring cases, Czech hospitals take preparatory measures.
Today, the Cancer Institute in Brno installed at its entrance a mask detection system capable of automatically detecting whether people are wearing masks when entering the building.
The historically highest number of COVID-19 cases was recorded by the hygiene station in Southern Bohemia – most of the 25 cases are foreign employees of one Prachatice-based company.
In total, 131 new cases were reported on Saturday. It is half as many as on Friday, but it must be noted that less people take tests at weekends.
Debutant becomes champion!
With a dazzling performance, Van den Bergh destroys Anderson
To a complete surprise of all, Dimitri Van den Bergh put in an excellent performance in the game against the 2018 winner of the second most prestigious competition within the PDC.
After a tight beginning, the Belgian darts player started to outplay his rival 8:7.
With a fantastic score in his 13th leg, Van den Bergh moved into the lead and dominated the rest of the game.
He literally smashed his rival and the much more experience “Flying Scotsman” had hard time scoring barely any double points.
The “DreamMaker“ managed to throw his rival off balance to such an extent that the completely disconcerted Anderson managed to score his maximum score only in the 24th leg.
What is more, the young Belgian was able to complete a stunning number of high checkouts.
When losing in his 11th leg, Van den Bergh managed to “score big” and landed with 170.
By the end of the game, Anderson was palpably frustrated.
While Andersons’ shots showed signs of resignation, the Belgian sailed to victory with absolute confidence.
He managed to hit the first out of the tree match darts and lived up to his name, when he made his big dream come true.
The worth of the trophy – named after Phil Taylor – was certainly further increased by the fact that the Belgian player claimed his first TV major.
Karel Sedláček has since remained the last player to defeat Van den Bergh.
Man confesses to starting fire at Nantes Cathedral
The Cathedral of St.Peter and St.Paul situated in the heart of Nantes caught on fire last Saturday, with the blaze severely damaging original stained-glass windows from the 16th century and destroying the organ.
Investigators have launched an arson inquiry, as the fire spread from three different points in the cathedral.
At the same time, however, the police haven't found any signs of forced entry.
Prosecutors charged a 39-year-old volunteer in the local diocese and Rwandan refugee.
He had already been detained shortly after the fire, but then released without charge.
The prosecutor's office now issued a statement saying that the man was arrested again on Sunday based on new evidence; he confessed and has been charged with arson.
If he's found guilty, he could face up to 10 years in prison and a hefty fine.
Le Monde reported that, according to his lawyer, he regrets his actions and has decided to fully cooperate with the investigators.
Czech Health Minister Vojtěch: A new system of epidemiological measures will be introduced on Monday
The new system will act as a pandemic plan, whose absence has earned both the Czech Government and the Ministry of Health a lot of criticism.
“The alert levels will be determined by the severity of community transmission,” the Minister explained.
He added that, as things stand now, the Moravian-Silesian Region and Prague would be in the middle, orange level.
The system was designed to work on a regional level, since there are significant differences in the situations across the regions, said the Minister.
The Ministry developed the system in collaboration with epidemiologists from the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic (ÚZIS).
Each alert level will come with a set of particular measures, be it the obligation to wear a face mask or the establishment of special hospital departments.
It was Czech Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (Czech Social Democratic Party) who called for an epidemiological plan in the Partie debate show broadcasted on the Prima channel, stating that people should have clear information on what measures to expect, should the epidemiological situation deteriorate.
In the recent days, the Czech Republic has recorded an increase in the daily number of coronavirus cases, while hospitalization rates remain low.
Vojtěch commented by saying that the situation is not serious and that it would be misplaced to talk about declaring a state of emergency or reassembling the Central Crisis Staff.
Following the increasing number of positive cases, the Government has reintroduced the nationwide obligation to wear face masks at indoor events with more than 100 people as of Saturday.
Starting Monday, these events will be capped at 500-person capacity – down from the current 1,000 people.
Lacking clarity on the nature of the measures as well as their announcement and coming-into-force dates, the Czech Government’s approach was met with criticism.
“I think that, in a situation that’s quite tense, our leaders’ should strive to create an atmosphere of security and clear all the confusion,” said Senator Marek Hilšer in Václav Moravec’s debate show.
Some measures differ across the regions as it is – e.g., in Prague, it’s mandatory to wear face masks in non-residential health-care facilities, such as pharmacies and doctor’s offices.
As of Friday, the Liberec and Ústí nad Labem Regions have also introduced the obligation to wear face masks while visiting health and community care facilities.
In the Vysočina Region and Jihlava District, they’re mandatory in indoor public spaces, public transport, and health-care facilities since July 14th.
In contrast, the Moravian-Silesian, the Central Bohemian Regions as well as the Kutná Hora District have all seen the restrictions loosened.
In early June, the Czech Government adopted the so-called “traffic light” system for Europe, which uses a color code to categorize European countries based on the risk of infection and regulates the rules for travelers arriving in the Czech Republic from these countries.
Since June 15th, Czech citizens arriving from countries with low-to-medium risk don’t have to provide a negative test, nor go into quarantine.
These measures are mandatory for people returning from high-risk countries.
As for now, all EU member states are in the “low risk of infection” category.
Techno music festival in Benešov region continues
The rave – that was supposed to close at midday – continues with a third of the sound speakers on.
The techno party organised near Hlaváčkova Lhota in the Benešov region continues over Sunday evening.
One third of the original 12 sound systems is still roaring with music.
According to the latest police estimates, nearly 500 participants (the original estimates reported 400 participants) remained on the premises after 8 pm. According to police spokesperson Lucie Nováková, in the morning the party was attended by 900 people.
The rave was originally scheduled to terminate at midday on Sunday, when the majority of sound speakers stopped playing.
“Some attendees left and others are about to leave.
Some music continues to play.
We expect that the organisers will gradually unplug, dismantle and pack their sound systems,” Nováková says.
“Police keep an eye on the departures in order to prevent attendees from driving under the influence of alcohol or narcotics.
All drivers can take a preventive breath alcohol test before they leave,” she adds.
The event was checked by tens of police officers from riot, foreign and transport units, and canine holders with police dogs were also disposed to intervene.
Today, police have checked 470 people in the event’s surroundings and 485 vehicles. Out of the 270 drivers who were given breath tests, in total 6 had wanted to drive under the influence of alcohol,” Nováková adds.
A total of 95 drivers were tested for narcotics and psychotropic substances, out of which one person tested positive.
Police officers issued 14 traffic tickets for infractions.
A total of 300 attendees took preventive breath tests and 4 people requested the police for preventive tests of narcotics and psychotropic substances.
On Saturday morning, the party was attended by approximately 2,000 people.
Police was ready to intervene if the party-goers did not leave the premises,
according to Minister of Interior Jan Hamáček, interviewed in the ‘Partie’ programme on the Prima television channel.
Since the number of attendees fell under 1,000, police considered its intervention as unnecessary. No intervention was requested by the local hygiene station, nor the Ministry of Health.
According to a Czech Television (ČT) report on Sunday, the rave spilled over onto to neighbouring meadows without previous authorisation of their owners.
The land owners are now likely to file a lawsuit to demand compensation.
Techno music lovers arrived to the party premises near Hlaváčkova Lhota on Friday evening.
Originally, police monitored meadows near Blažim, in the same region, where a similar party took place last year.
Blažim is located approximately 30 kilometres from Hlaváčkova Lhota, which, ultimately, became the ravers’ destination this year.
Nováková confirmed that this year the area near Blažim remained empty.
Viper's bite:  A girl ends up in hospital!
This year's first case has been reported in the area of Železna Ruda.
Regional Spokesperson for Emergency services, Maria Svobodová, told the Newspaper, that after being bitten by a viper, the girl, born 2010, was taken by her parents to the local emergency services center," and from there she was then transferred to the hospital in Klatovy.
The viper is the only poisonous snake in the Czech Republic and currently has been found in increased numbers in Šumava, and for this reason it is a good idea to be especially careful during walks.
However, these animals do not pose grave danger.
The probability that you will be bitten by one of these snakes is not very high, and in fact, typically when coming into contact, it is the snake itself that is usually afraid.
In fact, if it has enough space, it would rather slither away with a loud hiss.
It will only attack when it feels under great threat - for instance when it is accidentally trodden upon.
And even in the event of being bitten by one, it will not result in tragedy, as its poison, while very effective against small mammals, will not kill humans.
Death will only occur in those with compromised systems or allergy sufferers.
The risk of danger is highest amongst children, seniors, and allergy sufferers.
Miriam Gredová from the hospital in Klatovy describes that "when bitten, a person will often experience one or more of the following symptoms: nausea, sweating, elevated temperature, thirst, stomach pains and diarrhea, while individuals with weakened systems or allergies run the risk of going into anaphylactic shock."
Man threatens to throw infant out of window.
He poured wine on the police and threw dishes at them.
Sometime after 23:00, an intervention unit was able to gain entrance into the apartment and apprehend the man.
The infant was immediately taken in for health care, stated the press release from Markéta Janovská, spokesperson for the regional police.
The man did not want to cooperate and threw dishes and knives at the police and even poured wine over them from the window.
During the incident, he escalated his threats several times by leaning out of the window while holding the infant.
At one point, he even crawled out onto the window ledge where he continued with his threats.
The police continue in their investigation of the man.
At this time, the police have no other information to make public.
Sam Stosur to skip next tennis season to take care of her daughter
Australian tennis player Samantha Stosur will not play her part in the rest of this year’s season affected by COVID-19.
Yet, the 36-year-old 2011 U.S. Open champion, who became a mom this June, does not plan to retire.
She has vowed to return to court next year and believes that her family and daughter will enable her to take even more pleasure in her tennis career.
Two weeks ago, Stosur took to social media to announce that in mid-June her partner Liz Astling gave birth to a baby girl named Genevieve.
“I will stay home, spend time with my family and witness all the important milestones that Evie is about to reach in her first six months. Simply, I will enjoy it,” said the former No. 1 in the world in doubles for on the Australian tennis union’s webpage.
The WTA Tour is scheduled to resume in Palermo on August 3 with a clay-court tournament.
Sapa Market: police found uncertified meat, fish and eggs
“One of the cars entering the market was stopped transporting 1,320 qual eggs of an unidentified origin stored in inadequate conditions.
These eggs will also be eliminated at a rendering facility,” said the State Veterinary Administration.
An inspection at a seafood stall revealed that its owner had not certificates of origin of products and lacked the registration certificate of a seafood vendor.
From a veterinary point of view, the Vietnamese market has been long raising concerns.
An inspection from autumn last year found an illegal food commercial outlet with almost half a ton of uncertified foods.
The majority of them was indicated with use-by dates and some were expired and spoiled.
For five kilograms of cuttlefish, the shelf life was exceeded by three years.
Last May, the veterinary inspectors and police seized in the market 80 kilograms of uncertified food, including, among other things, dried fish, squid and frozen ducks, with some of them being mouldy.
Putin held phone talks with Zelensky prior to Donbass ceasefire, Kremlin criticises planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin held a telephone conversation with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky regarding the situation in Donbass where new ceasefire should begin at midnight.
According to the Kremlin’s official statement, Putin, among other things, criticised the Ukrainian Parliament’s decision to hold local elections. According to Kiev, Zelensky invited the Russian president to release the Ukrainian citizens held in the territory.
The ceasefire was agreed upon by Ukrainian and Russian negotiators with the help of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
It should be observed from the midnight of Monday, is described as “full and comprehensive” and its goal is to open the path to the fulfilment of the remaining provisions of peace agreements.
Putin said to Zelensky on telephone that the Ukrainian Parliament’s decision to organise local elections is contrary to the Minsk peace agreement and poses a risk to the outlook of conflict resolution in Eastern Ukraine.
The Ukrainian Parliament decided last week that the planned local elections will not be held in the territories controlled by pro-Russian rebels.
The Minsk agreement stipulates that Kiev will regain control over the borders of the Ukrainian territories occupied by separatists supported by Russian once it offers autonomy to the regions and organizes local elections.
The UNIAN agency reports that according to Zelensky’s presidential office, both presidents agreed on the usefulness of the planned ceasefire in Donbass as well as on the necessity to take further steps to promote peace in this region, including mine action in former battles areas and removing a part of the troops at the front.
Zelensky also invited Putin to release the Ukrainian citizens kept in Eastern Ukraine, in the occupied Crimean Peninsula and in Russia.
While the Minsk agreement contributed to easing the fights, people on both sides are still dying in occasional firefights and artillery attacks.
Since spring 2014, the conflict in Donbass claimed the lives of more than 14,000 people.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia from militarily supporting the separatists, which is an accusation denied by Moscow.
Zelensky made the conflict resolution in Donbass one of its priorities, but no major breakthroughs in negotiations have been reached so far.
Rykl is the unexpected champion of the decathlon while Novotná took the heptathlon.
By the end of Saturday's program, Doležal, the current two-time title defender, did not finish the 400, while Kopecký failed to jump the minimum height requirement in Sunday's pole vault.
Reinis Kregers, representing Latvia, who has long dominated the decathlon, and trains with the coach Josef Karas team, withdrew after the discus.
Rykl, who so far scored two bronze medals from the outdoors MČR, was this time the only decathlon competitor who crossed the seven-thousand threshold.
Other medalists included Vilém Stráský and Petr Urbánek.
After the competition, Rykl brought up the absence of Adam Sebastian Helceleta and Jiří Sýkora.
It is too bad that the boys were not here and that Kope did not qualify, because the results would definitely have looked completely different.
Nevertheless, the title tastes really sweet and I really value that I broke my personal record by 30 centimeters in the long jump.
I also was really pleased with the pole vault and I guess I was most disappointed with discus, as I was really below average, he conceded on the Club's Facebook page.
Kateřina Cachová won the first day of the heptathlon with more than a 100 point lead, despite suffering from an injured ankle on her rebounding leg.
However, she registered only 570 centimeters in the distance sector, she did not throw the javelin further than 40 meters, and did not run the final 800 meter race.
Novotná accumulated 5878 points and beat Kateřina Dvořákova out by more than 241 points.
Overall, her biggest achievement was the long jump, in which she jumped 631 centimeters, the best Czech result of the year.
I was really hoping that I would jump around 630.
My calf started feeling tight yesterday, but I am very glad that I did not feel it at all and that it did not limit me in the least, Novotná said on the Club's Facebook Page.
LPG arrives in the Czech Republic with a promise of an eco-friendly traffic solution
Liquefied Petroleum Gas (or LPG for short) has been a well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
Owing to a considerably lower excise tax, it’s a lot cheaper than gasoline and diesel fuel, and although this is the main reason behind its popularity, LPG has other benefits, such as lower CO2 emission per mile driven.
Just like gasoline and diesel, it has its own eco-friendly version called “bio-LPG”.
Quite the novelty, it was introduced into the European market no earlier than the year before last and, according to the Czech LPG Association’s press release, reached the Czech Republic just a few days ago.
“We’ve received the first ca 16 tons of bio-LPG, which will be distributed to our filling stations in a mixture with conventional fossil LPG,” said Jiří Karlík from the Primagas company.
However, bio-LPG shouldn’t be confused with bioethanol or biodiesel.
According to the Association, its chemical composition is similar to that of conventional fossil LPG, which is what many drivers fuel their cars with now.
That’s why the two version can be mixed.
“The only difference from conventional LPG is the method of production,” comments Ivan Indráček, the Chairman of the Association.
This takes us to a great advantage of bio-LPG over other alternative fuels.
It’s easy to transport and store, with a solid distribution infrastructure, compared to hydrogen or electricity, to name a few.
At the moment, the gas is obtained as a by-product of bioethanol production from food and sugarcane remnants.
In the future, it should be produced purposefully, e.g., from cellulose biomass, that is wood waste.
In contrast, conventional LPG is produced either as a by-product of crude oil refining or natural gas extraction.
Based on the production technology and source, bio-LPG-powered vehicles are thus 40–70 % more eco-friendly in terms of carbon footprint than those running on fossil LPG and as much as 90 % more when compared to diesel.
However, it’s not the cars’ CO2 emissions that are meant here, but rather the so-called well-to-tank emissions resulting from fuel production.
MThe biggest present-day LPG producers include petrochemical companies like Eni, Total and Neste.
As indicated by the recent National Clean Mobility Action Plan update, Unipetrol, too, is studying the possibilities of the gas’ production in its refinery in the Czech town of Litvínov.
According to the Association, about 170,000 vehicles are currently powered by LPG in the Czech Republic; the estimate of the Czech Ministry of Environment is rather higher, at about 200,000.
The Czech Ministry of Transport statistics show that nearly 6,000 vehicles were converted to LPG over the last year alone.
LPG is offered at around 950 gas stations across the Czech Republic, operated by different companies.
Minister Vojtěch reviewed COVID-19 statistics, the number of cases dropped by 1,775
Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch (ANO) demanded that the number of coronavirus cases be reviewed by the Ministry officials.
The updated statistics were published on Sunday on the Ministry’s official webpage.
The number of cases from Sunday was corrected from 5,245 of 3,479 cases, i.e., 1,775 fewer in total.
At the moment, the Czech Republic has reported 3,422 confirmed COVID-19 cases.
“The sudden surge in the number of patients presumed to be recovered is due to the review of the statistics which the hygiene stations did not have the time to update,” Jaroslav Dušek, chief medical statistician, explains.
As of Sunday afternoon, 15,212 people have been infected with the virus, 11,419 have recovered and 371 have unfortunately succumbed to the disease.
Mobile voting units or mail-in ballots.
Political Scientists and Sociologists look into possible alternatives to implement during the pandemic period.
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) believes that a change must be made to the law in order to ensure that those in quarantine due to coronavirus are also able to cast their vote in the regional and senate elections coming up in October.
Parliament could take this matter up in August or September on an accelerated schedule.
He announced this on Sunday during Partie on the television network Prima.
On Tuesday, he plans to discuss possible solutions with parliamentary party representatives.
Whatever we end up doing, it will mean a change to the voting law, stated Hamáček.
On Wednesday, the senate called upon the government to find a solution within the parameters of pre-existing legal rules.
However, the minister said that it will be necessary to amend the constitutional law, currently under which, individuals placed in quarantine due to their health status, are unable vote.
The ban on voting for patients diagnosed with open tuberculosis should remain intact.
On the program OVM, Daniel Prokop said that the possibility of introducing mail-in ballots has been deferred already since the year 2004.
Even the proposed law, currently in the house for consideration, would only allow mail-in voting for individuals living abroad, but not for those living in the Czech Republic.
At the same time, Prokop views the concerns of ANO or ČSSD (because according to experiences from abroad, this tends to work in favor of other types of parties) regarding mail-in ballots as over-stated.
Personally, he is against the proposal for electronic voting, which is at a clear risk for manipulation.
Michal Klima said that currently it is necessary to create ad hoc mechanisms (for voting) which could be realistically implemented this year while posing the least possible amount of health risk.
He also then views it a priority to be prepared for 2021 when parliamentary elections will take place in the Czech Republic.
He regards mail-in ballots (whether only for those living abroad or also for those within the Czech Republic) as a possible functional method.
He also sees mobile voting units or perhaps voting by proxy within familial limits as possibilities.
He added that much can be learned from Croatia, Poland or France, who, under similar conditions, also held elections during coronavirus.
67 Countries worldwide have already had to postpone various types of elections due to the spread of coronavirus.
Protests in Bulgaria: Demonstrators throwing pig's ears at government building
The demonstrators protesting against Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov and his cabinet were throwing pig's ears at the government building.
It was one of the many protests against "mafia-style governance" that have been taking place in Sofia and other Bulgarian cities for nearly past three weeks.
The DPA news agency reported that the organizers are planning a national blockade on Wednesday.
According to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, today's 18th consecutive daily protest had a lower turnout than the previous ones.
About 300 people met at 8 p.m., and some streets had to be closed to traffic.
Following the arrest of two presidential advisors to President Rumen Radev, a strong political opponent of the Prime Minister, protestors acted out a short performance outside the government building, symbolically throwing both Prime Minister Borisov and Prosecutor General Ivan Geshev into a prison cell.
The resignation of both is on the list of the protestors' demands.
They have also demanded a rejection of an announced healthcare reform as well as the end of corruption in connection with the construction on the Black Sea coast.
Protest organizer Nikolay Hadjigenov told a public radio today that they plan to "escalate" the protest on Wednesday by organizing "a national demonstration in Sofia and blockades all over the country".
Once again he called for the resignation of Borisov and his government as well as for early elections.
Right now, the elections are scheduled for March 2021.
Borisov said earlier that he wouldn't step down.
One of the reasons he gave was that it's necessary he leads Bulgaria out of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent economic crisis.
On Friday, he replaced his five cabinet ministers, but that wasn't enough to appease the protestors.
Early this week, Borisov's government survived the vote of no confidence in the parliament.
Bologna coach Mihaljovic is fed up with playing without a crowd
Bologna coach Sinisa Mihaljovic is tired of matches of the Italian Football League without fans.
The Serbian coach hopes that the stadiums will be full again from the beginning of a new season.
“What we are doing at the moment is not football.
I am fed up with matched behind closed doors.
It’s frigid football, it gives me no emotions, no joy.
And the games feel worse than a training session.
It’s horrible playing like this and I don’t think I’m the only one who thinks that,” Mihajlovic said before today’s game against Lecce.
After a COVID-19 break, Serie A games resumed in quick succession, and even if they take place at night, players must endure heat.
“We play every three days in incredible heat.
You can’t tell how good teams are in these conditions.
I can’t wait for this season to end.
The measures must have been taken because it was the only way we could complete the tournament, but I hope from September we can have our fans back,” the former coach of Fiorentina and AC Milano added.
This season is extraordinary for Mihaljovic also because of the fact that he had been absent from the coach bench during four months receiving leukaemia treatment.
“Despite my illness, the interruption of the League tournament and everything else, the team did take a step up to the next level.
We want to keep growing and to do that, we need more psychological resilience in the minds of the players,” he said.
We are the target of cyberattacks from foreign states, insists Iran.
Since the end of June, a series of fires and explosions has been reported in a number of Iranian military, industrial, and nuclear facilities, as well as even at oil refineries, electric power stations, factories, and businesses.
Some Iranian agents have stated that the fire that occurred this month in an underground nuclear facility in Natanz, could have been caused by cyber sabotage.
Causes of other incidents have until now not been explained.
According to Iranian media, Abbas Musavi, spokesperson for the the Iranian foreign ministry, said that the Islamic Republic's infrastructure faces "thousands of cyber attacks" on a daily basis.
He added that this is not a new development and that the majority of such attacks are successfully averted.
According to Musavi, in the past few months, several wider cyber attacks have been reported, for which, according to analysis, "specific governments and groups" are responsible.
According to Reuters, he did not offer more specific details about the possible perpetrators.
Musavi also added that fires in forests, refineries, and other sites occur more often in the summer.
This month, an article from the Iranian State Agency IRNA argued that enemies of Iran, such as Israel and the USA, could be responsible for recent incidents.
However, neither one of these states was directly accused of a specific attack.
Diplomatic relations between Iran and the United States ceased shortly after the revolution in 1979, when militant Iranian students attacked the American embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
The persisting tense relations between both countries intensified in 2018 after Washington withdrew from the 2015 Iran Nuclear Deal between Iran and world powers and applied sanctions on Iran that in turn have had dire consequences for its economy.
On January 3 of this year, there was a further notable escalation after the American army killed the Iranian General Kasem Solejman and Abu Mahdi Muhandis, a member of the Iraqi militia leadership.
On January 8, Iran then fired multiple rockets at bases in Iraq, where Americans maintain operations.
Later, the USA reluctantly admitted that tens of American soldiers were injured.
Israel regards Iran as its arch enemy and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is the main opponent to the 2015 Iran Nuclear Deal with Iran.
According to the Israeli prime minister, Iran is trying to develop the atomic bomb, which Iran denies.
Carmaker TPCA re-extends shutdown, this time until 25 May
The Kolín-based automobile manufacturer Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile (TPCA) has re-extended a shutdown of its factory because of COVID-19.
Its production sites are scheduled to reopen in the morning of 25 May.
According to carmaker’s spokesperson Tomáš Paroubek, the reopening will by accompanied with a series of hygienic measures.
The company was forced to halt production in the evening of 18 March due to the coronavirus pandemic.
It had previously scheduled to reopen on Monday, 18 May.
The stoppage was extended because of the closed borders and dealerships: there is no one to sell the cars to, Paroubek explains.
He adds that the plant will initially operate at 100% capacity on two shifts.
The coronavirus epidemic has hit the company’s key markets, such as Italy, UK and Spain.
Michael Kašpar, the mayor of Kolín (Změna for Kolín party), said that the shutdown of TPCA has not had a major impact on the everyday life of Kolín’s inhabitants.
“At the beginning, it was noticeable, because the city became empty.
But slowly, people have been reappearing on the streets, especially since Monday, when many restrictions were eased down.
So now, the city is full of life again,” he said.
Kašpar explains that foreign workers, who stayed in local hostels, have not caused any disturbances.
“We didn’t have to deal with a single problem over the last two months,” he said.
Car manufacturer Škoda Auto in Mladá Boleslav also had to shut down production, but on Monday 27 April it already reopened all of its three plants in the Czech Republic.
None of its factories operate at 100% capacity.
More than 80 hygiene measures have been put in place to ease workers into work at Škoda.
In the night from Monday to Tuesday, the plants in Mladá Boleslav and Kvasiny restored their first third shifts after the reopening.
Currently, TPCA employs approximately 2,500 people, making it one of the most important employees in the Kolín district, and it also ranks among one of the top exporters in the Czech Republic.
Bride leaves message for family after losing cancer battle shortly following her wedding
After more than a two-year battle with cancer, it looked as if Gemma Sisson had finally defeated the insidious disease just for it to come back again.
The 39-year-old woman who loved bodybuilding later ended up in a hospice bed where she married the love of her life just in time.
Unfortunately, she succumbed to the disease.
Just hours after her death, her family and closest friends were stunned when a shocking post appeared on her Facebook account.
Gemma Sisson was from Leeds, UK, and she loved bodybuilding.
With her boyfriend of 16 years, Ricky Moore, she travelled to competitions all over the world.
Despite having an active and healthy lifestyle, the 39-year-old was diagnosed with cancer in April 2018.
Gemma started her treatment, undergoing gruelling radiotherapy in the hope of getting better.
After months of treatment, it looked as if Gemma had beaten the disease, but in August 2019 the cancer came back and this time it had taken hold of her spine.
According to Daily Mirror, a British daily newspaper, the bodybuilder and personal trainer underwent a 10-hour spinal operation that was followed again by gruelling treatment.
But everything was in vain.
At the beginning of this year, on her 39th birthday, the doctors told her she had just months to live.
In April, the attractive blonde decided to get admitted to the hospice in Leeds, where she was frequently visited by her family that even arranged for her to get married to her partner Ricky.
The marriage lasted only two months.
For their two-month anniversary, Ricky took Gemma to a restaurant for the very last time.
Four days later, Gemma died in his arms.
Just hours after her death, a post appeared on her social media account that she had written for her family.
"If this is being posted it means I've finally died after weeks of clinging on far too long.
Although I'll be heartbroken to leave behind all my loved ones, I'll be so glad to get away from what this bastard disease has left me as.
I really can't thank Rick enough, who has been by my side all the way and given me an amazing amount of love and support throughout this horrific time," she wrote on social media, saying that the pain and suffering has now stopped, and she is finally at peace.
"I am also grateful for all the support I have received from all of my followers on social media," she said urging people not to take anything for granted and live their life to the fullest.
Art Vending Machines selling a sudorific matchmaker, an amulet made from mushrooms, or even a memory game set.
For a hundred crowns, passersby can procure a pocket size artwork from Czech artists, most of whom are newcomers.
These artists already know that the pieces that they create must be no larger than 8,5 by 5,5 centimeters.
Each piece is numbered and signed.
Both a curator's description of the artist and separately of the artwork itself are included in the package, elaborated Petra Widžová, curator of the project.
Artmat operates on the principle of chance.
Accordingly, buyers let themselves be surprised to find out which art work they will end up with.
For instance, currently, a new owner might receive a fantastic illustration by Alexandra Štoplová or a mini postcard from Tereza Bonaventurová, both of which can also be delivered by post.
The artist Punx 23 collaborated with Dora Dutková to create a Memory game that involves taking a walk through Prague.
The cards must be paired with house signs.
Ilona Polanski prepared a collection of tattoos for Artmat.
Marie Ladrová and Juliana Chomová are selling pocket-sized spiritualities: the former artist offers a protective amulet constructed from hardwood and a fortune teller card, the latter, an illustrated series derived from her comics, Spiritisky.
Next year, salaries in the health care sector will increase by no more than five percent.
According to Vojtěch, a larger increase is not realistic.
Salaries in health care next year could increase by no more than five percent, said Adam Vojtěch, the minister of health (for ANO) during "Otazky Václava Moravce" on Czech Television.
He views union requests for an increase by around 15 percent as unrealistic.
He also said that the state should be self-reliant in securing protective equipment.
According to him, hospitals currently have enough supplies.
I expect to see an increase (of salary) of up to five percent, announced the minister.
According to him, it is imperative to take into account the current situation with the Coronavirus pandemic along with government measures against its spread that have been affecting the collection of insurance premiums since March.
Insurance premiums during this period have decreased.
I view an increase by 15 percent as unrealistic at this time, said Vojtěch.
According to the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (ÚZIS), the average monthly income of a physician in critical inpatient care could reach 88,312 crowns, and for nurses, 47,498 crowns.
There is a difference of about seven thousand crowns between salaries for nurses employed at state hospitals, and wages earned by those employed at other facilities.
Data from ÚZIS also revealed that the decline in nurses in hospitals has ceased.
According to the Czech Statistical Office, the average wage in the Czech Republic was 34,125 crowns.
Already in June, trade union representatives announced that for the year 2021, they would be demanding a minimum raise by ten percent, but ideally 15 percent.
They have long criticized the significant difference between the incomes earned by doctors and nurses at state hospitals, which are determined by salary charts, and contract-based wages in municipal and regional hospitals as well as private ones.
For this reason, they are also demanding that the salary charts be unified.
This year, the difference in earnings for nurses will reach as much as seven thousand crowns a month.
Last year, for example, wages for doctors rose more quickly than salaries.
According to Roman Šmucler, the president of the Czech chamber of dentistry, the trade unions should take into account the current condition of the state.
Due to the fallout from the Covid Epidemic, The Parliament recently approved increasing this year's budget deficit to a record breaking 500 billion crowns, of which 1.75 billion is set aside as bonus pay for health care workers in hospitals and social services.
According to Šmucler, the health care provider board disagrees with an across the board wage increase for the next year.
According to him, remuneration should be decided by individual hospitals and health care facilities and the extra money should be funded through a reimbursement statute.
Vojtěch also said that at the moment, hospitals have a sufficient supply of protective gear.
This week, Pavel Švagr, the chairman of the Administration of State Material Reserves (SSHR), said that the Administration currently does not have a single piece of protective equipment in its possession.
It is waiting for the completion of tenders.
According to Vojtěch, world suppliers are now in a better position to deliver goods than they were in March, when they were sold out.
Regardless, he believes that the state should be more self-sufficient and endeavor to purchase from Czech firms.
Czech Republic: The troublesome “Smart Quarantine” to be taken over by the military?
Their message is: We’re ready
“Smart Quarantine is working, but there’s definitely room for improvement.
We’ll be discussing this with the military tonight.
Our armed forces are functioning perfectly, and the question is whether they should be taking the whole thing over once again,” said Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš on Saturday in his Facebook video series “Hello people”.
According to him, there is insufficient communication between the IT systems and public health offices, which will gradually have to adopt more up-do-date methods of work.
The Prime Minister said that problems occurred in the Moravian-Silesian Region, which is now one of the viral hotspots.
Defense Ministry spokesperson Jan Pejšek stated in an interview for the Czech Press Agency (ČTK) that he has no information about the Sunday meeting and that the Government should discuss the issue on Monday.
He also added that the military is ready to step in.
The “Smart Quarantine” project was placed under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Health on May 25th.
Before that, it was managed by a 90-member Central Control Team acting under the direction of the armed forces as a government advisory body headed by former Deputy Minister of Health Roman Prymula.
Jan Hamáček, the country’s Interior Minister (Czech Social Democratic Party), criticized the troublesome project on Sunday.
He, too, proposed that the military take charge.
Previously, Government Commissioner for IT and Digitalization Vladimír Dzurilla, who’s in charge of the system, admitted to its shortcomings.
“The system is functioning, but we’re still working on it.
It’s been developing separately and unsystematically for 20 years; now we’re trying to consolidate it in just a few months’ time.
It can’t be done in a flash.
Adopting to the new systems along the way, poor public-health-office workers are those who basically detect the faults,” Dzurilla stated.
Ostrava's mayor Macura won't run for office again, as he doesn't want to "lose his mind in politics"
The current mayor of Ostrava, Tomáš Macura (ANO), won't stand as a candidate in the next municipal elections.
The reason is that he is trying "not to lose his mind in politics," he said to the Respekt.cz magazine.
A member of ANO's party leadership, Macura has been the mayor of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the 2018 Ostrava municipal elections, ANO party with Macura at the top of the electoral list received almost one third of the votes.
Initially, Macura wanted to hold office only for four years.
"I was telling myself that I can make it for one term and, because I have experience in business, it would be enough time to take everything apart and give things here an overhaul," he told Respekt.
He added that he was, to some extent, talked into the second term.
"But that's the maximum for me.
I don't want to lose my mind in politics," Macura said in the interview, calling himself a complete introvert, who doesn't like to be in frequent contact with people.
According to Respekt, there have been speculations about Macura's possible departure from ANO for some time.
The magazine points out that Macura has criticised ANO several times, for example, for its alliance with the far-right SPD party or its support of Miloš Zeman in the presidential elections.
He was one of the few ANO party members who supported Zeman's rival candidate Jiří Drahoš in the election.
Becoming a member of ANO in 2017, Macura, however, doesn't plan to leave the party.
"As long as I feel that I can change something within the party and I'm not fighting a losing battle, and nobody is telling me how to do my job, I don't have an immediate motive to leave," he told Respekt.
Fifty-six-year-old Macura graduated from the University of Economics in Prague.
Before becoming Ostrava's mayor in 2014, he also worked as the director of Walmark, a pharmaceutical company.
He also had a seat on the boards of other companies.
Transportation service provider Uber returns to Brno
At the end of July, the Uber company offering transportation services will resume its activities in Brno.
It follows from a legislative amendment, Brno councillor for transport Petr Kratochvíl (ODS) explained in a press release on Thursday.
Taxi drivers in Brno protested against Uber, pointing to the company’s failure to comply with legal requirements to qualify for a ‘taxi’ service and its failure to use a taximeter.
The legislative amendment altered the conditions for the provision of both ordinary and alternative taxi services.
Kratochvíl organised a number of meetings with Uber representatives.
“As a result of these talks, the company decided to resume its activities in Brno at the end of July.
This decision was taken in response to the legislative changes thanks to which Uber can legally provide its services.
The city representatives were informed about these changes and we believe that the company’s services will respect the new limits,” Kratochvíl added.
Uber offered its services in Brno in the past.
Taxi drivers protested against the company, denouncing that the service’s cars were not designated as taxis and did not use taximeters.
The court ordered interim measures preventing Uber drivers from cruising Brno’s streets.
At first, the city representatives supported taxi drivers. At the end of last year, however, mayor Markéta Vaňková (ODS) declared that the city had wanted to enable Uber to return to Brno.
Later, the court ruled that Uber could operate in Brno, but the company did not use this opportunity.
It will return now, following the legislative changes.
Since August, it has been possible to operate not only traditional taxis with a roof sign and a taximeter, but also to provide transportation services ordered and paid exclusively via a mobile application.
Too lively of a celebration in Brno: a flying chair landed one meter away from a pedestrian on the sidewalk.
On Saturday evening, an office chair flew from the fourth floor of an apartment building, landing roughly one meter from the sidewalk.
A pedestrian, who happened to be walking by at that moment, immediately called the police.
Upon arrival at the address in question, located on the west side of town, the police immediately took note of an open window under which the chair still lay alongside several cans and cigarette butts.
The ruckus coming out of the room on the fourth floor indicated that a relatively loud party was in progress.
The officers approached the apartment through the building hallway and requested an explanation from three young men, aged between twenty-six and twenty-nine, said Jakub Ghanem, the spokesperson for the officers.
Babiš will hold talks with Social Democrats about Rafaj's possible dismissal
The Czech Prime Minister, Andrej Babiš (ANO party), is planning to hold talks with the Czech Social Democratic Party (ČSSD) – ANO's coalition partner – on Monday about the proposed dismissal of the head of the Antitrust Office (ÚOHS) Petr Rafaj.
The call for Rafaj's dismissal came from non-profit organizations and the Ústí nad Labem Region at the Government Anti-Corruption Council meeting.
The Social Democrats state that the change of the head of the office is advisable.
According to the news agency ČTK, Rafaj hasn't been invited to attend the Monday meeting at the Office of the Government.
His term expires in the middle of the next year, and by law he cannot be appointed for the third time.
His dismissal lies within President Miloš Zeman's authority.
Apart from the call made by the non-profit organizations, the Prime Minister has received a letter with a similar request from the Ústí nad Labem Regional Authority.
One of the reasons are, supposedly, Rafaj's recent scandals.
Last week, the Prime Minister refused to comment on this request before he gets acquainted with the materials and the coalition government takes a "certain stand".
He also said that he hadn't discussed these matters with the President so far, nor had he scheduled a meeting with him for the near future.
According to the statement of the Antitrust Office, there is no reason for Rafaj to be dismissed, as he hasn't been charged with anything.
The news websites IHNED.cz and Aktuálně.czwrote last week that the police are interested in Rafaj's meetings with Jiří Čunek, the Governor of the Zlín Region.
The websites found out that the meetings also concerned the selection of a contractor for the controversial eight-billion-crown project of a new Zlín hospital, which Čunek has been pushing for.
Čunek has admitted to meeting Rafaj and claims they discussed his "work in the Senate".
Rafaj has been telling a similar story.
The Ústí nad Labem Regional Authority called upon the Government to remove Rafaj from office in late June.
It also called for a reform of the Antitrust Office's decision-making mechanisms.
According to Jaroslav Komínek, Deputy Governor for Transport, the Office's decision-making regarding public procurements isn't transparent and shows signs of being arbitrary.
In March last year, the police intervened at the Antitrust Office because of a toll collection tender.
Then in June this year, Aktuálně.cz brought attention to the fact that Rafaj is using flats which are officially owned by a company belonging to Alexandr Čuba, an influential behind-the-scenes player of the Czech Social Democratic Party.
However, the deposit of 3.5 million CZK for the flat in Brno was paid from Rafaj's account.
Former MP from the ČSSD, Rafaj has been the Chairman of the Office for the Protection of Competition since 9 July 2009 and was appointed for the second term by the President in June 2015.
His second six-year term expires in less than a year.
The Czech competition law states that the Chairman can be removed from office upon the proposal of the Government.
His dismissal is possible only in cases when the Chairman hasn't been serving in the Office for more than six months or he has substantially compromised the dignity of the function or the Office's independence and impartiality.
Library employers collapsing from heat in the Czech town of Blansko.
Air-conditioning should help
Costing 740,000 Czech crowns, the new equipment will be up and running by the second half of August.
“The way I see it, it’s great news.
Me and my three children are frequent visitors at the library in the center of Blansko.
But it was virtually impossible to survive in there during the summer months.
It was scorching hot, and the air was awful.
Airing didn’t help.
That’s why I’m glad there will be air-conditioning,” said Petr Novotný, a reader from Blansko.
According to the director of the library Lukáš Dlapa, the temperatures in the building soar over 86 degrees.
The southern wall of the building is made of glass, working as a greenhouse during the sunny days.
“The sunlight hits the building for the most part of the day because of its curvature.
At the same time, it’s difficult to air all the departments, as the windows have to be closed at night for safety reasons.
As a result, the temperatures in the library often reach as high as 86 degrees since the morning,” Dlapa said.
Worst-off were the study and reading rooms on the third floor.
And the exhibition space and the director’s office one floor above.
Situated right at the top of the building, the children’s department, too, used to filled with hot air.
“We’ve had a few cases of librarians collapsing, having to take sick leave as a result.
The same issue would also arise in the cultural hall during lectures visited by dozens of people.
After only a few minutes, the room would become impossible to breathe in,” Dlapa added.
The original plan was for the air-conditioning to be installed into all areas of the library this year.
In the end, only three areas of the total five will be covered.
“Due to limited funding, air-conditioning will be installed only into the most problematic areas.
The study and reading rooms on the third floor.
Also, the cultural hall and the children’s department one floor up,” said Jiří Svoboda from the financial department of the Blansko town.
He also added that, last autumn, the workers installed the ventilation and adjusted the wiring as part of the first phase.
The cost amounted to approximately 360,000 Czech crowns.
Currently, the municipal library of Blansko has almost 3,000 registered readers.
About 900 of them are younger than 15 years old.
Chicago's goalkeeper sent coronavirus packing.
Crawford is back in the game
Not every sportsman contracting COVID-19 comes clean about it.
That's true especially about NHL players, as the league keeps its lips sealed and doesn't announce absolutely anything about the players' health.
Crawford is one of the few who have broken this pattern.
The 35-year-old native of Montreal participated only in the first practice and since then hasn't joined his squad.
He shared the reason behind his absence: "I'd like to tell everyone that I had been tested positive for COVID-19 and that's why I spent the past fourteen days quarantined in my house."
Fans don't need to worry about his state of health.
Crawford is ready to jump back into hard training.
"I'm excited to be back.
I'm going to do everything to get game shape back as quick as possible," he added.
The veteran goalkeeper has won two Stanley Cups with Chicago and has been an irreplaceable player in the goal area for the tenth season in a row.
The Blackhawks will first face St. Louis in an exhibition game and then begin a best-of-five play-in series against Edmonton.
In Israel thousands protest against Prime Minister
Thousands of Israelis took to the streets in several cities across the country to protest against unemployment, corruption and the way their PM Benjamin Netanyahu tackles the COVID-19 crisis.
Protesters rallied also in front of Netanyahu’s private villa in the town of Caesarea close to the Prime Minister’s official residence and in Tel Aviv’s parks.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, demonstrators having been gathering regularly for several weeks.
They call on Netanyahu to resign because of his involvement in a trial for corruption and fraud as well as the government’s handling of the second wave of the COVID-19 epidemic.
According to the Associated Press, one protester bore the slogan “Bibi, get out”, referring to the Prime Minister’s well-known nickname.
Another placard read “Everyone can see that the emperor has lost his clothes.”
The 70-year-old Netanyahu is the first serving Israeli Prime Minister to stand trial.
He faces charges in three cases of bribery, fraud and breach of trust.
He dismisses all charges as a witch-hunt.
According to the local media, the trial with more than 300 witnesses can last for up to three years.
Almost 60,500 people tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Israel, country of approximately nine million.
There has been a total of 455 COVID-19 related deaths.
In March, the Israeli government introduced quarantine measures that helped decrease daily surges in the number of confirmed cases.
With gradual easing of the restrictions since late April, the cases resumed their upward march.
Netanyahu’s opponents accuse the government of insufficient assistance to owners of small business, who have been hit hard by the quarantine measures.
The government has also been accused by demonstrators of issuing contradictory measures.
Driver dies in collision with tree
Firefighters had to use hydraulic scissors to cut the crashed car open to get the body out.
The tragic accident took place around 11 pm near Nevelkov on a narrow road leading off the Slapy Reservoir.
Driving at high speed, the car probably ran off the road into the forest and hit a tree.
The driver was killed instantly.
Firefighters had to use hydraulic scissors and cut the roof off to extricate the body.
The reasons for the crash are investigated by police.
They ordered a forensic autopsy which should, among other things, clarify whether the driver was under the influence of alcohol or different narcotics.
No more waste and flood of new collections.
Pietro Filipi bets on sustainability instead of sales
Czech fashion brand Pietro Filipi wishes to put more emphasis on sustainability through a major shift in its selling strategy.
Desiring to stop flooding the market with new collections, it cancels all sales.
It is no news to anyone that the garment industry ranks among the heaviest polluters in the world.
Billions of pieces of clothing end up in landfills and incineration plants every year.
In the recent years, there has been a relatively rapid shift in the way people perceive slow fashion, approach to clothing that has been until now frown upon by some.
Pietro Filipi managed to sell at full price about a half of goods.
It will be a challenge to refill its stock with the second half of goods sold at discounted prices.
The company no longer wants to overwhelm the market with new and new collections to be forced to sell products for less than their cost at the end of each season.
According to owner Michal Mička, long gone are the times when the fashion industry was dominated by the new and the old collections blindly following the rapidly changing fashion trends.
“The majority of sellers reflect the discounts already when purchasing goods, so the markup in the full price is higher at the outset.
So, it is deceiving in a way,” Pietro Filipi’s owner Michal Mička says.
Also, the brand’s new approach seeks to support local businesses.
“Each of our products is made by local designers using carefully selected high-quality fabrics.
Our emphasis is on creating a major portion of our collection with basics pieces – i.e., timeless pieces suitable for all seasons.
Globally, premium fashion brands never go on sale, since the price of each product already reflects its quality and there is simply no need for discounts,” Mička adds.
Giant graffiti depicts the RAF pilot Kurt Taussig.
The assignment was to create a work of art for the anniversary of the end of the war.
And I remembered our fighter pilot, who fought in the Royal British Airforce during the second world war.
The town's leadership liked my proposal, said Vacek of his work, which required two weeks of intensive creation to complete.
In order to finish the piece, he needed about 300 liters of paint and 50 spray cans.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplice-Šanova.
He left the town when he was 15 years old.
During the war, the Nazis sent him to an internment camp on account of his Jewish roots, where they held him for several weeks.
However, thanks to Nicholas Winton's organization, he and his brother were able to avoid being sent to a concentration camp.
In 1939, Taussig was able to reach Great Britain, where he voluntarily signed up with the Royal Air Force (RAF), and then went through pilot training in Africa's South Rhodesia and Palestine.
In early 1945, he joined combat operations.
In the years following the Velvet Revolution, he visited the Czech Republic on several occasions, even visiting his hometown Teplice, where he was granted honorary citizenship.
46 year-old Kamil Vacek, who is known by his moniker "Camo" by those in the Street Art world, has been working with spray cans in the streets of Teplice for over 20 years.
He started creating graffiti on surfaces that were earmarked for such use by the then mayor Jaroslav Kubera (ODS).
Hurricane Hanna made landfall in Texas
Hurricane Hanna roared ashore on the southwest coast of Texas, USA, on Saturday afternoon local time (last night before midnight CEST).
It made landfall on Texas' Padre Island, about 24 kilometers north of the small town of Port Mansfield, weakening to a tropical storm over land.
Despite that, meteorologists warn that it poses a great danger to the inhabitants of coastal areas.
It brought high winds and heavy rainfall; according to the AP news agency, the forecasters said Hanna could cause local flooding, power outages as well as various property damages such as damaged boats.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott issued a disaster declaration for 32 counties across Southwest Texas as early as on Saturday and recommended a voluntary evacuation.
The strongest warning was issued to the people living in the coastal zone between Port Mansfield and Mesquite Bay, but the natural disaster is expected to hit an area of almost 500 kilometers in total before gradually moving to Northeast Mexico.
"Although Hanna was downgraded to a tropical storm, it still threatens to bring heavy rain and high winds, storm surges, dangerous swells and isolated tornadoes," warned the American National Hurricane Center (NHC).
This morning local time (afternoon CEST), the storm was moving over the Mexico–U.S. border with winds of 85 km/h.
On Saturday, Hanna became the first hurricane of this year's Atlantic hurricane season.
Hanna's winds of 145 km/h over the Gulf of Mexico gradually weakened to 112 km/h as the storm was moving closer to the land and thus could no longer be classified as a hurricane.
The authorities urged locals to wait out the storm at home and to keep following the health protective measures preventing the spread of the coronavirus.
Texas is one of the American states that have been affected the most by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Given the current protective measures and the necessity of social distancing, potential evacuations could prove very challenging.
Temporary shelters have opened in hotels, schools and gymnasiums.
In Hidago County, Texas, one of the building has also been adapted into a shelter for evacuated people who had tested positive for coronavirus or been exposed to the infection in a different way.
Local officials call on all the evacuated people to bring face masks and hand sanitizers to the shelter if possible.
"We're not even close to over at this point.
We're still expecting catastrophic flooding," the AP news agency quoted Chris Birchfield with the National Weather Service (NWS) in Brownsville.
Forecasters said Hanna could bring 300 millimeters of rain just within hours – with isolated totals of almost 500 millimeters – and in addition to storm surges this could flood many buildings on the coast.
President Zeman will promote Lieutenant Lipka to General
Czech President Miloš Zeman will promote Lieutenant Lipka to the rank of General.
This follows from the overview of the Czech Defense Ministry's agenda.
In August, Lipka took over as Deputy Commander of the Multinational Division North East in Poland, laying the ground for his promotion.
To this day, Lipka has been serving as the Deputy Commander of the Czech Army’s ground forces.
The promotion was proposed to the President by the Government.
As of August, Lipka will replace Brigadier General Karel Řehka as the Deputy Commander of the Multinational Division North East based in the Polish city of Elblag, which coordinates operations under NATO's enhanced presence in Poland and the Baltic states.
In March Řehka became Director of the National Cyber and Information Security Agency (NÚKIB).
The Government has presented the President with a proposal to promote Lipka to Brigadier General.
Under the law on professional soldiers, promotion to a higher rank can be awarded for the duration of the office term or the performance of the official task requiring the promotion.
The post of the Deputy Commander of the Multinational Division corresponds with General’s rank.
The promoted soldier then has the same rights and obligations as if he was appointed to the post.
However, they’re not entitled to pay adjustment corresponding with the new rank.
The rank is effective until the expiration of the reasons for promotion.
“Demonstrating a high level of professional readiness, Lieutenant Lipka has been an example for his subordinates.
He has played a significant part in carrying out the tasks of the Czech armed forces such as working towards cooperation with international partners and ensuring the Czech army’s participation in international operations,” said the Czech Defense Ministry commenting on the promotion proposal.
The promotion will be taking place on Wednesday at 12.30pm at the Prague Castle and will be attended by Defence Minister Lubomír Metnar and Chief of the General Staff Aleš Opata.
EU states agree new COVID-19 standards for air travel
The EU states have agreed on a common framework of hygiene standards for air travel intended to help curb the spread of the new coronavirus.
The decision was announced by German Minister of Transport Andreas Scheuer.
The guidelines include social distancing and wearing face masks on plane and at airports. It was decided, on the other hand, that airlines will no longer have to leave middle seats empty.
Reuters agency reports.
“I am pleased that the German proposal was accepted by my colleagues at the European level and that we could agree on these uniform standards,” Scheuer told a European aviation conference.
The German Ministry of Transport added that the agreement was reached by officials and had yet to be formally approved by the ministers.
Measures agreed upon include mouth-and-nose protection for passengers from six years old and social distancing at airports during security checks and check-in.
A high fresh-air quota in planes must be guaranteed and information must be available in several languages.
Airlines will also be able to sell middle seats in their aircrafts.
The joint regulations meet at least some of the demands made by airlines.
Varying standards had caused confusion.
Temperatures in Arctic Svalbard hit a record high of almost 22 °C
"A 41-year-old record has been broken in Longyerbyen," announced Norway's Meteorological Institute on Twitter.
Later it added that the temperatures peaked at 21,7 °C early in the evening, breaking the record set in 1979 by 0,4 °C.
Home to around 2,000 people, Longyearbyen is the second largest town of Svalbard, located about 1,300 kilometres from the North Pole.
Svalbard is getting warmer faster than any other place on Earth.
The Norwegian Centre for Climate Studies stated in last year's report that this only highlights the dangers arising from the warming of other Artic regions all the way from Alaska to Siberia.
According to the Norwegian Centre, the average temperatures in Svalbard have increased between three and five degrees Celsius since the 1970s.
They could rise by a total of 10 degrees Celsius by 2100 if greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere are not reduced.
The temperature rise in Svalbard could cause the permafrost to thaw, endangering the stability of many buildings, roads and airports as well as cause more avalanches and landslides.
The climate warming also threatens Arctic wildlife, such as polar bears and seals, which depend on ocean's ice cover.
14-day quarantine introduced for UK arrivals from Spain
The British cabinet has called upon its citizens to refrain from travelling to mainland Spain unless absolutely necessary.
People returning from Canary and Balearic Islands are required to self-isolate too, despite these destinations not mentioned explicitly.
The new measures will come into force as of midnight.
“Protecting public health is our absolute priority.
We’ve taken this decision to limit any potential spread to the UK,” said the Government spokesperson.
“We’ve always been clear that we would act immediately to remove a country where necessary,” the spokesperson added.
As reported by the Metro newspaper, the new announcement will disrupt the travel plans of thousands of Britons.
Spain is one of the most popular holiday destinations.
Among other things, the British are worried that, should they be forced into 14-day self-isolation after returning from holidays, they won’t receive any sick pay.
Having booked a 10-day holiday to Lanzarote, Neil Hunter from Sittingbourne was supposed to leave on Tuesday.
The trip has been booked since December.
“We were going as a family, my wife Amanda, and daughter Bethany, but to be honest, since this announcement, I’m unsure what’s going to happen.
I work as a train driver, and I don’t think my employer will accept me having to isolate for two weeks due to going on holiday,” he was quoted saying by the Metro newspaper.
Spain is feared to be on the verge of the second wave of the pandemic.
During the last two days, there were 900 new cases recorded every 24 hours.
Some regions have already started implementing stricter measures – Catalonia, for example, seeks to restrict all nightlife in order to prevent large gatherings of people.
Recently, the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs has warned about the high risk of COVID-19 infection in Spain, Aragon, the Basque Country, and Madrid area.
Government will discuss the model of electricity purchasing from Dukovany power plant
On Monday, the Czech Government will discuss the model of purchasing electricity generated in a new planned unit of the Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant.
According to a new bill, in case the purchase price is higher than the market energy price, the consumers will pay the price difference in the form of tariffs.
On the other hand, if the purchase price is lower than the market price, the consumers will be affected in the opposite way.
The price of the energy – i.e., the commodity itself – isn't regulated by the state and constitutes only a part of the total electricity price paid by a consumer.
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry, Karel Havlíček (ANO party), and the energy company ČEZ have previously stated that it's more probable people will pay less for electricity thanks to this construction.
Analysts, on the other hand, point out that the long-term outlook for the market electricity prices is always uncertain, which was proved many times in the past.
The plan has already been criticised by environmental organizations.
"The purchase price can be either lower or higher than the market energy price.
Therefore, the final impact when this rule comes into effect can be either negative or positive.
The impact will be distributed among customers either according to the size of their circuit breaker in case of lower electricity consumption, or according to their energy consumption in case of higher electricity consumption," the Ministry of Industry and Trade stated in their documents.
In May, Havlíček said that he expects the wholesale electricity price to go up so people will gain from the construction of Dukovany.
If it's the opposite case, each household will have to pay just a couple of euros more per year, which, in Havlíček's opinion, is much less than the amount of money people get charged every year for the support of renewable energy sources.
He estimated earlier that the purchase price could range from €50 to €60 (CZK 1,320–1,600) for a megawatt-hour (MWh).
The presented documents don't include a price proposal, as it's supposed to be included later in the energy purchase agreement.
The current electricity price at the Prague Energy Exchange for 2021, for which traders are now "stockpiling", is around €45 (CZK 1,190) per MWh.
"If the difference between the purchase price and the market energy price is 10 euros, an average household with the consumption of 3,3 MWh per year – this can be a family of four that uses standard electrical appliances including electrical stove and oven, but does not have electric heaters or electric water heating – will have to pay a balance due of 100 CZK per year," wrote The Ministry of Industry and Trade in the documents for the Government.
"We live in an extremely turbulent time.
The coronavirus pandemic showed the vulnerability of the global economy.
That's the reason why I consider the long-term outlook of the market prices to be purely a matter for speculation," said earlier the executive director of the investment group Energy Financial Group, Tomáš Voltr, to the news agency ČTK.
According to the bill, the energy would be purchased at a pre-agreed price by a state-owned legal entity authorized by the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
Guaranteeing the conditions of electricity purchasing, the agreement between the investor and the state would be concluded for a period of at least 30 years with a repeated possibility of a ten-year extension, but no longer than until the termination of low-carbon energy generation.
The bill defines a low-carbon plant as an electricity generation site with a nuclear reactor connected to an electricity grid with a minimum of 100 MW installed capacity after the year of 2030.
Havlíček stated before that the new unit at Dukovany site should have a capacity of 1,200 MW and generate 9 terawatt-hours of electricity per year, which should cover one tenth of the estimated consumption in Czechia.
The nuclear unit is expected to be operational in 2036.
The model for financing the new Dukovany unit was approved by the Government on Monday.
The facility should be interest-free during construction, and the Government expects interest at 2% during operation.
The financial model is criticised by the opposition which also dislikes the possibility of Russian or Chinese companies being involved in the construction.
The Czech Republic is expected to cover 70% of the construction costs.
ČEZ is supposed to pay for the rest as well as for other possible additional costs.
In May, ČEZ CEO, Daniel Beneš, said to ČTK that the estimated cost of the unit construction at current prices is approximately €6 billion (CZK 162 billion).
The agreements between ČEZ and the government regarding the construction of the new unit at Dukovany site will be signed on Tuesday.
Ministry of Regional Development abandons plan for media campaign to support tourism worth 2 billion
The Ministry of Regional Development (MRD) has withdrawn a strategy to spend CZK 2 billion on a media, Internet and billboard advertisement campaign aimed at persuading Czechs to spend their holidays in the country. The plan was withdrawn from a government comments procedure.
Minister Klára Dostálová (ANO) said to the SeznamZprávy.cznews portal that the ministry will work in the document further.
The strategy was first brought up by the Zdopravy.czwebsite, pointing out to the project listed in the government electronic information system eKlep.
The Ministry explained that the strategy was designed as a response to the losses suffered by the touristic sector suffered in wake of COVID-19.
The media’s earnings slumped during the crisis, too.
The strategy was slammed by the opposition and representatives of the touristic sector.
The strategy, which can be consulted on the hlidactstatu.czwebsite, planned to support domestic tourism via allocating a generous budget to the Czech Tourism Authority which, in turn, was supposed to launch an advertisement campaign on TV and radio stations, in newspapers, on the Internet, on billboards and advertising displays at train stations.
TV stations would receive the largest portion of CZK 700 million.
The majority of the funding was directed to private television stations Nova and Prima.
Print daily and weekly press would receive CZK 400 million and the same amount would be spent on PR articles, advertisement banners and video clips.
Radio stations, mostly private, would obtain CZK 350 million.
The remaining CZK 150 million was intended to be used to pay for outdoor advertising using billboards, LED screens and advertising displays at train stations and metro stops.
The campaign to promote Czech tourism was scheduled to last over six months starting in mid-August.
“The strategy is still being developed. It is definitely not ready to be presented to the public,” explained minister Dostálová without further details to SeznamZprávy.
The campaign came under criticism by the opposition. According to leader of TOP 09 Markéta Pekarová Adamová, the campaign would help primarily the media actors pertaining to the trust funds owned by Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO).
“I firmly hope that this flagrant lack of humility will be punished by the results of the upcoming fall elections,” she said on Twitter.
Minister Dostálová dismisses the criticism according to which the strategy’s aim is to bail out media hit by the crisis.
“It may well be just a coincidence, I have no information about supporting the media,” she said on Friday to the Deník N daily.
She said the budget was just indicative.
“We are, naturally, still working on the final amount. It can be less or more.
It is just a blueprint,” she added.
The representatives of the ‘Let us save our tourism’ initiative dismiss the campaign to support domestic tourism, referring to as non-sensical.
“We need the budget of 2 billion to support the companies in tourism, and not a useless campaign,” Tomáš Barčík, the initiative’s leader, said on Sunday.
In an open letter sent to the government, the initiative representatives explain that if the government has are spare 2 billion, it should channel it to Czech companies.”
The juice of life, a beer tap, and death as a stalk of grass
The third album by Jaroslav Erik Frič, the Brno poet, tireless organizer of cultural activities, and publisher, who passed away a year ago May 24th, has been posthumously released.
This is the fifth entry in Frič's discography and like all his previous titles, it once again focuses on Frič's poetry, of which he himself is an excellent interpreter.
Born in 1949, Frič was understandably influenced by the American Beat Generation, and it is through this inspiration that he processed his own personal experiences as well as his own internal personal beliefs.
Far from wanting to provoke, when he spoke or wrote about faith and god, it was also always with a very intimate, non-confrontational, and completely tolerant style.
Bohuslav Reynek, the master of forgiveness, comes to mind (in contrast to Jan Zahradníček, for instance).
Frič's album offers not only the author's reading from 2006, but also performances with musicians, and whether it was Josef Klič or Honza Bartoň and Vitězslav Holata, they always accompany him with great sensitivity.
I look forward to them - gladly- are the words of Ostrava poet, Petr Hruška regarding Frič's long, poetic compositions.
On the topic of our endangered world, Hruška writes that "a proud and never-ending bitterness radiated from them".
The world, which continues to fall deeper and deeper into numbing consumerist vanity and greed, is straying further away from that which created its soul - from the secrets of faith, humility and human connection.
A nostalgia echoed for the one who recognizes that the values for which one was created are of little interest to most, but who is also aware that it is impossible to renounce those very values on account of a lack of general interest.
The poems remind us that while one might lose everything of value, it is not important how one comes to this loss.
If forced into bankruptcy sale, one might resign oneself with skepticism, give-up out of fear, or calmly and proudly maintain one's faith in what one believes and what one loves.
Hamáček: "Paroubek isn't my consultant"
Former Czech Prime Minister and leader of the Czech Social Democratic Party, Jiří Paroubek, isn't a paid consultant for the Social Democrats.
Jan Hamáček, the current Party leader and the Minister of the Interior, only communicates with him and reads his articles and opinions.
Hamáček said this today in Prima Partie TV programme.
The news about Paroubek allegedly being Hamáček's consultant was brought by SeznamZprávy.cz news website on Friday.
"We text each other from time to time, he sometimes sends me some materials, and I read through them," said Hamáček today.
However, he added that this isn't an official and paid cooperation.
He claims that the Czech Social Democratic Party doesn't have enough means to waste them on such purposes.
"I am not the only one who sometimes reads his opinions," he said.
In the following discussion with Jana Černochová, an MP from the Civic Democratic Party, the Minister said that many Civic Democrats "unapologetically listen to the opinions of Václav Klaus".
In his view, it is okay as Klaus is a seasoned politician and a former leader of their party, which is the same case with Paroubek.
He said that the fact that media were blowing this out of proportion was just a sign of this year's silly season.
On Friday, SeznamZprávy.cz wrote that Paroubek works for Hamáček as his unofficial consultant.
The news website also reported that Petr Benda's name is fourth on an electoral list in the Ústí nad Labem Region; Benda used to be a local party leader of the Social Democrats, and he also has connections to Paroubek, as he acted as Deputy Leader of his party LEV 21.
Today, Hamáček said the he wouldn't comment on the composition of the list until it was finalized and approved.
Duplantis has a mile long lead, it's a kick in the butt, the Swede's challenger lamented.
The 22 year old pole vaulter has both the ambition and the potential to present a serious challenge to the new top competitor.
He already knows what it is like to beat Duplantis, who is younger by two years, having defeated him last year at a NCAA meet.
Last year, we already went up against one another, with him winning and me coming in second, and then we swapped positions.
In both cases, it was a really good fight, describes Nilsen, who secured his victory with a height of 5,95 meters.
However, since then, Duplantis has shot straight up, and at the moment finds himself alone in the highest echelons of pole vaulting.
At a mere twenty years of age, he became a world record holder, clearing the bar at 6,17 meters at Torun on February 8th of this year, and adding still another centimeter a week later in Glasgow.
He could already jump six meters at eighteen years, when he finished high school, remembers his peer Nilsen for the website Světové atletiky.
It was obvious that once he fully matured from boy to man, his potential and talent would multiply by tenfold.
Twenty is a pretty good age at which to break the world record, he believes.
Although Nilsen has a much thinner roster of accomplishments in comparison to Duplantis, the American has similar goals.
So far, he has hinted at his possibilities at the NCAA races, which he regularly wins, having improved his personal record of 5,93 meters in February of this year. Last year in August, he won gold at the Pan American games in Lima, and already in 2017 he earned a place representing America in the world championship, finishing 13th.
His next milestone will be to try for the first time to take part in the Diamond League.
Without any doubt, my priority is to make it into the professional circle and compete as much as I can in the Diamond League because that is how I can make a name for myself, he acknowledges.
When you are able to succeed at that level, then there is no doubt that you can perform similarly at events such as the Olympic Games, the World Championships, or the Pan American Games.
However, because of the pandemic, these elite events have been postponed, which gives Nilsen and the other pole vaulters time to improve.
But will that be enough to go up against Duplantis, who is able to effortlessly change a match under the five circles into a battle for Silver?
We are all trying to catch up to him but I don't think that is possible, at least for the moment, claims Nilsen.
That guy has already been jumping for 16 years and he's a mile ahead of the rest in training.
And before Tokyo 2021 starts, it will be necessary to further improve.
Czech woman spends hundreds of thousands crowns from her son’s disability pension.
Prosecution is pending
The money provided to the 33-year-old by the state in the form of disability pension was intended to improve his quality of life.
The woman is now facing an 8-year prison sentence for fraud.
With the young man deprived of legal capacity on grounds of poor health, his mother was appointed his guardian, and as such was supposed to, among other things, manage his assets.
“Spending the money from her son’s disability pension on herself from November 2013 to this year’s January, the woman robbed him of a total of 440,000 Czech crowns,” said the police spokeswoman Dana Ladmanová, adding that the fact of her having a special duty to protect the interests of the injured party as the guardian qualifies as aggravating circumstance.
Following the court’s instructions, she opened a bank account for her son, only to have the money transferred to her own one.
“Having paid for her son’s stay in a medical facility and his necessary medication, she used the rest of the financial aid to purchase a vehicle, electrical appliances and to cover other household costs,” reads the indictment.
She did admit that the money wasn’t hers to spend.
However, she justified it by saying that she had been using it to cover family costs.
“We struggled to pay the household bills.
We’ve never bought anything above standard.
It was only things my son would approve of.
I simply saw it as family money.
I had no idea I was committing a crime,” the woman explained to the police.
She promised to pay her son back.
Newly excavated artifacts suggest humans already lived in North America 30,000 years ago
Researchers excavated 1,930 limestone tools from Chiquihuite Cave in the Mexican state of Zacatecas, including sharp-edged stones possibly meant for cutting meat as well as stone points that could have been used to tip spears or pikes.
The scientists found out that the oldest samples date to between 33,000 and 31,000 years ago.
"There are only a few artefacts from that range.
However, the presence is there," said Ciprian Ardelean, an archeologist at the University of Zacatecas and the lead author of one of the studies published about this topic in the journal Nature.
The youngest samples date back 12,500 years ago.
According to the experts, people lived in Chiquihuite Cave, located high above the sea level, for a long period of 20,000 years.
Until now, the generally accepted theory was that the first members of Homo sapiens species crossed a land bridge from present-day Russia to Alaska some 13,500 years ago.
Archeological evidence, including unique spear points used to kill mammoths and other prehistoric animals, showed that this Clovis culture later spread across much of Northern America.
In the past decades, however, this model has started falling apart, as several ancient settlements dating back two to three thousand years earlier have been discovered.
In the second study published by the journal Nature, evidence from 42 different sites around all Northern America indicates human presence on the continent as early as 26,000 to 19,000 years ago.
Scientists believe that a small number of people could have entered North America earlier than it was presumed until now.
Some of them could have reached America by boat as well.
"Clearly, people were in America long before the development of Clovis culture," said Ruth Gruhn, an anthropologist at the University of Alberta in Canada, commenting on the new findings.
Increase in demand for air travel follows optimistic outlooks, sellers claim
Airfares have been gradually going down
With each week, the sales of flights in the Czech Republic have been on the rise.
The number of booked flights is still approximately half the amount in last summer, but with each week, it has been steadily on the rise of nearly 20%.
According to sellers, such post-crisis developments meet their most optimistic expectations.
Airfares have been gradually going down.
Sellers claim that the most demanded destinations include the Southern European countries.
According to the Kiwi.com flight search site, Spain, Italy and Greece rank among the top three destinations.
The most sought-after flights at the Letuška.cz portal are those from Prague to Split in Croatia.
Other favourite destinations include the UK, which has been traditionally on the top of the list.
The average cost of a flight ticket has been plunging, too.
At Letuška.cz, in mid-April the average price for a flight was approximately CZK 6,250, which is CZK 3,000 fewer year-on-year.
This decrease is primarily due to the increased demand for flights to European countries, representing nearly 85% of all sales.
The price has been going down for some specific locations in Europe, such as Spain or Italy, where airfares dropped by nearly one fifth in the recent weeks.
Also, customer behaviour has changed in the crisis. People tend to buy flights in significantly shorter lead times before departure, as they feel insecure about the next evolutions of the pandemic.
According to data from the previous years by Kiwi.com, the lead time before departure has shortened by approximately 10 days year-on-year.
“This confirms a future tendency of customers to buy tickets much less in advance, as they will be requiring more flexibility and less risks,” Michal Šindelář, Vice President of Consumer Product at Kiwi.com, says.
Currently, customers book their flights on average 21 days prior to departure.
As the sales rise, more and more routes from Czechia have been restored.
At the moment, the Prague Airport dispatches regular flights to more than 60 destinations.
This is about half as many as in the summer last year.
The World Matchplay final is coming up tonight!
Watch the darts battle live on Nova Sport
The second most prestigious PDC tournament has come to the big finale.
The experienced 49-year-old Gary Anderson from Scotland will face the 26-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh, the dark horse of the tournament.
In the first round, Gary Anderson defeated Justin Pipe and was matched against his nearest rival in the ranking table.
Having beaten James Wade, he did well against Simon Whitlock, who had previously taken out the world’s number one player.
“The Flying Scotsman” came close to losing against Michael Smith.
It was a narrow escape, but he took the lead in the extra time, eventually prevailing 18-16 and securing his place in the final, which he had won in 2018 with an epic 21-19 victory against Mensur Suljovic.
The biggest surprise of the World Matchplay is Dimitri van den Bergh.
Enjoying the tournament, the Belgian genius has been delivering incredible performances, perhaps owing to the feeling that he has nothing to lose.
Having taken out the world’s number six Nathan Aspinall in a shocking win, the 26-year-old darts player prevailed in a dramatic battle against Joe Cullen and, after a fierce start, beat Adrian Lewis in the quarterfinal.
The semi-final was a big test.
Glenn Durrant showed his strength right away, but the ever-calm Belgian won several legs in a row to take the lead, holding it until the very end.
Van den Bergh showed he’s good at securing high scores, thus compensating for being somewhat uncertain at throwing doubles.
The Czech Republic sees lowest coronavirus cases since the beginning of the week amid a fall in testing
Since early March, when the novel coronavirus was first detected in the Czech Republic, it has infected 15,212 people.
Almost 9,600 of them have recovered, while 368 died.
The number of infected people now stands at 5,254.
The supporting data are available on the Ministry of Health’s website.
This week, the daily number of positive cases has exceeded 200 four times in a row.
The peak was reached on Friday with 281 new cases.
On Thursday, 235 tests came back positive, the same was true of 246 tests the day before and 206 tests conducted on Tuesday.
On the first working day of this week, 169 people were identified as infected.
Up until now, 9,590 people have recovered from COVID-19, which amounts to 63 % of the total number of infected individuals.
Most people experience mild symptoms.
According to the latest data from the Ministry of Health, 151 people are hospitalized, with 19 of them in a condition described as serious.
There are several COVID-19 hotspots in the Czech Republic.
The highest number of cases per 100,000 inhabitants has been recorded in the Karviná District (just below 59).
Next come the Jihlava District with 56 cases and Frýdek-Místek District with 36 cases per 100,000 people over the last week.
Due to a sharp rise in cases, new measures have been introduced in the Czech Republic since Saturday.
People are required to wear face masks at mass indoor events with more than 100 people; this applies to cultural and sports events as well as indoor weddings and funerals.
Starting Monday, their current maximum capacity of 1,000 will be cut by a half.
The number of confirmed novel coronavirus cases worldwide has surpassed 16 million.
These data have been provided by John Hopkins University, which has been monitoring the pandemic on a global scale.
According to this source, the number of people who died with COVID-19 is edging towards 645,000.
The latest million positive cases have been recorded over the past three days alone, with the 15-million threshold crossed on July 22nd.
With over 4,1 million cases, it’s mainly the United States that are responsible for the recent sharp rise in worldwide infection rates, followed by Brazil with 2.4 million and India with nearly 1.4 million infections recorded officially.
Infection rates are rising at a record-high pace.
As announced by the World Health Organization this week, there had been over 284,000 new cases recorded from Thursday to Friday worldwide, marking the highest daily total since the beginning of the pandemic.
This development can be attributed to the fact that the most populous countries such as USA, Brazil, or India are now at the peak of virus spread; however, according to Reuters, numbers have been rising in nearly 40 countries around the world for the past week.
This includes countries like Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium, and Israel.
The virus has spread into almost every country on Earth, with North Korea reporting its first case today.
Indoor air quality five times worse than outdoor.
Air fresheners and deodorants are bad for health
It’s not only the outdoor air pollution, but also the low indoor air quality that pose a threat to our health.
This was pointed out by The Jerusalem Post quoting Carol Abraham, an Israeli expert on human health.
According to Abraham, who’s credited with the foundation of the Ministry of Environmental Protection of Israel, it’s especially important to turn our attention to household pollutants now when many people spend more time working from home.
Abraham mentioned a study conducted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), deeming the indoor air quality as much as five time worse than outdoor.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has concluded that 3.8 million people die prematurely due to indoor air pollution.
“The Coronavirus epidemics has been forcing many people to work from home and with people spending more time inside, it’s time we tackle household air quality,” Abrahams said.
According to Abrahams, the problem of “household air” quality is hardly ever addressed in Israel.
All the while, there’s potential danger in items with which we come in contact on a daily basis such as paints, air fresheners, disinfectants, deodorants, and pesticides.
“Even the clothes that are regularly taken to the dry cleaner’s emit poisonous gas,” Abraham stated.
As pointed out by Abraham, it is children, the elderly, and people with respiratory diseases that are at most risk.
However, even the otherwise healthy individuals might develop symptoms such as headache, faintness, irritability of nasal cavity, nose bleeding, vomiting, and skin allergy.
Long-term exposure to harmful substances can damage internal organs and the central nervous system.
That being said, it’s not just the household items that produce pollutants, construction materials can be a source too.
Take quiz on Václav Havel: how long was he jailed and what made him sign Charter 77?
The COVID-19 pandemic thwarted the Fuenlabrada team’s hopes to win promotion to Spain’s top football league.
The league’s executives cancelled the originally postponed game against La Coruna, where the team hoped to secure a spot in the final playoff.
On Saturday, Fuenlabrada confirmed 12 more positive tests on COVID-19, bringing the total number of confirmed cases within the team to 28.
Following the increase in coronavirus cases in the team, its final-round match against La Coruna, where it needed at least a draw to make it to the playoffs, was postponed from its original date on Monday.
The league said today that since there was no alternative date available to play the match, they had to invoke the force majeure clause and suspend the game permanently.
Fuenlabrada accepted the decision.
La Coruna opposes it.
Even if it won the game against its Madrid-based rival, given the results of its other opponents this would not be enough to save the team’s chances for promotion. The team does, however, think it was unfair that it could not finish the competition in full as is customary.
The executives of this formerly elite Spanish club threaten to take a legal action against the decision which has driven it to the brink of dropping to the third tier of Spanish football.
The two top teams in the gird, Huesca and Cádiz, are certain to be promoted to the Liga.
In the playoffs, the third and final spot for promotion will be claimed by Zaragoza, Almería, Girona and Elche.
Was there no love lost between Havel and Gott?!
Gott’s daughter Dominika talks
“My dad had a got at Havel for many years,“ Dominika, the eldest of Gott’s daughters, said for Aha!. ‘Maestro’, as Gott was affectionately referred to by its supporters, could not simply stand Havel and flied off the hand every time the name of the former Czech president was brought about.
We can only speculate as to what happened, but according to Dominika, the bad blood dates back to the 90s.
“In an interview given after the fall of the communist regime, my father said that things had been easier for Havel than for him.
While Havel could secretly write his pieces even in the darkest hour, my father knew that any sign of defiance would cost him his entire career,” young Gott explains.
But she quickly adds that, in the end, the two prominent Czechs found a way to overcome the grudge.
“I know that until he turned sixty, only hearing Havel’s name used to drive him up a wall.
But then, the President congratulated him on his birthday, and my day started to gradually change his opinion,” Dominika recalls.
For that matter, Gott eventually invited the already former President to the celebration of his 70th birthday at Ambassador Hotel on Wenceslas Square in Prague.
“From then on, their relationship entered a new phase, because my father started to regularly invite Havel over to his villa Bertramka,” the blond, whose father passed ways last October, says.
The laureate of the Nightingale award, recognition of the most popular Czech pop singers, regretted that Václav Havel had never recognised his work with a state decoration.
Eventually, he was awarded one by Havel’s successor Václav Klaus (79) in 2009.
The incumbent president Miloš Zeman (75) will give the late Gott the Order of the White Lion, the country’s highest state honour, in memoriam this year to pay tribute to his legacy.
Humidity from Tuesday onwards in the Czech Republic, as meteorologists issue fire warning.
The high temperature warning issued by meteorologists takes effect from Tuesday afternoon and applies to all of the Czech Republic with the exception of the Karlovarsky Region as well as southern and central Moravia.
Exceptionally, temperatures could exceed 34 degrees celsius, especially in central Bohemia, they stated.
During the heat, they recommend that people make sure to drink plenty of fluids and to restrict their physical activity during midday and afternoon hours.
From Tuesday morning, there will be an increased fire hazard due to the hot weather and minimal precipitation.
Windy weather could accelerate their spread.
The meteorologists' warning of increased fire hazard pertains to central Bohemia, including Prague and the Liberecky, Ústecky, Karlovarsky, and Plzensky regions.
The fire hazard warning will remain in effect until further notice.
We do not expect any significant precipitation either in northwestern or western Bohemia which would help diminish the risk of fire before the end of the week, stated ČHMÚ.
The Prague Magistrate reacted to the meteorologists' warning by banning fire-building in risk-prone areas from Tuesday onwards.
People in the capital city will not be allowed to build fires in open spaces, for instance in parks, gardens or forests, and must ensure a distance of 50 meters from the outer periphery of forest areas.
Smoking and the use of pyrotechnics are also banned in these areas.
These measures will be valid until further notice informed Vít Hofman, spokesperson for the Prague Magistrate.
