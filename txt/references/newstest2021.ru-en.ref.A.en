Semilarski vs. the Prosecutor's Office: The cassation of Tartu's ex-deputy mayor will be examined on August 4th
This means that a decision on it will, most likely, be made in the beginning of September.
The first two court instances declined to examine Semilarski's case, but in the beginning of April the Federal Court took up his cassation appeal.
On December 12, 2019, the Tartu administrative court returned the appeal to the appellant, as the decision was not within the purvey of the administrative court.
In its decision, the court indicated that the appeal contained demands for the compensation of damages incurred during the course of the criminal proceedings.
"The prosecutor and the circuit court should handle these issues," press secretary of Tartu courts Anett Kreitsmann earlier explained to ERR's correspondent.
According to Kreitsmann, Valvo Semilarski contested the decision in the district court which, on February 5th, did not alter the decision of the first-instance court.
Now the Federal Court will have to voice its opinion.
According to Semilarski's defense attorney, sworn attorney Oliver Nääs, for about two years his client was groundlessly under suspicion of taking bribes.
Now he demands that the prosecutor reverse the false assertions that were directed at him and compensate him for moral damages.
The reason for the court appeal was statements made by the prosecutor in the special cases of the Lyuna district prosecutor Margus Gross, which were made by him on October 2017, when Semilarski was arrested along with the other Taru deputy mayor at the time, Artjom Suvorov, under suspicion of committing several crimes .
"We'd like to remind you that, when I was arrested, the Security Police and the prosecutor quickly organized a press conference and informed the entire Republic of Estonia that administrators of Tartu, one of the most influential organs of local governance, were corrupt.
Those public suspicions that were left hanging in the air dogged me for about two years.
And now, when these assertions and suspicions turned out to be false, the prosecutor doesn't want to say anything about it," Semilarski commented in the beginning of August 2019.
According to Oliver Nääs, at the press conference the prosecutor stepped beyond the legal bounds within which the prosecutor should act.
"The assertion regarding bribes and corruption turned out to be false, but that's not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has stressed more than once in its decisions regarding Russia, and also Lithuania, that during the stage of investigation government representatives should be careful in choosing their words, so that suspects are not presented as criminals until a judgement is made.
The prosecutor is also obliged to this by presumed innocence, which, unfortunately, was not observed in the case against Valvo Semilarski," Nääs said.
"Semilarski's presentation to the public as a serious violator of the law and bribe taker under circumstances when the facts laying at the base of the suspicion of bribe-taking were still being determined, is unacceptable, contradicts the presumption of innocence, and is unfair to the appellant," the attorney added.
rus.err.ee wrote that Tartu ex-deputy mayor Valvo Semilarski will not be brought to court on accusations of bribery—the criminal case made against him in June was partially closed.
Meanwhile, the former government official is being tried for accusations of intentional violation of anticorruption laws when conducting deals of an especially large size.
According to the letter of accusation, during the period of 2015–2017 on more than thirteen occasions the Tartu ex-deputy mayor participated in city administration meetings regarding the carrying-out of decisions relating to companies doing business in Tartu, the owners and managers of which Semilarski corresponded with personally during hours outside of work.
According to Gross, Semilarski had personal interests involved in all these cases, and for this reason should have avoided participating in the decision-making process.
Earlier, rus.err.ee wrote that the prosecutor put forward suspicions of Semilarski in the taking of bribes and the violation of anti-corruption laws when conducting deals of an especially large size.
This occurred in October 2016, when he was arrested with the other deputy mayor, Artjom Suvorov (Center Party).
At that time, the prosecutor and the Security Police announced that there was compelling evidence against both deputy mayors.
Following this, both government officials resigned.
Suvorov's case was later brought before the court, which fully exculpated the politician.
Judicial inquiry into Valvo Semilarski's case is ongoing.
Ex-soloist of the group Hands Up visited Tver Region
The ex-soloist of the group Hands Up, now a solo artist, businessman, and actor, Sergey Zhukov, posted a photo from Kalyzazin, Tver Region on his official Instagram account.

Clubs vying for Locomotiv star Miranchuk have come to light, as has his salary in Italy.
According to Sport-Express, Serie A teams Milan, Lazio, Fiorentina, and Atalanta are currently vying for Lokomotiv defensive midfielder Aleksei Miranchuk.

The US called on Qatar and its neighbors to stop their feud
It is essential to restore trust and unity between Qatar and other states, US Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook believes.
He stated that the conflict between the emirate and other countries in the region has already gone on too long, and will damage regional interests of stability, prosperity, and security.
So far the US has unsuccessfully tried to be a mediator in settling the conflict, which Washington sees as a "threat to efforts to contain Iran."
Three years ago the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Bahrain broke off diplomatic relations with Qatar.
They set up a transit blockade, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorism.
Doha responded by claiming that its neighbors are simply envious of Qatar's economic success—according to the IMF, for several years Qatar has been leading by a wide margin in per-capita GDP.
The emirate comes in third in natural gas reserves, is the sixth largest exporter of natural gas, and is the largest exporter of petroleum and petroleum products.

How the Central Bank’s decision to cut the key rate will affect the economy
The Bank of Russia is expected to cut the key rate again.
It dropped another 0.25 percentage points to 4.25% per annum – officially another historical low.
Judging by the return of the short-term rate cuts, the tone of the Central Bank’s statements, and the updated forecasts for the Russian economy, the regulator has a more optimistic view of the economic outlook than before.
This means the current cycle of the easing monetary-credit policy could soon come to an end.
“We have continued the easing monetary-credit policy, mainly considering that the dangers of the fluctuation of inflation down from 4% in 2021 have persisted”, said the head of the Bank of Russia Elvira Nabiullina.
They are connected to a significant decline in economic activity and a drop in domestic and foreign demand.
Economic recovery, according to Nabiullina, will take more than a year and a half.
At the same time, she noted that after lifting the pandemic restrictions, economic processes have revived: energy consumption and consumer and investment demand were restored, the construction and production of consumer goods were expanded, and the annual rate of decline in the turnover of transport and industrial production slowed.
According to the Central Bank’s updated forecast, the economy will decline by 4.5-5.5% in 2020 (4.6% was previously expected), and the economic recovery growth in 2021 will be 3.5-4.5%, in 2022 – 2.5-3.5%.
Additionally, the Bank of Russia revised its forecast for the annual price of oil to $38 and $40 per barrel of Urals in 2020 and 2021 respectively.
The Central Bank earlier expected $27 and $35 dollars per barrel.
Finally, the Bank of Russia forecasts 2020 inflation at 3.7-4.2% against the previously expected 3.8-4.8%.
The Bank of Russia’s view of the economic situation is becoming more optimistic, bringing us to the end of the easing cycle, believe Sophia Donets and Andrey Melaschenko, Renaissance Capital economists for Russia and the CIS.
Thus, the Bank of Russia has been consistently cutting the key rate for more than a year; it has already fallen 3.5 percentage points since the beginning of last summer.
And at the last meeting in June, the Central Bank lowered it immediately by one percentage point due to low inflation rates connected with suppressed demand and the need to stimulate the economy, which had stalled due to the pandemic and related restrictions.
The possibility of further adjustment to the monetary-credit policy remains (at the next session on September 18 and until the end of the year), but the limit is already near, agrees the lead RosBank analyst Evgeny Koshelev.
The aggregate of pro-inflationary risks also points to a coming pause in percentage policy easing – broken supply chains, possible cost increases due to epidemic prevention measures, and a quicker (than expected) recovery in demand, he says.
To top it off, the subsequent actions of the Bank of Russia will require more attention to inflationary processes during harvest season, and also external volatility, which has grown against the background of geopolitical conflicts, indicates Koshelev.
One way or another, the reduction of the key rate will lead to further reduction in rates for the most reliable borrowers, and also, possibly, for mortgages, says the senior economist for Otkritie Bank’s analytical department Maxim Petronevich.
The rate correction will be less pronounced than the reduction of the key rate, he specifies.
Rates on private loans could fall another 0.3-0.5 percentage points during the second half of the year, and mortgage rates could end the year in the range of 6.2-7%, BCS Premier economist Anton Poktaovich doesn’t rule out.
In his opinion, average deposit rates will also fall – they could fall to 4.2-4.5% (they’re now barely 4.5%) in the coming months.
Further, they could even fall to 4% if the Central Bank reduces the key rate in the fall, Pokatovich believes.
The Center Party promises to pay all its debts by the end of the year

Earlier, news emerged that the prime minister's party had returned 110,100 euros to the government which had been determined to be a prohibited donation.

Psychologist reports: "Emelianenko still can't forget his break up with the woman he loves."
Psychologist Veronika Stepanova, who has over 1 million subscribers on YouTube, spoke about MMA wrestler Alexander Emelianenko, who is her sister's ex-husband.
"Olya met Sasha and they fell madly in love," Stepanova said in a video on her YouTube channel.
"It was all picture-perfect — they immediately had a kid and everything was wonderful and amazing.
At some point, Sasha got fed up with all of that and wanted to let loose a little.
And while some other woman might not have a problem with that (oh so what, he went off to have some fun and dance a little), that's not the case for Olya.
She won't stand for such things.
And that whole story of his about going off to have some fun ended with my sister immediately marrying another man and having a child with him right away.
When Sasha came to about what had happened, he couldn't believe it.
He tried to come crawling back on his knees and give her diamonds.
His overwhelming pride wouldn't give him peace.
He wanted to return everything to how it was, but he didn't know how.
Their relationship is friendly and they have a child together, but to this day he can't get his head on straight.
His destructive behavior is a cry of desperation — an attempt to either attract her attention or die trying."

Prosa's last club was Tartu's Tammeka, which he joined during the previous season.
"Due to an injury I've been out of football for over a year.
I had an operation on April 30th.
But now everything is all right; I'm ready to play again.
Though I'm currently far from being in the best shape.
When will I make my debut for Legion?
It's definitely possible that on July 29th I'll play for some amount of time at the Estonian Cup, and then on August 1st I'll be on the roster for the championship match against Paide.
It all depends on my trainer's decision; he'll decide whether I'm ready or not.
Personally, I think I still need to put on quite a bit more," Albert Prosa said in his Sunday interview with ERR.
In the current Estonian football championship, Legion holds ninth place in the tournament ranking after 14 tours, in which it scored 10 points.

I think that next year our results will be better.
But for this year, our job is to hold our spot in the upper league and to play more confidently," Prosa added.
"I'm not setting any kind of personal goals for myself.
It's not easy to come back to football after such a long break.
My main job right now is to help the team stay in the upper league and climb as high in the rankings as possible," the forward said.
Prosa previously played for the capital city's teams Flora and Infonet, for Finland's RoPS and TPS, and for Malta's Valletta.

The Main Naval Parade was celebrated with new boats and film techniques
A novel film technique was used at the Main Naval Parade in Saint Petersburg: a camera was passed under one of the boats, showing it "from the inside out."
It was from this perspective that the journey of the newest small-missile series ship Sovetsk along the Admiralty Embankment was filmed.
The Main Naval Parade was broadcast on the TV channel Russia-1 and on the site Russia.tv.
Earlier, on June 24, at the parade in honor of the 75th anniversary of the Great Victory, the camera "passed through" the barrel of a tank into the armored vehicle when cutting from one shot to another, and during the flight of fighter aircraft flown by the aerobatic teams Russian Knights and Swifts, the camera "flew out" of a plane's engine exit.
The Main Naval Parade, comprising 46 combat ships, motorboats, and submarines; 41 maritime aviation planes and helicopters; and over 4 thousand soldiers, took place in the Kronstadt water zone.
In particular, the large submarine chaser Vice-Admiral Kulakov, the corvette Stoiky, the large landing ships Minsk and Patriot, the nuclear-powered cruise missile submarine Orel, the submarine Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, the patrol ship Vasily Bykov, the antisubmarine corvettes Kazanets and Urenga, the small-size rocket ships Liven and Passat, and the missile boat Chuvashiya took part.
In the Kronstadt harbor in the Finnish Gulf, the large landing ship Pyotr Morgunov, built at the Baltic shipyard Yantar to the Nevsky Design Bureau's Project 11711, could first be seen.
The lead ship of the class, the Ivan Gren, is already serving in the Northern Fleet, TASS reports.
Among the other newcomers to have recently joined the navy's armaments was the Admiral Flota Kastanov, the first frigate of the class, built at the Northern Wharf shipyard to Project 22350.
Yet another navy newcomer was the diesel–electric submarine Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, built to Project 636.3 by the Rubin Central Design Bureau for Maritime Facilities on the Admiralty Wharfs.
It was added to Russia's Pacific Fleet in December 2019.
The other newest ships added recently to the Russian Navy are the Project 22800 small missile ships Sovetsk and Mytishchi, developed by the Almaz Central Maritime Design Bureau.
The Project 21631 Buyan-M small missile ships Veliky Ustyug and Serpukhov also participated in the parade on the Neva.
The largest participants were the nuclear-powered cruise missile submarine Orel and the large submarine chaser Vice-Admiral Kulakov—they could be seen in the Finnish Gulf.
In acknowledgement of the large contribution made by the Russian Navy to studies of the World Ocean, the two newest surveying motorboats, Georgy Zima and Mikhail Kazansky, paraded down the Neva with the combat ships. And the oceanographic research vessel Admiral Vladimirsky, which in June completed a circumnavigatory research expedition with the Russian Geographic Society to the shores of Antarctica in honor of the 200-year anniversary of its discovery by the Russian mariners Fabian Bellingschausen and Mikhail Lazarev, appeared in the waters near Kronstadt.
And by the Palace Bridge, the first, 16th-century Russian ship of the line Poltava, reconstructed on a historic wharf, could be seen.
This 54-gun sailing-ship was launched in 1712, partook in the war with the Swedish, and in 1717 carried out a landing on the island of Gotland.
In 1725 this ship was retired from the ranks of the Baltic Fleet and, after its reconstruction, was launched in Saint Petersburg on May 27, 2018.
Passage to Kronstadt was restricted this year during the parade due to preventative measures taken against the spread of COVID-19, RIA Novosti reports.

Survey: Ruling Lithuanian Farmers and "Greens" Union topped party ratings again
The Lithuanian Farmers and "Greens" Union, which heads the ruling Seimas coalition, topped the party ratings.
This was shown by a survey conducted by the sociological research company Vilmorus, commissioned by the newspaper Lietuvos rytas.
After their victory in the 2016 parliamentary elections, the "Farmers" dropped from first place and the main critic of Russia in Lithuania, the opposition Union of the Fatherland - Christian Democrats (Conservatives) was in the lead for a long time.
Nevertheless, assessing the parties' electoral chances, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda recently said that after the parliamentary elections this year, the Farmers and "Greens" Union will probably be able to form a coalition again.
This statement caused outrage among the conservatives.
The latest survey showed that if parliamentary elections were held today, 17.6 percent of voters would vote for the Farmers, and 17.2 percent for the Conservatives.
According to Vilmorus director Vladas Gaidys, the difference is within the margin of error, but still, the ruling party no longer lags behind the Conservatives.
According to Gaidys, the "Farmers'" sociological success was thanks to the news that their electoral roll will be headed by Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis.
This politician was also the first on the "Farmers'" roll in the 2016 elections.
In third place is the Social Democratic Party, which 7.1 percent of respondents are ready to vote for.
It unexpectedly lost 2 percent in a month.
Fourth is the Labor Party, led by Russian-born businessman Viktor Uspasskikh (6.2 percent).
Judging by the survey, the other political organizations won't be able to pass the 5-percent electoral barrier yet.
Putin spoke of the Russian fleet's unique advantages
Russian President Vladimir Putin announced at the Main Naval Parade in St. Petersburg that unique advantages and increased combat capabilities would be provided to the Russian fleet by the integration of state-of-the-art digital technology.

Emphasis will be placed on providing unique hypersonic missile strike systems.
The president added that the Navy was armed with the latest ships equipped with high-accuracy weapons, strategic submarine cruisers, and multipurpose submarines, as well as unique specialized equipment.
Putin also stressed that navy sailors complete the most difficult tasks with dignity, serving the Fatherland faultlessly.

Extra requirements for public procurement applications will be excluded by law
Legislation could establish comprehensive requirements for applications to participate in procurements.
At a plenary meeting in its fall session, the State Duma plans to examine a bill in its second reading that establishes requirements for the contents and registration of an application to participate in a procurement in which only small and mid-sized businesses may participate.
The government is introducing amendments to the law "On the procurement of goods, works, and services by certain types of legal entities".
The bill was developed pursuant to the roadmap for the implementation of the Strategy for the Development of Small and Mid-sized Business in the Russian Federation until 2030, approved by the government.
It anticipates the preparation of a draft law on a comprehensive list of documents that ordering parties have the right to require as part of an application from small and mid-sized business participants in a procurement.
And also - a list of requirements for the specified documents.
To date, the law "On the procurement of goods, works, and services by certain types of legal entities" partially regulates the procurement activities of specific types of legal entities.
Requirements for content, form, design, and structure of applications to participate in a procurement are independently established by ordering parties in the procurement documentation.
"As a result, ordering parties establish excessive requirements for the contents and registration of an application, requiring records, certificates, and abstracts that might only be received from the authorized bodies after the deadline set by the ordering party for submitting the application, which makes it impossible to participate in such a procurement and reduces the number of participants in the procurement", reads the explanatory note to the bill.
The new bill provides for the establishment of a comprehensive list of documents that ordering parties have the right to demand as part of the application for procurement from small and mid-sized business participants.
"The adoption of the document will do away with orderign parties' arbitrary requirements for the composition and content of applications from small and mid-sized business participants", the explanatory note says.
Republicans propose providing another $1 tln to support the US economy

Doctor Myasnikov named the important indications of a person's health
An oversized waistline is one of the most important criteria in the "deadly quartet"
Doctor and TV host Alexandr Myasnikov told of the key indicators for determining a person's health.
His so-called "deadly quartet" includes four criteria – high blood pressure, cholesterol, sugar and waist size, the doctor said on air on the Rossiya 1 TV channel.

For men, this parameter should not exceed 102 centimeters, and for women – 88 centimeters.
Exceeding these norms may be a sign that your health is in danger.
In the first place this concerns the heart's condition – a waistline greater than the norm is a risk factor for developing a stroke, heart attack, and also cancer and diabetes.
To recap, earlier Myasnikov told why it's okay to eat a piece of candy before bed.
The doctor explained that sugar in itself is not a health hazard, and dessert becomes harmful only when such food is eaten in large quantities, but a piece of candy before bed, according to him, is not the worst snack.

US experts named Pompeo the worst secretary of state in the country's history
International affairs experts Aaron David Miller and Richard Sokolsky named Mike Pompeo the worst secretary of state in the history of the United States.
CNN published their opinions on July 23.
"In just two short years Mike Pompeo – with an eye on the presidential post in 2024 and the support of President Donald Trump - has become not only the worst secretary of state in US history but also the most partisan," the text says.
The experts accused Pompeo of having "politicized the office of secretary of state and debased the institution he runs", for the sake of promoting his personal political program and protecting Trump "from accountability and the rule of law".
In particular, they say the secretary of state covers up the "Trump blackmail of Ukraine" and is willing to throw State Department officials under a bus for their cooperation with Congress in the matter.
Besides that, they recalled that Pompeo was extremely friendly with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammed bin Salman, who was partially responsible for the murder of The Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.
Trump announced the decision to appoint Mike Pompeo as head of the State Department on March 13, 2018 after the dismissal of the former secretary of state Rex Tillerson.
Previously Pompeo headed the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

After heavy downpours in the upper waters of the Yangtze River, the longest water artery in China, flood rises occurred for the third time this year.

Regional head Igor Kobzev met with mayors of Ust-Orda Buryat Okrug
The main trends of development of remote agricultural territories were discussed during the working meeting that took place at the administration of the Irkutsk Region today, July 24,
During his working trips to the districts of the Ust-Orda Buryat Okrug, the regional head gave a variety of instructions.
Today, the mayors reported on their implementation.
First of all, construction on the Sports House in Ust-Orda was resumed.
The President of the Russian Federation gave the order for this site fourteen years ago.
But only now was the situation able to get going from a dead stop.
866 million rubles will be spent on the construction.
Construction will be completed in 2022.
And a school in the village of Bayanday should begin operating this year.
At the moment, the finishing on the premises has been completed.
Among the remaining works is the landscaping of the territory.
In general, the program of construction of pre-school and secondary education facilities is of special significance for the region.
Especially for your district.
The demographic situation here is the best in the region.
"And we are obligated to create all conditions for the education and leisure of children of all ages", said the acting Governor of the Irkutsk district, Igor Kobzev.
At the meeting, the regional head instructed all the mayors to actively take part in the work on the development of general community plans.
This is one of the main conditions for the comprehensive development of the okrug.
All communities must have established borders and a general plan.
"This is necessary for the development of the territory, for the construction of socially significant sites, as well as infrastructure and cultural heritage sites", the regional head emphasized.
During the conversation, the problematic issue of the 30% reduction in receiving milk from cooperatives was also raised.
This occurred because of the redistribution of milk purchases by the processing plant in favor of peasant farms.
Because of this, the share of products received from cooperatives has decreased.
The regional head instructed the acting Minister of Agriculture to go to the site, study the structure of milk sales, analyze the experience of other territories, and identify possible solutions to the problem.

Ivan Pugachev came in third after rising five places.
Moscow regional authorities talk about fate of closed landfills
Landfills of solid household waste continue to be closed in the Moscow Region.
The authorities promise to close the final ones this year.
Some of the 39 existing landfills in the region are being upgraded to modern waste processing plants.
But it isn’t possible for every site – many of them now have a packed residential developments.
After a landfill is closed, reclamation begins – the site is filled in with soil, and degassing and infiltration removal systems are installed.
This allows the chemical processes inside the landfill to stop so it doesn’t ignite, emit a foul odor, or poison the soil and groundwater.
And then the former landfill remains a towering, useless heap amidst the surrounding residential development.
Why not make something useful out of it?
For example, in Ruza, where the reclamation of the Annino landfill was finished literally just a few days ago, the authorities are considering the possibility of making a ski slope out of the heap.
This landfill, which operated from 1976 to 2016, expanded so much that it went beyond the confines of the land allotted for it.
Thus, during reclamation, they had to buy out the neighboring plots, de facto already filled to the brim with garbage long ago.
“Some time will pass, the landfill will ‘settle down’, it’ll gain strength, and we’ll think about what we can do to make it useful.
A ski resort really stands out”, Nikolay Parfenov, the head of the Ruza District, told journalists.
Two landfills will become sites for producing renewable energy sources
The Torbeevo landfill in Lyubertsy and the Timokhovo landfill in the Bogorodsk District will become sites for producing renewable energy sources from landfill and biological gases.
By the end of the year, a gas-piston power plant will be launched on the territory of Torbeevo, capable of generating up to 8 million kilowatt-hours of electricity a year and about 0.95 gigacalories of thermal energy, which will provide for the site’s own needs – heat supply to the administrative and industrial facilities.
Timokhovo will produce 72.5 million kilowatt-hours and continue to operate as a waste processing plant.
And at the Kuchino landfill in Balashikha, which was closed after residents complained about it on Direct Line with the president of the country, a museum could be opened.
“There was an idea of building a museum of landfill reclamation in the Moscow Region”, said Dmitry Kurakin, the Deputy Chairman of the administration – regional Minister of Ecology and Nature Management.
Israel reported drone crash in southern Lebanon
An Israeli military drone fell in the south of Lebanon.

Furgal's replacement met protesters for the first time
Acting Khabarovsk Krai Governor Mikhail Degtyaryov for the first time since his appointment met participants of protests in support of the arrested former governor of the region, Sergei Furgal.
The meeting was broadcast on his Instagram feed.
"Moscow hears you all, that's why it has sent you an acting governor, so the region doesn't slide downhill without leadership... I will repeat one more time: he is 'a' – my comrade, 'b' – my fellow party member, 'c' – I am very concerned about his fate, the party is providing him with assistance, food, Zhirinovsky is knocking on all doors," said the acting governor.
According to Degtyaryov, Khabarovsk Krai cannot remain without leadership at present, which is why President Vladimir Putin issued the decree naming him head of the region, so that the "wonderful building [the territory's government] could function, everything could work, the budget could be spent on social needs."
The acting governor explained that he had not met with the protesters earlier, because he cannot converse with thousands of protesters.
That is why he is broadcasting on social networks and reads all the comments addressed to him.
Two consecutive protests took place in Khabarovsk on July 25.
Protests in support of the former governor have been taking place since July 11.
On the eve of the latest protest, Mikhail Degtyaryov announced that he was leaving the city on the day of the protest.
His motorcade was blocked by protestors who called for him to speak out on the fate of the arrested former governor Furgal.
Degtyaryov refused to meet with the protest participants earlier.
"There is actually something for the leader to do other than meet and talk with those who are shouting from under the window," said the acting governor.

Attractive, tall minarets only made Hagia Sophia more beautiful
Again about Hagia Sophia - I came across a text from Fr. Vladimir Zelensky that supposedly needs to be protested.
First, the entrance is now free - hooray!
I haven't been to Istanbul, but a free entrance to the House of God is better than for a fee.
Second, the Muslims conquered this land just as fairly as the Orthodox conquered the Vola-Oka interfluve, the Muslim Caucasus (and set up a church in Grozny), and planted apple trees on Mars.
Godspeed!
The Jews conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans conquered America.
Are we going to give everything back to everyone?
Don't you think there will be pagans who will demand the return of their temple where the Tithes Church is?
Third, the Muslims have improved this building and invested in it.
That is, it is theirs, just as the factories and estates that the Leninists took for their own from the bourgeoisie belong to the Leninists - to Putin and other nomenclature.
They improved everything - from the Kremlin to the Angara, so it's all theirs by right of the progressors.
The attractive, tall minarets beautified Hagia Sophia very, very much.
There was a stupid inkwell, and it became a stupid inkwell with beautiful minarets.
Fourth, there are no "Islamic" or "Orthodox" civilizations.
There are believers, there are hypocrites, and there are sanctimonious people who combine faith and hypocrisy.
The believer doesn't think in terms of civilization.
This is the thinking of the official of the British Foreign Ministry Toynbee, but a believer is ashamed to think this way.
For a believer, everywhere is a place of prayer.
And always.
The only place a believer doesn't pray is somewhere he's asked to leave - he goes somewhere else and prays there.
He is a believer, not a fighter.
We're koloboks, not gloomy stones.

Immigrant from Rwanda admitted he set fire to the cathedral in Nantes
An immigrant from Rwanda, who was working in the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul in the French city Nantes on a volunteer basis, admitted to arson a week after the fire.
The France-3 TV channel reported this on Sunday.
According to its information, the man, who had already been arrested on July 19, the day after the fire, was detained again the day before.
On Saturday evening he appeared before the investigating judge.
After being charged with deliberate damage to property the man admitted that he set fires in three places – under the main organ, under the small organ and near the electrical panel.
He now faces up to 10 years' imprisonment and a 150,000-euro fine.
The 39-year-old Rwandan immigrant's motives have not been reported.
It is only known that he was voluntarily helping in the cathedral and on the day of the fire he was supposed to close its doors.
But according to surveillance camera footage, he left the religious establishment 15 minutes after the calls were received about the fire in the building.
The fire in the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul occurred on July 18.
More than 200 firefighters spent several hours fighting for the Gothic architectural landmark.
Nonetheless, they were unable to save the stained glass windows from Louis XII's times and a unique organ of the Baroque era.
The situation was only brought under control three hours after the fire started.
Nobody was hurt as a result of the incident.
The latest fire is not the first during the cathedral's existence.
In 1972 a fire destroyed its roof.
Liquidating the consequences of that blaze took 13 years.
The cathedral was reopened to visitors only in 1985.

Detachments are being created to patrol the streets in Minneapolis, The Wall Street Journal reports.
Local residents want to help the police.
Some of the volunteer citizen patrollers are armed.
The armed citizens insist that they will not open fire, and that this would be possible only in cases of extreme necessity.

The author of the post even gave an example, providing a real address where an elderly lady sells cherries.
But residents of Tyumen soon erupted with irate comments.
"I saw with my own two eyes how a seller from a neighboring country came right up to an old woman and gave her a new batch of goods 'from grandma's garden' to sell.
Be careful about what you buy!!!" wrote Nadezhda Grigoreva, sharing her observations.
"More than once I've seen them get herbs from sellers who come from neighboring countries, and then sell them.
I don't trust them." Larisa Kharlamova agreed.
"Not long ago I saw that an only woman had victoria "shimmer"; we couldn't get it to grow in our garden. I ask, 'Is that from your garden?'
'Yes!'
I bought it, it tasted awful, simply no way it was fresh from a garden. Then I see these "yeses" on every corner; the old lady fooled me—she really got it from someone else," Tatyana Krasilnikova said about her experience.
That being said, users underscore that they are not calling on people to not make purchases from elderly ladies, but are just sharing their opinions and advising others to pay attention to the quality of the products.
Residents of the Tyumen region are celebrating the Year of Remembrance and Glory in an offline format.

decision to expand RPL wouldn't be supported by either EUFA or FIFA
The president of the Russian Football Union (RFU), Alexander Dyukov, believes it would be inappropriate to expand the Russian Premier League (RPL) to 18 teams at the moment.
"First of all, it was the decision of the RPL, but I'll agree with it, because it's wrong to change the rules after the tournament's over.
It violates the integrity of the tournament and the principle of fair play.
And, of course, this decision wouldn't be supported by either EUFA or FIFA", Dyukov said after the final of the Russian Cup, Zenit - Khimki (1:0).
The RPL currently includes 16 clubs, but the possibility of increasing the number of teams to 18 was considered.

Kirilenko shared memories of NBA games with Bryant and Jordan
The head of the Russian Basketball Federation (RBF) Andrey Kirilenko shared memories of National Basketball Association (NBA) games against the legendary Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan.
I knew not to offend Bryant’s ego with any trash talk, so as not to encourage his athlete’s rage.
Kobe had a killer instinct, so I tried to talk to him on the court in such a way that he wouldn’t take the game so aggressively.
I would give him compliments on the court: “Oh!
Kobe, good shot, great pass!
Hearing my enthusiastic responses, he would forget a little bit that he had to get the ball again and score another 3 – 4 points.
Kobe and I communicated well”, Vechernyaya Moskva quotes Kirilenko as saying.
He also spoke about his first game against Jordan.
“I was guarding him.
For the first three minutes of the game, I was running around delighted at having a legend next to me whom I had only seen on TV.
While I was still unable to breathe for joy, Michael scored several points.
Soon I calmed down, I blocked his shots a couple of times…
My team won the game, but Jordan still scored 44 points”, the head of the RBF added.

Degtyarev surprised at Sakhalin-1 gas purchases for dollars
During a meeting on Sunday, July 26 with Sovetskaya Gavan residents, Khabarovsk Krai acting governor Mikhail Degtyarev was surprised that the region buys Sakhalin gas extracted by the American company Exxon Neftegas for dollars.
The American gas is under a dollar contract until 2025.
"To tell you the truth, I didn't know, and I'm knocked down by this information.
"I did not have any idea that this was still possible in 2020 in Russia," RIA Novosti quotes him as saying.
Degtyarev noted that this matter was discussed with the head of the Russian Energy Ministry Alexander Novak during his visit to Khabarovsk on July 24.
The acting governor also emphasized that by 2025 Gazprom will switch to the supplies of Russian thermal power plants and facilities, meaning that Russian gas will be used, purchased in rubles "at normal prices".
The Sakhalin-1 project is being implemented under a production-sharing agreement, in which the project operator is Exxon Neftegas Ltd with a 30% share, another 20% is held by Rosneft, 30% by Japanese Sodeco, and 20% by Indian ONGC.
Khabarovsk Krai has been purchasing gas from this project since 2005.

Russian TV series actor responded to "propaganda of LGBT and feminism" accusations
An actor from the Russian serial "Chicks", whose creators have been accused of "propaganda of LGBT and feminism", responded to the complaints about the film.
The authors "understood the pungency of the issues raised and didn't want to offend anybody", said American Stephen Thomas Ochsner in an interview with the publication Podyom.
"I think it's a story about power and general aspects of human life.
It's got nothing to do with LGBT and feminism," said the actor, who plays the father of a boy who cross dresses.
He stressed that he is "proud of the work" and does not consider it propaganda.
At the same time, the American added, some people's reaction to the serial's storyline frightens him: for example, there was an incident when "someone on a drinking binge fired shots at the set and said it was all wrong".
"Then there were a couple of times when we met disgruntled locals who didn't understand what we're doing.
"But we were open, so the people who initially came with complaints began to understand us," he concluded.
The shooting incident, the publication explains, occurred in September 2019 in Kabardino-Balkaria: a drunk man attacked the film crew's vehicle with a weapon, and was later detained by police officers.
Earlier it was reported that the public commissioner for the protection of the family, Olga Baranets, sent a complaint to the MVD and the Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media about the more.tv service which runs the Russian serial "Chicks".
Baranets accused the serial's creators of "propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations and feminism", noting that the main characters of the film work as prostitutes and the serial itself contains "scenes of physical and psychological violence".
The commissioner was also upset that "the serial pays a lot of attention to the homosexual sexual orientation" of an underage character.
The comedy drama "Chicks" tells the story of three prostitutes who start a new life and open a business on a female friend's advice.

Singer Polina Gagarina named the foods that aid weight loss
Russian singer Polina Gagarina named five foods that helped her correct her figure and not gain weight afterwards.
First on the list was water.
The singer prefers to drink pure still water before each meal, to suppress hunger pangs and eat less.
Vegetable salads, brown rice and seafood are also ideal for staying in shape.
They form the foundation of a balanced diet: vegetables contain fiber, rice contains complex carbohydrates, and seafood is a source of protein, beneficial vitamins and amino acids.
On fasting days the singer opts for apples.
Thanks to these foods, Gagarina was able to lose more than 30 kilograms of excess weight.
The singer also switched to fractional meals – eating often and in small portions – and excluded fatty, sweet and calorific foods from her diet.
Gagarina does not eat fried food, baked goods, sausage products or processed meats, kp.ru reported on July 26.
She also replaced red meat with fish and seafood.
She favors vegetables (besides potatoes), whole grains and plenty of greens.
Gagarina also actively works out in the gym, does yoga, and runs.
