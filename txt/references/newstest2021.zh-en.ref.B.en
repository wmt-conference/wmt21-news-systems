Xinhua Editorial: Making outstanding returned migrant workers a new force for rural revitalization-Xinhua Net
Talents are the key to rural revitalization.
But where to find talents?
The outstanding group of returned migrant workers is a new integral force.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 26: Making outstanding returned migrant workers a new force for rural revitalization
Zhang Xiong, 34, quit his job in Beijing in 2010 with a monthly salary of about 10,000 yuan and returned to his hometown in Guoyuan village, Meishan City, Sichuan to start his own business.
After several years of hard work, he now operates a family vineyard with an annual income of more than a million yuan, becoming a well-known entrepreneurial leader, and was also selected to join the "Two Committees" of the village.
In recent years, under the inspiration of a series of policies to support and benefit agriculture such as national poverty alleviation and rural revitalization, more and more excellent migrant workers like Zhang Xiong have chosen to return to their hometowns to start their own businesses, which stimulates the vitality of the rural communities.
Sichuan, a large population and labor export province in western China, implements the Excellent Migrant Workers Return and Training Program to take advantage of the trend, and in 2019 alone, among the excellent migrant workers returned to Sichuan, more than 8,000 village party branch secretaries, 61,000 village reserves, and more than 20,000 party members were trained under the program, which provides a strong guarantee for winning the battle against poverty and implementing the rural revitalization strategy.
The key to reaching a well-off life depends on the fellow villagers.
Since the reform and opening up, a large number of young labors in China's rural areas have gone out to work to increase their income, and some of them have started their own businesses through hard work.
However, this has inevitably led to the emergence of rural "hollowing out" to varying degrees, especially the weakening of rural grassroots organizations, and the village party branch secretaries and party members are showing the characteristics of aging and low education, which reduces the capabilities of the village party organization leader team and highlights the shortage of talents.
If the rural talents and other resources keep flowing to the city, and the rural areas are " hemorrhagic" and "anemic" for a long time, revitalization is a mere word.
Attracting those migrant workers who are capable, conscious and interested in serving their hometowns, guiding them to return to their hometowns and become entrepreneurial leaders, and training them as party members and rural cadres, is the fundamental solution to the shortage of rural party members and grassroots party organizations.
The excellent migrant workers returned must also be retained and do a good job.
In recent years, Sichuan has started the party building work among migrant workers and established a systematic mechanism for excellent migrant workers returning, service, training and promotion by following a strict criteria, so that they can improve their ability, work and life, and really take root in the countryside and have a sense of achievement in their work and business.
This year is the closing year of the decisive battle against poverty, and talent is the key factor to make a good connection between poverty alleviation and rural revitalization.
Party committees and governments at all levels should attach great importance to this group of excellent returned migrant workers, and take comprehensive measures to make them a task force that can stay, can fight and cannot be taken away, so as to provide strong organizational guarantee and talent support for rural poverty alleviation and revitalization.
Because of the COVID-19 epidemic, this year's college graduates are a very special class, on the evening of July 11, Bilibili Summer Graduation Concert brought a special live online performance to the graduates, and musicians such as Lao Lang, Pu Shu, Li Yuchun and Mao Bubi sent songs and blessings to the graduates.
SealWu Wu Yifan, a well-known up master, also brought a “Wild Grass”, which is a rap song adapted by him from Lu Xun's prose poems of the same name, and is very popular among young people.
Due to the COVID-19 epidemic, many graduates failed to experience the ritual feeling of turning of the tassel and granting degree certificates on the spot, so they transferred the ritual feeling online.
According to the data, the peak popularity of live broadcast of this 2.5-hour concert exceeded 35 million.
“Follow your heart, seize the opportunity, don't care about the consequences, and sometimes you will have unexpected gains. ”
Although it is a graduation song party, many songs also move non-graduates.
“One really want to cry when he watches the whole graduation song party, and whoever's youth is full of beauty and regret, but it is worth remembering and must go bravely. ”
Beijing’s natural ecology continues to improve, attracting more than 500 kinds of wild animals to "settle down" in Beijing - www.chinanews.com

The natural ecology of the capital continues to improve, attracting wild animals to "settle down" in Beijing
There are more than 500 species of wild animals in Beijing
According to the Beijing Youth Daily (reporter Wang Bin), the Beijing Youth Daily reporter learned from the Beijing Gardening and Greening Bureau that in recent years, with the continuous improvement of the natural ecological environment in the capital, the species and quantity of wild animals have also increased continuously.
At present, the number of terrestrial vertebrate wild animals inhabiting Beijing has increased to more than 500 species, including brown pheasant, black stork and other national first-class protected animals, as well as impala, swan, grey crane, mandarin duck and other national second-class protected animals.
Both the urban forests planted within the second ring road and the small wetlands embedded among buildings not only bring the wild interest of nature to the citizens of the capital, but also attract wild animals to “settle down” in the city.
In midsummer, Songshan National Nature Reserve, located in Yanshan Mountains in the northwest of Yanqing District, is full of vitality.
A raccoon dog plays leisurely beside the mountain stream, while two badgers fight with each other.
Looking back, a wild boar couldn't resist the "scratching" of its body, and is rubbing against the bark. Hu Qiaoli, director of the Management Office of Songshan National Nature Reserve, said that by the end of 2019, there were 178 kinds of wild animals living in this green sea with a total area of over 6,200 hectares, including the national first-class protected animals Golden Eagle and the national second-class protected animals Scoop Chicken and Impala, and nearly one third of the wild animals in the city could be found here.
"In Songshan, wild animals are the real 'masters', and our staff can only be regarded as their 'bodyguards' at best. ”
Hu Qiaoli said that in order to know the wild animals and plants in the reserve on the spot, more than 30 professional patrol members patrol along 16 carefully formulated protection routes every day, and there will be a "big circle" every month, where patrol members will almost travel all over the reserve in a whole day.
"During the inspection, patrol members should not only check and record the biodiversity, but also check and install artificial bird nests, rescue injured wild animals, and install wild infrared cameras, etc. ”
At present, more than 200 infrared cameras have been installed in Songshan National Nature Reserve to record the living conditions of wild animals in the forest.
Hu Qiaoli introduced that in recent years, with the increasing biodiversity in the natural reserve, more and more wild animals appeared in the cameras, and leopard cats, raccoons and pigs and badgers have become "permanent guests” in the cameras, and the "appearance rate" of the national second-class protected animal Impala in the cameras is getting higher and higher.
Zhang Zhiming, director of the Wildlife and Wetland Protection Division of Beijing Gardening and Greening Bureau, said that the number of the species of terrestrial vertebrate wild animals in Beijing has increased from 461 in 1994 to more than 500 now, and the species and quantity of wild animals in Beijing have been increasing continuously in recent years.
Wild animals are becoming more and more common in the city, which is closely related to the continuous upgrading of urban landscaping in the capital in recent years.
In particular, the new round of one-million-mu afforestation and greening construction starting in 2018 proposes to reshape the urban ecological environment, enhance the ecological function of woodland and green space, and highlight the concept of "near nature".
In planning, this project strives to realize interconnection and interaction with the surrounding green spaces, which is convenient for wild animals to "visit relatives and friends", and the trees planted are also honey and food plants that animals like.
Black land “plants” out of agricultural modernization - www.xinhuanet.com
Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 26 – Title: Black land “plants” agricultural modernization
In midsummer, two pesticide spraying planes pass by the 10,000-mu high-yield demonstration field in the second operation station of the fifth management area of the Friendship Farm, forming two white lines, and the characters “the first field in the world” planted with black rice seedlings in the green fields are particularly eye-catching.
Kong Lingqiang, the stationmaster of this operation station, said that this kind of aircraft could spray chemicals on more than 6,000 mu of cultivated land every day, and its efficiency was about 8 times that of unmanned aerial vehicles and hundreds of times that of manual work.
This farm is located in Youyi County, Heilongjiang Province, the largest grain-producing province in China; from the past “shua, shua” sound of rice cutting to the present “long, long” sound of motors, Chinese traditional farming and farms have changed in this black soil belt.
Besides airplanes, satellites are also used in modern agricultural production of the Friendship Farm.
Kong Lingqiang introduced that on the one hand, they used satellite remote sensing technology to achieve precise fertilization, reducing agricultural investment and reducing pollution; on the other hand, satellite navigation technology could improve the standardized operation level of agricultural machinery in the field.
In this year's rice production process, the farm expanded the operating area of satellite navigation unmanned transplanting technology from 3000 mu last year to 30000 mu.
This technology makes the seedling planting more uniform, maximizes the utilization of sunlight and cultivated land resources, and saves the labor cost of RMB 16 per mu.
The farms try new technologies such as informationization and intelligence in agricultural production, forming the largest agricultural machinery group in China from the ground to the sky.
According to statistics, at present, the total quantity of farm machinery is 49,000 units, and the comprehensive mechanization rate in the field reaches 99.8%.
100% GPS satellite navigation, 100% precision sowing in dry land and 100% high horsepower locomotive operation in dry land are realized in agricultural machinery operation.
"Green agriculture, smart agriculture and digital agriculture are the exploration directions of agricultural modernization. ”
Liu Hualian, director of the Friendship Farm, said.
The key to agricultural modernization lies in scientific and technological progress.
Heilongjiang Land Reclamation, represented by farms, has played a leading role in the demonstration of modern large-scale agriculture “aircraft carrier” in recent years, and initially established a modern agricultural industrial system dominated by large-scale planting, standardized production and industrialized operation.
In the suburb of Youyi County, there is an agricultural machinery exposition park covering an area of 350,000 square meters.
Here, more than 140 sets (pieces) of agricultural machinery introduced and used by Heilongjiang Land Reclamation for many years are exhibited.
These agricultural machinery and farms have witnessed the development of China's agricultural modernization.

At 4 o'clock in the afternoon on July 25, Fu Kunbao, wearing rubber shoes covered with mud, went back and forth with his wife Zhou Yan to pack things.
“I was still mowing grass in the field when I got a call from the village cadres to transfer. ”
Fu Kunbao said that he had transferred more than 60 mu of land and planted rice; at present, the rice was growing well, "I also gave medicine to rice yesterday, and the tools had not been cleaned up. ”
Fu Kunbao pointed to the pesticide sprayer placed in the corner, "no one wants his house to be flooded, let's give up a small family for everyone. ”
In order to cope with the continuous high water pressure and possible heavy rainfall in Chaohu Lake, on the 26th, Hefei City of Anhui Province is going to start flood diversion and water storage in Jiangkou River Lianwei where Fu Kunbao's family is located.
Jiangkou River Lianwei is located in Feixi County, close to the levee of Chaohu Lake.
There are thousands of villagers in Yandian Township and Sanhe Town involved in Jiangkou River Lianwei who need to be transferred.
As of 16: 00 on the 25th, the water level of Chaohu Lake, the fifth largest freshwater lake in China, remained at a high level of 13.2 meters, exceeding the guaranteed water level of 0.7 meters.
Fu Kunbao's kitchen is clean, with a pot of pumpkin head vegetables on the table, eggs and some pot-stewed vegetables in the refrigerator.
“I don't expect to move, but the water in Jiangkou River looks good at present.  ”
Zhou Yan said that her house was a bungalow, and she had not decided where to put some big objects.
“Put away valuable items first, and large items such as refrigerators and televisions can be temporarily placed in the homes of neighbors or relatives in high-lying places. ”
Wang Liwen, a village cadre, gave Fu Kunbao advice.
Wang Liwen is responsible for the transfer and resettlement of the villagers of 13 households, and notifies each household and confirmed the resettlement plan of each person.
The nearest resettlement point to Fu Kunbao’s home is Suxiao Primary School in Yandian Township, about 2 kilometers away.
In addition to the big items, Fu Kunbao and his wife are worried about more than 1,000 kilograms of grain and some newly bought furniture.
“Food is ready to be dragged to relatives’ homes, and furniture can't be moved. ”
After discussing, the couple decided to put a stool under the newly bought bed, raising it about half a meter.
At 6 pm, Fu Kunbao began to transport things to his relatives’ homes by tricycle, while Zhou Yan continued to clean up at home.
At 11 o'clock in the evening, the couple watched it back and forth at home, turned on the switch, and prepared to go to the resettlement point.
"I hope the water will return early. ”
Fu Kunbao said.
At 9: 30 a.m. on July 26, the reporter saw at the scene of Jiangkou River Lianwei that the local area had made all preparations before flood diversion.
Zhang Jike and Lin Xiaozhai team up support muscular teenagers - www.xinhuanet.com
On July 11, the “Let’s Exercise, Boys”, a hot-blooded sports show for sports teenagers, officially landed on Hunan Satellite TV.
Zhang Jike, the sports leader, and Lin Xiaozhai, the sports assistant, crossed the industry on the same stage, Lin Dan and Fu Yuanhui commented on each other’s styles, and the the “monster”-like power pulling device came on the stage with difficulty, which made the program very "burning".
In the first episode, 11 sports teenagers appeared on the power track, and their appearance surprised the audience; at the same time, the “strong conflict”, “strong confrontation” and “strong heart” on the arena also received attention.
The “strong conflict” comes from Qiao Wenyi, a super A sports student; before the competition, he openly challenged Xu Zhibin, who is known as “beautiful boys” in the track, choking that Xu Zhibin should go to the sing and dance program in view of his appearance condition, and even releasing the malicious words of “don’t cry your makeup when you lose”.
Some remarks made teenagers and sports leaders on the field breathe in a gasp.
The "strong confrontation" is more like a fairy fight, and Sun Jianqi, who is known as the "Great Devil", and Zhang Xindong, who has the same strength, performs a strong confrontation.
Their identities are unexpected; Sun Jianqi is an actor who loves fitness, while Zhang Xindong is a retired special warfare player and a winner of the Warriors Medal for three times.
At the beginning of the competition, the two teenagers tried their best to pull out the small pole quickly, and the lasting confrontation on the big pole made the audiences sweat for them.
Under the tense competition situation, Zhang Jike, as one of the sports leaders of the “Let’s Exercise, Boys”, also watched the game carefully.
In the comment session, he was also very careful, patiently encouraging the teenager who lost the game and helping him to review every mistake in the process.
Lin Xiaozhai, the sports assistant, is a fancy assistant, and she makes no secret of her appreciation for the online teenagers who have beauty strength.
When she learned about the overloaded daily training of sports teenagers, she was even more admired.
Lin Dan and Fu Yuanhui, who are also sports leaders, have their own styles; one is a calm “prophet”, and the other is a “girl with prehistorical power” who dispels tension with a smile.
In addition, Jike Junyi and Liu Ye, as sports assistants, also created a lot of hilarious topics around sports teenagers.
A fire broke out in Nantes church in France: A parish volunteer admitted arson. He is usually kind and taciturn - www.chinanews.com
Www.chinanews.com, July 26 - According to foreign media reports, on July 18, the famous Cathedral Church of St.Peter and St.Paul, a religious and historical building treasure in Nantes, France, was severely damaged in a fire, and the grand organ was completely destroyed.
On the 26th (local time), a Nantes prosecutor announced that a parish volunteer in charge of security work in the cathedral had been charged with “arson and destruction”.
The parish volunteer has admitted that he had started the fire in the church.
According to reports, Sernas,a local prosecutor, said that the 39-year-old parish volunteer from Rwanda admitted that he had set fire to three places in the cathedral at night.
The lawyer of the parish volunteer said that the arsonist now regretted doing such a thing.
This parish volunteer entered France through asylum several years ago, and was sheltered in the parish where the fire happened, and was taken in in the church.
The prosecutor pointed out that recently, the prosecutor tried to renew his visa and was talking with the police station about it.
However, the church said that it still couldn't believe that this kind-hearted, smiling but quiet believer would destroy the church that he loved so much.
On the day of the fire on July 18, this volunteer had been questioned and investigated by the police because of the illogical problems in his narrative, but he was released later.
The picture shows firefighters carrying out rescue at the scene.
On the evening of 25th, the professional engineers of the laboratory of Paris Central Police Department obtained new evidence, so this person was arraigned again.
This time, this man admitted his arson.
According to reports, If the crime of intentional arson is convicted, the suspect may face a 10-year imprisonment and a fine of 150,000 euros.
According to reports, the fire caused serious losses to the Cathedral Church of St.Pierre and St.Paul, and the organ in the church was completely burned, and the stained glass windows behind the organ were also seriously damaged.
Brunet, chief architect of French historic buildings, believed that it was conservatively estimated that the restoration of the Nantes Cathedral would take at least three years.
Comprehensive news: U.S. unilateralism undermines the relations between two countries, international public opinion supports China's countermeasures against U.S. - www.Xinhuanet.com
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 – Foreign correspondents of Comprehensive Xinhua News Agency reported that, on the morning of July 24, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs notified the U.S. Embassy in Beijing of China's decision to revoke permission for the establishment and operation of the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu, and brought forward specific requirements for the Consulate General to cease all operations and activities.
International public opinion believes that the unilateralist measures taken by the United States have caused serious disturbances in the relations between China and the United States, and that it is legitimate and necessary for China to respond to and take countermeasures for the unreasonable provocations of the U.S. side.
Andrés Borges, Director of the Center for Chinese Studies at the Institute of International Studies of the University of Chile, said that the unilateralist measures of the United States have destroyed the bridge of understanding between the peoples of China and the United States and put the relations between the two powers in crisis.
China notified the U.S. to close its Consulate General in Chengdu as a countermeasure to the U.S. unilateral measures, which is in line with diplomatic practice.
According to Patricio Giusto, professor at the Catholic University of Argentina and director of the Center for Argentine-Chinese Studies, the above-mentioned Chinese decision is a legitimate and necessary countermeasure to previous provocations of the U.S. and is not aimed at the general American public.
The U.S. is trying to divert the attention of the American public by pressuring China for the purpose of covering up its ineffective response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Bambang Surjono, chairman of the Center for Asian Innovation Studies, an Indonesian think tank, said the provocative diplomatic posture of the U.S. has caused serious distress to the relations between China and the U.S., which is facing serious challenges.
China's notification to the U.S. to close its Consulate General in Chengdu is a normal countermeasure and in line with diplomatic practice, reflecting both China's principled position to resolutely safeguard its own interests and the justifiable and favorable nature of Chinese diplomacy.
Tanzanian current affairs commentator Francis Semwinza said that the above-mentioned decision of China is a legitimate and necessary response to the provocation of the United States.
If China-US relations are to return to normal, the United States should take the initiative to improve relations with China and stop interfering in its internal affairs.
The United States should focus on how to achieve a win-win situation with China economically and politically, and how to benefit the two peoples and even the international community as a whole.
Ali Yousuf, executive director of China Association of Friendly Arab headquartered in Sudan, said the countermeasures China was forced to take were a legitimate and necessary response to the unreasonable actions of the U.S. side, in line with international law and basic norms of international relations, as well as diplomatic practice.
The previous request by the U.S. side to close the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is a serious violation of international law and basic norms of international relations.
The U.S. side is expected to revoke its previous decision and create the necessary conditions for the two countries to return to normal relations.
An editorial in Singapore's Union Morning Paper said that the United States' greater strategic intent is to encircle China and prevent its continued rise.
In the face of the United States’ pressurizing step by step, China is reluctant to see Sino-U.S. relations continue to deteriorate, but it has to take countermeasures.

Poland to Withdraw from European Treaty on Prevention of Violence against Women
The Polish Ministry of Justice said on Saturday that Poland would take steps next week to withdraw from the European Treaty on the Prevention of Violence against Women.
The cabinet of the Polish right-wing government stated that the treaty requiring schools to teach students on gender issues has violated the rights of students’ parents.
Polish Minister of Justice Giobro held a press conference, saying that the Ministry he led would raise the request on Monday asking the Ministry of Labor and Family to start withdrawing from the treaty.
That treaty is also known as the Istanbul Convention.
Giobro said, “The treaty contains some elements we consider harmful in ideological nature. ”
Poland’s ruling Law and Justice Party and its ruling coalition partners holds a close alliance with the Roman Catholic Church and promote a conservative social agenda.
Polish President Duda made hostility to gay rights one of the main topics for discussion during his successful re-election campaign this month.
On Friday, thousands of Poles (most of them women) held protests against withdrawal from the treaty in Warsaw and other cities.
Lempat, one of the organizers of the protests, said in a protest march in Warsaw that “the purpose of withdrawing from the treaty is to legalize domestic violence.”
Some protesters held up a banner that reads “Law and Justice Party is a hell for women.”
The Law and Justice Party has long been complaining about the Istanbul Convention
The previous centrist government in Poland ratified the convention in 2015.
The Law and Justice Party government stated that the treaty does not respect religion and requires liberal social policies to be taught at schools.
But so far the party has not decided to withdraw from the treaty.

According to a recent report in the Russian Izvestia, the Armed Helicopter Ka -52M is called “Super Alligator”, and its development contract was signed between Russian military and military industrial units in April last year; at present, the first two upgraded Armed Helicopters are undergoing renovation and replacement in the Far East Helicopter Factory of Russia’s “Progress” Aerospace Corporation, and its national testing and improvement finishing work will be completed before October 2022.
According to Russian experts who understand the above upgrading work, the Armed Helicopter Ka -52, the “predecessor” of the “Super Alligator”, was officially installed in November 2011, and some weaknesses were exposed in the use of this model; and this transformation and upgrading is just to “fill the shortcomings”.
It is reported that compared with the Ka -52, Ka -52M will partially adopt new protective materials that would not increase weight, and its cockpit will be reinforced and equipped with new equipment to resist missile attacks, thus increasing the survival probability of the battlefield; assemble more powerful generators to supply power to more complex airborne electronic equipment; the photoelectric system is upgraded to be able to detect and identify battlefield targets that are farther apart; the new light multi-purpose missile equipped with mainly attacking armored combat vehicles and reinforced concrete fortifications has a range of 20 kilometers, which is about double the range of similar missiles used by Russia's active military forces; and its defense weapons and communication equipment will be used in common with Mi -28NM helicopter gunships that can attack air targets to the maximum extent, thus making related maintenance simple and economical.
In addition, Ka -52M will have more advanced electronic guidance system, weapon aiming system and navigation equipment.
Russian experts also said that it was worth paying attention to that the Ka -52M would be equipped with communication equipment to communicate with unmanned aerial vehicles, so as to obtain information transmitted by nearby unmanned aerial vehicles in real time in the air, such as displaying images taken by unmanned aerial vehicles on the cockpit screen of the helicopter.
According to the plan, the pilot of Ka -52M can directly control the UAV with which it cooperates, thus improving the pilot's mastery of the battlefield situation and the guidance of long-range missiles.
According to Russian media reports, Krivoruchko, deputy minister of the Russian Ministry of Defense, said in December last year that the Russian Ministry of Defense planned to purchase more than 110 Armed Helicopter Ka-52Ms by 2027.

(Deutsche Welle Chinese) In the past two weeks, Spain saw a sharp rebound in the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, which increased by more than 1,000 daily for many days.
The British Government made a temporary decision on the evening of Saturday (July 25) to remove Spain from the safe travel list since 00:00 on the 26th day local time, and required that people entering the UK from Spain must be quarantined for 14 days.
British tourists going vacationing in Spain successively expressed their surprise, concern and even anger at the decision, since the news came out of the blue and caught them off guard.
As report goes, British Minister of Transport Grant Shapps is also on vacation in Spain at present.
Before the UK issued the quarantine measures, Norway had also announced a 10-day quarantine for people returning to Norway from Spain.
France and Belgium advised their residents to abandon the plan to vacation in Barcelona and the surrounding area ahead.
The beaches in these areas were so overcrowded that it was impossible to maintain a social distance between people, and once, the police had to take actions to reduce the number of beachgoers.
Tourism is an important pillar industry of Spain.
Spain: It is safe here.
Aiming at the decision made by the UK, the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Sunday that the pandemic was under control in this country.
Spanish Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya stressed to the media that "Spain is safe, not only for Spaniards, but also for tourists. ”
The Spanish Government will try to convince the British Government to exclude the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands from the quarantine measures.
The reason is that the infection rates in these two tourist destinations are much lower than in the British Mainland.
To prevent the spread of the pandemic, the Catalonia region of Spain has also restarted the "stay at home order".
Tourism is an important pillar industry of Spain, and Spain is one of the most popular vacation destinations for British tourists.
This decision by the UK is expected to have a significant impact on tourism in Spain.

Engine May Stall, FAA Urgently Investigated 2,000 Boeing Airliners - www.xinhuanet.comq
On the 24th, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an emergency airworthiness instruction, requiring emergency inspections of approximately 2,000 Boeing 737NG and 737Classic airliners registered in the United States on the ground that the air check valves of those airliners, after eroded, may cause the engines to stop operating in the air.
The Administration said that it has received 4 reports on 737NG and 737Classic aircraft engines’ stopping in the air, so it has issued the urgent inspection requirement. The inspection will cover passenger aircrafts that have been parked for 7 consecutive days or longer, those whose flights is fewer than 11 after being re-flown.
FAA warned that if the level 5 check valves of all two engines of an airliner are both corroded, they may become stuck in the open position, causing the airliner to completely lose power and fail to restart the engines.
The aviation regulatory agency has ordered that once the check valve is found corroded, the aviation operator must replace this key component before the passenger plane is put into service again.
Boeing responded later that day that the outbreak of the new crown epidemic has reduced travel demand, and many passenger aircrafts have been sealed or flown less frequently, so their "check valves are more susceptible to corrosion."
At the same time, Boeing said that it has advised aviation operators to inspect the passenger aircrafts involved by the order, and if any problem is identified, Boeing will provide assistance in repairing and replacing affected check valves.
The Associated Press reported that airliners owned by major U.S. aviation operators usually fly multiple times in a day, but after the outbreak of the pandemic, large number of airliners stopped flying, and with the recent slow growth in passengers’ travel demand, some airliners have been put back into operation.
FAA did not release the details of the four reports on flameout in flight.
Alaska Airlines disclosed one of the incidents later on the 24th.
The aviation operator said in a statement that on July 15th, one of its passenger planes was en route from Seattle, Washington to Austin, Texas, when an engine suddenly stopped operating, and the passenger plane finally made an emergency landing successfully at Austin Airport.
Alaska Airlines said it had replaced the airliner's engine and had inspected the engines of six other airliners in accordance with the FAA instruction.
American Airlines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines stated respectively on the 24th that no engine stalling associated with the air check valves on their airliners had ever happened.
Four airliners under American Airlines will be inspected, and so will be 28 airliners under United Airlines.
Delta Air Lines said it would inspect its 20 passenger planes, but did not mention whether there had been any engine stalls.
Many media reported that the FAA's emergency airworthiness directive was another strike on Boeing.
Indonesia Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines each crashed a Boeing 737MAX passenger plane in October 2018 and March 2019 respectively, killing a total of 346 people.
This series of passenger aircrafts was subsequently grounded globally, and their production was suspended in January this year and resumed in May.
FAA Director Steve Dixon admitted in June that FAA “made a mistake” in overseeing Boeing regarding the 737MAX airliners.

Frequently Nourish All Citizens and Party Members with Historical Knowledge of CPC and PRC — www.chinanews.com
2020-07-26 17:37:29 Source: People's Tribune By Zhu Yanjing Editor in charge: Zhu Yanjing
CPC’s general secretary Xi Jinping has recently visited Memorial Hall of Siping Battle, during which he stressed that "we should let all our 1.4 billion citizens and the over 0.9 billion CPC members, esp. the leading cadres at all levels, to study the histories of both CPC and New China in an in-depth way. ”
Serious studying of the histories is a required course for all Party members and cadres to firmly keep in mind their original aspirations and missions, from which rich nutritions should be absorbed and with which patriotism can be boosted, allowing us to advance steadily on the new Long March road of the new era.
Histories of the Party and New China are magnificent with ups and downs, and they have recorded the persevering struggles and glorious experiences of CPC since its birth and demonstrated the faith and loyalty the communists have forged with their lives and blood as well as the original intentions and missions they have always adhered to.
History is the best textbook which histories of the Party and New China are its most brilliant chapters for CPC members and cadres.
Each of them should continuously strengthen the historical thinking of viewing history as a mirror for marching to the future and take over the "relay baton" of the times with new missions and new expeditions in mind to march successfully along the Long March road of the contemporary people.
They should sharpen their spirits with history and hold fast to the original intention and mission by studying the history of the Party and New China.
Examining the histories, anyone can feel they are full of the eternally unchangeable original aspirations and missions of the Chinese communists and their adherence to the rock-firm convictions, which demonstrate the simple and unadorned feelings of the communists for standing with the people forever.
To thoroughly understand important events, important meetings, and important figures in the histories does not only bring about direct spiritual shocks and purification, but also a clear comprehension of connotations of the original beliefs and weight of the missions.
If Party members and cadres want to continuously refresh their original beliefs and missions and permanently maintain their true vanguard qualities, they must pinpoint their starting point and gravity of the original intentions from the histories and keep a clear understanding and a firm stand, which will generate strengths for them to fight bravely for the country and its people and ensure the communist power our revolutionary ancestors have seized through fighting at the cost of blood and life to be passed on from generation to generation.
Studying history makes people wiser, and we should inherit the noble spirit through study of Party history and history of New China.
Since the CPC’s founding, the Party has successively forged a series of great spirits such as the Red Boat Spirit, Jinggangshan Spirit, Long March Spirit, Yan'an Spirit, Anti-Japanese War Spirit, Xibaipo Spirit, "Two Bombs and One Satellite" Spirit, and Aerospace Spirit.
These great spirits precipitated by history have provided our party with powerful spiritual drives to beat all kinds of risks, dangers and challenges on its way forward, and it is a precious spiritual wealth that cannot be defeated, washed away, or seized by anyone.
The process of studying the histories is a course of reviewing these spirits and shaping our own spirit, and we must consciously take the lofty spirits of the revolutionary forerunners as spurring mirrors and stick to the spiritual home of Communists to lay a strong foundation for advancing the great cause and realizing the great dream and carry them forward to shine with brilliant rays of a new era.
Make self-examinations through reading of Party history and history of New China to preserve the righteousness and eliminate the evil.
For Party members and cadres, there has never been any part of the history that can bring us deeper warnings, enlightenments and lessons than histories of Party history and New China.
In the histories, we can both see the great deeds of the older generation of revolutionaries who were determined to devote themselves to their beliefs and persistently fought to achieve their set goals and the profound lessons given by some people who have become enemies of the revolution due to their betrayal of revolutionary ideals and beliefs, that has told or warned us never to stop or become slack with our resolute determination and strong will and always maintain an ample and tenacious fighting spirit for constantly purifying Party spirit and make self-cultivation and self-discipline.
To truly become a firm believer and loyal practitioner of the lofty ideals of communism, one needs to wipe off the thinking “dusts” and strictly prevent any “dirt” from contaminating him or her, and the histories of Party and New China should be the basis for every Party member and cadre to make self-examinations and keep alert.
Sharpen our will through learning of history and bravely shoulder the important responsibilities endowed by times through studying of Party history and history of New China.
General Secretary Xi Jinping once pointed out: "Learning the histories of our party and our country is a required course for us to uphold and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics and continue promoting all undertakings of the Party and the country. ”
The purpose of looking back at history and asking ourselves about the original aspirations is to maintain our glories and march towards the future successfully.
Every Party member and cadre should take study of Party history and history of New China as a lifelong pursuit to constantly rectify his or her course of life in the study, and bravely assume the historical missions, bear responsibilities, and take proactive actions on his or her respective work post.
Always take the advanced deeds of the older generation of revolutionaries as our guide and lighthouse and constantly polish the political qualities of communists, maintain the fighting posture of seizing the day and working hard, and keep the struggling spirit featured with faster advancing for harder and more difficult tasks to compose our own brilliant chapters in the great rejuvenation of Chinese nation.
People in "Oasis at North of Great Wall" Pursue Poetic “Dream of Yellow River " - China News Service
(A Story of Chinese Poverty Alleviation) People in "Oasis at North of Great Wall" Pursue Poetic "Dream of Yellow River
China News Service, Yinchuan, July 26 (by Yang Di) - "The winding Yellow River is full of sands along its 10,000km basin and the waves and wind hitting it come from far end of the world. ”
The Yellow River, which has aroused countless literati's lofty passions, gave birth to the beautiful and fertile Ningxia Plain, and today, Ningxia, which has the reputation of "Oasis at North of Great Wall", is adhering to the concept of "ecology first and green development" and pursuing the poetic “Dream of Yellow River ".
Dream of a clear and sandless river full of green waves
"Along the Yellow River basin throughout China, Ningxia is the richest", the Yellow River flows through Ningxia, covering a distance of 397 kilometers in the region, is the "mother river" nurturing this area.
But with the rapid advancement of industrialization and urbanization, the development and utilization of rivers and lakes got unbalanced with their management and protection, chaos such as excessive sewage discharge, lake reclamation, and infringement of water areas have emerged, causing their water to become black and stinky, their water turned substandard, the environment became dirty and ecological degradation came.
At present, Ningxia is promoting rectification and restoration of the water to achieve the ecological goal of recovering their water diversity and working hard to make the Yellow River become beautiful and clear again.
Water control must start from the source.
In Yinchuan of Ningxia, the local government has adopted the method of "high-standard improvement + pollution remediation + strict management" to treat all sewages from industrial parks in a centralized manner and made all urban sewage treatment plants there to hit Class A standards for their sewage discharges, the black and odorous water bodies in the urban built-up areas were basically eliminated, and the city has been approved as one of the 3rd batch of demonstration cities in China which have successfully removed their black and smelly water bodies.
In addition, Ningxia government fully implemented the river and lake chief accountability system in 2017, which has now been completely carried out through the five-level (district, city, county, town and village) river and lake chief account ability system, and the river and lake chiefs regularly make patrolling watches of rivers and lakes, which has become normality.
The 64-year-old Gu Jincheng lives in a village by the Yellow River, and he has witnessed the changes in the river: "The previous water smelled stinky, but now the stink has gone after remediation. ”
He said that the ecological environment is improved and his life also becomes more comfortable, and now he often walks by the Yellow River with his family to enjoy the clear water and blue sky.
The "wetland dream" with gull flocks flying and circling
Flying birds, green trees, plank roads, clear water... The beautiful scene of "gull flocks flying and circling" described by Fan Zhongyan has become a reality in the Yellow River Wetland Park of Yinchuan, Ningxia.
The Yellow River flows through Ningxia, forming many types of wetlands, such as river wetlands, lake wetlands and marsh wetlands along its way in the region, which play an important role in promoting the rational use of water resources and keeping ecological balance of waters, and they have also constituted an important international bird migration passage.
Since 2009, relevant departments in Ningxia have accumulatively invested a total of RMB3.45 billion in wetland protection projects, at present, Yinchuan’s wetland covers an area of 19,200 hectares and the wetland protection rate has reached 78.5%, there are nearly 200 natural lakes and marsh wetlands, 5 national wetland parks, 1 national urban wetland park, 6 autonomous region-level wetland parks, and 8 municipal-level parks in the city.
Lu Jinhu, deputy director of Yinchuan Wetland Conservation Center, told the reporter that wetland protection has increased biodiversity, which is particularly evident in bird species, "The relict gull is a kind of endangered bird and there are only more than 20,000 in the whole world, but over 2,000 of them live in Yinchuan. ”
At the same time, Ningxia government has drawn 500-meter-long red lines for the wetland protection areas on both sides of the Yellow River’s Yinchuan section in accordance with related laws, stipulating that no organization or individual is allowed to conduct any development, construction and business activities within the protected area, except for those for public welfares.
According to Zhao Shaoyong, deputy director of Yinchuan Water Conservancy Service Center, pollution source treatments, comprehensive remediation of river and lake ecologies, and construction of terminal wetlands has improved water quality of nine main drainage ditches in Ningxia which discharge their water into the Yellow River, their quality has completely reached Class IV standards, “Now the water is clear, and fishes are swimming and the flowers are blooming. ”
"Dream of Drinking Water" for Inclusive People’s Livelihood
Yinchuan City in Ningxia used to have an "embarrassing" title: the only city next to the Yellow River that "looking at the Yellow River’s water but suffering from water shortage".
Since 2010, Yinchuan City has been facing persistent water shortages during the peak summer periods, the pain from water shortage in the past ten years has become a painful summer experience for many high-storied residents, but the situation is that all major water sources are standing at groundwater over-exploitation’s extreme limits and large areas of funnel zones has developed under the ground of the urban areas, and water shortage caused by lack of water in water sources has become a problem plaguing Yinchuan city.
Thanks to the improvement of water quality of the Yellow River, drinking the purified water from the Yellow River has become a good way for the local residents to solve their drinking water shortage problem.
According to Ding Ming, deputy director of Yinchuan Water Affairs Bureau, in order to better satisfy the water demand of urban and rural residents in Yinchuan, Ningxia has started the west-route water supply project for urban and rural areas inside Yinchuan Metropolitan Area at an appropriate time, replacing the original underground water source with high-quality Yellow River water.
"On December 29, 2019, this water supply project started to supply water officially to the three districts of Yinchuan City, and in 2020, residents of Minning Town and Helan County will also be able drink the water from the Yellow River. ”
Ding Ming said that Yinchuan Water Conservancy Department will make overall considerations to conduct transformations aiming at integrating water supply projects in rural area with those in urban areas, "Next, we will integrate all the scattered water supply points in rural areas and then connect them to the west-route water supply project, and it is expected the integrated water supply for both urban and rural areas in Yinchuan will be basically realized by the end of this year. ”
Implement responsibilities, and all departments strengthen flood control and disaster relief work - www.chinanews.com
Implement responsibilities, and all departments strengthen flood control and disaster relief work
CCTV News (News Broadcast): According to the news from the Ministry of Water Resources, at 12: 00 today (July 25), the super-alert water level in the lower reaches of Wangjiaba in the Huaihe River was 0.64 ~ 3.31 meters, and the super-alert water level of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the lower reaches of Shashi and the two lakes was 0.05 ~ 2.02 meters.
Taihu Lake has exceeded the warning water level for 28 days since June 28.
At 12 o'clock today, the average water level of Taihu Lake was 4.67 meters, which exceeded the guaranteed water level by 0.02 meters.
Today, after consultation and judgment, the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters decided to continue to maintain the Class II flood control response of the Yangtze River and Huaihe River, requiring various regions to perform their responsibilities and further implement flood control and disaster relief work.
Today, the Office of the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters and the Ministry of Emergency Management urgently dispatched professional drainage trucks from Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Fujian to help Jiangxi solve problems such as urban waterlogging caused by heavy rainfall.
The U.S. launches countervailing investigation against China for the first time on the ground of "undervaluation of RMB exchange rate”
In response to the U.S. Department of Commerce's recent announcement that it has decided to launch an anti-dumping and countervailing investigation into the ties (cable ties) originated from China and an investigation into the "undervaluation of the RMB exchange rate".
China's Ministry of Commerce pointed out that this is the first time that the United States has opened a countervailing case to investigate the so-called project "undervaluation of RMB exchange rate" project, which China firmly opposes.
China's Ministry of Commerce issued a press release on the evening of the 23rd day especially in this regard, said that China implements a managed floating exchange rate system based on market supply and demand, adjusted by referring to a basket of currencies, with the market playing a decisive role in the formation of the exchange rate.
The press release stressed that, on the whole, the RMB exchange rate is at a reasonable and balanced level and is not undervalued.
Since 2005, the RMB has appreciated by more than 17% against the US dollar.
According to data published by the Bank for International Settlements, from the beginning of 2005 to May 2020, the nominal effective exchange rate of the RMB appreciated by 38% and the real effective exchange rate by 49%, making it the strongest currency among the G20 economies and one of the most appreciated globally.
The Ministry of Commerce pointed out that the exchange rate issue is beyond the authority of members to conduct countervailing investigations in accordance with World Trade Organization rules.
In February of this year, the United States amended the rules to conduct countervailing investigations on other countries' exchange rates, which has been suspected of violating WTO rules and is opposed by many parties.
The press release stated that even under the U.S. rules, the applicant's complaint contains numerous errors and does not have the necessary countervailing elements, such as financial support, benefit awarding and exclusivity.
China urges the U.S. to abide by the existing international rules and stop conducting countervailing investigations on the so-called "undervaluation of RMB exchange rate".
Influenced by the further tensions between the U.S. and China, the offshore and onshore RMB exchange rate against the U.S. dollar depreciated sharply during the 22nd session, both falling below the mark of each 7.0 RMB Yuan for 1 U.S. Dollar.
It is worth watching that whether the U.S. Department of Commerce’s move is intended to force up the RMB.
The spot exchange rate of RMB against U.S. Dollar rose above 7.0 on the 23rd day, closing at 6.9961.
The median exchange rate of the RMB against the U.S. dollar, which is subject to official regulation, was lowered by 17 basic points to 6.9938 on the 24th day.
With the gradual improvement of the COVID-19 epidemic, the film and television industry, which has been silent for nearly half a year, has gradually returned to normal.
Recently, the Organizing Committee of the 26th Shanghai Television Festival announced the shortlist of this Magnolia Award.

Venezuela's foreign minister accuses U.S. of fabricating lies in unprovoked attack on China – www.xinhuanet.com
Arreaza said the U.S. government has recently been putting pressure on China on political, diplomatic, economic and public opinion fronts, which is an unfounded attack on a sovereign country.
Arreaza retweeted a Tweet posted by Chinese Ambassador to Venezuela Li Baorong on his personal account earlier in the day and made the above comments.
In the Tweet, Li Baorong said that China strongly condemns the forced entry of the U.S. side into the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, which is a serious violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and the U.S.-China Consular Treaty, and that China will respond to it in a legitimate and necessary manner.
Venezuelan Vice President Rodriguez, Deputy Foreign Minister in charge of the North American Affairs Carlos Long and other government officials, social celebrities, and journalists of mainstream media also retweeted Li Baorong's Tweet successively, condemning the U.S. action as a serious violation of international law.

Therefore, PCOO has specially prepared a working group that has not contacted the staff confirmed as cases of COVID-19 to cooperate with President Duterte's press release of SONA.
Martin Andanar, minister of PCOO, said in an interview with DZBB on the 26th that he had prepared two plans for the President Duterte’s announcement of the SONA.
According to Plan A, Duterte will deliver the SONA at the Batasang Pambansa building in Quezon on the afternoon of the 27th.

Once one of the participants tested positive, Plan B will be launched, that is, the President Duterte will deliver the SONA at Maracanan Palace, the Presidential Palace, and fewer seats will be arranged at the scene.
Traditionally, the SONA will be broadcast live to the Philippines in real time.
As of press time, the Philippine Presidential Palace has not confirmed whether Duterte's family will attend the SONA.
Andanar said that the President Duterte's SONA would focus on how the government would lead the Philippines to deal with the COVID-19 epidemic and resume social and economic life; and the SONA would also mention the promises Duterte made when he took office, namely, fighting against government corruption, cracking down on illegal drugs and reducing poverty.
Duterte will also explain other plans of the current government, including creating more employment opportunities, revitalizing the economy, promoting education, and helping overseas Filipino workers who suffered from the COVID-19 epidemic.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 (Reporter Hu Lu) - On the 26th, the No.3 flood of the Yangtze River in 2020 was formed.
On 26th, E Jingping, Minister of the Ministry of Water Resource, presided over the meeting, demanding that the Three Gorges Reservoir should be carefully dispatched, the water coming from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and Dongting Lake should be taken into account as a whole, the staggered peak dispatching should be implemented, the storage capacity of reservoirs should be reserved to prepare for possible major floods, and the flood control safety of the main stream of the middle and lower reaches and the important dikes of Dongting Lake should be ensured.
It is predicted that there will be heavy-hard rain in parts of southwestern China, southern Jianghuai, northern and western Jiangnan, eastern and southern Hubei, and central Guangxi in the next three days, including heavy rain in northern Hunan and southwestern Jiangsu; and there will be moderate- heavy rain in the central and western parts of North China, including heavy rain in some parts of central Hebei.
The Ministry of Water Resources predicts that due to the impact of heavy rain, the rain inflow of the Three Gorges Reservoir in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River may reach about 60,000 cubic meters per second around the 28th, and the water level of the Lianhuatang River section and Dongting Lake in the middle reaches will rise again and exceed 0.20 meters; the water level of the main stream in the middle reaches of Huaihe River generally slows down, and the water level of Hongze Lake continues to rise slowly; and Haihe River Daqinghe River system, Yongding River and other rivers will have a rising water process.
E Jingping proposed that the Huaihe River Basin should further intensify flood discharge, lower the water level of Hongze Lake as soon as possible, and prepare for the possible flood.
It is necessary to do a good job in dealing with the storms and floods in Yishu-Sishui system.
He said that the Taihu Lake Basin should continue to increase flood discharge without slackening, reduce the water level of Taihu Lake and its surrounding river network as soon as possible, and reduce the risk of high water level and typhoon in Taihu Lake.
In addition, he emphasized that floods in northern areas such as Inner Mongolia and Hebei rose and fell sharply, and the warning time was short, which is easy to cause flash floods and mudslides, and it was difficult to defend; and there were many small and medium-sized reservoirs and warping dams, which have potential safety hazards.

The special rectification will strengthen supervision and inspection according to regulations, urge relevant enterprises to strengthen the protection of APP personal information, rectify and eliminate outstanding problems such as illegally collecting and using users' personal information and harassing users, deceiving and misleading users, and inadequate implementation of management responsibility of application distribution platforms, and purify APP application space.
Lewis’ family member: John Lewis is a soldier "fighting for the weakest".
US Congressman, civil rights fighter John Lewis was remembered as a soldier "fighting for the weakest" at a memorial service held for him on Saturday (July 25).
Lewis' public memorial service has been held in Alabama since Saturday.
There were two memorial services even on the first day.
On Saturday, at a public memorial service at Troy University in Alabama, Lewis' five siblings and a grandson talked about him as a caring, fearless, family-oriented man.
Henry "Grant" Lewis, Lewis's youngest brother, said at the service: "He has devoted his whole life to helping others. ”
Samuel Lewis said, his mother had warned John "Don't make trouble, and don’t stir up any problem. ”
He added that John didn’t listen to his mother’s warning, he said: "We all know John always gets into trouble, always stir up things, but that’s because he insists on the right thing, which is a good trouble. ”
Lewis’ brothers and sisters reminded the people at the memorial service that John’s most famous argument was to produce "good troubles", that is, as long as it is for justice, he would not shy away from provoking any trouble.
John once applied for entry into Troy University in Troy, Alabama, where he was born, but Troy University, whose students were all white people at the time, rejected him.
John Lewis, who preached the gospel to chickens on his farm when he was a child, was eventually conferred a degree in religion and philosophy by Fisk University.
Many years later, University of Troy awarded him an honorary doctorate.
Senator Doug Jones from Alabama said that the current protesters are "protesting peacefully and nonviolently," just like Lewis did in the civil rights movement.
Jones said: "Even if President Trump overturned a boat at one stroke and described all protesters as thugs, but he was wrong.
The protesters are patriots, and they want the United States to move towards a more equal country.  ”
A series of six-day events to commemorate Lewis will culminate at his funeral in Georgia this week.
On Saturday, Lewis’s coffin was parked at a public memorial service at the University of Troy, and people came to pay tribute to the pioneer of the civil rights movement.
At a slightly later time on Saturday, a private ceremony was held in a small church in Selma, Alabama to pay tribute to him, followed by a public memorial service.
On Sunday, Lewis' body will pass the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma.
In 1965, he and the demonstrators who demanded the right to vote for blacks were beaten up by the Alabama police in front of this bridge, and the police also released tear gas to the demonstrators.
Lewis was almost killed.
This day was later called "Bloody Sunday".
Lewis' remains will be transported to Montgomery, the capital of Alabama.
Mayor Steven Reed encouraged people to line up on the sidewalk to complete the final journey with Lewis.
At the same time, officials asked the public to wear masks and maintain social distancing when participating in this activity.
Alabama Governor Kay Ivey ordered that the flag be lowered at half-mast on Saturday and Sunday to commemorate Lewis.
During the nearly week-long commemorative event, Lewis's body will be placed briefly and respectively in the Alabama State Capitol in Montgomery, the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta, and the U.S. Capitol in Washington for the public to express their condolences.
Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced last week that people could go to the U.S. Capitol on Monday and Tuesday to pay their tribute to Lewis.
Due to the coronavirus epidemic, the public events to commemorate Lewis will be held outdoors.

Tibetan antelope in Hoh Xil enters the moving-back season - www.xinhuanet.com
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 25 (Reporter Wang Jinjin) – The reporter learned from Wudaoliang Protection Station, Hoh Xil Management Office, Yangtze River Source Park, Three-River-Source National Park Administration, that monitoring showed that Tibetan antelopes who had migrated to Zhuonaihu Tibetan Antelope Aggregation area, the hinterland of Hoh Xil, were finishing giving birth successively and began to bring their cubs back to their original habitat.
According to the monitoring pictures near Wudaoliang Protection Station, on July 25th, about 40 female Tibetan antelopes led three young Tibetan antelopes to pass through the Beida Bridge of Wudaoliang on the Qinghai-Tibet Highway 3002 km in succession, and the Tibetan antelopes have started to move back.
According to expert analysis, in recent years, the number of Tibetan antelope cubs in the Tibetan antelopes moving back accounted for one fourth to one fifth of the total number of Tibetan antelopes.
Lian Xinming, an associate researcher of the Northwest Plateau Institute of Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: "In the early stage of moving-back, Tibetan antelopes face a higher risk of being preyed, so the number of cubs in the Tibetan antelopes will be relatively small, and there may even be no cubs. ”
According to the statistics of Hoh Xil Management Office of Yangtze River Source Park of Three-River-Source National Park Administration, the number of Tibetan antelopes moving back has been increasing year by year. In 2019, the number of Tibetan antelopes moving back was 4,860, with an increase of 338 compared with 2018.
Lian Xinming said: "it is expected that the moving-back of Tibetan antelopes will end in early September this year, and the number of Tibetan antelopes moving back is still expected to continue to increase. ”
Tibetan antelope is a national first-class protected animal.
At the end of May every year, Tibetan antelopes from Sanjiangyuan in Qinghai, Qiangtang in Tibet, and Altun Mountain in Xinjiang all go to Zhuonaihu Lake in the hinterland of Hoh Xil to give birth to lambs.
Wu Xiaomin, an expert on Tibetan antelope protection in China and a researcher of Shaanxi Institute of Zoology (Northwest Institute of Endangered Zoological Species), said: "the moving-back of Tibetan antelopes is a process in which female Tibetan antelopes return to their habitats successively after giving birth. At first, the moving-back population leaving the breeding area is relatively large, but then the Tibetan antelope will return to their respective habitats along different paths according to different geographical populations. ”
In order to ensure the safe moving-back of Tibetan antelopes, the reporter learned that the Hoh Xil Management Office of Yangtze River Source Park of Three-River-Source National Park National Park Administration has arranged staff to continuously carry out video surveillance and patrol in the main moving-back areas.
If it is found that Tibetan antelopes try to cross the highway, the mountain patrol team will carry out temporary traffic control at the first time, so that the Tibetan antelopes can safely pass through the wildlife passage, and ensure that they are as little disturbed by human beings as possible during the moving-back.
So, how to get rid of the summer heat in daily life?
Experts suggest that when going out in summer, we should try to avoid the high temperature period, and we'd better not walk or work in the hot sun around noon, because the sunshine is the strongest in this period, and the possibility of heatstroke is higher.
If we have to go out at this time, we must do a good job of protection, such as wearing a parasol, sun hat and sunglasses, and if we have the conditions, it is best to apply sunscreen to prevent sunburn.
We should try to choose light-colored, breathable cotton, hemp and silk fabrics, and wear less chemical fiber clothing, so as to avoid heat stroke caused by excessive sweating.
In hot and sultry weather, we should prepare enough water to drink in time, and don't wait for thirst to drink water, because once we feel thirsty, our body is already short of water, so drink 150 ml to 200 ml each time, and drink warm boiled water instead of ice water.
According to the temperature, the average person should drink 1.5 liters to 2 liters of water every day, and the high-temperature workers should drink 3 liters to 5 liters of water every day.
When sweating more, we can supplement some salt water appropriately to make up for the salt lost by sweating.
In addition, the human body is prone to potassium deficiency in summer, which will make people feel tired and fatigued, and potassium-containing tea is an excellent summer drink.
In summer, we had better eat more fruits and vegetables with high water content, such as lettuce, cucumber and tomatoes, and fresh fruits, such as peaches, apricots, watermelons, melons, etc., which have a water content of 80% to 90% and can be used to supplement water; and dairy products can not only replenish water, but also meet the nutritional needs of the body.
In addition, people working in high temperature environment should properly supplement drinks containing potassium, magnesium and other elements.
In summer, the days are long and the nights are short, the temperature is high, the metabolism of human body is vigorous, the consumption is large, and it is easy to feel tired.
Adequate sleep can relax brain and body systems, which is beneficial to work and study, and is also a measure to prevent heatstroke.
Experts say that the best time to go to bed is from 22: 00 to 23: 00, and the best time to get up is from 5: 30 to 6: 30.
When sleeping, we should be careful not to lie under the air conditioner outlet and electric fan to avoid suffering from air conditioning diseases and hot cold.
Experts suggest that people who are outdoors or working at high temperature can carry heatstroke prevention drugs such as Shidi Shui, Rendan, Huoxiang Zhengqi Shui or Huoxiang Zhengqi Wan with them, or put them in the nearest workplace to use them at any time, so as to prevent heatstroke.

The reporter learned that this 2020 graduates’ art exhibition collected 50 works/group works of 57 young artists from the Central Academy of Fine Arts, the Communication University of China and the Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts, and the exhibition space was extended from 2 floors to 6 floors, and the light boxes in the building were fully used to display the plane works, thus maximizing the artistic atmosphere in the graduation season.
Under the COVID-19 epidemic, the significance of this exhibition is particularly special.
Ge Ping, head of Meichen, Chaoyang Joy City, said: “we choose to bring the graduation exhibition to the ‘cloud’ back to the offline space again; and we also hope that more people can see the youth’s exploration themselves and understanding of the world, and enlarge the art for society and the healing power of the soul.  ”
She revealed that the works exhibited this time were collected from graduates from the above art colleges, and they were selected to be suitable for commercial space display; and the works ranged from traditional easel painting and sculpture to new media installations, interactive animation and VR panorama, with the highest volume and richness in the past years.
Li Yunxiao expressed his feelings in the epidemic through the creative language of mechanical and manual mixing in the “First Battle of 2020”; Liu Jiaying's work "Sound Money" created by Ethereum Blockchain discusses the subjects of “cryptocurrency”, “credit creation”, and “transaction”, etc.; Zhang Jiaqi’s “Cat Forest” and Qiu Daqiang’s “Ji” show animals that are often accompanied by human beings, from which we can see young artists’ understanding of the relationship between man and animals; and Zhu Zhongyu’s work “Winter of Faith-Gift” is to remind young people who are growing up, i.e. “when one day has a successful career, do not forget your initiative mind, and remember that simplicity and sincerity.  ”
Li Jingyin from the Sculpture Department of the Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts is one of the few graduates who personally arranged the exhibition.
“I came to Beijing on July 7. At that time, I was actually a little worried about the epidemic; I also accepted nucleic acid testing three days in advance; and I brought alcohol cotton and testing report for the exhibition. ”
His work “Yesterday as a Mystery” has a complicated structure, so he must do it himself.
At the same time, he also undertakes the task of helping students repair damaged works.
“The exhibition was arranged until 4: 30 in the morning, and then I made repair; the time was very tight; and I forgot to take a photo with the work, and it was a bit regrettable. ”
He hopes that when the epidemic situation is more stable, he will come to Beijing with his classmates to see his work exhibition.

A new drug developed by Australian university is expected to be used to treat vascular occlusion caused by COVID-19 - www.xinhuanet.com
Xinhua News Agency, Sydney, July 26 (Reporter Yu Chen) – Researchers of Monash University of Australia are developing a new drug that can help prevent heart disease and stroke, and hope that this drug can be used to treat blood vessel blockage caused by COVID-19
Researchers have found that an enzyme in platelets can accelerate platelet coagulation before a heart attack or stroke.
Therefore, they are developing a drug that can temporarily inhibit platelet coagulation, thus avoiding blood vessel blockage and preventing heart disease and stroke.
Researchers said that this drug would only inhibit the clotting effect of platelets when there was a sign of heart disease or stroke.
As studies have shown that similar vascular occlusion is one of the main causes of death of severe patients in COVID-19, researchers hope that this drug can be used for the treatment of such severe patients in the future.
At present, this drug has achieved good results in animal model experiments, and researchers are preparing to conduct human clinical trials in the next stage.
The research results have been published recently in the Science Translational Medicine, an American Journal.

China News Service, Hami, Xinjiang, July 26 - Title: Xinjiang deeply cultivates “sunflower fields” and makes good use of clean energy
More than 6,000 pentagonal heliostats, each of which is 48 square meters, are arranged neatly in a circle, just like a silver sunflower field, which rotates with the sun and reflects the sunlight to the heat absorption tower with a height of more than 200 meters in the center to realize power generation.
On the 25th, the reporter saw this scene in Hami Molten Salt Tower Photothermal Power Plant of CLP Engineering Limited in Naomaohu Town, Yiwu County, Hami City, Xinjiang.
"The molten salt tower photothermal power generation is to reflect sunlight through the mirror to the heat absorption tower to form heat energy, and then convert the heat energy into electric energy through traditional power generation technology. ”
Zhang Yong, deputy general manager of CLP Hami Solar Thermal Power Generation Co., Ltd., said that the design principle of the molten salt tower photothermal power generation was similar to that of solar cookers used in rural areas in northwest China, and they needed to gather sunlight.
The construction of the power plant started in October 2017 and it was connected to the grid at the end of last year, and it covers an area of 6,600 mu and plans to install 14,500 heliostats in total.
"Compared with traditional solar power generation technology, the biggest advantage of the molten salt tower photothermal power generation is that it can store the accumulated heat energy and generate electricity at night. ”
Zhang Yong said that the 13-hour heat storage system configured in the project could keep the generator set running continuously and stably, and was not affected by light changes; and it could also quickly participate in peak shaving of power grid according to peak and valley demand of power grid load.
After the project is completely completed, it can realize annual power generation of 198 million kWh, save more than 60,000 tons of standard coal, reduce more than 60 tons of sulfur dioxide, more than 60 tons of nitrogen oxides, about 20 tons of smoke and dust, and more than 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide every year, providing a steady stream of clean energy for the local area.
In addition, there is another silver “sunflower field” in Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park in Hami City.
Hami Fuguang Solar Photovoltaic Power Station covers an area of more than 2,300 mu, and 714 pieces of built power generation equipment rotate with the sun, always keeping the sunlight at a 90-degree right angle with the condensing plate surface.
"We adopt dual-axis tracking concentrated power generation technology, and through unified integrated control, all power generation equipment will, according to the height of the sun, adjust the angle to maintain power generation efficiency. ”
Duan Mengqi, stationmaster of the power station, said that under good weather conditions, the power generation efficiency of this power generation technology could be improved by about 20% compared with the traditional photovoltaic power generation.
In the first half of this year, the power station has generated more than 7 million kWh of electricity, supplementing the local electricity demand.
Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park is a photovoltaic industry demonstration park with the largest single unit and the most complete types of photovoltaic modules in Xinjiang, and there are 38 photovoltaic power generation projects in Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park, with a total installed capacity of 820,000 kilowatts.
In the first half of this year, the power generation of Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park exceeded 110 million kWh, with an increase of 6% compared with the same period in 2019.
Hami is one of the areas with the best solar energy resources in China.
The annual average total solar radiation in Hami is more than 6200 megajoules per square meter, and the annual sunshine hours are about 3200 hours.
In recent years, Hami has vigorously developed photovoltaic industry and planted "sunflower fields".
More than 2.5 million kilowatts of solar power generation has been built, and in the first half of this year, the photovoltaic power generation in Hami exceeded 1.4 billion kWh, with an increase of about 14% year on year.
At present, there are more than 330 grid-connected photovoltaic power stations in Xinjiang, with installed capacity exceeding 10 million kilowatts.
It is estimated that photovoltaic power generation will reach 15 billion kWh this year in Xinjiang, which can replace more than 6 million tons of standard coal.
The police circulate a notice on the details of “a female college student lost after traveling to Qinghai”, search and rescue work is continuing – www.xinhuanet.com
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 26 (reporters Wang Jinjin, Zhou Zhe) – Recently, the incident of “A female college student lost after traveling to Golmud, Qinghai” has aroused the concern of netizens.
The Public Security Bureau of Golmud City, Haixi Mongolian and Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, informed on the 26th that a female college student from Nanjing Huang XX is still in a lost state, and the police in many places are searching Huang XX actively along the place where she was lost.

According to the latest information, at 1:00a.m. on July 26, Golmud Public Security Bureau organized rescue forces with rescue equipment to go to Budongquan Conservation Station and Sonam Dharje Conservation Station along Qinghai-Tibet Highway to search the student, and contacted the police of Sichuan, Tibet and Nanjing actively to develop the work jointly, and at present, the search and rescue work still continuing.
The local police hope that the netizens and all circles of the society provide relevant clues, if any, to the police of Golmud and Nanjing in time, striving to find the lost person Huang XX early.
At the same time, the relevant experts suggest that tourists, when carrying out in outdoor activities, should act in a standardized, rational, civilized way , always pay attention to roadside warning signs, never venture into uninhabited areas, and promptly call the police under emergencies.
The US media unveiled the truth that the US unreasonably required China to close the Consulate General in Houston - www.chinanews.com

The US media unveiled the truth that the US unreasonably required China to close the Consulate General in Houston
On the 24th, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the US Embassy in China that China had decided to revoke the license for the establishment and operation of the US Consulate General in Chengdu, and put forward specific requirements for the Consulate General to stop all its business and activities, as a counter-measure to the US's sudden requirement on the 21st that China should close its Consulate General in Houston.
This action of the US government has attracted much attention, and its political motivation has been questioned by foreign media and scholars.
Why did the US government require China to close the Consulate General?
Many foreign media said that it was not clear why the United States chose the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, but for the purpose of this move, the foreign media said bluntly: for the general election.
The Cable News Network (CNN) reported on the 23rd that the US's requirement to close the Chinese Consulate General in Houston caused people to question its political motives.
According to the article, the catastrophic dealing with the COVID-19 epidemic by the US government caused the low support rate of President Trump's polls before the general election.
White House officials said privately that the tough strategy against China was to save Trump's support rate, and at the same time, to shift the responsibility of the White House for failure to deal with the COVID-19 epidemic.
According to the article, the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is a "politically driven and very cautious" goal chosen by the United States, and the US government chose it for the purpose of "creating a tough attitude and avoiding the risk of major conflicts".
The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) also believed that Trump believed that "playing the Chinese card had political advantages" when the US general election season was approaching and the US economy was severely hit by the COVID-19 epidemic.
The current situation is "a spiral and tit-for-tat struggle", which is promoted by the US government from the perspective of domestic considerations to a certain extent, and this will only worsen the tension between China and the United States.
The Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) reported that Trump's prospect for re-election were under pressure because of the outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic, and he repeatedly blamed China for the COVID-19 epidemic.
Almost every day, the United States takes new actions with respect to Trump’s absurd argument that "China exploited the United States".
"The Chinese Consulate General in Houston is very important in establishing ties between the two countries.”
The Associated Press commented that the United States required China to close its Consulate General in Houston, which aggravated the tension between the two largest economic entities in the world.
If the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is closed, besides the diplomatic influence, Chinese citizens in the southern United States will face difficulties in obtaining consular services, and American citizens seeking visas and other services will also face difficulties.
A Houston business group expressed regret that the United States required China to close its Consulate General in Houston, saying that the Consulate General played an important role in establishing trade, investment and cultural ties between the two countries.
The Associated Press believed that this reflected the importance of China’s economy.
According to the website of the Foreign Policy, this move by the United States was "part of a series of provocative measures, which will only worsen the US-China relationship".
Reuters quoted Jonathan Pollack, an expert on East Asian issues of Brookings Institution, an American think tank, as saying that since the establishment of a comprehensive diplomatic relationship between the United States and China in 1979, he could not think of any action comparable to the US’s action against the Chinese Consulate General in Houston.
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported that this move by the United States was unprecedented in the diplomatic relations between China and the United States for more than 40 years.
Analysts believe that this move by the United States may cause lasting damage.
Established in 1979, the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is the first Chinese Consulate General in the United States.
At present, China has one embassy and five consulates general in the United States.

In 2019, China submitted around 59,000 patent applications by means of Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), with an annual growth rate of 10.6%, becoming the country submitting the most international patent applications.
China has become a great power in innovation and intellectual property.
Data from the Urumqi Central Branch of the People's Bank of China show that， in the first half of this year, new loans to agriculture-related and small and micro enterprises in Xinjiang exceeded the annual increment in 2019.
In the first half of this year, the Urumqi Central Branch of the People's Bank of China used a variety of monetary policy instruments to guide the banking industry to continuously increase loan supply, providing sufficient financial security for the prevention and control of the epidemic as well as the resumption of work and production.
Free nucleic acid test has been basically completed in most areas of Urumqi, and secondary test is carried out in high-risk areas – www.chinanews.com
Www.wlmq.chinanews.com, July 26 (reporters Sun Tingwen, Zhao Yamin) - Zhang Wei, Director of Urumqi Municipal Health Commission, said when reporting the latest pandemic and nucleic acid test on the 26th day that, at present, free nucleic acid test has been basically completed in most areas of Urumqi.
The expert panel of the State Council and the experts of the Autonomous Region and Urumqi are carrying out further assessment on the development of the pandemic according to the results of nucleic acid test and epidemiology investigation.
The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Information Office held a press conference on the 26th day to inform about the epidemic situation and prevention & control in Xinjiang.
As introduced by him, from 00:00 to 24:00 of July 25, Urumqi had 22 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 (including 5 confirmed cases transferred from the asymptomatic infection cases), and 38 new asymptomatic infection cases.
As of 24:00 of July 25, Urumqi had 135 confirmed cases and 147 asymptomatic infection cases.
The asymptomatic infection cases newly increased on the 25th day were basically discovered through the free nucleic acid test and initiative screening in the city.
Zhang Wei, Director of Urumqi Municipal Health Commission, said when reporting the latest pandemic and nucleic acid test on the 26th day that, at present, free nucleic acid test has been basically completed in most areas of Urumqi.
He also said that, as seen from the experience of other regions in China, the results of nucleic acid test are affected by many factors, such as the sensitivity of test reagents, the time of infection and detoxification of the tested persons, the cooperation of the tested persons when the specimens are taken (poor cooperation may result in the improper acquisition of specimens), as well as the test environment and the operational proficiency of test personnel.
False negative result will possibly appear in the nucleic acid test for various reasons.
So-called false negative refers to that a tested person is infected actually, but the result of his or her nucleic acid test is negative.
In addition, two nucleic acid tests are usually required to rule out persons who have had close contact with confirmed or suspected cases.
For persons who have been to medium- and high-risk areas of the pandemic, and have fever and respiratory symptoms, two nucleic acid tests are also required to rule them out since one nucleic acid test will possibly produce the result of false negative.
He said that, in view of the above-mentioned situation, for the physical health of the people of all ethnic groups in the city, Urumqi will carry out secondary free nucleic acid test and develop “the check and supplement of omissions” in key areas such as Tianshan District and Shayibake District.
It’s learnt that Tianshan District and Shayibake District are high-risk areas of the pandemic.

White House epidemic expert Fauci: I am cautiously optimistic about the development of vaccines in early 2021
Fauci made the above remark at an online video conference hosted by the International Leadership Foundation on the 25th.
He reminded that it was not clear how the COVID-19 epidemic would develop in autumn and winter, nor what the final impact of the COVID-19 epidemic would be, but "the only way to end all this is for each of us to choose to be part of the solution".

Although the epidemic varies from place to place, it is necessary to develop solutions depending on the local conditions, but diversified anti-epidemic strategies do not mean that there is no close connection between regions.
The epidemic in one region will eventually affect other regions.
"Now is not the time for complacency," Fauci said, and "our work has not been completed, we must step up our efforts, and we must be vigilant against the uncertainty in the future.  ”
He Dayi, an American Chinese medical expert and founder of "cocktail therapy" for treating AIDS, pointed out at the meeting that the COVID-19 epidemic in the United States had not yet reached its peak.

On the 25th, the 2020 Hunan Red Tourism Culture Festival and the First Xiangtan Red Culture Industry Expo kicked off in Shaoshan.
In recent years, the demand for red tourism has gradually increased.
However, the red tourism industry also faces some dilemmas in its development, such as a small number of young tourists, homogenization of excursion projects, and simplex channels for commercialization.
Especially this year, facing the surprise attack of COVID-19 pandemic, the national cultural tourism industry has suffered a serious setback, and red tourist attractions are also confronted with serious challenges.
For example, tourists’ tour requirement of “appreciating scenes before personal arrival” can be satisfied by technological means such as shooting with drones and VR immersion experience; the economic benefits of red tourism can be enhanced directly by introducing online live streaming to recommend and introduce famous and high-quality specialty products of red tourist attractions; the propaganda and education functions of red tourist attractions can be sufficiently exhibited and improved by introducing “cloud” technology to develop the exquisite products display with highlighted topics, distinctive orientation, and abundant connotations; and it is available to make the revolutionary cultural relics "come alive", make red tourism become popular, make the red gene passed on, and enhance the attractiveness of red tourist attractions by innovating the ways to spread red culture.
This Culture Festival used the currently popular "special recommendation by county magistrate and mayor (district chief) + professional anchor" to promote red cultural tourism specialties, and used 5G technology to provide real-time scenic view and smart city demonstration, and other services to promote red cultural tourism attractions, all of which are attempts to put smart wings on red tourism, and the red tourism in Hunan is expected to become more and more prosperous.
U.S. - China trade talks representatives rumored to meet in August
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported on the 25th August by citing an anonymous source familiar with the matter that Liu He, the head of China's trade negotiation team and the Vice Premier of the State Council, and Robert Lighthizer, the co-leader of the U.S. team and Trade Representative, are expected to hold formal talks in August to assess the two sides' implementation of the first phase of the U.S.-China trade agreement.
According to the report, China has significantly increased its purchases of U.S. agricultural products in the past few months, but because of the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors, Chinese purchases are still some distance away from the quantities promised in the trade agreement.
Analysts said that the closure of each other's consulates by the U.S. and China and their other disputes could derail any progress on trade between the two sides.
The first phase of the U.S.-China trade agreement, which took effect one month after it was signed on Jan. 15, stipulates that a trade framework group composed of high-level officials from both sides should hold talks once every six months.
A source close to the matter said that, the meeting will be "an important turning point" for the two sides to assess the progress of the agreement.
But the source also said that if U.S. - China tensions lead to a low willingness to talk at this time, the two sides may agree that the conference call between Lai Haizhe and Liu He on May 8, which meets the terms of the trade agreement to hold talks once every six months.
Since this year, the China-US relations have deteriorated sharply, and the disputes between the two sides cover a range of issues such as the origin of novel coronavirus, trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the South China Sea and ideology.
U.S. President Trump has changed his attitude recently, despite boasting about his achievements in the first phase of the agreement earlier in the year.
He said at a White House press conference on the 23rd day that, China’s single-day purchase of U.S. corn has broken the record, and also, China has bought a lot of soybeans recently, "but now, this trade agreement means less to me than it did when it was reached."
An anonymous adviser from Beijing Government also believes that a new round of trade talks is unlikely due to poor U.S.-China relations and that "the issue of trade has lost its weight in the China-U.S. relations."
But he revealed that China's relevant economic and trade units still met on the 23rd day to discuss a range of issues, including how to increase imports from the U.S. "We have done our best to buy, so any additional purchases will be difficult".
Jake Parker, the Vice President of the U.S.-China Business Council, said it is "more important than ever" to maintain the momentum of the first phase of the agreement, and that China has made progresses this year in further opening its financial markets to U.S. companies.
An analyst from Plenum, an independent research firm, said, "It's better to hold talks than not to do so, even though it may only be treated as routine. ”

Chief Representative Hao Yusheng of NASDAQ China: Now is the best time for Chinese companies to develop IPO in the U.S. - eeo.com.cn - Professional financial and economic news website
Economic Observation Network (eeo.com.cn) Reporter: Zhang Bin For Luckin Coffee’s counterfeiting incident, the U.S. market has imposed tougher regulation on Chinese concept stocks. Coupled with long-term pressure of valuation, Chinese concept stocks going listed in the U.S. have felt much pressure, and successively started their journey back to Hong Kong for listing recently, such as NetEase and Jingdong.
However, some companies, like BEKE, Li Auto Automobile, are increasingly enthusiastic about going listed in the U.S.
Is it the best time for Chinese enterprises to go listed in the U.S. in condition of the COVID-19 pandemic and the crisis of Chinese concept stocks?
“With regard to the recent IPO cases and the companies which will go listed in the U.S., the IPO in the U.S. is not subject to any influences substantially, and on the contrary, the market is very optimistic now, and even, the present time is the best for Chinese companies to develop IPO in the U.S. over the past decade. ”
Chief Representative Hao Yusheng of Nasdaq China said at “2020 Listed Company Leaders Summit Chinese Concept Stocks Forum Branch” sponsored by xueqiu.com.
In April of this year, SEC and PCAOB issued the Statement on the Vital Role of Audit Quality and Regulatory Access to Audit and Other Information Internationally - Discussion of Current Information Access Challenges with Respect to U.S. - listed Companies with Significant Operations in China.
According to this Statement, international cooperation and coordination have increased significantly in recent years, but problems with access to information by U.S. regulators continue, and the SEC and PCAOB still face legal and practical challenges; corresponding to this document, the PCAOB website gives a detailed list of listed companies that have encountered audit obstacles and their auditing agencies, including a large number of Chinese concept stock companies.
In addition, in May of this year, the U.S. Senate passed the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, which imposes additional information disclosure requirements on foreign companies going listed in the United States.
In Hao Yusheng's view, the crisis of Chinese concept stocks doesn’t affect the appetite of investors.
“When this news was released, it caused everyone to panic, and everyone asked whether they could go listed in the U.S. in the future, but later, we found out that this is not a matter on the investors' side, maybe this question is still asked by investors during their road-show for IPO in the U.S., and even becomes a standardized question, but it is not regarded by investors as an important factor for no investing in a Chinese company.
You are suggested to treat the current situation with a usual mind.
Of course, the present situation seems to be the worst in the past two years, but the appetite of investors is not affected in any way.
So next, the boom of IPOs in the U.S. will continue between now and the end of this year or before the U.S. elections. ”
On May 9 this year, Kingsoft Cloud officially went listed on NASDAQ in the U.S., becoming the first Chinese company developing IPO in the United States after the COVID-19 pandemic.
"The listing of Kingsoft Cloud gives much confidence to the Chinese companies preparing for IPOs thereafter. ”
Hao Yusheng said.
According to the data report of Chinese concept stocks in the first half of 2020 released by xueqiu.com, in the first half of this year, total 20 Chinese enterprises went to the U.S. for IPO, representing an increase of 17.6% over the same period of last year. As seen from the total amount of IPOs, 20 enterprises raised RMB2.725 billion in total, representing an increase of more than 52.4% over the same period of last year. In terms of industrial distribution, the amount of IPOs of healthcare industry in the first half of this industry increased by 100% over the same period of last year.
As introduced by Hao Yusheng, the quality of Chinese companies that went to the U.S. for IPO in the first half of this year is relatively high, High quality companies with excellent fundamentals and growth will be more favored by investors.
In the short, medium and long term, Hao Yusheng continues to be optimistic about the IPO of Chinese companies in the U.S.
"In the short term, the boom of IPO in the U.S. is still going on, in the medium term, Chinese companies have more choices, and for A-shares, Hong Kong stocks, and U.S. stocks, people will take the U.S. elections and the Sino-U.S. relations as considerations for market choice and time choice. In the long term, everything will return to normal, and market fluctuations are periodic, both politically and economically, and finally, the market will return to normal stage, and fluctuation always takes place in advance in stock market. ”
Hao Yusheng also said, "There are many uncertainties this year, but for high-quality companies, no matter how good or bad the market is, if only they have solid growth which can be seen by investors, other factors will be secondary, since investors need to invest in good Chinese companies. ”

People's Daily Opinion: Focus on our own business and create new advantages for future development - On studying and implementing General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the entrepreneurs symposium - Xinhua Net
Beijing, July 25, Xinhua News Agency - People's Daily July 26 Opinion: Focus on our own business and create new advantages for future development
At present, the global epidemic and the world economy remain tough and complicated, and our development is facing unprecedented challenges.
Maintaining strategic determination, enhancing confidence in winning, and focusing on our own business are crucial to dealing with all kinds of risks and challenges.
In a recent entrepreneurs symposium, General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized that under the current external environment of rising protectionism, stagnant global economy, and shrunken global market, we must focus on our own business, give full play to the advantages of the domestic mega-market, gradually establish a new development model in which the domestic circulation plays a dominant role while the domestic and international circulations support each other, improve the modernization of the industrial chain and supply chain, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation, accelerate the research and development of key and core technologies, and create new advantages for future development.
The one who observes the situation is wise, and the one who manages the situation wins.
In the past, under the external environment of deepening economic globalization, the external markets and resources had played an important role in the rapid development of China.
Now, the world under the impact of the epidemic is experiencing profound changes, facing more instability and uncertainty, which leads to the emergence of de-globalization.
To be mentally and professionally prepared to deal with changes in the external environment for a longer period of time, and to promote China's economy to ride the waves and develop steadily for a long-term, it's very important to strategically expand and meet domestic demand, give full play to our own advantages, add momentum to China's economic development through a prosperous domestic economy and a smooth domestic circulation, and drive the recovery of the world economy.
We should be deeply aware that building a complete system of domestic demand is crucial to the long-term development and long-term stability of our country.
After reviewing the situation carefully, the Party Central Committee clearly proposed to firmly implement the strategy of expanding domestic demand, which is necessary to cope with the impact of the epidemic, maintain the long-term sustainable and healthy development of our economy, and meet the growing needs of our people for good life.
The advantage of a large economy is that it is internally circulatable.
Thanks to the world's most complete and largest industrial system, strong production capacity, perfect supporting facilities, more than 100 million market players, more than 170 million people with higher education or various professional skills, and the super-sized domestic demand market consisting of 1.4 billion population including more than 400 million middle-income groups, China is going through the rapid development of new industrialization, informatization, urbanization and agricultural modernization, which has huge potential for investment demand.
The fundamental socialism economic system, which is dominant by Public Ownership and To Each According to His Contribution, supports the co-existence of multiple ownership economies and multiple distribution methods and includes the socialism market economic system, not only stimulates the vitality of various market players, unlocks and develops productivity, but also promotes the efficiency and equity and continuously achieves common prosperity.
We must firmly implement the strategy of expanding domestic demand, make production, distribution and circulation more dependent on the domestic market to achieve a positive loop, clarify the strategic direction of supply-side structural reform, and promote a dynamic balance between total supply and total demand at a higher level.
We must accelerate the establishment of a complete domestic demand system, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation and innovation in all other aspects, and drive the development of the digital economy, intelligent manufacturing, life and health, new materials and other strategic emerging industries, thereby building more new growth points and growth pillars, and gradually establishing a new development model in which the domestic circulation plays a dominant role while the domestic and international circulations support each other.
Openness brings progress, while closure would lead to backwardness.
General Secretary Xi Jinping has repeatedly stressed that the door of China's opening will not be closed, but will only be opened wider and wider.
The domestic circulation playing a dominant role, does not mean closing our door to external market, instead, it aims to unleash the potential of domestic demand, better connect domestic and international markets, and make better use of both international and domestic markets and resources in order to achieve stronger and more sustainable development.
At the same time, the expansion of domestic demand and the greater openness are not contradictory, the smoother the domestic circulation, the more conducive to building a new openness model, and the more conducive to building new advantages in international cooperation and competition.
Although protectionism is now on the rise internationally, we must stand on the right side of history, insist on deepening reform, expanding openness, strengthening cooperation in science and technology, promoting the building of an open economy, and promoting the building of a community with shared future for mankind.
The Chinese people have experienced many trials and tribulations throughout our history, but we have never been crushed, but have become more and more courageous, constantly growing and rising from them.
On our way forward, with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core of the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee, the significant advantages of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, the strong mobilization capability and strong comprehensive power, and the solidarity of the entire party, the whole army and the people of all nationalities, we will be able to overcome all difficulties and obstacles to maintain the momentum of good economic and social development in our country, to build a moderately prosperous society, and successfully start a new journey of building a modern socialist country!
Yu Ebao's Revenue Declines, But "Post-90s" to Save Money "in a Retaliatory Way"?
With the decline in the income from Yu Ebao, the "post-90s" did not only escape from it, but began to save money in a "retaliatory" manner?
The "Report on Yu Ebao Savings of Post-90s" (2020 version) recently released by the China Institute of New Economics and Alipay shows that in the first half of the year, "post-90s" love to save money more than before: the average amount of money saved per capita has increased by nearly 40% compared to that of 2019.
What’s interesting is that "post-90s" tend to start saving from “small amounts”, and 60% of the savings are less than RMB20 each...
Saving money with Yu Ebao has also become the habit of saving money for "post-90s".
Related data indicate that among the 700 million Yu Ebao users, 134 million are "post-90s".
There are 174 million "post-90s" in China, that is to say, about 3 out of 4 "post-90s" in the country are using Yu Ebao to save money.
At present, the 7-day annualized rate of return from currency funds such as Yu Ebao has fallen to around 1.5% from a level of higher than 2% at the beginning of the year.
Even so, it did not affect the pace of saving money by the "post-90s".
In the context of enhanced Yu Ebao's "money saving effect", many young people who are accustomed to using Yu Ebao have also directly become into "fund investors".
According to Alipay data, as of July 13, the number of new "fund investors" on Alipay more than doubled year-on-year in the past month, and more and younger people have "upgraded" their wealth management practices on Alipay.
Some analysts believe that the flow of funds from Yu Ebao into the stock market is also an important reason for the clear decline in the share of money funds in June.
The report also shows that "post-90s" girls are more inclined to save more money, which is on average 20% higher than that of boys, 60% of users who hold funds on the Alipay platform are men, and women tend to choose more robust financial management methods compared with men.
After saving money, what plans do the "post-90s" have?
Alipay data indicate that "post-90s" have the habit of saving money for their goals, and the most users make travel as their goal.
Affected by the pandemic, many "post-90s" save money to prepare for post-pandemic travels, and the reopening of movie theaters also provides a new way for them to switch from saving money to start consumption.

According to the report released on the 25th, 10 of PCOO employees tested positive.
Marvin Gatpayat, deputy minister of the PCOO Department of Administration and Legal Affairs, said that the Department was located in the new administrative office building of the presidential palace, which was originally scheduled to resume to work on the 27th, when president Duterte delivered the fifth state of the union address.

France increases military investment in space - www.xinhuanet.com
Florence Parly, minister of French Ministry of Defense, said on the 24th that France would add hundreds of millions of euros in space defense budget to develop space military forces to prevent “unfriendly actions” that other countries might carry out in outer space.
On the same day, Parly told the Provence that from 2019 to 2025, the expenditure budget of French space military projects would increase from 3.6 billion euros (about 4.2 billion US dollars) to 4.3 billion euros (5 billion US dollars).
According to the French Military Planning Act 2019-2025 approved by the French Parliament in 2018, France is expected to update the existing observation satellites and communication satellites and launch three electromagnetic interception satellites to improve the modernization level of space surveillance radar.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced in July last year that a space military command and an "aviation and space force" would be established within the French Air Force.
Parly said that she would officially announce the establishment of this space force when she visited a military academy in Salon, Provence.
Parly said that this space force was affiliated to the Air Force and would have 500 personnel by 2025.
She said: "People used to think that space served the common interests of science, but this idea is gone forever.  Nowadays, space is a place where countries compete for global hegemony.  ”
Parly reiterated Macron’s previous statement that France had no intention of provoking an arms race.
"We are by no means engaged in an arms race.  But it is my duty to fully understand the threats we may face. ”
Parly revisited the surveillance of a military satellite shared by France and Italy in 2017.
She said that the “peeping satellite” was a Russian satellite.
Russia denied this claim.
Parly said that France "would soon" have a small patrol satellite capable of detecting and targeting "those black hands behind unfriendly actions".
According to French media, the reason why France seeks to establish a space force is that US President Donald Trump required the US Department of Defense to draft a bill to establish a space force in February last year.
Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act in December last year, approving the establishment of the sixth largest US military service-the Space Force.
Some experts are worried that these measures by the United States have accelerated the pace of militarization of American space and may trigger a new round of space arms race.

However, the shared accommodation market has been picking up since March, and the trading volume, the amount of orders, and the number of recipients in the market have been recovering gradually.
The Report shows that, the significant drop in the trading volume of the shared accommodation market, on the one hand, was due to the significant drop in the demand for travel accommodation and the sharp decrease of orders in condition of the pandemic prevention and control, and in the first 5 months, the total number of orders and the number of persons received decreased by 65% and 63% on year-on-year basis respectively, and on the other hand, the significant drop in the price per room per night was caused by the weakness of demand, and the average price per room per night in the first five months decreased by 16% on year-on-year basis.
However, in March, April and May, the market turnover increased by 78%, 199% and 35% respectively on month-on-month basis; the number of orders increased by 141%, 152% and 50% respectively on month-on-month basis; and the number of receptions increased by 81%, 112% and 28% respectively on month-on-month basis.
The Report points out that, the development of the shared accommodation industry is promising in the long run, but there are still many uncertainties in the near future.
For this, Yu Fengxia, deputy director of the Center for Research of Sharing Economy of the State Information Center, told the reporter of the Workers’ Daily that the development of shared accommodation needs more powerful policy support, on the one hand, it is necessary to do a good job in implementing the policies that have been introduced in the early stage, further strengthen the dissemination and implementation of policies, and focus on creating a better business environment, on the other hand, it is also necessary to further stimulate consumer demand, enrich the tourism accommodation services to be supplied, innovate service methods, strengthen the cooperation with the government and platform enterprises, and further strengthen policy guide and support.

Professor Huang Xiaojin, director of the Vascular Surgery of Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University, said in an interview with a reporter from www.chinanews.com that the Vascular Surgery of Zhongshan Hospital also had a long history of exchanges with Changhai Hospital, and the two hospitals formally formed a cooperative unit, which brought the cooperation and exchanges between both parties to a new level.
He said that Zhongshan Hospital would regularly invite Shanghai experts to Xiamen to carry out surgical technical exchanges, teaching rounds, and difficult case discussions, etc., and further carry out remote consultations; currently, it planned to conduct remote consultations once a week; and in addition, the department would also send personnel to study and exchange to strengthen the training and development of discipline talents.
At the meeting, the reporter learned that vascular disease was the leading cause of death in China, and the aorta, as the main road of various organs of the human body, flowed from the heart to the whole body and played an important role.
The occurrence of aortic diseases is often accompanied by high risk, high mortality and high difficulty in treatment; the diameter of the thickest section of aorta is up to 4cm; and once hemangioma is formed, rupture occurs, or vascular intima ruptures, producing dissection, it will cause massive bleeding, which is very dangerous.
In recent years, with the change of people's life style and accelerated pace of life, China has become the world's largest country with high blood pressure, and aortic diseases have also increased; nowadays, with the development of surgical technology and industrial materials, the treatment of aortic diseases continues to develop towards minimally invasive, fast and efficient direction.
Doctors can properly "change lanes" for blood flow by puncturing the thigh and placing stents in the aorta, so as to avoid the impact on aneurysm or ruptured dissection and achieve a good therapeutic effect, and some operations only need local anesthesia.
This academic seminar invited more than ten domestic experts to discuss the new progress of aortic disease treatment, and conducted cutting-edge technical training and difficult case discussion in the form of conference salon.
At the meeting, the reporter learned that with the development of surgical technology and industrial materials, the treatment of aortic diseases was developing towards minimally invasive, fast and efficient direction at present.

Www.cq.chinanews.com, July 26 (reporter Han Lu) - The reporter learnt from China Railway Chengdu Group Co., Ltd. on the 26th day that, the small Three Gorges Tunnel of Zhengzhou-Wanzhou High-Speed Railway which is around 18.9km was joined up on the very day.
It’s learnt that, the Small Three Gorges Tunnel is not only the longest high-speed railway tunnel within the scope of the Three Gorges Reservoir area, but also the longest single-hole and dual-lane high-speed railway tunnel with a designed speed of 350 km/h among the projects currently under construction in China.
Zhengzhou-Wanzhou High-Speed Railway is located within Henan Province, Hubei Province and Chongqing City, connected with Beijing-Guangzhou and Xuzhou-Lanzhou High-speed Railways in the north of Zhengzhou, and connected with Chongqing-Wanzhou High-Speed Railway to Chongqing in the south of Wanzhou, and it is an important part of the Channel along the River and Hohhot-Nanning Channel in Chinese “Eight Vertical and Eight Horizontal” High-speed Railway Network.
The Small Three Gorges Tunnel of Zhengzhou-Wanzhou High-Speed Railway was fully joined up on the 26th day.
The picture shows the joining-up site.
Zhengzhou-Wanzhou High-Speed Railway starts from Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, and leads southwestward to Wanzhou District, Chongqing after passing by Pingdingshan City, Nanyang City, and Xiangyang City of Hubei Province, and the new line is around 818km, including around 184km in Chongqing, and has a designed speed of 350km/h.
Wherein, Zhengzhou-Xiangyang section was opened to traffic on December 1, 2019, and the construction of Chongqing section is being accelerated.
The Small Three Gorges Tunnel joined up on the 26th day is a full-line control project of Zhengzhou-Wanzhou High-Speed Railway. Located in the intersection of Fengjie County and Wushan County, Chongqing, this project is around 18.9km, and has the maximum burial depth of 890m.
The construction of this tunnel was commenced in February 2017, and the entire line was joined up on July 26, 2020.
As introduced by Wang Guojun, the person responsible for the design of Zhengzhou-Wanzhou High-Speed Railway tunnel of the survey and design party China Railway Eryuan Engineering Group Co., Ltd., located in a place with very complicated geological conditions, the Small Three Gorges Tunnel faces the risks of karst, mud outburst and water gushing, large deformation of tunnel in soft rock, etc., and it is a level-I high-risk tunnel, so the design and construction of this tunnel are extremely difficult.
“In the construction of this project, we forecast geological condition in advance by means of geological survey, physical prospecting, and advanced drilling, and adopted special design plans for more than 30 karst caves of various types.  For example, we built a 24m-long bridge to cross a large karst cave of more than 10m in vertical length and more than 55m in depth in the tunnel to avoid the tunnel settlement. ” Wang Guojun said.
As introduced by the construction party China Railway Tunnel Group, this tunnel was constructed through the combination of dredging and plugging. By building transverse gallery and flat bearing, grouting for water blocking, strengthening the support of tunnel structure, and building sewage treatment station, we have not only guaranteed the orderly promotion f this project, but also avoided the destruction of water bodies in the Small Three Gorges scenic spot, and successfully overcome the difficulties in construction, such as the poor geology like the large deformation of 7km soft rock, and mud outburst and water gushing with maximum daily water gushing of 157,000m3.
After Zhengzhou-Wanzhou High-Speed Railway is completed and opened to traffic, it will become a new convenient and express main channel for passenger transport from southwest China to Central Plains, north China and northeast China, and it has great significance to improve the capacity and quality of the northeast railway channel in southwest China, perfect the layout of the regional road network, accelerate the development of tourism resources and the process of urbanization along the line, promote the regional coordinated development, and push the implementation of the Western Great Development strategy.
Experts say it is unconstitutional to collect immigration data through U.S. Census for seat allocation in the House of Representatives
Some civil rights organizations and governments of several U.S. cities and counties filed suits against the U.S. federal government, claiming that the attempts made by Trump’s Presidential Palace to exclude undocumented immigrants from the U.S. Census are unworkable and unconstitutional.
The U.S. Census will determine allocation of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Sarah Brannon, the executive attorney of the American Civil Liberties Alliance, told VOA, "It won't work. ”
She went on to say that Trump's request to identify the citizenship of the people through the census is difficult and "not very reliable. ”
Another civil liberties organization Common Cause filed a lawsuit on Thursday to challenge Trump's executive order.
Some cities in New Jersey and Georgia joined the lawsuit.
Arlington County, Virginia, also joined the lawsuit on Friday.
Arlington County Board of Management Chairman Garvey said, "The U.S. Constitution requires an accurate count of our population every 10 years.  We must accurately count everyone who lives in Arlington County, and we will not allow this illegal attempt for scaring away people and shrinking the number of our immigrant communities to succeed. ”
Some other organizations and individuals praised President Trump's executive order.
Alabama Attorney General Marshall called the executive order a "victory" for the state.
He said, "The allocation of seats in the House of Representatives and Electoral College seats in each state must be based on the number of residents living in each state, and the number should be that of the residents living legally there. ”
The U.S. Supreme Court last year prevented the Trump administration from including citizenship issues in the 2020 census form.
President Trump signed an executive order earlier this week instructing Secretary of Commerce of the U.S. Census Bureau to submit data on the undocumented population obtained from the census so that the administration can exclude these undocumented populations from the state census, and in addition to that, the data will be used to determine whether each state will increase or decrease or maintain the seats of the House of Representatives.
The United States redistributes the seats of House of Representatives every 10 years based on the demographic changes.
Heavy rain fell in 33 districts and counties of Chongqing. The local government started the level IV emergency response of flood control - www.chinanews.com
Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, July 26 (Reporter Ke Gaoyang, Li Song) - The reporter learned from Chongqing Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters that Chongqing had ushered in a new round of heavy rainfall since July 25, with 33 districts and counties experiencing heavy rains, and 4 small and medium-sized rivers experiencing super-alert water level floods, and the local government has started the level IV emergency response of of flood control.
According to the monitoring of Chongqing Hydrological Monitoring Station, from 8: 00 on the 25th to 8: 00 on the 26th, heavy-hard rain occurred in most areas of Chongqing, including 33 districts and counties such as Jiangjin, Qijiang and Wulong, and 16 districts and counties including Wanzhou, Yunyang and Nanchuan had heavy downpours.

Act Dynamically with Specific Situations and Trends to Promote Construction of Industrial Projects - ShiDianNet.com - Hunan Daily Network (hnrb.voc.com.cn) - www.voc.com.cn
In the midsummer of Hunan, heat waves are blowing everywhere.
But the enthusiasm from the site observation meeting for promoting industrial project construction in the province has overwhelmed the heat of the dog days, the clear eye-catching orientation of “Compete with industries to demonstrate your strength and define heroes according to projects” is encouraging people throughout the whole Hunan province.
Development of Hunan should always depend on building projects and cultivating industries.
Facing the extremely unusual first half of the year and under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the whole province insisted on taking comprehensive actions to go all out to fight the two tough battles - beating the epidemic and control the flood, and implemented industrial projects as the “first actions” for achieving the goal of realizing "Six Stabilities" and “Six Guarantees”.
From a year-on-year decline of 1.9% in GDP in the first quarter to a year-on-year growth of 1.3% in the first half of the year, the hard difficulties encountered and the great efforts made in the period are self-evident.
In this precious list of achievements, we can see that it is construction of industrial projects that constituted the key support for Hunan's rapid economic recovery and stable development.
Take actions by trends and never go against them.
Construction of industrial projects must be integrated with the overall pattern and the general trends of events, and people should not only be good at trend accumulation and planning, but also at identifying and seeking of change and adapting to them.
In the current complex and severe background of the current international situation, apart from engaging at the hard work of attracting investment, it is also necessary to calm down and study the new characteristics of the current new situation, so as to master the rules more accurately and more scientifically to better integrate with the new development pattern in which domestic and international circulations supplement with each other while the great domestic circulation taking the dominant position.
Pay more attention to improving the basic capabilities of industries.
In the first half of the year, not only did a large number of heavyweight investment projects in the emerging industries kick off in our province, but also the enterprises in the traditional and advantageous industries have accelerated deployments in making digital, intelligent, and green industrial transformations.
In the Project of Yiyang Aoshikang Third Science Park, existing production lines have been revamped with the intelligent lines producing high-end printed circuit boards, which has seized the first opportunity in the market, New Plant of Hunan China Tobacco Changde Cigarette Factory has focused on intelligent transformation and plant modernization construction, which is also a vivid demonstration of "An old tree grows fresh sprouts"... Only by consolidating and upgrading advantageous industries, actively fostering and developing emerging industries, and comprehensively strengthening scientific and technological innovations and localization-based substitutions based on major national strategies and important construction projects, can we continue to consolidate the basic conditions and accumulate momentum for transformations.
Pay more attention to cultivating and developing new economies, new business types and new models.
The sudden outbreak of new Covid pandemic has made "cloud economy" go viral and activated potential of digital economy, which have provided new opportunities for industrial transformation, in the first half of the year, computer and office equipment manufacturing industry, electronic and communication equipment manufacturing industry saw a growth of 12.6% in our province, while the online retail sales of wholesale and retail enterprises above designated sizes and the online meal-fee income of catering companies hit 32.2% and 35.6% respectively year-on-year.
It is an irresistible trend to nurture new opportunities amidst the crisis, create new situations amidst changes, actively promote digital industrialization and digitization of industries, and guide digital economy and entity economy to integrate with each other for further development.
Pay more attention to optimizing and stabilizing the supply chains of the industrial chains.
Construction machinery industry plays a key role in Hunan's industries, but two-thirds of its supporting enterprises are outside the province, so there is still room and potential for us to tap in the supporting chains.
Strengthening industrial-chain focused thinking to reinforce project implementations requires continuous strength accumulation of leading companies and their technological breakthroughs in the key links of industrial chains, and in addition, all levels of governments should also cultivate industrial chains wholeheartedly to trigger "chain" reactions by strengthening, supplementing and expanding the chains and push related supporting industries to make coordinated arrangements and speed up construction of independent, controllable, safe and reliable industrial chains’ supply chains.
To overcome difficulties and support enterprises, Hunan is still a hot spot and paradise where business environment is good and market opportunities spring up in large numbers.
Governments at all parts of the province have frequently taken actions, made new plans and adopted practical measures to catalyze high-quality developments with "burden reductions" targeting at helping enterprises overcome their difficulties, and Shaoyang government has provided “shareholder-style" services to help enterprises handle their affairs and fulfill policies thoroughly and solve their problems effectively... In the process of reducing pandemic-incurred losses, they have done “everything possible” to pinpoint the weak and blocked points for them and turned crises into opportunities.
Researching, cultivating, and developing industries whole heartedly and optimizing business environment steadily, they will surely win the favor of more investors.
Adverse winds and waves are still ahead, but to brave the winds and waves has become the normal practice for all levels of governments in the province to highlight construction of industrial projects and boost high-quality developments.
At this critical time, we must earnestly study General Secretary Xi Jinping’s important instructions and follow them effectively, and we should cope with external uncertainties efficiently with the certainties from our own actions, and constantly promote industrial project construction with strong enthusiasm and perspiration to ensure the successful achievement of “The 13th Five-Year Plan” and realization of a well-off society in an all-round way.

The overall stability of employment and commodity prices shows that the economy has “temperature”
Economic Daily • Reporter of China Economic Net Lin Huocan
In the first half of this year, facing the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic, China made an overall plan to promote epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development; the situation of epidemic prevention and control kept improving, the steady economic recovery was obvious, and the performance of employment and commodity prices closely related to people's livelihood was generally stable; and the Chinese economy handed over a transcript of economic operation with “temperature”.
In the first two months of this year, the survey showed that the unemployment rate had increased.
Especially in February, the production and operation activities of many enterprises were basically in a state of suspension of production, the employment demand of enterprises decreased, the recruitment was delayed or cancelled, and the surveyed urban unemployment rate increased.
With the gradual improvement of epidemic prevention and control situation, the production and living order of the whole society is constantly restoring.
The CPC Central Committee adheres to the general work guideline of making progress while maintaining stability, further intensifies the macro-policy opposition, comprehensively strengthens the employment priority policy, and actively promotes the work of assisting enterprises in stabilizing posts and expanding employment.
China has stepped up policies to hedge and stabilize posts, promulgating a combination of policies of "reduction, exemption, mitigation, return and subsidy", reducing and exempting three social insurance unit contributions in stages, allowing deferred payment of social insurance premiums, expanding the benefits of stable post return of unemployment insurance and work-based training for small and medium-sized enterprises, and providing absorption subsidies and probation subsidies for enterprises to absorb employment of key groups.
With the complete implementation of various policies to stabilize employment, the employment demand of enterprises has steadily rebounded, the employment situation has gradually improved, and the surveyed urban unemployment rate has gradually declined, and in June, the surveyed unemployment rate was 5.7%.
Zhang Yi, director of the Department of Population and Employment Statistics of the National Bureau of Statistics, said that in the second quarter, various employment policies continued to take effect, the labor force who quitted their jobs due to the COVID-19 epidemic in the early stage returned to work one after another, and the urban labor participation rate in June increased by about 10 percentage points compared with February, which was close to the same level last year.
The data shows that the total urban employment in June increased by more than 19% compared with February, and most industries reached the pre-COVID-19 epidemic level; and the average weekly working hours of employees in enterprises reached 46.8 hours, 6.6 hours higher than that in February and 0.1 hour higher than that in January.
Commodity prices are also related to thousands of families.
In January this year, CPI increased by 5.4% year on year, setting a new high for many years.
In February, although the year-on-year increase of CPI declined slightly, it was still in the "5 range".
The year-on-year increase of CPI was at a high level, which was not only pulled by the consumption demand before the Spring Festival, but also caused by the staggered month of the Spring Festival and the low year-on-year base.
However, the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on commodity prices was particularly obvious.
Affected by the COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control, logistics delay, untimely material supply, and increased material transportation costs, etc. occurred all over the country in January and February; in addition, some citizens hoarded and snapped up commodities, so the prices of some daily necessities increased significantly.

China News reporting, Hainan of Qinghai, July 26th. Title: "Live Broadcasting Studio for Sea of Flowers" beside Qinghai Lake: "Sweet" Live Stream Sales Help Farmers Earn Higher Incomes - China news
by Hu Guilong and Pan Yujie
"In the midsummer Qinghai Lake, golden flowers are everywhere and thousands of bees are flying busily, the altitude here is high, resulting in a huge temperature difference between day and night, air pollution here is little and sunlight is strong, and all of those have bred the most tenacious and generous bee colonies, which endow Qinghai royal jelly with the characteristics of higher activities, high protein, rich nutritions, low sugar and low fat. ”
On 26th, Zhang Jianxun, deputy director of the Industry and Information Administration of Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Qinghai Province, said so.
The same day, the program of the live stream sales of bee products called "Fighting Pandemic in a Concerted Effort to Help Farmers Sell Spring royal Jelly" was held on the banks of Qinghai Lake, representatives of Chinese Bee Products Association, representatives of entrepreneurs, and beekeepers gathered together there to promote Qinghai's featured bee products, and the total online and offline sales reached nearly10,000 bottles of Qinghai Plateau Royal Jelly, hitting a total of approximately RMB3.8 million.
The picture shows beekeepers demonstrating their bee products at site.
It is reported that the live stream sales program has been supported by Beijing Houdeli Bee Industry Chain Store Network, Kuaishou, Taobao and other well-known domestic bee product retail companies, live broadcast, and e-commerce platforms and has facilitated exchange and cooperation of "enterprises + beekeepers + farmer households", "Qinghai Plateau Spring Royal Jelly Consumption Coupons" were also distributed successively to consumers through both online and offline channels, and it is estimated that the company will surrender a total profit of nearly RMB5.28 million throughout the year.
In this regard, Wu Na, President of Beijing Houdeli Bee Industry Co. Ltd., believes that it is "very worthwhile": "This move can boost reputation of Qinghai bee products and attract more consumers to understand and get to love pure and natural bee products containing no additives, which will increase beekeepers’ income. ”
At present, the company has signed strategic agreements on production cooperation with Qinghai Cloud Bee Industry Co., Ltd. and Qinghai Huabao Bee Industry Co., Ltd., hoping to jointly promote the rapid development of Qinghai's local bee industry.
The picture shows the sea of rape blossoms by the Qinghai Lake.
This spring, many bees died from missed flowering periods and lack of food, which were resulted from road access barriers provided on the beekeepers’ roads of "chasing flowers and honey" due to the needs of prevention and control of the epidemic, so the incomes of beekeepers were seriously affected.
"Throughout the whole year, beekeepers travel long distances following the flowering periods from Yunnan and Sichuan, all the way northwards to the northwest region, and they have to live in the open air without fixed homes, and their work is very hard.
As a business, we have a responsibility to help them.  ”
Wu Na said.
"Little bees are 'environmental scouts', and they cannot survive in heavily polluted areas." Zhao Xiaochuan, executive vice president of China Bee Products Association, introduced that bee pollination is an important link of the ecological chain, which plays an irreplaceable role in protecting plant diversity and improving ecology.
At the same time, bee pollination can also increase yields and improve quality of crops, especially in areas with extensively planted crops and poor management conditions, the significance of pollination is even greater.
Research data indicate pollination can increase rapeseed yield by approx.15% - 30%.
The picture shows Zhao Xiaochuan (right), executive vice president of China Bee Products Association, promoting Qinghai bee products.
"The economic, ecological and social benefits created by bee pollination are far greater than the value of bee products themselves, the bee industry has huge potential in human health, crop production, vegetation reproduction, and ecological protection, which people have always known a little. ”
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
Nowadays, the number of beekeepers is decreasing, in addition to beekeepers who are always on the go all the year round, there are still many impoverished households with limited mobility who choose to become shareholders of cooperatives with their beehives.
"The state provides financial support and we contact our technical personnel to offer help and guidance, beekeepers lack understanding and judgment of the market environment, and to open a market, they also need the help and coordination from government, enterprises, and industry associations. ”
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
"I hope everyone will pay more attention to and help beekeepers in the future," said Wu Na, "Our bee products are also screened and quality controlled in strict accordance with national standards to ensure their quality, so we will protect consumers’ rights and interests while helping beekeepers. ”

According to this historical background, Deng Yuan, a well-known screenwriter, has polished this film several times, which makes the plot tortuous and brain-burning.
Liu Yunlong is the producer and the leading actor in the “Winner”.
In the play, Tang Fei, played by Liu Yunlong, is the criminal section chief of Linhe Police Department; and he is a stuttering policeman who is quite happy and even a little angry, but his real identity is an underground member of the Communist Party of China.
Cai Meng, the heroine who played the opposite play, is the head of Linhe Security Bureau, who is highly appreciated by Japanese boss Fukuhara; and there is a subtle relationship between Cai Meng and Tang Fei, which is both enemy and friend and ambiguous.
In recent years, Su Qing has tried many different roles, from Lu Ruowen in the “Those Years We Are Young” to Er Qing in the “Story of Yanxi Palace”, all of which impressed the audiences deeply and were recognized by the audiences for her acting skills.
This time, Su Qing and Liu Yunlong are partners for the first time; and the arrangement of stuttering police chief with charming policewoman is quite interesting and innovative.
In addition to the two protagonists, there are many powerful actors such as Liang Guanhua, Li Liqun, Qian Bo, Lei Han, and Shen Junyi in the “Winner”, and the old actors are also one of the highlights of this film.
It is understood that the “Winner” is also very sophisticated in production, and the crew spans nearly 2,000 kilometers in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Liaoning provinces for shooting and framing.
In order to restore the grotesque city features during the Japanese occupation period in Northeast China, the artists and props group of the crew worked day and night, carefully polishing every detail of the scene construction and props, which made the scenes in the play delicate and rich in historical texture.

White House advisers "bite back” that the states resume work too early
On July 23rd, local time, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 exceeded 4 million, accounting for 30% of the global cases of COVID-19.
For several months, US President Trump repeatedly required all the states in the country to resume work and school, and only recently did he change his attitude and actively wear masks in public; and his advisers even "bit back" and said that some state governments resumed work too early.
On the 22nd, White House Presidential Advisor Kellyanne Conway said at a press conference that some state governments failed to comply with the standards for resuming work and restarted places like bars too early.
Conway also mentioned that the previous statement that the president has "absolute power" to decide the resumption of work in each state was a misinformed rumor.
"The president is a federalist, and he believes that every state has autonomy.  ”
She defended Trump.
However, the "rumor" in Conway's mouth was uttered by Trump himself at the White House epidemic briefing meeting on April 13.
This self-hit-face operation was ridiculed by netizens as "rewriting history".
Kellyanne Conway wants to rewrite history, and she is a liar.
Trump called Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer a dictator because she followed medical standards and insisted on stopping work.
Trump wants to push resumption of work so that he can hold a rally.
This is not the first time Kellyanne Conway has caused controversy.
On April 15, Conway blurted out in an interview with Fox News: "This is COVID-19, not COVID-1, friends!”  ”
She seemed to understand "19" as a version number, which was ridiculed by netizens crazily: read the newspaper without common sense!
Is it reasonable for a 3-year-old child to sue the school after obtaining compensation because he has been hit while playing in the university playground?
2020-07-26 05:01:11 Source: Legal Daily Author: Wang Sishuo Editor in Chief: Wang Sishuo
The child sued the school after obtaining compensation after being hit
□ Our correspondent Zhao Yifan
When 3-year-old Xiaowen was playing in a university playground, he was accidentally shot in the head by Chen, a member of the softball team.
After Chen compensated Xiaowen, Mr. Wen, Xiaowen's father, as Xiaowen's statutory agent, sued the school to the court, demanding the school where the playground where the accident occurred is located to apologize, and paying a total of RMB 20,000 for medical expenses and mental damages.
Recently, after hearing the case, Beijing Haidian District People's Court held that the school had set up protective nets in the playground at the time of the incident, and had performed its proper security obligation, and that Chen had already made compensation, so it made a judgment, rejecting the plaintiff's claim.
Mr. Wen claimed that during the summer vacation in 2019, he took Xiaowen to play in the school playground when the softball team was training in the playground.
In order to avoid the risk that may be brought by the softball team, Xiaowen, Mr. Wen and many other children and parents played in the safe area designated by the softball team.
However, Chen, a member of the softball team, dropped the ball when he threw the ball, causing the softball to fly over the protective net to the above safe area and hit Xiaowen's hindbrain.
Mr. Wen immediately took Xiaowen to the hospital for treatment, and Xiaowen was diagnosed as head injury.
Mr. Wen thought that the facilities of the school stadium did not meet the relevant safety regulations, and the school had not effectively managed the softball team and related facilities.
The school's fault led to the above incident, which caused Xiaowen to suffer great pain physically and mentally, and also brought great pain to his family, so the school should bear legal liabilities for the accident.
In this regard, the school argued that it had set up protective nets in the playground, and posted management regulations and a training notice, telling that persons entering the playground must keep a safe distance from the training ground and pay attention to their own safety, and the plaintiff could not prove that the school "failed to perform its security obligation", so the school did not agree to compensation.
After hearing the case, the court held that the place where the accident occurred was a place open to the public free of charge by the school involved in the case, and although the school had the security obligation for the management of the playground, this security obligation only needed to meet the general duty of care.
At the time when the accident occurred, the school set up protective nets in the playground, and performed its proper security obligation, in addition, Chen compensated Xiaowen for medical expenses, transportation expenses and other losses of more than RMB 2,000 according to the previously signed compensation agreement, and both parties agreed to solve the dispute once.
Afterwards, Xiaowen's parents once again claimed compensation from the school, which was untenable in law, therefore, the court made a judgment, rejecting all of the plaintiff’s claims.
After the judgment was pronounced, neither party appealed, and the judgment is now in effect.
According to Article 37 of Tort Law of the People's Republic of China, schools, as managers of public places, have the security obligation; and in the case that a third person's behavior causes damage to another person, the third person shall bear the tort liability, while the public place manager who fails to perform the security obligation shall bear the corresponding supplementary liability.
The judge held that the manager of a public place was most likely to know the actual situation of the whole place, foresee the possible dangers and damages, and thus was most likely to take necessary measures to prevent the occurrence of losses or reduce the degree of damages, and the cost of avoiding and reducing damages was the lowest, so the laws stipulated that the managers of public places should bear the corresponding guarantee obligations for engaging in social activities.
In this case, for unspecified people entering the playground which is open to the public free of charge, the school’s security obligation should be adapted to the social activities it engages in, and specifically, the school should mainly take basic security measures and have the obligation to inform hidden dangers.
In judicial practice, it is not appropriate to impose excessive security obligations on managers of public places.
If the school has set up protective nets and fulfilled its obligation of informing, it can be concluded that the school is not at fault and should not bear legal liabilities.
In addition, for third-party infringement, even if the managers of public places such as schools fail to fulfill their security obligations, their responsibilities are also a supplement to damages, and according to the newly promulgated Civil Code, a manager can also claim compensation from the third party after bearing supplementary responsibilities.
Therefore, in such accident, the victim should not expand the scope of claim after obtaining compensation from the direct infringer.
Facing the normalization of pandemic prevention and control, people’s enthusiasm for sports and fitness has run high.
With the gradual liberalization of cross-province tourism business, the tourism market will also see a recovery.
Fujian Province has resumed cross-province travel business since July 21, and on the first weekend after the opening, Xiamen, a hot tourist destination, saw a passenger flow peak.
As a hot destination city of tourism, Xiamen attracts many tourists on weekends.
Xiamen Railway Station is expected to send passengers of 3.7 million person times in the summer vacation, while the airport passenger flow will be dominated by students, tourists and family visitors.
The tourism market is gradually recovering, in July, airports in Xiamen operated an average of 440 flights per day, and domestic flights returned to 80% of the pre-epidemic level.
Airline companies have increased air express routes from Xiamen to major cities such as Shanghai, Beijing, Kunming and Xi'an to seize the tourism market after recovery.
At present, a number of travel agencies in Xiamen have launched a number of domestic cross-province tour products for summer vacation, mainly giving priority to outdoor attractions for group itineraries.
Aiming at the passenger peaks at railway stations and airports during summer vacation, relevant units have arranged additional staff at check-in counters, security check lanes and other areas where people tend to gather for guidance, and Fujian has also optimized and upgraded the "Bamin Health Code" to achieve the sharing and mutual recognition of health data with 31 provinces to promote the orderly recovery of the tourism market.

Israel strengthens the prevention and control of the repeated COVID-19 Epidemic
At the early stage of the outbreak of COVID-19, the effectiveness of Israeli epidemic prevention and control measures were obvious.
However, with the gradual lifting of the ban on epidemic prevention and control measures, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Israel has increased obviously recently, and the Israeli government has taken urgent measures to strengthen the epidemic prevention and control.
On February 28, the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Israel; therefore, Israel quickly took epidemic prevention and control measures such as closing all entry-exit ports, suspending non-essential industries, changing schools to online teaching, restricting public transportation and non-essential social activities, blocking cities with severe COVID-19 epidemic, and maintaining epidemic prevention and control together military and police.
This series of measures quickly achieved positive results, and by mid-May, the number of newly confirmed COVID-19 cases in Israel once fell back to single digit.
With the COVID-19 epidemic under control, all epidemic prevention and control measures in Israeli were completely lifted, however, since June, the number of newly confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Israeli has gradually rebounded.
Especially since July, the COVID-19 epidemic spread rapidly.
In recent days, there were more than 1,500 new cases of COVID-19 in Israel every day for eight days, and as of July 25, the number of new cases of COVID-19 in Israel reached 916 on that day.
As of July 25, there were 59,745 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 448 deaths in Israel.
Facing the rapid rebound of the COVID-19 epidemic, the Israeli government has taken urgent measures for many times to strengthen the epidemic prevention and control.
On July 6, after the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 exceeded 30,000, the Israeli government closed gymnasiums, swimming pools, bars, nightclubs and other public entertainment places, and introduced a policy of restricting public transportation, stipulating that the maximum number of passengers on a bus should not exceed 20.
On the 17th, the Israeli government announced a series of new restrictive measures, including the implementation of "lockdown" on weekends, which stipulated that "lockdown" should be implemented from 17: 00 every Friday to 5: 00 every Sunday.
During the period of "lockdown", people could go out, but shops, shopping centers, barbershops, beauty salons, libraries, zoos, museums, exhibition halls, swimming pools and tourist attractions would be closed, while supermarkets, pharmacies and other basic service places would remain open.
At the same time, gatherings of more than 10 persons were prohibited on all dates and time periods, gymnasiums, studios and other relevant places were closed, having meals at restaurants and cafes were prohibited, and only take-out services were allowed.
At the same time, the Israeli people did not pay enough attention to the severity of the COVID-19 epidemic and failed to form a joint force with the government in fighting the COVID-19 epidemic.
After repeated outbreaks of the COVID-19 epidemic in Israel, many people took to the streets to protest and march because the government’s epidemic prevention and control measures affected their own economic interests.
On July 11, tens of thousands of persons held demonstrations in Tel Aviv, arguing that the anti-epidemic policy affected the economy.
On the evening of the 21st, thousands of protesters gathered in front of Prime Minister Netanyahu’s residence in Jerusalem to protest against Prime Minister Netanyahu's promulgation of epidemic prevention and control measures against restaurants and coffee halls without giving corresponding compensation.
In addition, many people did not comply with the regulations of wearing masks and keeping a safe social distance of two meters when they were outdoors, and in order to avoid being fined by the police for not wearing masks, many people only wore masks on their chins or hang masks on their wrists.
During the repeated outbreaks the COVID-19 epidemic, schools were the hardest hit areas where COVID-19 spread; and according to the reporter's recent visits to kindergartens during this period, teachers and students in the kindergartens did not wear masks as required by the government, and did not keep a safe social distance of two meters from each other, which laid a hidden danger for a large number of teachers and students to be infected with COVID-19.
Professor Elie Waksman, a member of the anti-epidemic expert advisory group of the National Security Council of Israel, thought that Israel was moving towards a "dangerous situation", pointing out that the epidemic prevention and control measures taken by Israel at present were not enough, and all leisure and entertainment venues and summer schools should be closed to control the further spread of the COVID-19 epidemic.
Waksman said that Israel lacked an overall plan to fight the COVID-19 epidemic, and the parliament and government departments should abandon their respective interests as soon as possible, reach an agreement on fighting the COVID-19 epidemic, and formulate clear steps including relevant restrictive measures in different departments.

Despite the inconvenience of his legs and feet in the past two years, 77-year-old Dai Tianfu is still counting on "coming to Liang Yun Cultural Courtyard every three or five days to watch the play".
Liang Yun Cultural Courtyard is an unremarkable courtyard in Yuanzhou District of Guyuan City; different from ordinary farmhouses, there are often melodious Shaanxi Opera, splendid shadow play, embroidery works, traditional Qin Opera, eyebrow and Hu Opera in Liang Yun Cultural Courtyard.
The owner of Liang Yun Cultural Courtyard is Liang Yun, who used to be a carpenter.
More than 10 years ago, Liang Yun who loves shadow play and singing opera started planning to build a cultural courtyard.
After the Liang Yun Cultural Courtyard was built, the cultural life of the villagers has become rich and colorful.
Before the reporter entered Liang Yun Cultural Courtyard, the tune of Shaanxi Opera had already spread out.
Bai Lixiang, a villager from a neighboring village, was singing excerpts of Shaanxi Opera for villagers.
Bai Lixiang loves Shaanxi Opera since childhood, and now she is famous in the local area, and whenever she has free time, she will come to Liang Yun Cultural Courtyard to perform for the villagers.
Recently, Bai Lixiang also played network broadcast.
Bai Lixiang said: "it is a very happy thing to have a stage for more people to see her performances. ”
On the stage, the singer is one-size-fits-all, and the players are one tune at a time, and although they are amateurs, their enthusiasm is undiminished.
Just like the rustic style of the farmyard, besides the Shaanxi Opera, the "grassroots" art and non-legacy culture in Liang Yun Cultural Courtyard come to the fore.
Liang Yun Cultural Courtyard also has a collection of more than 300 material objects including agricultural tools of different ages, traditional and hand-made tiles, paper-cuts, embroidery, and shadow puppets, etc.
Liang Yun led the reporter into the exhibition hall in the courtyard, which displayed his old collection of objects, such as old hip flask, three-stringed instrument, and spinning wheel.
Why did an ordinary farmer build a cultural courtyard?
Liang Yun said: "shadow play is my family craft, and I have been learning this craft since I was 15 years old. ”
Established in 2012, Liang Yun Cultural Courtyard has become the first rural "intangible cultural heritage exhibition hall" in Ningxia, and is also a demonstration courtyard for the protection of intangible cultural heritage in Guyuan City.
In addition to Liang Yun Cultural Courtyard, there are more than 120 cultural courtyards and 79 folk performance groups in Yuanzhou District, Guyuan City, among which there are more than 50 cultural courtyards with a certain scale, such as Shenjiahe Cultural Courtyard, Wang Yonghong Cultural Courtyard, and Yanglang Cultural Courtyard, covering all towns and streets in Yuanzhou District, with more than 5,000 participants.
These grassroots artists are active in the fields and folk, enriching the cultural life of the masses and meeting their spiritual needs.
"As people’s lives get better and better, traditional culture can't be left behind. ”
Liu Yunlong stars opposite Li Liqun in Winning, his iconic spy TV series - Xinhua Net
The 40-episode spy TV series, Winning, will be released on Beijing TV from July 16.
Winning is adopted from the dusty Soviet military archives, which are disclosed for the first time in many years.
The actor Liu Yunlong, who is well known to the audience for his spy TV series, defies his typical image by playing a faltering special agent.
In recent years, the popularity of serials such as The Pretender, The Mask and The Kite have proven that the spy genre has a strong vitality.
Unlike previous spy series, Winning has a broader setting, extending the story all the way to the battlefields of the Soviet Far East.
The story is set in the final stage of the war against Japan in 1944, in which Tang Fei (Liu Yunlong), a secret intelligence agent of the Communist Party of China, who, under the leadership of the Secretary of the Linhe Provincial Committee and the Director of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Bureau, carries out the Mudan-Ula strategy of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Bureau.
In many spy dramas, the male protagonist, as a senior spy, appears as the perfect image of handsome, highly intelligent and mature.
But in Liu Yunlong's view, such people are not suitable for spies. "Spies should be the kind of person who is not even noticed in the crowd. If the spy has a very handsome appearance, and even hopes to attract everyone's attention, then how to lurk? There's a line in The Kite, 'If you don't come and get me, I'll forget I'm a Nationalist,' and spies have to be de-elitist. ”
Therefore, in Winning, Liu Yunlong has depicted his main character Tang Fei as a "faltering agent" with a sense of humor.
The adversaries in Winning are the Japanese Fukubara, played by Liang Guanhua, and the head of the police department, Fang Shibao, played by Li Liqun.
The two talented lead actors are from the South and the North respectively, adding a lot of highlights to the whole series.
Director Yin Fei used the word "interactive" to describe the rivalry between Li Liqun and Liu Yunlong in the drama, "absolutely interactive, the two of them have tacit understanding, this tacit understanding in them is very impactful to me. Many times their scenes are on-the-spot performance, for example, we only write half a page long, and when I don't say cut while shooting, they both can keep on playing. ”
The actors do not steal each other's scenes, the director does not intervene, and when the actors are into the role, they can not only shape the roles from the character's point of view, but also bring more viewing possibilities to the audience, Yin Fei said that only such a play is outstanding.
In the drama, audiences can also see many familiar faces in the "Liu's spy dramas", and three of the "Mountain City F4", who were so famous and powerful in "The Kite", have also gathered in Winning.
Hou Yu and Liu Mingyang, who played Song Xiaoan and Zhao Jianzhi, are once again playing Tang Fei's right-hand man.
Director Yin Fei introduced, "There is no inferiority in these two people, they just went with the flow in that era and that environment. ”
Liu Yunlong also said, "Let's be humane. This human touch means that I must have good and bad people around me, and the bad ones are the enemy, but we must bring them to our team to grow ourselves. ”
The ending of these two people in the play is also carefully designed by Liu Yunlong, who believes that he will give the audience a satisfactory answer.

Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 25 - Xu Zhengyu, the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, said that the financial market in Hong Kong remains active and functioning in an orderly manner.
He was optimistic about the financial stability and economy in Hong Kong.
At a webinar co-organized by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Toronto and the Hong Kong-Canada Business Association (Canadian General Chamber of Commerce) on July 24 (Toronto time), Xu Zhengyu said Hong Kong is going through a difficult situation because of the "controversy over the amendment of Fugitive Offenders Ordinance" and the COVID-19 epidemic.
The exchange rate of Hong Kong dollar is stable and tilted towards the guaranteed level of exchange for the strong side.
The banking system shows no clear signs of capital outflows, but on the contrary, more than USD11 billion has flowed in since June.
Total bank deposits have also continued to increase over the past few months, and the stock market has seen a spate of public offerings to raise fund, with market transactions rising repeatedly.
Xu Zhengyu said the COVID-19 epidemic has put pressure on the global economy and financial markets, but Hong Kong's fundamental strengths remain intact.
Hong Kong continues to be a leading international financial center for its many advantages, including geography, the rule of law, high-speed communications, free flow of information and capital, and a simple and low tax system.
Xu Zhengyu pointed out that the Hong Kong SAR Government has set aside 6 billion Hong Kong dollars in the "Pandemic Prevention and Control Fund" to create around 30,000 time-limited jobs in the public and private sectors in the next two years, covering people with different skills and educational backgrounds.
To support the development of financial technology, the Hong Kong SAR Government has also launched the "1,000 Talents Scheme" to subsidize local financial technology companies, start-ups and other enterprises with financial technology-related businesses to create 1,000 new jobs, hire local talents and enrich the financial technology talent pool in Hong Kong.
Looking forward to the future, Xu Zhengyu expressed the optimism for the financial stability and economy of Hong Kong.
He encouraged Canadian companies to seek development and make investments in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area and nearby regions by making best of Hong Kong's strengths and its position as an international financial center, an international asset and wealth management center and a global hub for offshore RMB business.
The Lancet published an article praising China’s anti-epidemic efforts and encouraging countries to learn from China’s experience - www.chinanews.com
The Lancet magazine published an article on the 25th, saying that China, as a country with a population of 1.4 billion and a scale similar to that of Europe or the United States, has effectively controlled the COVID-19 epidemic at the present stage, and the COVID-19 epidemic has not spread widely in China again, thus largely controlling the domestic COVID-19 epidemic.
The article indicates that in the past decade or so, China has invested heavily in domestic research and public health construction, which makes China's preparation for COVID-19 much better than that for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).
According to the author, when SARS broke out in 2002, China was not prepared enough at first, especially the pathogen could not be determined.
When COVID-19 was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists were able to identify the virus species quickly, and shared the genome sequencing data with the international community on January 11, 2020.
By the end of January, doctors from Mainland China and Hong Kong had clarified the clinical features of COVID-19, and warned the world about the threat of COVID-19 through research papers published in The Lancet.
China has also been at the forefront of vaccine research; under the state of emergency declared by the country, such research has been carried out very quickly and strictly through close domestic cooperation in China; and in May and July, the results of early trials of COVID-19 vaccine developed by China were published in The Lancet respectively.
China's experience shows that it is very important to invest in the national health and research system and effectively improve the laboratory capacity.
This is the basis for China to respond quickly and effectively to health emergencies and global health security.
Other countries, especially low-income and middle-income countries, are worth learning from China's experience.
In addition, China's experience proves that on the basis of strong research, there must be a strong high-level institution to make correct decisions decisively based on scientific basis, so that the COVID-19 epidemic can be effectively controlled.
The article emphasizes that the government and its leaders must respect science, understand its value, and take actions against COVID-19 in the most beneficial way to society.
In the early stage of the outbreak of COVID-19, the National Health Commission of China sent three groups of infectious disease experts to Wuhan to investigate the risk and spread of COVID-19, and their suggestions provided the basis for the decision to "Lockdown" in Wuhan on January 23; when some experts put forward the necessity and urgency of building mobile cabin hospitals, the government quickly made a decision and implemented it quickly; and at the same time, the extensive participation of the community and the masses also made the COVID-19 epidemic quickly and effectively controlled.
Finally, the article emphasizes that countries need to strengthen global cooperation and joint response to global health emergencies.

Focusing on the front line of epidemic prevention and control in Wuhan, the film will use a unique narrative from a humanity perspective and a very impactful camera language to show how Wuhan medical and nursing staff and medical teams from various provinces and cities fight on the front line against the epidemic, and to talk the touching story of dedication and sacrifice in a panoramic view.
It is reported that on the first day when the Wuhan city lifted its lockdown, Bona overcame many difficulties and sent a team to go deep into the front line of the epidemic, exchanging information with and collecting data from hundreds of medical workers face to face, and at present, Bona has interviewed the angels in white who were at the forefront of the epidemic fight, including Academician Zhong Nanshan, the first person who rushed to Wuhan from Guangzhou, the medical team from Guangdong to assist Wuhan, as well as doctors from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan Union Hospital, Wuhan University Central South Hospital, Wuhan Central Hospital, etc., and captured a lot of precious first-hand videos.

He said he had previously seen My People My Country and Chinese Captain and thought the approach of telling big-picture stories from the perspective of ordinary people would be good.
"Now some foreign friends still have some misconceptions about China. ”
When it comes to the communication of the film, Academician Zhong Nanshan said that some people abroad currently like to politicize the virus, and he hopes that the film will impress the audience from a humanistic perspective: "It is better for this film to be shown abroad in addition to China, and to impress the audience with a true humanistic spirit in a way that both domestic and foreign audiences can understand. ”
Academician Zhong Nanshan also fondly recalled the 1980s film At Middle Age, "After so many years, I still have the deepest impression of the post-reform and opening-up film At Middle Age, and my doctor friends abroad watched it and cried, and it would be amazing if Chinese Doctors could serve that purpose. ”
Academician Zhong Nanshan said that if Chinese Doctors can resonate with foreign audiences, it will be very successful.
During the discussion and exchange, Academician Zhong Nanshan also shared his opinions and suggestions on the current international epidemic prevention and control, "I believe that people are always smarter than viruses. ”
Academician Zhong Nanshan said that although the virus is unpredictable, but from primitive society to date, humans have survived thousands of difficulties, now modern society has developed medical technology and social administration measures, coupled with the basic understanding of the scientific response to the COVID-19 epidemic among medical professionals and even the general public all over the world, people won't be as passive as they used to be, "in the future, we need to study how the world can strengthen cooperation, and to comfort the people who have suffered from the epidemic.

There are cumulatively more than 30,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Japan – www.xinhuanet.com
According to statistics, on the 26th, 239 new cases were confirmed in Tokyo, and the number of new cases exceeded 200 on a single day for six consecutive days, reaching a total of 11,214 cases.
In addition, 141 new cases were confirmed in Osaka Prefecture, 90 in Fukuoka Prefecture, and 80 in Aichi Prefecture.
In the first half of the year, telecommunication network fraud crimes rose by 70%, and the Supreme People's Procuratorate summarized the characteristics - www.chinanews.com
Www.chinanews.com, July 26 - According to the information on the website of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, in the first half of this year, procuratorial organs nationwide prosecuted 58,101 persons for fraud, with an increase of 35% year on year.
Especially in the crime of preventing and controlling the COVID-19 epidemic, fraud crimes occurred frequently, and the number of fraud crimes prosecuted by procuratorial organs accounts for 43.4% of all crimes against the epidemic prevention and control.
The Supreme People's Procuratorate has carried out targeted guidance, at present, there are 9 cases involving fraud in the ten batches of typical cases involving the epidemic prevention and control issued by the Supreme People's Procuratorate.
Judging from the cases handled by procuratorial organs in the first half of the year, there are many names of fraud crimes, ranging from national macro policies to people's food, clothing, housing and transportation, including fraud involving the COVID-19 epidemic, "hospital scalper" fraud, "health care products" fraud, "enrollment intermediary" fraud, "trap loan" fraud, defrauding state subsidies and national assets unfreezing fraud, etc., which constantly bring forth new ideas, covering education, medical care, employment, old-age care, social security, land acquisition and demolition, precise poverty alleviation, financial credit and other fields, which not only cause economic losses to victims, but also seriously affect economic and social development.
In particular, some telecommunication network frauds break through the restrictions of national boundaries, regions and personnel, and have the characteristics of stakeholder, cross-border, remote, and electronic payment, etc., with many unspecified victims and great harm.
For example, some telecommunication network frauds established specialized companies, rent high-end office buildings, set up multiple departments or posts, carried out publicity and recruit by legal network platform, trained and assessed recruiters, adopted enterprise operation mode management, and wore "legal cloak", which is more confusing.
It is the unshirkable responsibility of procuratorial organs to punish and prevent crimes according to law and issue early warnings to the public and relevant departments in a timely manner.
In the judicial handling of cases, the procuratorial organs conscientiously perform their duties, not only insisting on maintaining a high pressure on fraud crimes, but also refining various law enforcement measures in a targeted manner, and promoting social governance by issuing procuratorial suggestions, etc.
Procuratorial organs strictly control the facts, evidence, procedures and application of laws in cases of arrest and prosecution of fraud criminals, taking facts as the basis and law as the criterion, without anyone being wrongly sentenced or connived at.
Especially for telecommunication network fraud, procuratorial organs pay attention to the core role of electronic data in fact determination, and strive to build an evidence chain of mutual corroboration among electronic data, verbal evidence and documentary evidence.
For example, for the case handled by the People's Procuratorate of Yinzhou District, Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province where Ying committed fraud involving the COVID-19 epidemic, the procuratorate intervened in advance at the first time, and it took only five days from the occurrence of the case to the completion, which reflected the attitude and determination to handle it quickly and strictly and maintain the stability of the overall social situation.
In the process of examining arrest and prosecution, the procuratorial organs paid attention to the prosecution of missing criminals, correcting 733 persons who were missed by the public security organs, and correcting 1113 accomplices who were missed by the public security organs.
In the first half of the year, procuratorial organs across the country issued 298 procuratorial suggestions against fraud crimes, promoting joint efforts to prevent fraud crimes and promote deep governance.
For example, for the loopholes found in telecommunication network supervision by telecommunication enterprises, banks, and intermediary organizations, etc., Guangzhou People’s Procuratorate and Dongguan People’s Procuratorate of Guangdong Province put forward procuratorial suggestions in a timely manner, urging relevant units to strengthen supervision, improve mechanisms and promote the construction of long-term systems.
Fourth, procuratorial organs do their best to recover stolen goods and losses.
Procuratorial organs all over the country seize the important links of intervening in investigation, guiding evidence collection, examining and prosecuting, etc., urge investigative organs to actively recover stolen money, cooperate with relevant departments in recovering stolen goods and recover losses, and strive to minimize the economic losses caused by fraud crimes to the masses.
For example, in the case of Lin's trap loan handled by Beijing People’s Procuratorate, which involved 22 properties waiting to be sealed up, when the properties may be disposed of in advance in other cases, Beijing People’s Procuratorate initiated the issuance of a "Suspended Enforcement Letter", which was promptly delivered to the relevant court, suggesting that the court previously enforcing sequestration suspend the enforcement of the properties involved, and dispose of them uniformly after the criminal facts were ascertained, so as to make the best efforts to recover the properties involved and recover the losses of the victims.
Prosecutors remind everyone that we should be very vigilant against fraud crimes, don't expect "pie in the sky", don't believe in cheap things, and keep our own "money bags".
Yina Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province: Shorter Apple Trees, Wider Road to Poverty Alleviation - www.chinanews.com
2020-07-26 11:42:58 Source: China Economic Net Author: Zhu Yanjing Editor in Chief: Zhu Yanjing
Hot summer, Economic Daily - the reporter of China Economic Net walked into Zhonghai Village, Yina Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province.
Against the scorching sun, Li Yuanzhong, a villager, was weeding in the base, and although his face was red with sunshine, he sang a few songs in his mouth from time to time.
Weining County where Yina Town is located has a certain reputation in the surrounding areas because its produced apple has high sugar content and good taste due to its low latitude, high altitude, sufficient sunshine and large temperature difference between day and night; however, because the apples are small in size and have many spots, they have not been able to sell at a good price and have not formed an industrial scale.
Yina Town used to be a poor township with "covering the valley and potatoes for the spring and autumn", and ten years ago, the poverty rate in Yina Town was as high as 25.8%.
It is extremely urgent to change traditional planting habits, adjust industrial structure and increase farmers' income when the poverty alleviation enters the critical period of decisive battle.
After many visits, Chen Chao, secretary of the Party Committee of Yina Town, and a group of people in the town thought that industrial development could no longer follow the old path.
Therefore, Yina Town introduced leading enterprises to plant apples in a modern way.
Hou Jianwen, deputy general manager of Weining Chaoyue Agriculture Co., Ltd., came to Yina Town from Shaanxi in 2015 for investigation, took a fancy to the local planting conditions at a glance, and planted apple trees in Yina Town from 2016.
At first, the village mobilized Li Yuanzhong to transfer the land to plant apple trees; however, Li Yuanzhong and his wife made a whisper in their hearts: "apples were planted for so many years, but I have not seen who planted apples in the village to make a fortune. ”
"The apple trees planted are dwarf apple trees, which will not make the apple trees grow too high. ”
What Li Yuanzhong didn't expect was that this apple planting adopted a new method, namely, irrigation pipes are laid under each apple tree, and water and fertilizer will be poured to the roots, and when harvesting fruit in autumn, the tractor will drive directly into the orchard, and the fruit could be picked when standing.
At present, the apple base has gradually entered a high-yield period, and the market is just as expected by Hou Jianwen; and apples sell well and are deeply loved by consumers in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other cities.
The growing apple industry has brought new changes to Li Yuanzhong's life, and although he is still farming, he has a new source of income.
Li Yuanzhong's family has transferred more than 9 mu of land to the Apple Base; every year, in addition to the guaranteed land transfer fee, there is a profit dividend after the apple trees bear fruit; and Li Yuanzhong and his wife usually work in the Apple Base, "one person can get RMB 80 every day and have a job all the year round".
Li Yuanzhong told the reporter that last year's profit dividend was more than RMB 2,800, plus the land transfer fee and the couple's income from working, the family earned more than RMB 80,000, "there is nothing to worry about food and clothing, and the family lives a well-off life".
"At present, the Apple Base has achieved initial results, and the annual output value of 1 mu of apples exceeds RMB 15,000, which is about 10 times that of corn. ”
Chen Chao told the reporter that at present, 20,000 mu of apples have been planted in the whole Yina Town, with 6,000 mu in Zhonghai Village alone, covering 4,056 households and 17,200 persons, including 656 households and 2,952 poor households who set up files and set up cards; and the annual salary to be paid is more than 6 million, which really realizes that the base is built at the door of the house and there is no need to go out to work.
Li Yuanzhong, the money in whose wallet is increasing day by day, has also begun to realize his "wish".
During the Lunar New Year this year, Li Yuanzhong bought an off-road vehicle; now he drives to and from work every day; "he still has more than ten mu of land; and when the Apple Base will expand its scale in the future, Li Yuanzhong intends to transfer such land to the Apple Base, and his income will be even more at that time. ”

Membrane separation technology helps to solve the "greenhouse effect"
Schematic diagram of preparation technology of new mixed matrix membrane
Www.chinanews.com, reporter Shang Rui - Recently, the Atmospheric Environment and Bioenergy Task Force at Tianjin University made great progress on "carbon dioxide capture by membrane separation method", and successfully researched and developed a new preparation technology of mixed matrix membrane, which greatly improves the carbon dioxide capture performance of membrane materials.
Related achievements have been published as a cover article of the international journal Greenhouse Gas: Science and Technology.
"Greenhouse effect" is a major environmental problem that puzzles human development, and carbon dioxide emission is the culprit of "greenhouse effect".
How to efficiently capture and utilize carbon dioxide emitted by human beings is the focus of scientists' attention.
"Membrane separation" is a new carbon dioxide capture technology, which separates carbon dioxide gas with the help of membrane materials, and has the characteristics of high efficiency, energy saving and simple operation.
How to make membrane materials "breathe deeply" and improve the efficiency of gas separation is the bottleneck and difficulty of carbon dioxide capture by membrane separation.
The scientific research team of Tianjin University innovated ideas and explored the impact of different solvents on membrane gas separation performance through repeated experiments.
The experimental results indicate that with N- methylpyrrolidone as the preparation solvent, the carbon nanotubes in the generated membrane material are more evenly distributed and “more breathable”, which effectively improves the gas separation efficiency and rate of the membrane material.
The carbon dioxide separation performance of the mixed matrix membrane prepared by this new technology is close to the upper limit of the theoretical separation of this kind of membrane material at present.
"The new technology provides a new idea for capturing carbon dioxide by membrane separation. ”
Li Run, a member of the Atmospheric Environment and Bioenergy Task Force at Tianjin University, said: "we hope that this technology can provide strong support for future coal-fired power plants and chemical enterprises to deal with flue gas and play a major role in controlling greenhouse gas emissions. ”
First Understand What Major-Based Score Differences Mean before Filling College Preferences Form - www.chinanews.com
2020-07-27 02:22:36 Source: Chongqing Morning News Author: Yu Xiao Editor in Charge: Yu Xiao
First Understand What Discipline-Based Score Differences Mean before Filling College Preferences Form
When filling college preference form each year, there are always some students or parents who do not understand the terms involving the filling, which then brings about adverse effect.
This year, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing University of Science and Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing Forestry University, and Beijing University of Chemical Technology have jointly issued their 2020 enrollment policy, which cancelled the major-based score differences.
What is the meaning of major-based score differences and what is its significance in college preference filling?
Three ways are available for defining major assignment rules
Experts remind that before filling the form, you must read the "Student Admissions Brochure" of your favorite college/university to understand its admission rules, including the student file transfer ratio, major assignment rules and others.
The major assignment rules refer to the three main ways of major admission - major priority, score priority, and major-based score difference after colleges/universities receive the transferred files of the candidate students.
The specific admission method adopted by colleges/universities will be specified in their Admissions Brochures.
However, some colleges/universities also adopt the total score first admission principle without setting up any score difference between majors.
That is to say, candidate students falling into the admission range are ranked according to their total scores, when one candidate student’s total score fails to reach the required admission score limit for the first preferred major, the teachers will check if it has hit the one for the second preferred major, the same will be done until the admission score limit for the last preferred major is caught, and no major-based score difference will be provided between the majors.
The so-called "major-based score difference" refers to the one or several score numbers publicized in the admission brochure when colleges/universities designate majors for the candidate students, which are used to determine the admission majors of the students who have applied for different majors, and this score number or numbers are called "major-based score difference".
That is the differences of total scores of a candidate student between his or her 1st preferred major and non-1st preferred majors, which are defined by a college and a university in admitting a student. They are specified score differences for different preferred majors, which are 3 points, 2 points, 1 point, etc.
For example,
Suppose one candidate student Xiao Ming applies for entry into college A and his score is 560 points, his preferred majors are computer, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering, and e-commerce, college A adopts the major-based score difference method for student admission and the difference are 2 points, 1 point, 1 point and 0 point.
When assigning a major to Xiao Ming, if his score meets the admission line for his first preferred major and there is admission space in the major plan, then Xiao Ming will be admitted to the "computer" major; If he is rejected for being admitted to computer major, his score will be deducted by 2 points and be treated as one of the candidate students whose 1st preferred major is "international trade", and then his score now will be 558 points, which will be taken as the basis for determining if the score has met the limit for his admission to the major of international trade; If he fails to hit the score limit, then his score will further be subtracted by 1 point (i.e., 557 points) before the decision for his admission to the third major is made by the college; If his score again fails to hit the admission limit for that major, his score will be subtracted by 1 point (that is, 556 points) once again for admission to his fourth preferred major, and if his score still fails to meet the admission limits of the subsequent majors, no more score subtraction will be made, and so forth.
Different colleges or universities provide different score differences.
With the popularization of provision of parallel preferred majors, many colleges/universities have now cancelled those differences, but some colleges/universities still retain them this year, according to the Admission Brochures publicized by colleges/universities, more than 20 colleges or universities have defined the difference this year.
For example, Sichuan Agricultural University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Jiangxi Normal University, Chengdu Medical University, Northeast Electric Power University, JiMei University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing University of Technology, Ningxia University, Shandong University of Technology and China Civil Aviation Flight Academy have provided the differences.
These universities have set different major-based score differences for different majors.
Some colleges/universities have provided a major-based score difference for every major, e.g., Ningxia University, for candidate students whose files have already been submitted Ningxia University, they will be admitted according to the order of their preferred majors and 1 point will be deducted successively as per this order.
While some other universities have set up different major-based score differences between different majors.
For example, Jimei University has set a total score of 4 points as major-based score differences, that is, the major-based score difference is 3 points between the 1st preferred major and others have a grade difference of 3 points, no major-based score difference is provided between other preferred majors, which are viewed as parallel ones, the difference is 1 point between other preferred majors and the adjusted majors.
When filling the form of preferred majors, candidate students and their parents must carefully read the admission policies of their targeted colleges/universities to clarify if any major-based score difference is provided and the specified differences defined, while fully considering the scores, they must also reasonably analyze the colleges/universities and the majors to be selected, if major-based score difference method is adopted by such colleges and universities for student admission which are clarified in their admission brochures, the students should pay attention to the score gaps between each major when choosing a major, which will bring about a higher probability of being admitted.

A 3-year-old Belgian girl died of novel coronavirus infection – www.chinanews.com
Belgian Health Authorities said on the 24th day that, a 3-year-old girl died of the novel coronavirus infection, who was the youngest death caused by novel coronavirus infection in this country.
Budwin Katerry, the spokesman of Belgian Health Authorities, said that this girl had other serious illnesses before being infected with the novel coronavirus; in addition to this girl, an 18-year-old youth died of the novel coronavirus infection too recently.
Katerry said that 85% of the new confirmed COVID-19 cases in Belgium last week were aged below 60.
He cautioned the healthy, younger population not to take it lightly.
"It is relatively rare for young people to die of the novel coronavirus infection, but no one is immune now. ”
Last week, Belgium saw an 89 % increase in the new confirmed cases of novel coronavirus infection compared to the previous week, with a daily average of 2.9 deaths of novel coronavirus infection, higher than the daily average of 1.7 persons in the previous week.
During the peak period of the epidemic in Europe, Belgium had the "highest" proportion of people infected with novel coronavirus in Europe.
Belgium has a population of more than 11 million.
The latest data show that a total of 64,847 people in Belgium have been infected with the novel coronavirus.
Earlier this week, Katerry warned that people must act before the snowball grows bigger and eventually causes an "avalanche".
To curb the rebound of the epidemic, Belgian Prime Minister Sophie Wilmès announced on the 23rd day that the rules regarding people wearing masks in public places will be stricter, and the program to further lift restrictive measures in August will also be temporarily suspended.

Chengdu people pile around U.S. Consulate, and the police stop people from "looking too happy"
In response to the U.S. closing of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, China announced the closure of the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu on Friday.
On Saturday, the insignia of the U.S. Consulate was removed, on Sunday, a dark-glassed car drove away from the consulate amid boos from passersby.
On Sunday, many Chengdu people piled up in front of the U.S. Consulate to take pictures, and those who had not been here before also came to take a look because they were curious about the current events.
A correspondent of the AFP Chengdu also went to observe the vicinity of the U.S. Consulate in Chengdu, and word came back that there was a steady stream of curious people, and many parents came to walk with their children, see the consulate, and take pictures of the building, or take selfies.
The consulate was surrounded by guards, and police officers occasionally "corrected" people's behavior and they seemed to not allow any outbursts: a woman was stopped just as she was about to sing a red song, and a guard confiscated a banner.
However, residents of a nearby residential building managed to pull up a giant Chinese flag on their balcony and shouted slogans in support of China.
The U.S. Consulate in Chengdu opened in 1985 and covered all U.S. consular-related matters in southwestern China, particularly in the Tibet Autonomous Region.
A correspondent of the AFP Chengdu said that the Chinese Government's response to the U.S. was relatively restrained: many Chinese people demanded online that the government close the U.S. consulate in Hong Kong, but the officials simply said that "closing the U.S. consulate in Chengdu is a necessary and legal response to the unreasonable behavior of the U.S.".
At present, in addition to Chengdu, the U.S. also has consulates in Guangdong, Shanghai, Shenyang, Wuhan, and Hong Kong of China.
