Novák helped Trabzonspor to second place, Škoda also scored
Defender Filip Novák helped Trabzonspor to the vice-championship with a goal in the last round of the Turkish Football League.
His team won 2-1 at Kayserispor, holding off third-placed Besiktas.
Striker Milan Škoda scored his 10th goal for Rizespor after a January transfer from Slavia, who saved himself despite a 1-3 defeat at Fenerbahce.
Novák confirmed the defender's excellent productivity with his seventh goal of this league year.
In the 63rd minute, the Kayserispor goalkeeper just kicked out a sharp shot and the Czech footballer drove the ball into the net from an angle.
The home side managed to equalise five minutes before the end, but Trabzonspor pulled off the victory in the sixth minute of the set-up by successfully finishing off a four-on-one break.
Škoda levelled the game at 1-1 at the start of the second half with Fenerbahce.
Rizespor did not hold on to the tie for long, but he did not have to regret it, as the results of the opponents left them three points above the relegation zone.
The competition will end with Sunday's Championship Basaksehir duel at Kasimpasa.
The well-hidden Cave at the Hermit in the woods near Nový Bor was not really habitable
In the north of Bohemia, in the foothills of the Lusatian Mountains, near Nový Bor in Českolipsko, in the woods through which the Hraběcí cesta led, there are several sandstone rock formations hidden.
Natural and artificially created.
And we will follow the one created by human hands.
The place is called the Cave at the Hermit.
In fact, no hermit has ever lived here and the cave served as a shelter, more precisely a hiding chamber apparently for grain.
The cave is carved from the side into the rock spur and accessible by stairs from above.
However, it is virtually invisible until the last moment.
It is revealed only by the narrow stairs leading to a kind of rock gallery, from where the rock is only just entered.
Although the chamber seems to be quite far from human dwellings, at the time of its creation there may have been a field on the plateau where the forest is today.
"The fact that the object has no window and even a traditional place of furnace clearly proves that no hermit could ever survive the winter here," explains historian Kamil Podroužek from the Faculty of Philosophy of Jan Evangelista Purkyně in Ústí nad Labem.
The one-dimensional object has only a stone bench at the back, which is probably used for putting away containers.
"I see it as a chamber for storing some food or products from the field," adds Kamil Podroužek.
There are traces of tools on the walls of the cave.
Breaking the sandstone with a pick was quite simple and quick for the initiates.
It was enough to use the claws appropriately and to gradually break the sandstone off.
By the length of the pick track and the way of cutting it can be given a general indication of the period of the cave's formation.
According to the historian, it is probably the end of the 18th century.
The cave is freely accessible and according to the mess that appears in it, nowadays someone sometimes sleeps there.
If you approach the cave from above from one of the forest paths and you are attracted by a flowing stream and the nearby Count's path, you will surely find the path down as well.
And on the way out of the forest you may still be captivated by the nearby Raven Rocks.
Jockey Minařík is in an artificial sleep after a heavy fall in Germany
"Filip is in the best hands now.
The institute is arranged for such cases, and fortunately we have part of the family in Hanover.
This makes my situation much easier and also the care of my daughter Finja," Jezdci.cz quoted a statement from Minařík's wife Katja.
"Everyone is doing their best, Filip needs time to recover now.
There is no point in giving any prognoses.
Anyone who has ever encountered the issue of head trauma and patients in an artificial sleep knows that the situation can change.
Filip is a great fighter.
We all have to be patient now and give him time," said the wife of the 45-year-old jockey.
Star Frankie Dettori, who won the seventh race of the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot on Saturday, has also called for financial support from the injured Minařík, equalling the legend Lester Piggott.
Gofundme has raised nearly €70,000 to date.
The goal is €100,000 (2.6 million crowns).
The video referee took four goals from the Sassuolo players, losing 0-2
The Sassuolo players took the ball four times in their opponent's goal in Saturday's game in Naples, but in the end they had to accept a 0-2 defeat.
Neither of their goals was conceded by the referee after consulting the video for offside.
According to the Italian media, this is a record of unfavorability of the technology, so many hits have never been thwarted by the VAR for one team.
"The VAR was stricter on Sassuolo than the road radar and punished it like no team has ever been.
The new technology is breaking records," wrote Gazzetta dello Sport in the commentary.
"The festival of unaconceded goals by Sassuolo.
Never before has the VAR been so strict on one team," added Corriere dello Sport.
Napoli took the lead in the 8th minute on Saturday, but after half an hour of play it seemed that Sassuolo had equalized.
However, Filip Djuričič's goal was not conceded after the video referee's intervention for offside.
For the same reason, Djuričič's other hits and those of Francesco Caputo and Domenico Berardi did not pay off.
The home side added one more goal.
Electric cars report a new record.
In the Czech Republic, they charged the most in history
"The growth was driven both by a 30 percent increase in the number of stations in our network and the trend of more frequent charging at public stations, as well as by the accelerated development of new e-car registrations," said Tomáš Chmelík, head of ČEZ's clean technology department.
Other big players, such as PRE and E.ON, the electric car manufacturer Tesla, as well as the supermarkets Billa and Lidl, are also reporting their share of the market.
The operators of classic petrol stations are represented by the company MOL.
However, it does not have figures yet.
"We only started building our network for electromobility last year," explained company spokesperson Jana Jusková.
However, the editorial of Deník exclusively obtained data from all 216 electric stands operated by the company ČEZ.
They show that drivers took an average of 13.5 kWh from the stations.
This corresponds to the range of roughly 100 kilometers of a smaller electric car.
Excluding small pumps of up to 1 kWh, the average charging time is two and a half hours.
The vast majority of refuelling took place in a free tariff.
If motorists had already paid for their collection, their typical spend was around 330 crowns.
Electromobility runs mainly in the capital city.
On the territory of Prague, there are all five of ČEZ's busiest chargers, which will eclipse even entire regional towns with their popularity.
Olomouc leads among the regions.
On the other hand, there is the least interest in remote stations in the borderlands, for example in Bohumín or Prachatice, which often remain unused throughout the day.
More than four thousand electric cars are currently registered in the Czech Republic.
In the first half of this year alone, 1274 new e-cars were added.
In an extensive survey by Deník "Czechs on the Move" eight percent of readers said that they were considering buying an electric car for their family.
However, only a third of respondents know where to look for the nearest charging station in their area.
Not only for better water retention.
Environmental activists protest in Prague
According to organizers, the government's actions to date on issues of protecting and restoring the Czech landscape and tackling the climate crisis are insufficient, and speakers called on the state to take a more aggressive approach.
Representatives of large organizations such as the Rainbow Movement, Greenpeace or the Green Party participated in the event, as well as smaller local associations.
"For example, we have people here who have been speaking out against expansion at the Turów mine for a long time, there are people here who are speaking out against gravel-sand mining at the Uherský Ostroh, there are people here who are speaking out against the construction of meaningless dams," said Marika Volfová, speaking for the organizers.
She said that the main demands of the protesters are the creation of a plan to retain water in the landscape, a radical change in agricultural policy and subsidy system to promote sustainable agriculture, and the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources as soon as possible.
"The government is supposed to defend the interests of the people, not a ruthless and devastating business," she said.
A stall with a petition calling on representatives of the Czech state to work for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the restoration of the Czech soil and landscape was set up on Malostranské náměstí.
The people present were equipped with banners with slogans such as "End of Depression from Rapeseed" or "Less Coal, More Newts."
Jan Škoda from the association Za vody pro lidi, which is protesting against the gravel-sand mining plan in Hodonínsko, came to Prague from southern Moravia.
"It threatens the source of drinking water for 140,000 people," he said.
He added that the wells represent the fifth most abundant source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
According to him, the planned gravel-sand mining is located only about 500 meters from the wells and according to the assessments it is certain that the quality of the water will be endangered.
Vojtěch Veselý came from the village of Valeč in Karlovy Vary for the so-called agro-ecological farmers.
He drew attention to the merits of small farms that do not chase yields and profits and supply the inhabitants directly on the spot.
"Small agro-ecological farms are able to feed the whole population completely normally, on top of that they do not cause such destruction on the shape of the countryside and the environment," he said.
Three people die as plane crashes on house in Germany
Three people died and two others were injured when an ultralight plane crashed on an apartment building in western Germany today.
Local emergency services reported that two crew members and one occupant of the house are believed to be among the dead.
The plane crashed on the roof of a building in the town of Wesel in North Rhine-Westphalia.
A fire subsequently engulfed the penthouse, which was one of five apartment units in the house.
Firefighters have already managed to get the flames under control.
Robert Meyboom, the deputy chief of the local fire department, said that both crew members of the plane were believed to have died.
The third victim, according to police, is a woman who lived in the house.
The Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ), citing the mayor of Wesel, reported that she was a single mother whose two-year-old daughter was rescued from the apartment with minor injuries.
An emergency parachute was found near the accident, which apparently served as a brake during landing.
Police assume that it came from the crashed plane.
There was room for two people in the plane.
The plane took off from the airport in the nearby town of Marl.
The Rheinische Post, citing eyewitnesses, reported that the plane collided with a hot-air balloon before it crashed.
However, this information has not yet been confirmed.
WAZ, citing other witnesses, wrote that the plane disintegrated in mid-air before hitting the ground.
Česká spořitelna erroneously charged some card payments twice on Saturday.
The error has already been corrected
Česká spořitelna erroneously charged its clients some card payments twice on Saturday afternoon.
According to bank spokesman Lukáš Kropík, the problem could have involved thousands of transactions.
The error has already been corrected by the bank and the money returned to the clients.
The problems with double billing of card payments were noted by the bank on Saturday afternoon.
"As recently as yesterday (Saturday) night, we updated the system and immediately returned all these double payments to the clients.
At the moment, everything is working smoothly," Kropík told the bank on Sunday afternoon.
The exact number of clients for whom the bank deducted money from card payments twice is unknown to the bank spokesman, who estimates it was a lower number of thousands of transactions.
The causes of the problems are being investigated by the bank.
"It could have been a combination of several factors," said Kropík.
Česká spořitelna is the largest bank in the Czech Republic by the number of clients.
At the end of March, it had 4.6 million.
Sparkasse KölnBonn is owned by the Austrian financial group Erste Group Bank, which is a key player in the Central and Eastern European banking market.
Vojtěch will present a system of three emergency levels against the coronavirus on Monday
"The levels will be based on the strength of community dissemination at the level of regions.
We are working on this together with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics," Vojtěch told ČT.
It will be a so-called traffic light, individual regions will be marked with green, orange or red according to the risk of coronavirus occurrence.
The minister added that he will still talk to epidemiologists about the inclusion of individual regions.
He admitted that only the Moravian-Silesian region would be orange at present and Prague would be approaching it.
Individual measures for regional sanitation stations, hospitals, social facilities and employers will also feature on the map.
"We want to address this at the level of regions, because the situation in them is not uniform," said Vojtěch.
Vodník a Karolínka
When the water-sprite Jonáš and the miller's daughter Karolínka fall in love, it is not easy for them.
Jonáš is prevented from loving by his father, the rude water-sprite Hastrbuch, while Karolínka has no idea that her dear Jonáš is not a man.
Luckily there is young Libor, who will do his best to protect the whole village, and especially Karolínka, from the water-sprite villain.
So what if he plots and lies?
Especially if he can make Karolínka reject Jonáš and give preference to him, the brave Libor.
Before long, it is clear to everyone in the village who is to blame for the drowning of the pond Konvička, the spoiled flour, the fire of the mill and other mischief.
Angry villagers organize a hunt for the water-sprite, and an implacable water-sprite curse falls on Jonáš's head.
And now Konvička's soul gives advice to Karolínka!
How to soften old Hastrbuch, convince the neighbors of Jonáš's innocence, find Jonáš and free him from the curse?
The fairy-tale was filmed in September 2010 in the studios of ČT and in exteriors at the Brzina pond, in Obděnice in Sedlčansko and in the beautiful setting of the historic mill in Hoslovice.

Most of them are mild, only three percent of those infected need to go to hospital
Either a milder form of coronavirus is spreading through the Czech Republic, or a summer dose of sunshine has significantly improved our immunity.
Infectious wards of hospitals are half-empty, although the numbers of those infected are rising.
"The situation today and in April is completely different and it is mainly due to the number of hospitalized people," confirms Health Minister Adam Vojtěch.
It is worth remembering that on April 11, when the first wave of the epidemic peaked in our country, everyone wore masks, the army took samples, the republic was closed and the Czechs used disinfectant for the year ahead.
Nevertheless, ten people were dying every day.
Now the daily increases in the number of infected are higher, but every day with covid-19, a maximum of two people die.
Karvinsko still has the highest number of infected per population, similar numbers already have Jihlava due to an outbreak at the local Alzheimer centre, where there are already 57 infected - 40 clients and 17 employees.
Another home for the elderly has been closed by the sanitation department in Černozice in the Hradec Králové region.
Tests in one of the nurses confirmed the disease.
"We are tracing, we have reduced movement, we have all the hygiene measures," says Martin Scháněl, the director of the nursing home.
According to him, none of the home's clients have symptoms of the disease yet.
Health officials will start the blanket testing tomorrow and then decide on further measures.
Hospitals are also responding to the increased number of infections.
The Oncological Institute in Brno today launched an automatic camera system at the entrance, which can tell if people are wearing a mask when entering.
The record is reported by South Bohemian health officials, who recorded twenty-five cases of coronavirus - most of them foreign employees of the powder company.
Overall, there were 131 infections on Saturday - half of Friday's number - but there are fewer tests at the weekend.
Debutant champion!
Van den Bergh finishes fairy tale, Anderson gets swept away
The big surprise of the tournament by the name of Dimitri van den Bergh produced an outstanding performance in the match against the player who won the second most prestigious event within the PDC in 2018.
The opening match was a two-way tie, the break coming at 8:7 for the Belgian darter.
Van den Bergh took a break with a 13-dart lego and has had the upper hand ever since.
He was literally crushing his opponent with his game and the much more experienced "Flying Scot" had a hard time getting to the doubles.
The way in which the "Dream Maker" had him in the grip is also evidenced by the fact that a flustered Anderson played his first best only in the 24th lego.
In addition, the young Belgian managed brilliantly high checkouts.
The last time he lost was in the 11th lego, but he "caught a big fish" in an unfavourable state and closed with a 170.
At the end of the match Anderson showed great frustration.
Rather, he just threw the darts and his behind-the-triumph opponent performed perfectly well.
Van den Bergh converted the first of three match darts and lived up to his name - he wrote his big dream.
Winning the trophy named after Phil Taylor is all the more valuable for the Belgian dart player because it is his first major win.
It remains the case that the last player who managed to beat van den Bergh is Karel Sedláček.
Charges dropped in Nantes over cathedral fire, man confesses
St Peter and Paul's Cathedral in the heart of Nantes caught fire last Saturday and the fire severely damaged the original 16th-century stained glass windows and destroyed the organ.
The suspicion of arson was being investigated by investigators because the fire was moving through the temple from three different locations.
At the same time, police found no sign of forced entry into the cathedral.
The accused is a volunteer with the local diocese, a 39-year-old Rwandan refugee.
Police arrested him shortly after the fire, but released him without prosecution.
Now the prosecution has informed that based on new evidence, the man was arrested again on Saturday, confessed and faces arson charges.
If found guilty, he faces up to ten years in prison and a heavy fine.
According to his lawyer, the man regrets the crime and has decided to cooperate fully with the investigators, Le Monde reported.
Vojtěch: On Monday, we will present a "traffic light" for epidemiological measures
The new system is intended to fulfil the role of a pandemic plan, the absence of which is facing criticism from the government and the Ministry of Health.
"Degrees will be according to the strength of the community spread," explained the minister.
He added that at present, for example, the Moravian-Silesian Region or Prague would reach a medium, orange level.
The system is designed as a regional one, because the situation in the individual regions varies significantly, he added.
On the system, the ministry cooperated with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (IHIS).
According to the minister, specific measures will be linked to the individual levels, whether it concerns the obligation to wear masks or the organization of special departments in hospitals.
Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) called for the creation of an epidemiological plan on Prima Partie television, according to which people should have clear information about what measures they can expect if the epidemiological situation worsens.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has been growing in recent days, although the number of hospitalized people remains low.
Vojtěch commented that nothing major is happening, there is no need to talk about declaring an emergency or re-convening an emergency staff.
In view of the increasing number of infected since Saturday, the government has again introduced the obligation to wear masks at internal events for over 100 people throughout the Czech Republic.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be limited to 500 people, now it amounts to 1,000 people.
The government's approach, when it was not clear until the last moment what measures and when they would start to apply or when they would be announced, has received criticism.
"I think that in a situation that is quite tense, the main actors should create a sense of security and straighten out the confusion," Senator Marek Hilšer said in Questions.
Measures can already vary by region, for example, in Prague from Sunday, the obligation to wear masks also applies in non-residential health facilities, i.e. pharmacies or waiting rooms at the doctor's office.
The obligation to wear masks when visiting health and social facilities or pharmacies has also been introduced in the Liberec and Ústí Region since Friday.
In Vysočina na na Jihlavsku it is necessary to wear masks in indoor public spaces, in public transport and in health facilities since 14 July.
In the Moravian-Silesian Region, on the other hand, anti-epidemic measures have been relaxed, as well as in the Central Bohemian Region in Kutnohorsko.
At the beginning of June, the Czech government also approved the so-called traffic light for Europe, which differentiates in colour the level of risk of infection in individual European countries and adjusts the rules applicable to entry into the Czech Republic from these countries accordingly.
For low and medium risk countries, the authorities have not required Czech citizens to have a negative test for the coronavirus since 15 June or have not ordered quarantine instead.
These are mandatory when Czechs return from high risk countries.
At the moment, all EU member countries are now in the low risk category.
Technoparty continues in Benešov region.
Plays at one-third capacity, should have ended at noon
Hlaváčkova Lhota (Benešov region) Technoparty continues in Hlaváčkova Lhota in Benešov region on Sunday evening.
A third of the original 12 music systems still play.
According to evening estimates by the police about 500 people remain here after 20:00, the initial rough estimates were about three hundred, in the morning there were about 900, said police spokesperson Lucie Nováková.
Originally, the technoparty was supposed to end at noon on Sunday, at which time part of the music systems actually ceased.
"Some have already left and others are preparing to leave.
The music production is still partially ongoing.
We expect that the disconnection and dismantling of the music systems will gradually take place," said Nováková.
"Police officers are still consistently checking departing visitors in order to prevent drivers from driving under the influence of alcohol or addictive substances.
Drivers have the opportunity to undergo a preventive breath test before leaving," she added.
Dozens of riot police are supervising the event, foreign police, traffic and riot police are on the scene, and dog handlers with service dogs are also on standby.
"During the day, officers checked 470 people moving in the event venue and 485 vehicles, 270 drivers were subjected to a breath test, six of whom got behind the wheel under the influence of alcohol," Nováková said.
A total of 95 drivers were tested by police for the presence of narcotic and psychotropic substances, one of which was positive.
Officers also dealt with 14 traffic offences.
At the request of techno party participants, officers conducted 300 preventive breath tests and four preventive tests for the presence of narcotic and psychotropic substances.
About 2,000 people were at the event on Saturday morning.
If the number of participants had not decreased, police would have intervened there.
Czech Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) told the Prima Partie television program.
However, the number of participants decreased below 1,000, so the police assessed that the intervention was not needed, and neither did the sanitation station or the Ministry of Health ask for it.
Czech Television (ČT) reported on Sunday that the techno-party extended to the surrounding land, whose owners did not agree with the use for the techno-party.
It is possible that the owners of the surrounding land will demand compensation for damages.
Supporters of techno came to the meadow near Hlaváček's Lhota on Friday evening.
Police originally guarded the meadow in Blažim in Benešov on Friday, where the techno-party took place last year.
Blažim is located roughly 30 kilometers from Hlaváček's Lhota, where the techno-party actually went.
According to Nováková, no one came to Blažim.
Viper bite: Little girl ended up in hospital!
"The first case this year was recorded in Železnorudsko.
A viper bit a girl in her leg, class of 2010, who was brought by her parents themselves to the local emergency services base," regional emergency services spokesperson Mária Svobodová told Deník, adding that the child was then taken to a hospital in Klatovy.
Viper is the only venomous snake in the Czech Republic and it is in Šumava that these animals are found in higher numbers, so it is good to be careful when walking.
However, there is no great danger from these animals.
The chance of being bitten by a viper is not very high, it is afraid of itself during normal contact.
And if it has the space to do so, it likes to crawl away with a loud hiss.
It will only attack if it feels very threatened - for example, if you accidentally step on it.
Even its bite is not a tragedy, its venom is very effective against small mammals, but it does not kill people.
This can only happen if a person has a particularly weakened organism or suffers from allergies.
The risk of danger is therefore especially for children, seniors and allergists.
"After a bite, a person often feels nauseous, sweats, has an elevated temperature, thirst, abdominal pain and diarrhea, in weakened individuals and especially allergists can go into anaphylactic shock," Miriam Gredová from Klatovy Hospital told Deník.
The man threatened to throw the infant out of the window.
He poured wine and threw dishes at the policewoman
After 23:00, a SWAT team entered the apartment and detained the man.
The infant was immediately taken into care by paramedics, regional police spokesperson Markéta Janovská said in a press release.
The man did not want to cooperate with the police, throwing dishes, knives or pouring wine out of the window at the police negotiator.
He amplified his threats several times during the negotiation by leaning out of the window with the child in his arms.
Once he even climbed on the windowsill himself, where he staggered.
The police are continuing to investigate the man.
They do not want to disclose further information yet.
Stosur prefers daughter to tennis season
Australian tennis player Samantha Stosur will not play in the coronavirus-affected season again this year.
The 36-year-old 2011 US Open champion, who became a mother in June, but does not want to finish her career just yet.
She plans to return to the courts next year and believes she will enjoy tennis even more than before thanks to her family and daughter.
Stosur announced on social media two weeks ago that her partner Liz Astling had given birth to her daughter Genevieve in mid-June.
"I'm going to stay home, spend time with my family, be around all the little milestones our Evie will experience in the next six months and just enjoy it," the former world number one doubles player posted on the Australian Federation's website.
The WTA Tour will resume its interrupted season on August 3 with a clay tournament in Palermo starting in March.
Sapa market: Raid reveals meat, fish and eggs of unknown origin
"One of the vehicles entering the area was transporting 1320 pieces of quail eggs of unknown origin, in unsuitable conditions.
Also these eggs will be disposed of at the rendering plant," said the State Veterinary Administration.
During the inspection of the live fish stall, it was then discovered that the vendor did not have documents of origin of the goods and was not registered for the sale of live fish.
The market has long been considered a problem from a veterinary point of view.
For example, last autumn, veterinarians discovered an illegal food shop, containing almost half a tonne of unmarked food without documents of origin.
For most of them, the expiry date could not be determined, some of the products had expired and were spoiled.
For five kilograms of cuttlefish, the expiry date was exceeded by three years.
Last May, veterinarians and police officers seized 80 kilograms of food without documents of origin, including dried fish, squid or frozen duck, in the area of the market, some of which was mouldy.
Putin on the phone with Zelensky ahead of Donbass ceasefire, Kremlin criticizes planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke on the phone with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky about the situation in Donbass, where a new ceasefire is to take effect from midnight.
Putin, according to the Kremlin statement, criticized, among other things, the decision of the Ukrainian parliament to hold local elections; Kiev reported that Zelensky called for the release of the detained Ukrainians.
A new ceasefire was agreed on Wednesday evening by the negotiators of Ukraine and Russia, supported by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
The ceasefire is to begin after midnight on Monday night, is to be "complete and universal" and is to open the way for fulfilling other provisions of the peace agreements.
In the interview, Putin told Zelensky that the decision of the Ukrainian parliament to hold local elections contradicts the Minsk peace agreement and threatens the prospects for a settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
The Ukrainian parliament decided last week that the forthcoming local council elections will not take place in territories controlled by pro-Russian rebels.
The Minsk agreement foresees that Kiev will regain control of the border of Ukrainian territories occupied by separatists with Russia after giving these regions wide autonomy and holding local elections there.
According to Unian, Zelensky's office said that the two statesmen agreed on the benefits of the upcoming ceasefire in Donbass as well as on the need to implement other measures to support peace in the region, such as de-mining areas of fighting or withdrawing part of the troops from the front.
Zelensky also called on Putin to release Ukrainians detained in eastern Ukraine, the occupied Crimea peninsula and Russia itself.
The Minsk agreement has helped to stop the fighting, but people continue to die in occasional firefights and artillery attacks on both sides of the front.
The conflict in Donbass has resulted in over 14,000 deaths since spring 2014.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of military support for the separatists, which Moscow denies.
Zelensky has made ending the war in Donbass his priority, but no major breakthrough in negotiations has yet taken place.
Rykl is the unexpected decathlon champion, Novotná dominated the heptathlon
Defending champion of the last two titles Doležal did not finish the 400 at the end of Saturday's program, Kopecký did not jump the pole on Sunday.
The decathlon was long ruled by Latvian representative Reinis Kregers, who is preparing in the group of coach Josef Karas, but he withdrew after the discus.
Rykl had two bronze medals from the outdoor Czech Championship so far, this time he was the only decathlete who made it past the 7,000 mark.
Other medals behind him were won by Vilém Stráský and Petr Urbánek.
Rykl recalled the absence of Adam Sebastian Helcelet and Jiří Sýkora after the competition.
"It's a pity that the boys weren't here and Kope didn't start, because then the results would have looked completely different.
But the title tastes very good, I especially appreciate the fact that I took a person by 30 centimetres in the distance.
Then I was even more pleased with the pole and the most disappointing thing was probably the disc, where I was below average," he acknowledged on the union facebook.
Kateřina Cachová won the first day of the heptathlon with more than 100 points, despite suffering from an injured ankle on the rebound leg.
In the distance sector, however, she then registered only 570 cm, did not throw 40 meters with a javelin and did not enter the final eight hundred.
Novotná collected 5878 points and won by 241 points ahead of Kateřina Dvořáková.
She came out mainly in the distance, 631 cm is the best Czech performance of the year.
"I really wanted it to be around the 630.
Yesterday my calf started to pull, but I'm really glad that I didn't feel it at all and that it didn't limit me at all," Novotná said on the union facebook.
Bio LPG arrives in the Czech Republic, promises ecological operation
Liquefied petroleum gas, abbreviated as LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas), is a very well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
It is especially popular for its substantially lower price compared to petrol or diesel, due to a significantly lower excise tax, but its benefit is also in lower CO2 emissions per kilometre driven.
Like petrol and diesel, it also has its environmentally friendly variant - "bio LPG".
But it is quite new - it first appeared on the European market two years ago and arrived in the Czech Republic a few days ago, according to a press release from the Czech LPG Association.
"In these days we have received the first fifteen tonnes of bio LPG, which will be distributed in a mixture with classic fossil LPG to our petrol stations," the association quotes Jiří Karlík from Primagas.
However, bio LPG cannot be taken as bioethanol or biodiesel.
According to the association, it is chemically identical to classic petroleum LPG, which many motorists are refueling in their cars now.
Therefore, it is also possible to mix both versions freely.
"The only difference compared to classic LPG is the way of production," says Ivan Indráček, chairman of the association, about bio LPG.
This is also said to be one of the great advantages of bio LPG over other alternative fuels.
It can be easily transported and stored, and the distribution infrastructure is also relatively good, e.g. compared to hydrogen or electricity.
Currently, this gas is obtained as a by-product in the production of bioethanol from food and sugar cane residues.
In the future, it should also be produced in a targeted way, e.g. from cellulosic biomass, i.e. from wood waste.
In contrast, classic petroleum LPG is produced partly as a by-product in the refining of oil, partly by separation in the extraction of natural gas.
As a result, depending on the production technology and the source, the operation of a car on bio LPG is 40-70% more environmentally friendly in terms of carbon footprint than the operation on petroleum LPG, and up to 90% compared to diesel.
But it is not about CO2 emissions from the exhaust of the car, but about the ecology of fuel production, i.e. the so-called "well-to-tank" part.
Some of the largest producers of bio LPG currently include the petrochemical companies Eni, Total and Neste.
According to a recent update of the National Clean Mobility Action Plan (NAP CM), Unipetrol is also investigating the possibility of production at its Lithuanian refinery.
According to estimates by the association, there are about 170,000 LPG vehicles in the Czech Republic; the Ministry of the Environment mentions a slightly higher number in the NAP CM, about 200,000.
According to statistics from the Ministry of Transport, almost 6,000 LPG-powered car conversions were carried out last year alone.
It is possible to refuel LPG in the Czech Republic at about 950 stations of various operators.
Vojtěch revises numbers of infected, number drops by 1775 cases
Health Minister Adam Vojtěch (for ANO) ordered the Ministry to revise the numbers of infected with the coronavirus.
The new statistics were published by the Ministry of Health on its website on Sunday.
On Sunday afternoon, the number dropped from Saturday's 5254 to 3479 cases, which is by 1775 fewer infected.
At present, therefore, there are 3422 patients in the Czech Republic.
"Behind the jump in the number of cured people is a revision of the data, which health officials have not been able to update recently," said the head of health statistics, Jaroslav Dušek.
By Sunday afternoon, 15 212 people in the Czech Republic had been infected with the coronavirus, 11 419 had recovered and 371 had unfortunately succumbed to the disease Covid-19.
Mobile Election Units or Correspondence Election.
Political scientist and sociologist looking for options for the pandemic
According to Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD), a change in the law is needed to allow people in quarantine due to the coronavirus to vote in the October regional and Senate elections.
Parliament could discuss it in August or September under an accelerated regime.
He made the announcement on Sunday in Partia Tv Prima.
On Tuesday, he wants to discuss possible solutions with representatives of parliamentary parties at the ministry.
"Whatever we do, it will have to mean a change in the electoral law," Hamáček said.
On Wednesday, the Senate called on the government to find a solution within the framework of the legal rules in force.
However, the minister said that it would be necessary to modify the provision of the law according to which people in quarantine due to a medical condition cannot vote.
The ban on voting should be maintained, for example, for patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop said on the OVM program that the possibility of correspondence election has been postponed since 2004.
Even the current bill, which is in the Chamber, then envisages introducing it for voting abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
At the same time, Prokop considers the concerns of ANO or ČSSD (because according to experience from abroad it would rather benefit other types of parties) about correspondence voting to be overstated.
He personally opposes the possibility of electronic voting, where there is a considerable possibility of abuse.
Michal Klíma said that it is now necessary to invent ad hoc mechanisms (elections) that could be carried out already this year and with the least possible health risk.
He considers the main one to be ready for 2021, when parliamentary elections are to take place in the Czech Republic.
He considers correspondence voting (whether only abroad or also in the Czech Republic) to be one of the functional methods.
He sees as another the aforementioned electoral units or the possibility of proxy voting within the family.
He added that it is possible to learn how similar situations -⁠ elections at the time of the coronavirus -⁠ were handled in Croatia, Poland or France.
Due to the spread of the coronavirus disease, various types of elections in 67 countries around the world have been postponed already this year.
Protests in Bulgaria: Pig ears thrown by demonstrators at government building
Participants in a demonstration against Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov and his cabinet threw pig ears at the government building.
It was another in a series of protests against the "mafia style of governance" that have been taking place in Sofia and other cities for almost three weeks.
Organizers are planning a nationwide blockade on Wednesday, DPA reported.
Today's protest, which took place for the 18th consecutive day, had a weaker turnout than the previous one, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.
At 8 p.m. some 300 people had gathered, some streets had to be closed to traffic.
Demonstrators outside the government building staged a theatrical stunt in which they symbolically locked both Prime Minister Borisov and Attorney General Ivan Geshev in a prison cell in connection with the arrest of two aides to President Rumen Radev, who is a strong political opponent of the Prime Minister.
The resignation of both is one of the protesters' basic demands.
They also demanded the cancellation of the announced health care reform and an end to corruption in construction on the Black Sea coast.
Protest organizer Nikolai Hadjigenov said on public radio today that a "peak of escalation" is planned for Wednesday in the form of a "nationwide rally in Sofia and blockades throughout the country."
He reiterated the demand for the resignation of Borisov and his government, as well as the calling of early elections.
The regular elections should take place in March 2021.
Borisov has previously said that he does not intend to resign.
He justified this by, among other things, the need to carry Bulgaria through the covid-19 pandemic and the resulting economic crisis.
But on Friday he replaced five members of his government team, although the concession did not reassure the demonstrators.
Earlier this week, Borisov's government withstood a vote of confidence in parliament.
Bologna coach Mihajlovic no longer wants matches without spectators
Bologna football coach Siniša Mihajlovič has had enough of Italian league matches without spectators.
The Serbian coach hopes that fans will return to the stadiums from the new season.
"What we are running here at the moment is not football.
I am sick of matches without spectators.
It is sexless football, it brings me no emotion, no joy.
The matches are worse than training.
Playing like this is terrible and I think I am not the only one who thinks so," said Mihajlovič before today's match against Lecce.
After the coronavirus break, the Serie A matches follow in quick succession and even though they are played in the evening, the players are exposed to the heat.
"We play every three days in terrible heat.
In such conditions, you can't even tell how the teams are.
I wish this season would end.
The measures had to be taken to finish the competition, but I hope that by September the fans will be back," said the coach, who has also managed Fiorentina and AC Milan in the past.
For Mihailovic this season is also unusual because he missed four months on the bench due to leukemia treatment.
"Despite my illness, the league break and everything else, we managed to take our team up a level.
We want to continue to grow and for that we need the players to be mentally stronger," he said.
We Have Been Targeted by Foreign States' Cyber-Attack, Iran Says
Since the end of June, fires and explosions have been reported from a number of Iranian military, industrial and nuclear facilities, as well as oil refineries, power plants, factories and businesses.
Some Iranian officials have said that the fire that broke out in the Natanz underground nuclear facility earlier this month may have been caused by cyber sabotage.
The cause of a number of other incidents has not yet been explained.
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi told reporters, according to Iranian media, that the Islamic Republic's infrastructure faces "thousands of cyber attacks" every day.
He added that this is not a new phenomenon and that most of them will be repelled.
In recent months, Mousavi said, several wider cyber attacks have been reported, with analyses saying that "certain governments and groups" were behind them.
However, he did not provide further details on the possible perpetrators, according to Reuters.
Mousavi also added that fires in forests, refineries and other places are frequent in the summer.
An article by Iran's state-run IRNA news agency this month discussed how Iran's enemies, such as Israel and the US, may have been behind the recent incidents.
But neither country was directly accused of the specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States broke off diplomatic relations shortly after the 1979 revolution, when Iranian militant students attacked the US embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
Long-strained relations between the two countries escalated in 2018 after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers and imposed sanctions on Iran that have a severe impact on its economy.
Another significant escalation came this year after the US military killed Iranian General Qasem Soleimani and Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi Muhandis on January 3.
On January 8, Iran fired a number of missiles at bases in Iraq where the Americans are based.
The US only admitted with hindsight that dozens of US soldiers were wounded.
Israel considers Iran its arch-enemy and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is the main opponent of the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran.
According to the Israeli Prime Minister, Iran is trying to develop an atomic bomb, which Iran denies.
TPCA has extended production shutdown, now until May 25
Cologne-based Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile (TPCA) has again extended the production shutdown due to the coronavirus.
Production lines should be restarted on Monday, May 25 in the morning.
Dozens of sanitary measures will accompany the start-up, said Tomáš Paroubek, a spokesman for the car company.
Production has been stalled since the evening of March 18 due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Originally, the company intended to resume production on Monday, May 18.
The reason for the extension of the shutdown, according to Paroubek, is closed borders and closed dealerships, so there is no one to sell the cars.
According to Paroubek, the company will produce 100 percent, i.e. in two shifts, from the start.
Coronavirus-affected key markets of the company, such as Italy, the United Kingdom or Spain.
Mayor Michael Kašpar (Change for Cologne) said that the shutdown of production at TPCA does not affect life in the city.
"It was noticeable at the beginning, the city was empty.
But gradually the streets are filling up, especially now since Monday, when it has become very loose.
So the city is full," said Kaspar.
According to him, there are no complications even with the foreign workers who have stayed in the residential hotels.
"In those two months we had almost no problem to solve," said Kaspar.
For example, Škoda Auto in Mladá Boleslav, which has also suspended production due to the coronavirus crisis, resumed production on Monday 27 April at all three of its production plants in the Czech Republic.
Not one of the plants is operating at 100 percent capacity.
The resumption of production at Škoda was accompanied by more than 80 sanitary measures.
On the night of Monday to Tuesday, a third night shift was held in Mladá Boleslav and Kvasiny for the first time after the resumption of production.
The TPCA currently employs about 2,500 people and the company represents one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and also an employer in Cologne.
Cancer kills bride shortly after wedding: She leaves message for family
For more than two years, Gemma Sisson battled a vicious cancer, and just when it seemed she had beaten the cancer, the disease came back.
The 39-year-old woman, who loved bodybuilding, eventually ended up in a hospice bed, where she was still able to marry the love of her life.
Sadly, she succumbed to the disease.
A few hours after her death, a shocking message appeared on her Facebook account for those closest to her.
Gemma Sisson, from Leeds, England, loved bodybuilding.
She and her boyfriend Ricky Moore, with whom she had lived for more than 16 years, toured competitions held all over the world.
The 39-year-old woman played sports and lived healthily, yet in April 2018, she was diagnosed with cancer.
Gemma began a grueling course of treatment, radiotherapy, in the hope that she would recover.
After months of treatment, it did seem that Gemma had managed to beat the cancer, but in August 2019, the cancer returned, this time attacking her spine.
The bodybuilder and personal trainer, according to the British Daily Mirror, underwent a 10-hour spinal surgery and eventually resumed the drastic treatment.
However, it was all in vain.
Earlier this year, on her thirty-ninth birthday, doctors told her she had a few months to live.
In April, the handsome blonde finally decided to attend a hospice in Leeds, where her family visited her every so often and even arranged her wedding to her love Ricky.
The marriage lasted two months.
Ricky took Gemma to a restaurant for the last time on their two-month anniversary.
Four days later, Gemma died in his arms.
Just hours after her death, a post that Gemma had written for her family appeared on her social media account.
'If this has been made public, it means I have finally died after weeks of fighting too long.
Although I will be heartbroken to leave my loved ones behind, I will be so glad to be rid of what this terrible illness has caused me.
I can't thank Ricky enough, who has been by my side all this time and has given me a tremendous amount of love and support during this terrible time," she wrote on the social media site, saying that the pain and suffering had finally stopped and she had found peace.
"I am also grateful for all the support I have received from all of my social media followers," she wrote, saying that everyone should treasure their lives and live them to the fullest.
Automats for art sell sweat dating, mushroom amulet and memory game
For one hundred crowns, passers-by will get a pocket work by mostly beginning Czech artists.
They create pictures and other creations directly for the artmat, so they know in advance that they must fit into the size of 8.5 by 5.5 centimeters.
Each piece is numbered and signed.
"In the package there is always a curatorial text about the artist and then the work itself," said Petra Widžová, the curator of the project.
Artmat works with the principle of chance.
The buyer can thus be surprised by what artwork he will get.
Currently, he may become the new owner of fanciful illustrations by Alexandra Štoplová or mini-postcards by Tereza Bonaventurová, which can also be sent.
The artist Punx 23, in cooperation with Dora Dutková, has prepared a memory game connected with a walk through Prague.
Cards must be paired with house signs.
Ilona Polanski has created a collection of tattoos for Artmat.
Marie Ladrová and Juliána Chomová sell pocket packs of spirituality: the first of the artists offers a protective amulet made of tinderbox and fortune cards, the second a series of illustrations based on her Spiritistky comics.
Healthcare salaries will increase by a maximum of five percent next year.
A larger increase is unrealistic, according to Vojtěch
Healthcare salaries could increase by a maximum of five percent next year, said Health Minister Adam Vojtěch (for ANO) in Václav Moravec's Questions on Czech Television.
He considers the demand of trade unionists for an increase of up to 15 percent unrealistic.
He also said that the state should try to be self-sufficient in providing protective equipment.
Hospitals now have their supplies, he said.
"I think the increase (in salaries) can be somewhere up to five percent," said the minister.
According to him, it is necessary to reflect the current situation, when the coronavirus pandemic and government regulations against its spread intervened in the collection of insurance premiums from March.
Insurance companies' incomes fell at the time.
"A 15 percent increase seems unrealistic to me at the moment," said Vojtěch.
The average monthly earnings of doctors in acute inpatient care according to data from the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (IHIS) are likely to reach 88,312 crowns this year, nurses 47,498 crowns.
The difference between the salaries of nurses in state hospitals and those of other founders will be as high as CZK 7,000.
The IHIS data also show that the decline of nurses in hospitals has stopped.
The average wage in the Czech Republic was CZK 34,125 in 2019, according to data from the Czech Statistical Office.
Trade union representatives said in June that they would demand a minimum increase of ten percent for 2021, ideally 15 percent.
They criticize the long-term significant difference between the earnings of doctors and nurses in state hospitals, which have to follow pay scales, and contractual salaries in hospitals of cities, regions or private ones.
They also demand, therefore, that the pay scales be uniform for health workers.
For nurses this year, the difference will be as high as CZK 7,000 per month.
For example, for doctors, wages grew faster than salaries last year.
According to the president of the Czech Dental Chamber, Roman Šmucler, trade unionists should perceive how the state is currently doing.
The House recently approved an increase in this year's state budget deficit to a record 500 billion crowns due to the effects of the covid epidemic, of which 1.75 billion is to go towards the remuneration of health workers in hospitals and social services.
According to Šmucler, the Board of Health Care Providers does not agree with the across-the-board salary increases next year.
According to him, the remuneration should be decided by the hospitals themselves and the medical facilities, and the extra money should go to them via a reimbursement decree.
Vojtěch also said that hospitals currently have enough protective equipment.
The chairman of the Administration of State Material Reserves (SSHR), Pavel Švagr, said this week that the administration currently does not have a single protective medical device in its possession.
It is waiting for the tenders to be completed.
According to Vojtěch, suppliers in the world are now able to deliver goods better than in March, when they were bought out.
The state should also try to be as self-sufficient as possible and buy from Czech companies as well.
The scrubbing smart quarantine could be taken over by soldiers.
We are ready, they say
"The smart quarantine is working, there is something to improve of course.
We will discuss it with the army tonight.
The army is working perfectly and the question is whether they should run the whole thing again," the Prime Minister said on Sunday in his Facebook program "Hi people."
He said it was not possible to sufficiently connect IT systems and sanitation stations, which gradually have to move to more modern methods of operation.
The problems were in the Moravian-Silesian region, where there are some of the current outbreaks of the epidemic, according to the Prime Minister.
Defence Ministry spokesperson Jan Pejšek told ČTK that he did not have information about Sunday's meeting and that the government should discuss the matter on Monday.
The army is ready for this step, he says.
The smart quarantine project was taken over by the Ministry of Health on 25 May.
Until then, the smart quarantine was led by a 90-member central management team set up under the army as an advisory body to the government, led by former Deputy Minister Roman Prymula.
The grinding project was criticized by Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) on Sunday.
He, too, suggested that the army could take over again.
The government's IT and digitalization commissioner Vladimír Dzurilla, who is in charge of the project, previously admitted shortcomings in the project.
"The system works, but it's still being worked on.
For 20 years it was created independently and non-systemically, now we're trying to unify it within a few months.
It's not going at a gallop.
People on the march, poor people on the sanitation system on the march are adapting the new systems and catching up the errors," he said.
The Mayor of Ostrava, Macura, will not run again because he does not want to "go crazy in politics"
The current Mayor of Ostrava, Tomáš Macura (ANO), will not run in the next municipal elections.
The reason is to "not go crazy in politics," he told Respekt.cz.
Macura, who is also a member of the ANO movement's Bureau, has been the Mayor of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the 2018 municipal elections, the ANO candidate led by him won almost a third of the electoral votes in Ostrava.
Macura originally wanted to be in office for only four years.
"I told myself that I would last one term and with the experience of business I could turn everything around and get it back on its feet," he told Respekt.
He added that he had been persuaded to a certain extent for a second term.
"But for me it's the maximum.
I don't want to go crazy in politics," added Macura, who in an interview described himself as a heavy introvert who did not like frequent contact with people.
According to Respekt, there has been speculation about Macura's possible end in the ANO movement for some time.
The server recalls that Macura has criticized the ANO movement several times, for example for its alliance with the SPD movement or for supporting Miloš Zeman in the presidential elections.
As one of the few ANO figures, he supported Zeman's opponent Jiří Drahoš in the elections.
Macura does not plan to leave the ANO movement, which he joined in 2017.
"As long as I have the feeling that I can make a difference in the movement, that it is not a completely futile fight and that no one is interfering with me, I have no immediate motive to quit," he told Respektu.
The 56-year-old Macura graduated from the University of Economics in Prague.
Before he became Mayor of Ostrava in 2014, Macura served, among other things, as director of the pharmaceutical company Walmark.
He also sat on the bodies of other companies.
Uber will return to Brno offering transport services
Uber, a company offering transport services, will return to Brno at the end of July.
This is the result of a change in the law, Brno's transport councillor Petr Kratochvíl (ODS) said in a press statement on Thursday.
Cab drivers protested against Uber in Brno, pointing out that Uber does not meet the conditions such as a designation as a taxi or a taximeter.
However, the change in the law changed the conditions for operating regular and alternative taxis from July.
Kratochvíl has had several meetings with representatives of Uber in recent weeks.
"On the basis of these meetings, the company decided to return to Brno with its services at the end of July this year.
This step is the result of a change in the law that allows the company to legally operate.
The city has been notified of this change and we believe that the company will operate its services within the given limits," said Kratochvíl.
Uber has operated in Brno in the past.
It has been protested by taxi drivers for not marking vehicles as taxis or missing taximeters.
The court issued a preliminary injunction that banned Uber from driving in the city.
Brno initially supported taxi drivers, but Mayor Markéta Vaňková (ODS) said at the end of last year that the city would like to take steps to make Uber work in Brno.
According to later court decisions, Uber could have ridden in Brno, but the company did not take advantage of this.
It will now return on the basis of a change in the law.
Since July, it has become easier to operate a transport service ordered and paid for exclusively via mobile apps in addition to classic taxis with a flashlight and taximeter.
An overexuberant celebration in Brno: a flying chair landed a meter from a person on the sidewalk
An office chair flew from the fourth floor of an apartment building on Saturday evening in Brno and landed about a meter from the sidewalk.
A pedestrian was following him at that moment and immediately called for officers.
Immediately after arriving at the address in the western part of the city, the patrol noticed an open window with a chair still lying under it and several cans and cigarette butts beside it.
"The noise from the room on the fourth floor indicated that a rather noisy celebration was taking place inside.
The officers came out along the corridor to the apartment and asked the three young men present, aged between twenty-six and twenty-nine, for an explanation," said a spokesperson for the officers, Jakub Ghanem.
Demand to dismiss Rafaj will be discussed by Babiš with ČSSD
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO) plans to discuss with the coalition Social Democrats on Monday the demand for a proposal to dismiss the head of the Antimonopoly Office (ÚOHS), Petr Rafaj.
Rafaj has been called for by non-profit organizations at the meeting of the anti-corruption council of the government, as well as by the Ústí Region.
The Social Democrats state that an exchange at the head of the office is in order.
According to information from ČTK, Rafaj has not been invited to the Office of the Government for Monday.
His second mandate will expire in the middle of next year, according to the law he cannot be appointed for a third time.
His dismissal is in the competence of President Miloš Zeman.
In addition to the appeal by the non-profit organizations, the Prime Minister also received a letter with a similar request from the Ústí Region.
The reason is supposed to be among other things Rafaj's recent cases.
Last week, the Prime Minister refused to comment on the demand, saying that he would get acquainted with the materials and the governing parties would take "some position" on it.
He also said that he has not yet discussed the calls with the President, and he does not have a meeting with him arranged anytime soon.
According to the DOC's statement on the appeal, there is no reason, because Rafaj has not been accused of anything.
Last week, the IHNED.cz and Aktuálně.cz news servers wrote that the police were interested in Rafaj's meetings with the Governor Jiří Čunek.
The meetings were connected, among other things, with the decision-making on the competition for the controversial new Zlín hospital project worth eight billion, which Čunek is pushing hard.
Čunek admitted the meetings, saying they jointly addressed his "Senate activities."
Rafaj speaks similarly.
The Ústí Region Council called on the government to dismiss Rafaj at the end of June.
It is also asking for a reform of the office's decision-making mechanisms.
The DOC's decision-making on public contracts, according to the Deputy Governor for Transport Jaroslav Komínek, is not transparent and has signs of arbitrariness.
Last March, the police intervened at the antitrust office over a toll-collection tender.
In June this year, the Aktuálně.cz news server pointed out that Rafaj was using apartments written to the firm of the influential ČSSD backroom player Alexander Čuba.
However, a deposit of 3.5 million for an apartment in Brno was paid from Rafaj's account.
Rafaj has been the chairman of the Office for the Protection of Competition since 9 July 2009, and he appointed the former Social Democrat MP for a second term in June 2015.
In less than a year, Rafaj's second six-year mandate will expire.
The Act on the Antitrust Office states that the president may dismiss the chairman of the office on a proposal from the government.
He can be dismissed only if he has not been in office for more than six months, or if he seriously undermines the dignity of his office or the independence and impartiality of the office.
Employees collapsed in the Blansko library in the heat.
Air conditioning will help
The new technology will cost 740,000 and will be operational in the second half of August.
"It's good news for me.
With three children, we go to the library in Blansko city centre regularly.
In the warm months, however, it was practically impossible to stay there.
It was terribly hot and the air was bad.
The ventilation didn't help.
That's why I'm glad for the air conditioning," said Petr Novotný, one of Blansko's readers.
According to the director of the library, Lukáš Dlapa, the temperatures in the building often climbed to over thirty degrees.
The south wall of the building is glazed and functions as a greenhouse on sunny days.
"In addition, the sun shines into it for a large part of the day thanks to the curvature of the building.
At the same time, it's a big problem to air out the individual departments, because the windows have to be closed during the night for safety reasons.
Often, we have to reach thirty degrees since morning in the library," said Dlapa.
The worst was the study and reading room on the third floor.
And on the floor above, the exhibition rooms and the director's office.
There was also an unpleasant climate in the children's department, which is located under the roof of the building.
"Several times, librarians collapsed at work and ended up on sick leave.
The problem also regularly occurred in the culture room at lectures attended by dozens of people.
After a few minutes, it was impossible to breathe there," said Dlapa.
Originally, the city representatives wanted to make air-conditioning in all areas of the library this year.
In the end, there will be only three circuits out of five.
"Because of the limited funding, only the most problematic areas will have air-conditioning.
The study and reading room on the third floor.
Then there will be the culture room and the children's department on the floor above," said Jiří Svoboda from the Blansko Investment Department.
He added that in the first phase, the workers had installed air-conditioning in the above-mentioned areas last autumn and had modified the wiring.
It cost approximately CZK 360,000.
The Blansko Municipal Library has nearly three thousand registered readers.
Of these, there are about nine hundred within fifteen years.
Chicago prop banishes coronavirus.
Crawford gets back in the game
Not every infected athlete comes out with the truth.
Especially when it comes to NHL players, who remain silent as the grave about the players' health and make no public announcement.
One of the few to step out of the lineup was Crawford.
The 35-year-old Montreal native was only present for the first practice session, and has been absent from the lineup ever since.
"I'd like to let you all know that I tested positive for Covid-19 and that's why I've spent the last fortnight cooped up in my house," he said, revealing the reason for his absence.
Fans no longer have to worry about his health.
Crawford is ready to throw himself back into a full workload.
"It's amazing to be back.
I'm going to do everything I can to get in shape as soon as possible," he said.
The veteran goaltender won two Stanley Cups with Chicago, a solid part of the goaltending for the tenth consecutive season.
The Blackhawks face St. Louis in the preseason before facing Edmonton in the preseason.
Thousands protest against PM in Israel
Thousands of Israelis in several parts of the country protested against unemployment, corruption, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's handling of the coronavirus crisis.
The rallies took place outside Netanyahu's private villa in Caesarea, near his official residence, or in a park in Tel Aviv.
Protests have been taking place regularly in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv for weeks.
Participants are demanding the resignation of Netanyahu over the trial in which he is accused of corruption and fraud, as well as the government's handling of the next wave of the coronavirus epidemic.
"Bibi, go home," one demonstrator wrote on his banner, according to the AP, referring to Netanyahu's well-known nickname.
"Everyone can see that the emperor has lost his clothes," another read.
The 70-year-old Netanyahu is the first prime minister of Israel to be tried in office.
He is accused on three counts of corruption, fraud, and abuse of trust.
He denies all the charges, calling them a witch hunt.
According to local media, the trial may take up to three years, with over 300 witnesses called.
The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has been confirmed in nearly 60,500 people in Israel, which has a population of about nine million.
About 455 people have died in connection with the outbreak.
In March, the Israeli government imposed quarantine measures that helped reduce the daily increase in infections.
But after a gradual loosening of restrictions since late April, the numbers of infections began to rise again significantly, especially in late June.
Netanyahu's critics argue that the government has not sufficiently helped, for example, business owners affected by the quarantine measures.
Protesters are also annoyed that the government is issuing sometimes contradictory instructions to combat the coronavirus.
The driver smashed the car into a tree and was killed.
The body had to be cut out of the wreckage by firefighters
The tragic accident occurred around 11 p.m. near Neveklov on a narrow road leading from the Slap Dam.
The driver apparently flew down into the woods at no small speed and smashed the car into a tree.
He was killed at the scene.
The body had to be removed from the wreckage by firefighters, among other things cutting off the roof.
The circumstances of the crash are being examined by police officers.
They have ordered a forensic autopsy to clarify, among other things, whether the man was driving under the influence of alcohol or other addictive substances.
No more wasting and churning out one collection after another.
Pietro Filipi cancels discounts and bets on sustainability
The Czech clothing brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and is embarking on a fundamental change in strategy.
It cancels discounts and no longer wants to churn out one collection after another.
The fact that the fashion industry is among the biggest polluters of the environment is not news.
Billions of items of clothing end up in incinerators and landfills every year.
However, the view of slow fashion, the often despised approach to dressing, has changed quite quickly in recent years.
Approximately half of Pietro Filipi's goods were sold at full price.
The other half, which was sold thanks to discounts, is not so easy to buy.
The company does not want to churn out one collection after another and at the end of each season to discount products below their production price.
Moreover, according to the owner Michal Mička, the time of new and old collections and the blind following of rapidly changing fashion trends is over.
"Most retailers already count on discounts when buying goods, so a much higher margin is included in the full price.
So it's actually a bit of a fraud," says Pietro Filipi owner Michal Mička.
In addition, the company wants to support local business with its approach.
"Each of our products is made of carefully selected quality fabrics and designed by local designers.
We place emphasis on the fact that a large part of our collection is made up of so-called basic pieces - i.e. clothes that are timeless and over-seasonal.
Globally, the segment of premium brands is typical of the absence of any discounts, the price of the product simply corresponds to its quality and there is no need for a discount," adds Mička.
Giant graffiti depicts RAF airman Kurt Taussig
"The assignment was to create something for the anniversary of the end of the war.
And I remembered our fighter pilot, who fought in the ranks of the British Royal Air Force in the Second World War.
The city leadership liked the design," said Vacek, who finished his work after a fortnight of intensive work.
He used about 300 litres of paint and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplice-Shanov.
He left the city when he was 15 years old.
During the war, because of his Jewish background, the Nazis dragged him to an internment camp, where he was held for several weeks.
However, he and his brother managed to avoid the concentration camp thanks to the organization of Nicholas Winton.
In 1939, Taussig made it to Great Britain, where he volunteered for the Royal Air Force (RAF), and eventually received pilot training in African Southern Rhodesia and Palestine.
He became involved in combat operations in early 1945.
After the Velvet Revolution, he visited the Czech Republic and his native Teplice several times, which granted him honorary citizenship.
The 46-year-old Kamil Vacek, known to people in the field of street graphic art as Camo, has been working with spray paint in the streets of Teplice for over 20 years.
He started with graffiti on areas set aside for this purpose by then-Mayor Jaroslav Kubera (ODS).
Storm Hanna reaches Texas coast
Hurricane Hanna reached the southwest coast of the U.S. state of Texas on Saturday afternoon, local time (before midnight GMT last night).
It hit Padre Island, Texas, about 24 kilometers north of the town of Port Mansfield, weakening to a tropical storm as it moved over land.
However, according to meteorologists, it still poses a major threat to coastal residents.
It has brought strong winds and heavy rainfall; along with local flooding, power outages and various material damage are reported, including damaged boats, according to the AP.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott already declared a state of natural disaster for 32 counties in southwestern Texas on Saturday and advised people to evacuate voluntarily.
The strongest warnings were received by people from the coastal strip between Port Mansfield and Mesquite Bay, but in total the storm is expected to hit an area of nearly 500 kilometers before moving gradually over northeastern Mexico.
"Although Hanna is now a tropical storm, heavy rain and winds, rising levels, dangerous surf and isolated tornadoes may pose a threat," warned the US National Hurricane Center (NHC).
This morning, local time (GMT afternoon), the storm was moving along the US-Mexico border, accompanied by winds of 85 kilometers per hour.
Hanna became the first hurricane of this year's Atlantic hurricane season on Saturday.
Winds of up to 145 kilometers per hour were accompanied by winds over the Gulf of Mexico, but gradually weakened to 112 kilometers per hour as it made landfall, once again removing Hanna from the hurricane category.
Authorities urged local residents to wait out the storm at home, not forgetting sanitary measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
Texas is one of the US states most affected by the covid-19 pandemic.
With existing security measures and the need to keep a distance, potential evacuations are also a major challenge.
Temporary shelters have been opened in hotels, schools, and gyms.
In Hidalgo County, Texas, one of the buildings has also been adapted as a shelter for evacuees who tested positive for the coronavirus or were otherwise exposed to the disease.
Local authorities have urged all evacuees to bring masks and disinfectant gels to the shelter if possible.
"It's not even close to being over yet.
We're expecting catastrophic flooding," the AP quoted Chris Birchfield, who works for the National Weather Service (NWS) service in Brownsville, as saying.
Forecasts say some places could get as much as 300 millimeters of rain in a few hours, in some cases close to 500 millimeters, which, together with sea level surges, could flood a number of coastal communities.
Zeman to bestow general's rank on Colonel Lipka
President Miloš Zeman will bestow the general's rank on Colonel Pavel Lipka on Wednesday.
This follows from an overview of the expected events of the Ministry of Defence.
The reason for bestowing the rank of brigadier general is the August arrival of Lipka as deputy commander of the Alliance Multinational North-East Division in Poland.
Lipka still serves as deputy commander of the Czech Army's ground forces.
Promotion to Zeman was proposed by the government at the end of June.
Lipka will replace brigadier general Karel Řehka as deputy commander of the Multinational North-East Division in Elblag, Poland, which commands units of the Alliance Forward Presence on the territory of Poland and the Baltics, from the beginning of August.
Řehka became director of the National Office for Cyber and Information Security (NÚKIB) in March.
The government proposed to the president that he bestow the rank of brigadier general on Lipka.
According to the Act on Professional Soldiers, a higher rank can be granted to a soldier for the period of performance of an elected office or for the period of performance of a service task that requires the granting of a higher rank.
The post of Deputy Commander of the Allied Division corresponds to the rank of General.
A soldier who has been granted the rank has the same rights and obligations as if he had been appointed to that rank.
However, he is not entitled to an adjustment of the salary that would correspond to that rank.
The granting of the rank lasts until the reason for which it was granted ceases to exist.
"Colonel Lipka demonstrates high professional readiness and is a model for subordinates.
He is significantly involved in the fulfilment of tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic, including cooperation with foreign partners and ensuring the participation of the army in foreign operations," the Ministry of Defence said in June on the proposal for promotion.
Wednesday's promotion will take place at 12:30 at Prague Castle, attended by Minister of Defence Lubomír Metnar or Chief of General Staff Aleš Opata.
EU countries have coronavirus standards for aviation
European Union countries have agreed on common hygiene standards for air travel to help limit the spread of the new coronavirus.
German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer made the announcement.
The standards agreed include keeping a distance or wearing masks on planes and at airports, but the middle seats on planes will not have to remain unoccupied.
Reuters reported.
"I am pleased that my colleagues have accepted the German proposal for Europe and that we have been able to agree on these uniform standards," Scheuer said at the European Aviation Conference.
The German Transport Ministry added that the agreement had been concluded by officials and that it had yet to be formally approved by ministers.
The measures agreed include a requirement to cover the mouth and nose for passengers from the age of six, a requirement to keep a recommended distance during security checks and check-in at airports.
Enough fresh air must also be guaranteed on planes, and all information must be available in several languages.
Airlines will also be able to fill the middle seats.
The common regulations agreed upon by officials meet at least some of the airline's requirements.
Different standards have caused confusion.
Arctic Spitsbergen set a temperature record, measuring almost 22 degrees
"Longyearbyen set a 41-year-old record," the Norwegian Meteorological Institute said on Twitter.
By early evening, the temperature had risen to 21.7 degrees Celsius, 0.4 degrees above the 1979 record, it added.
The roughly 2,000-strong Longyearbyen is the largest city on Spitsbergen, located about 1,300 kilometres from the North Pole.
Spitsbergen heats up faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This highlights the dangers of warming in other parts of the Arctic - from Alaska to Siberia, according to a report last year by the Norwegian Center for Climate Study.
The average temperature on Spitsbergen has risen by three to five degrees since the 1970s, he said.
It may even rise by ten degrees by 2100, if greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere are not reduced.
Temperature rises on Svalbard can melt permanently frozen soil, threatening the stability of many buildings, roads or airports, and may cause more avalanches and landslides.
Warming climate also threatens Arctic fauna, such as polar bears or seals, which depend on the ocean's ice cover.
Britons returning from Spain face mandatory two-week quarantine
The British cabinet has also urged citizens to avoid all unnecessary travel to mainland Spain due to the risk of spreading covid-19.
The Canary and Balearic Islands are therefore not mentioned, but even after returning from them, people have to go into isolation for two weeks.
The new rules come into force at midnight.
"Protecting public health is our absolute priority.
We have taken this decision to prevent the possible spread of the virus in Britain," British diplomacy said in its statement.
"We have always made it clear that we will immediately remove a country from the safe list if needed," it added.
As the British newspaper Metro noted, the latest announcement will hit the travel plans of thousands of Britons.
Spain is one of the most popular holiday destinations.
Among other things, Britons are concerned about whether they will be paid sick pay if they have to go into isolation for 14 days after returning from holidays.
For example, Neil Hunter from Sittingbourne has booked a ten-day holiday to Lanzarote, leaving on Tuesday.
The trip has been booked since December.
"We were supposed to go the whole family, my wife Amanda and daughter Bethany, but to be honest, after this announcement I don't know what will happen.
I work as an engineer and I don't think my employer will accept that I will be quarantined for two weeks after returning from holiday," Metro quoted Hunter as saying.
Concerning Spain, there are fears that the country is at the beginning of the second wave of the epidemic.
Over 900 new infections have been added there every 24 hours in the last two days.
Authorities are already tightening coronavirus measures in some areas, for example Catalonia is trying to limit all night life and prevent people from gathering in large numbers.
The Czech Foreign Ministry has newly drawn attention to the increased risk of infection in Catalonia, Aragon, the Basque Country and the Madrid region.
Dukovany power purchase model to be discussed by the government
The government will discuss on Monday the model for the purchase of electricity from the planned new Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant unit.
The bill foresees that if the purchase price is higher than the price of power electricity on the market, the difference will be paid by all consumers through tariffs.
In the second case, if the purchase price is lower than the price on the market, the impact on consumers will be the opposite.
Power electricity is an unregulated part of the final price of electricity for customers.
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry Karel Havlíček (for ANO) as well as the energy company ČEZ have previously stated that the more likely option is that people will save on electricity thanks to the construction.
Analysts, on the other hand, point out that the long-term outlook for electricity prices on the markets is always uncertain, which has been shown several times in the past.
The intention has been criticized by environmental organizations before.
"The purchase price can be both below and above the market price of power electricity.
The final impact at the time of application of the rule can thus be both negative and positive.
The impact will be distributed among customers according to the size of the circuit breaker - at lower consumption or electricity consumption - at higher consumption of electricity," the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MPO) said in the material materials.
Havlíček said in May that he anticipates that the wholesale price of electricity will rise and people on the Dukovan construction will make a profit.
Otherwise, the impact will be in the tens of crowns per year per family, which he says is far less than people pay annually in electricity invoices to support so-called supported sources.
He has previously estimated that the purchase price could be between 50 and 60 euros (about 1320 to 1600 CZK) per megawatt hour (MWh).
The submitted material does not contain any proposal for the amount, it is to be included in the purchase contract.
The price of electricity on the Prague Energy Exchange for 2021, for which traders will now stock the most, is currently around 45 euros (about 1190 CZK) per MWh.
"With a difference between the purchase price and the market price of power electricity of ten euros, the supplement could amount to an average household with consumption of 3.3 MWh per year - it can correspond to a household of four, equipped with electrical appliances, including an electric hob and oven, but which does not use electricity for heating and hot water heating - less than 100 CZK/year," the MIT wrote in its government documents.
"We are living in extremely turbulent times.
The coronavirus pandemic has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term prediction of market prices to be a speculative matter," Tomáš Voltr, executive director of the Energy financial group investment group, told the Czech News Agency earlier.
The proposed law envisages that the purchase would be carried out by the MIT, or by a legal entity authorised by it, owned by the state, at a predetermined price.
A contract between the investor and the state, guaranteeing the conditions for the purchase of electricity, would be concluded for a minimum of 30 years, with a possible extension of ten years, even repeated, but at the latest until the operation of low-carbon production is terminated.
The proposal defines a low-carbon production plant as an electricity production plant with a nuclear reactor connected to the electricity system with an installed capacity of at least 100 megawatts (MW) after 2030.
Havlíček previously stated that the new Dukovany unit should have an output of 1,200 MW and produce nine terawatt-hours of electricity annually, which would correspond to a tenth of the expected Czech consumption.
The unit should be put into operation in 2036.
The financing model for the new Dukovany unit was approved by the government on Monday.
The state should finance the facility interest-free when it is built, while operating it is expected to incur 2% interest.
The opposition disagrees with the financing model, and is also concerned about the possibility that Russian or Chinese companies would build Dukovany.
The state should participate in the construction 70%.
The rest should be paid by ČEZ, which will also cover all possible additional costs.
ČEZ CEO Daniel Beneš told ČTK in May that the expected sum for the construction of the block at current prices is about six billion euros (approximately 162 billion crowns).
Contracts between the state and ČEZ for the construction of the new Dukovany block will be signed on Tuesday.
The Ministry of Regional Development withdrew two billion crowns of material on tourism support in the media
The Ministry of Regional Development (MMR) planned to spend two billion crowns on advertisements for holidays in the Czech Republic in the media, on the internet and on billboards, the office withdrew the material from the comment procedure.
Minister Klára Dostálová (for ANO) told the server SeznamZprávy.cz that the material is still being worked on.
The document in eKlep (the electronic library of the legislative process) was pointed out by the server Zdopravy.cz on Friday.
The Ministry justified the plan by the fall in tourism due to the coronavirus.
During the coronavirus crisis, the media also experienced a drop in revenue.
The proposal drew criticism from the opposition and from tourism representatives.
According to the proposal, which is now available on the website hlidacstatu.cz, the MMR planned to give money through the state tourism support agency CzechTourism to advertise in television, radio, press, on the internet, billboards or areas in railway stations.
The largest part of the money, namely CZK 700 million, would go to television stations.
Most of it would go to private TV stations Nova and Prima.
Printed dailies and weeklies would receive CZK 400 million and the same part would go to the MMR for PR articles, advertising banners and videos on websites.
Radio stations would receive CZK 350 million for the media campaign, most of it again to private stations.
The remaining CZK 150 million would be used for outdoor advertisements on billboards, LED screens and areas in railway stations or in the metro.
The campaign to promote tourism in the Czech Republic was to start in mid-August and last a year.
"The material is still being worked on, it is certainly not in the form that should be presented yet," Dostálová told news server SeznamZprávy without further details.
The material was criticized by the opposition, according to TOP 09 head Markéta Pekarová Adamová, the media would benefit from the advertising from the trust funds of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO).
"I firmly believe that this ostentatious disdain will get a punch in the eye at the elections in the autumn," she wrote on twitter.
Dostálová rejects that it is really about helping the media hit by the crisis.
"It can also be a coincidence, I don't know anything about supporting the media," she told Deník N on Friday.
According to her, the budget of two billion is indicative.
"Of course, we are still counting it, it can be less or more.
It is a working material," she added.
The Save Tourism initiative does not make sense for a media campaign to support domestic tourism.
"We want two billion for companies in the tourism industry, not an unnecessary advertising campaign," the chairman of the initiative, Tomáš Barčík, told the daily on Sunday.
If the two billion crowns are in the state budget, they should be directed to companies, not the media, the initiative writes in an open letter to the government.
The broth of life, the rooster of beers and death as a blade of grass
The posthumous is also the third album titled A Death is a blade of grass by the Brno poet, tireless organizer of cultural activities and publisher Jaroslav Erik Frič, who also left a year ago, on May 24.
In Frič's discography it is the fifth item and, like previous titles, the main emphasis here is on Frič's poetry, of which he is himself an excellent performer.
Frič, 1949, was understandably influenced by the American beat generation, but he passed this inspiration through his own, personalised experiences and also through very visceral expressions of faith.
He was, however, far from any agitation, when he spoke or wrote about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, non-aggressive, totally tolerant.
I can think of Bohuslav Reynek in that context (in contrast to Jan Zahradníček, for example), masters forgive.
Frič's album offers recordings of the author's reading from 2006, but also performances with musicians who have always accompanied him very sensitively, whether it was the cellist Josef Klíč, or Honza Bartoň and Vítězslav Holata.
I will help myself - gladly - with the words of the Ostrava poet Petr Hruška about Frič's long poetic compositions.
"They radiated a proud and endless bitterness," writes Hruška, "over the state of our world threatened by extinction.
The world, which is sinking more and more into numb consumerist futility and avarice, is moving further and further away from what its soul was made of - the mystery of faith, humility and human closeness.
There was the sadness of one who knows that few people are interested in the values for which he was created, but who also knows that they cannot be renounced just because of general disinterest.
The poems reminded us that one may have to lose everything expensive, but it is not immaterial how one loses it.
If one sells himself to general decadence, he resigns sceptically, shuts up fearfully, or remains until the last moment in a calm and proud insistence on what he believes and loves."
Paroubek is not my adviser, said Hamáček
Former Prime Minister and ČSSD leader Jiří Paroubek is not a paid adviser to the Social Democrats.
Party chairman and Interior Minister Jan Hamáček only communicates with him and reads his opinions and articles.
Hamáček said this on the Prima Partie television program today.
News server SeznamZprávy.cz reported on Friday that Paroubek should be Hamáček's adviser.
"From time to time we write a text, he sends me some material from time to time and I read it," Hamáček said today.
He added that, however, it is not an official and paid cooperation.
ČSSD, he said, does not have the resources to waste them for similar purposes.
"The fact that I read his opinion from time to time, there are a lot of such people," he said.
In a subsequent discussion with ODS deputy Jana Černochová, the minister said that many members of the ODS still "openly listen to the opinions of Václav Klaus."
This is okay, he said, because he is an experienced politician and a former party chairman, which is also the case with Paroubek.
He called the fact that the media is making an affair of it a sign of this year's cucumber season.
Seznamy.cz wrote on Friday that Paroubek is fulfilling the role of Hamáček's unofficial consultant.
He also wrote that the fourth place of the party's candidate in the Ústí Region is headed by the former chairman of the local cell, Petr Benda, who is linked to Paroubek and served as the vice-chairman of his party LEV 21.
Hamáček said today that he will not comment on the composition of the candidate until it is ready and approved.
Duplantis has a mile-long lead, it's a kick in the ass, laments Swede's challenger
The 22-year-old American pole vaulter has the ambition and potential to be one of the new ruler's most serious competitors.
He already knows what it's like to beat the two-year-old Duplantis, defeating him last year at the NCAA Universities Association meeting.
"We had a battle the year before, he won and I was second, then we switched places.
It was a very good fight both times," describes Nilsen, who secured the victory with 5.95 meters.
But Duplantis has since shot up sharply and currently finds himself alone in the highest pole-vaulting spheres.
At just 20 years old, he became the world record holder, breaking the 6.17 meter bar in Torun on February 8 this year, adding an inch a week later in Glasgow.
"He was jumping six meters at the age of 18 when he graduated from high school," recalls his peer Nilsen for the World Athletics website.
"It was clear that once he matured from boy to man, he would increase his potential and talent tenfold.
Twenty years is a pretty good age to jump a world record," he believes.
While Nilsen's list of accomplishments is noticeably thinner than that of Duplantis, the American has similar goals.
He has hinted at his options so far at NCAA races, which he has won regularly, improving his indoor personal best to 5.93 metres at one in February this year. He won a gold medal at the Pan American Games in Lima last August, having already fought his way into America's quest for the World Championships in 2017, where he finished 13th.
The next milestone for him is to get his first taste of the Diamond League.
"It's definitely my priority to get on the professional circuit and compete as much as possible in the Diamond League, because you can make a name for yourself there," he realizes.
"If you can succeed at this level, you can undoubtedly do the same at events like the Olympic Games, the World Championships or the Pan American Games."
But the pandemic has delayed these peak holidays, giving Nilsen and the other pole vaulters time to improve.
But will that be enough to catch up with Duplantis, who can easily turn a race under five rings into a mere silver match?
"Everyone's trying to catch up, but I don't think that's going to be possible anytime soon," Nilsen muses.
"The kid's been jumping for 16 years, and he's a mile ahead of everyone else in practice."
And he'll want to increase it even more before Tokyo 2021 begins.
Woman spends hundreds of thousands on disabled son's disability pension
Court awaits
The 33-year-old man's state disability pension is intended primarily to improve his quality of life.
The woman faces up to eight years in prison for embezzlement.
Due to ill health, the court deprived the sick man of his rights and appointed his mother as guardian to manage his son's money, among other things.
"From mid-November 2013 to this January, the woman used part of the funds from her son's disability pension for her own use, depriving him of CZK 440,000," police spokesperson Dana Ladmanová said, adding that the accused woman was aggravated by the fact that as guardian she had a special obligation to defend the interests of the injured person.
The woman had set up an account for her son, according to the court's instructions, but had his pension sent to her own account.
"After paying for the costs associated with her son's stay in the medical facility and paying for the necessary medication, she used the remaining funds for the purchase of a vehicle, electrical appliances and for the running of the household," according to the indictment.
The woman admitted that she could not use her son's money for her own use.
However, she defended herself by saying that she helped them pay for the family's expenses.
"We had problems with our income to tighten the household.
We never bought anything above standard.
It was always for things that my son would have approved.
I thought it was family money.
I had no idea that I was committing a crime," the woman explained to the police.
She promised to give the money back to her son.
North America has been inhabited for 30,000 years, scientists say after tool discovery
Findings from the Chiquihuite cave in the Mexican state of Zacatecas include 1930 tools made of limestone, including fine blades that could have been used to slice meat, and pointed objects that could have served as spearheads or spears.
Scientists have found that the oldest of the tools date from 33,000 to 31,000 years ago.
"There are only a few products of this age.
But there are," said archaeologist Ciprian Ardelean of the University of Zacatecas and lead author of one of two studies published on the subject in the journal Nature.
The youngest tools reach 12,500 years old.
Experts say humans have been inhabiting the Chiquihuite cave, located at high altitudes, for a long 20,000 years.
A widely accepted theory to date has suggested that the first representatives of Homo sapiens crossed the land bridge from what is now Russia to Alaska some 13,500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including unique spear points used to kill mammoths and other prehistoric animals, has shown that this Clovis culture subsequently spread throughout much of North America.
But this model has been given a break in recent decades, with the discovery of several ancient settlements that were two to three thousand years older.
A second study published in the journal Nature reports 42 different sites across North America, proving human presence on the continent as early as 26,000 to 19,000 years ago.
Scientists believe that a small number of humans may have arrived on the North American mainland earlier than previously thought.
Some may have reached America by boat.
"It is obvious that humans were in America long before the development of the so-called Clovis culture," said anthropologist Ruth Gruhn of the University of Alberta, Canada, on the new findings.
So far, the interest in tickets is fulfilling an optimistic scenario, the sellers say.
Prices are also gradually decreasing
Ticket sales in the Czech Republic are growing every week.
Compared to last summer, the interest is still about half, but the demand is growing by up to 20 percent every week.
According to the sellers, the development after the crisis is fulfilling the most optimistic scenarios.
Ticket prices are also gradually decreasing.
The most sought-after destinations, according to the sellers, are mainly southern European countries.
According to Kiwi.com data, Spain, Italy and Greece lead the way.
Flights to Split, Croatia, are the most sold at Letuška.cz.
Of the other countries, the most sought-after is the United Kingdom, which has always been one of the busiest destinations.
The average ticket price is also decreasing.
At Letuška.cz, it was around 6250 crowns in the middle of the month, down by 3000 crowns year-on-year.
This is mainly due to an increase in demand for European destinations, which now account for about 85 percent of sales.
However, prices to some European destinations, such as Spain or Italy, have also fallen by about a fifth in the past weeks.
The crisis has also affected the behaviour of customers, who are now buying tickets far less in advance than before because they are worried about the further development of the coronavirus situation.
According to earlier information from Kiwi.com, the time to buy a ticket before departure has decreased by about ten days year-on-year.
"This confirms the future trend, where people will order tickets far less in advance, require more flexibility, take less risks," said Michal Šindelář, Vice President of Products at Kiwi.com.
Currently, the average time to book before departure is 21 days.
Along with the growth in sales, the number of renewed flights from the Czech Republic is also increasing.
At the Prague airport, there are currently regular flights to more than 60 destinations.
Compared to last summer's season, it is about half the destinations.
The grand final tonight!
Watch the darts battle live on Nova Sport
The second most prestigious tournament within the PDC has reached the grand final.
It features the experienced 46-year-old Scottish darts player Gary Anderson and the surprise of the tournament, 26-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh.
Gary Anderson knocked out Justin Pip in the first round, then ran into his next-door neighbour in the table.
However, he also managed to cope with James Wade, and in the quarter-finals he had a good fight with Simon Whitlock, who had earlier sent home the world's No.1.
The "Flying Scot" had a close call in the semi-finals, when he faced Michael Smith.
But at the last moment he escaped the gravedigger's clutches, dominated in overtime, and after a result of 18:16 he won a place in the final of the tournament, which he dominated earlier in 2018, beating Mensur Suljovic 21:19 in an amazing battle.
The biggest surprise of World Matchplay is Dimitri van den Bergh.
The Belgian talent is enjoying the tournament, and it is perhaps the knowledge that he has nothing to lose that has helped him to play on an absolutely fantastic wave.
The 26-year-old darter first surprisingly knocked out world number six Nathan Aspinall, was outclassed in a dramatic battle by Joe Cullen, and in the quarter-finals, after a sharp start, he also beat Adrian Lewis.
The semi-finals were the big test.
Glen Durrant showed his strength at the outset, but the calmly playing Belgian then took an excellent series lead, which he then more or less held to the end.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in the high scoring, which made up for the occasional uncertainty on doubles.
Coronavirus cases have increased at least since the beginning of the week, the number of tests has decreased
Since the beginning of March, when the new coronavirus was discovered in the Czech Republic for the first time, it has been proven that 15,212 people have been infected with it.
Almost 9,600 of them have been cured, 368 patients have died.
At present, 5,254 people are sick.
This is according to data on the website of the Ministry of Health.
The daily number of newly confirmed cases this week has exceeded two hundred four times in a row.
The maximum was 281 cases on Friday.
On Thursday, there were positive 235 tested, 246 the day before, and 206 on Tuesday.
On the first working day of this week, there were 169 infected.
Of the covid-19, 9,590 people have been cured in the Czech Republic, or 63 percent of all those infected so far.
Most of them had a mild course of the disease.
There are 151 people in hospital with coronavirus, according to the latest data from the Ministry of Health, 19 of whom are assessed by doctors as serious.
There are several outbreaks of covid-19 in the Czech Republic.
Karvinsko still has the most infections in the last seven days per 100,000 inhabitants, at almost 59.
It is followed by the district of Jihlava with 56 and Frýdecko-Místecko with 36 infections per 100,000 inhabitants in the last week.
Due to the increased number of infections, new measures against the spread of the coronavirus have been in force in the Czech Republic since Saturday.
People have to wear masks at internal mass events of over 100 people, such as cultural and sporting events, but also weddings and funerals inside buildings.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be halved from the current 1,000 people.
In the world, the number of people who have been proven infected with the new coronavirus has already exceeded 16 million.
This was reported by the American Johns Hopkins University, which monitors the development of the pandemic globally.
According to this source, the balance of victims who died with covid-19 is close to 645,000.
The latest million infected have been added to the statistics in just three days; the 15 million mark fell on July 22.
The United States, which already registers over 4.1 million infections, Brazil, with 2.4 million, and India, where authorities say nearly 1.4 million people have been infected, have accounted for the largest increase in recent days.
The number of infections is now increasing at a record rate.
The World Health Organization reported this week that more than 284,000 new cases have been added worldwide from Thursday to Friday, the highest daily rate since the pandemic began.
This development can be attributed to the fact that the spread of the disease is at its peak in populous nations such as the US, Brazil, and India, but according to Reuters, the number of new cases has been growing in nearly 40 countries around the world over the past week.
These include Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium, and Israel.
The disease has already appeared in almost every country in the world, with the first case officially announced today by the DPRK.
Household air is up to five times worse than outdoor air.
Air fresheners and deodorants harm health
Health is threatened not only by poor outdoor air quality, but also at home.
This was pointed out by Israeli human health expert Carol Abraham, who was quoted by The Jerusalem Post.
According to Abraham, who helped create Israel's Ministry of Environmental Protection, household pollutants need to be targeted now, when many people spend more time working from home.
Abraham mentioned research by the U.S. Environmental Agency (EPA) that domestic air quality is up to five times worse than outdoor air quality.
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 3.8 million people die prematurely each year because of poor air quality in their homes.
"Because of the coronavirus epidemic, which has forced and continues to force many to work from home, people have to spend more hours in their homes than before, so it's time to focus on air quality in their homes," Abraham said.
In Israel, she said, almost no one is concerned about the quality of "home air."
Dangerous things that people normally come into contact with - paints, air fresheners, disinfectants, deodorants, or pesticides - can be dangerous.
"Clothes that we regularly bring to the cleaners also give off poison gas," Abraham said.
Children, old household members, and people with respiratory problems are the most at risk, she said.
Even otherwise healthy individuals can start to suffer from problems such as headaches, fainting, nasal irritation, nosebleeds, vomiting, or skin allergies.
Long-term exposure to unhealthy substances can damage internal organs and the central nervous system.
But not all of the pollutants come from objects inside homes, and the material that houses are built from can also be a source.
Václav Havel quiz: How long he spent in prison and what prompted him to draw up Charter 77
Fuenlabrada has lost its chance of promotion to Spain's top football league due to a coronavirus outbreak in the team.
The competition management cancelled the originally postponed duel of the last round of the second league, in which the team could have secured a place in the play-offs.
Fuenlabrada announced 12 more infected people on Saturday, bringing the club's total number of positive tests for covid-19 to 28.
Due to the outbreak in the team, Monday's duel against La Coruni was postponed, in which a point was enough for Fuenlabrada to reach the play-offs.
The competition management said today that the duel against La Coruni was definitely called off due to force majeure due to the fact that it was never played again.
Fuenlabrada accepted the decision.
On the other hand, La Coruňa is rebelling against not playing the match.
In the end, given the results of their rivals, even a victory over Fuenlabrada would not have been enough to save them, but they consider it unfair that the last round did not take place according to custom, complete on a single date.
The management of a former elite Spanish club is threatened with court due to their fall to the third league.
The top two teams of the table, Huesca and Cadiz, are guaranteed promotion to the elite.
Zaragoza, Almería, Girona and Elche will compete for the remaining third place in the play-offs.
Karel Gott didn't like Václav Havel?!
Dominik's daughter revealed it
"Dad didn't like him for many years," Gott Dominik's eldest daughter told Aha! , saying that the Master couldn't come up with Havel's name and that whenever he came up, Karel was always annoyed.
It's hard to say what they did to each other, but according to Dominika, the feud began sometime in the mid-1990s.
"Dad said in an article after the revolution that he had it easier than he did.
That Havel could write in a drawer in the dark ages, but if he somehow resisted, his career would be over," Gottová says.
But then she adds that in the end the Czech greats found their way to each other.
"I know that Havel couldn't hear the word at all until he was sixty.
But then the President congratulated him in a letter on his birthday and suddenly his father's relationship with him began to change," Dominika recalls.
Indeed, ten years later, Gott even invited the then former President to celebrate his seventieth birthday at the Ambassador Hotel on Wenceslas Square.
"And that's where the new era of their relationship began, because then Mr. Havel's father regularly invited him to his home for Bertramka," said the blonde, whose father died last October.
Slavík was also said to be sorry that he never received a state medal from Václav Havel.
However, he did receive it in 2009, even though it was already at the hands of his successor Václav Klaus (79).
He will receive another honour in memoriam, the current president Miloš Zeman (75) is supposed to award him the Order of the White Lion and honor his memory.
Heat threat in the Czech Republic as of Tuesday, meteorologists warn of fires
Weather warnings of high temperatures are valid for Tuesday afternoon for the whole of Bohemia, with the exception of the Karlovy Vary Region, as well as for southern and central Moravia.
"Exceptionally, temperatures may exceed 34 degrees Celsius, especially in central Bohemia," they state.
They recommend people to follow a drinking regime in the heat and limit their body load in the noon and afternoon hours.
Due to the warm weather with a minimum of rainfall, there will be a risk of fires starting on Tuesday morning.
Windy weather could contribute to their rapid spread.
Weather warnings about the risk of fires apply to central Bohemia, including Prague, Liberec, Ústí nad Labem, Karlovy Vary and the Pilsen Region.
Fire warnings will be in force until further notice.
"We do not expect significant rainfall that would alleviate the danger in the northwest and west of Bohemia until at least the end of the week," says ČHMÚ.
The Prague Municipality responded to the weather warnings by banning the setting of fires in risky places, which should apply from Tuesday.
People in the capital will not be allowed to set open fires in parks, gardens or forests, for example, up to 50 meters from the edge of the forest growth.
Smoking and the use of pyrotechnics are also prohibited in these places.
The measures will apply until further notice, Prague Municipality spokesperson Vít Hofman informed.
