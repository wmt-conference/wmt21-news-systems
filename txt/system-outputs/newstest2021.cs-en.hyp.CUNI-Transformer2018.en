Novak helped Trabzonspor to second place, also hitting Skoda
Defender Filip Novak scored a goal in the final round of the Turkish Football League Trabzonspor to win the vice-captaincy.
His team won 2-1 at Kayserispor and held off third-placed Besiktas.
Striker Milan Škoda scored his 10th goal for Rizespor after a January transfer from Slavia, who saved even though he fell 1-3 to Fenerbahce.
Novak confirmed the defender's excellent productivity with his seventh goal of the league year.
In the 63rd minute, the goalkeeper of Kayserispor merely fired a fierce shot and the Czech footballer smashed the ball into the net from an angle.
The home side had levelled five minutes from time, but Trabzonspor snatched the victory in the sixth minute of regulation when they successfully completed a four-on-one.
Pity tied it at 1-1 in the second-half opener with Fenerbahce.
Rizespor didn't hold the indecision for long, but he didn't have to be sorry, as his opponents' results left him three points above the drop zone.
The competition concludes with Sunday's Basaksehir Championship duel on the Kasimpasa Course.
The well-hidden Cave at the hermit in the New Bor woods was not actually habitable
In the north of Bohemia, in the foothills of the Lusatian Mountains, not far from Novy Bor in Českolipsko, several sandstone rock formations are hidden in the woods through which the Count's Road ran.
Both natural and man-made.
And we will go after the human hand created.
The place is called the Cave of the Hermit.
In fact, no hermit had ever lived here, and the cave served as a hiding place, or more accurately, a concealment chamber apparently for grain.
The cave is carved from the side into a rock spur and accessed by stairs from above.
But at the same time, it's virtually invisible until the last minute.
It is revealed by the narrow stairs leading to a sort of rock gallery, from which it is only just entering the rock.
Although the chamber appears to be a considerable distance from human habitation, at the time of its creation there may have been a field on the plateau where the forest is today.
"The fact that the object does not have a window, nor does it have a furnace on the traditional site, clearly demonstrates that no hermit could ever survive the winter here," explains historian Kamil Podroužek of the Jan Evangelista Purkyně Faculty of Philosophy in Ústí nad Labem.
The one-dimensional object has only a stone bench at the rear, apparently used for removing vessels.
"I see it as a storage chamber for some food or produce from the field," adds Kamil Podroužek.
There are tool marks on the walls of the cave.
Unbreaking the sandstone with a cane was simple and quick enough for insiders.
All you had to do was use the claws appropriately and gradually break off the sandstone.
Based on the length of the canine mark and the mowing pattern at all, you can frame the time of the cave's formation.
According to the historian, this is probably the late 18th century.
The cave is freely accessible, and according to the clutter that appears in it, someone sometimes sleeps there these days.
If you approach a cave from above one of the forest roads and are intrigued by a running stream under the cave and the nearby Earl's Road, then you'll find a path down as well.
And on your way out of the woods, you might still be captivated by the nearby Raven Rocks.
Jockey Minařík is in artificial sleep after heavy fall in Germany
"Philip is in the best hands now.
The institute is set up for such cases, and fortunately we have part of the family in Hanover.
This makes the situation much easier for me and also for the care of Finja's daughter," a statement from Minařík's wife Katja was quoted by Jezdci.cz.
"Everyone's doing their best, Phil needs time to recuperate now.
There's no point in making any predictions.
Anyone who has ever encountered the issue of head trauma and sleep-induced patients knows that the situation can change.
Philip is a great fighter.
We all need to be patient and give him time now," said the 45-year-old jockey's wife.
The star Frankie Dettori, who won the seventh consecutive King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot on Saturday to match the legend of Lester Piggott, has also called for the financial support of the injured Minaris on Twitter.
Almost €70,000 has been raised on the Gofundme server to date.
The target is €100,000 ($2.6 million).
Video referee takes Sassuolo's four goals, they lose 0-2
Sassuolo's players got the ball four times in their opponent's goal in Saturday's match at Napoli, but in the end they had to accept an 0-2 defeat.
Not one of their goals was conceded by the referee after consulting the video for offside.
According to Italian media, this is record-breaking technology, so many hits have never been squashed by a single team's VAR.
"The VAR was tougher on Sassuolo than the road radar and punished it like no team has ever done.
New technology is breaking records," Gazzetta dello Sport wrote in a commentary.
"Sassuolo's Unrecognized Goals Festival.
Never has the VAR been so strict on one team," added Corriere dello Sport.
Napoli took the lead in the eighth minute on Saturday, but after half an hour of play Sassuolo seemed to have equalised.
But Filip Djuricic's goal was disallowed after the video referee was hit for offside.
For the same reason, Djuricic's other intervention and the hits of Francesco Caputo and Domenico Berardi did not gradually apply.
The home side, on the other hand, added another goal.
Electric cars set a new record.
In the Czech Republic they recharged the most in history
"Growth was driven by both a 30 percent increase in the number of stations in our network and a trend of more frequent charging at public stations, as well as accelerated development of registrations of new e-cars," said Tomáš Chmelík, head of ČEZ's clean technology unit.
Other big players, such as PRE and E.ON, electric car maker Tesla, as well as supermarkets Bill and Lidl, are also claiming their share of the market.
The operators of classic petrol stations are represented by MOL.
But she doesn't have the numbers yet.
"We only started building our electromobility network last year," explained company spokeswoman Jana Jusková.
However, the Daily News desk has exclusively obtained data from all 216 electric racks operated by ČEZ.
They show that drivers took an average of 13.5 kWh from the stations.
That's equivalent to driving about a hundred miles of a smaller electric car.
Apart from small drawings up to 1 kWh, the average charge takes two and a half hours.
The vast majority of refuelling then took place at a free tariff.
If motorists were already paying for the collection, their typical spending was around 330 kroner.
Electricity pulls mainly in the capital.
All five of ČEZ's busiest rechargers are located on the territory of Prague, which will eclipse even the entire regional cities in its popularity.
Olomouc then leads between the regions.
On the contrary, there is little interest in remote stations in the borderlands, such as Bohumín or Prachatice, which often remain unused throughout the day.
There are currently more than four thousand electric cars registered in the Czech Republic.
In this year's first half alone, there have been 1274 new e-cars.
In a wide-ranging survey in the Daily "Czechs on the Move," eight percent of readers said they were considering buying an electric car for the family.
But only a third of respondents know where to look for the nearest charging station in their neighborhood.
Not just for better water retention.
Environmental activists protested in Prague
According to the organizers, the government's actions so far on the issues of protecting and healing the Czech landscape and tackling the climate crisis are insufficient, speakers have called for a more forceful approach by the state.
Representatives of large organisations such as the Rainbow Movement, Greenpeace or the Green Party, as well as smaller local associations, took part in the Last Drop event.
"We have, for example, people who are speaking out against the expansion of the Turów Mine in the long term, there are people who are speaking out against the gravel mining at Uherský Ostroh, there are people who are speaking out against the construction of pointless dams," Marika Volf said for the organizers.
It said the protesters' main demands were the creation of a plan to conserve water in the countryside, a radical change in agricultural policy and subsidy system to promote sustainable agriculture, and a switch from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources as soon as possible.
"The government is supposed to be defending people's interests, not a reckless and devastating business," she said.
A stall was set up in Malostransky Square with a petition calling on representatives of the Czech state to work on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and restoring the Czech soil and landscape.
The people in attendance were equipped with signs with slogans such as "End the Rape Depression" or "Less coal, more newts."
From southern Moravia to Prague came Jan Škoda from the association for water for people, who is protesting against the plan to extract gravel in Hodonín.
"It threatens a source of drinking water for 140,000 people," he said.
He added that the wells represent the fifth most productive source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
The planned gravel extraction, he said, was only about 500 metres from the boreholes, and the assessments made it certain that the water quality would be compromised.
For so-called agro-ecological farmers, he came from the village of Valeč to Karlovarsku Vojtěch Veselý.
He drew attention to the virtues of small farms, which do not run on yields and profits, supplying residents on the ground.
"Small agro-ecological farms are able to feed the entire population quite normally, on top of that they don't wreak such havoc on the form of the countryside and the environment," he said.
Three people died in a plane crash on a house in Germany
Three people died and two others were injured in an ultralight plane crash on an apartment building in western Germany today.
Local emergency services have been informed, with two crew members and a female occupant among the dead.
The aircraft crashed onto the roof of a building in Wesel, North Rhine-Westphalia.
The penthouse, which was one of five apartment units in the house, was subsequently engulfed in fire.
Firefighters have already managed to control the flames.
Assistant Chief of Local Fire, Robert Meyboom, reported that both crew members of the aircraft appeared to have died.
The third victim, according to police, is a woman who lived in the house.
The Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ), citing the mayor of Wesel, wrote that she was a single mother whose two-year-old daughter was rescued from her apartment with minor injuries.
An emergency parachute was found in the vicinity of the accident, presumably acting as a brake on the landing.
The police assume it came from a crashed plane.
There was room for two in the aircraft.
The machine took off from an airport in the nearby town of Marl.
The Rheinische Post, citing eyewitnesses, reported that before the crash, the plane collided with a hot-air balloon.
However, this information has not yet been confirmed.
WAZ, citing other witnesses, wrote that the aircraft disintegrated in midair before hitting the ground.
On Saturday, Česká spořitelna erroneously charged some card payments twice.
She has already deleted the error
Česká spořitelna erroneously charged its clients some card payments twice on Saturday afternoon.
According to the bank's spokesman, Lukáš Kropík, the problem could have involved thousands of transactions.
Sparkasse KölnBonn has already removed the error and returned the money to its clients.
Problems with double billing of card payments were noted by Sparkasse on Saturday afternoon.
"Just last night (Saturday) we updated the system and returned all these duplicate payments to clients immediately.
At the moment, everything is working smoothly," Kropík said on Sunday afternoon.
The exact number of clients to whom the bank deducted money from card payments twice is unknown to a bank spokesman, who estimated that there were fewer thousands of transactions.
Sparkasse KölnBonn is investigating the causes of the problems.
"It could have been a combination of multiple factors," said Kropík.
Česká spořitelna is the largest bank in the Czech Republic by number of clients.
At the end of March, it had 4.6 million.
Sparkasse KölnBonn is owned by the Austrian financial group Erste Group Bank, which is a key player in the banking market of Central and Eastern Europe.
Vojtěch will present a system of three emergency stages against the coronavirus on Monday
"The grades will be at the level of the regions, according to the strength of community dissemination.
We are working on this together with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics," Vojtěch told TIME.
It will be called a semaphore, with individual regions marked in green, orange or red according to the risk of coronavirus.
The minister added that he would still talk to epidemiologists about the inclusion of the individual counties.
He admitted that only the Moravian-Silesian region would currently be orange and Prague would be approaching it.
Individual measures for county sanitation stations, hospitals, social facilities and employers will also feature on the map.
"We want to address this at regional level because the situation is not uniform," said Vojtěch.
Vodnik and Carolina
When the waterboy Jonah and the miller's daughter Caroline fall for each other, they don't have it easy at all.
Jonah's love is held back by his father, the nerdy waterboy Hastrbuch, and Caroline has no idea that her lovely Jonah is not human.
Good thing there's a lad named Libor who'll do anything to protect the whole village, and especially Carolina, from that aquatic villain.
So what if he plots and lies?
Especially if she can make Charlotte reject Jonah and favor him, the valiant Libor.
Soon it is clear to all in the village who is to blame for the drowning of the pony-headed Conch, the rotten flour, the mill fire, and other mischief-makers.
Angry villagers would hunt down the water-sprite, and there would be an implacable water-curse on Jonah's head.
And now Hot Dog's soul Caroline rays!
How to mollify old Hastrbuch, convince the neighbors of Jonah's innocence, find Jonah and release him from the spell?
The fairy tale was filmed in September 2010 in TIME studios and exteriors by Brzina pond, in Obděnice on Sedlčansk and in the beautiful setting of the historic mill in Hoslovice.
Motor car launches new e-shop
Customers of the Bridge Autodrome can use the new e-shop on its website.
It will also already buy coupons for free and test rides by car or motorcycle on a large racing circuit, which was previously only possible in person at the autodrome worker in the starting tower.
"We have made improvements to the e-shop to make it user-friendly, while expanding the portfolio of products and services that can be purchased through it.
At the same time, on this occasion we have prepared a bonus for our customers in the form of a discount of 1,000 kroner on all safe driving courses from our offer.
They can find a discount coupon at www.autodrom-most.cz," explained AUTODROM MOST's sales and marketing director Jana Svobodová.
The e-shop website is now clear, she says, easy for the customer to navigate.
"The e-shop visitor picks the focus on the bar he's targeting.
For example, sports, safe or sport driving courses, training, experience programs, gift items, gift vouchers, activities for children and others," the principal said.
Among the innovations in the products and services offered by the e-shop are, for example, the Racing Legends Surprise Collection T-shirt, the car track, the safe driving course in reduced visibility, the advertising and gift items of the native professional racing team Buggyra Racing, or the Engelmuller glove from the limited edition BOHEMATIC watch factory, created on the occasion of the historic victory in the prestigious 24 Hours of Le Mans race in 1949.
"The offer is very varied, the customer can choose from more than 200 items," Jana Svobodová said.
When paying for a selected product or service, the customer can choose one of four options.
Payment by deposit (bank transfer), letter of delivery, cash on personal collection or online via payment gate.
The disease rate of the majority is moderate, with only three percent of those infected having to go to hospital
Either a milder form of coronavirus is spreading through the Czech Republic, or a summer dose of sunshine has significantly improved our immunity.
Hospital infection wards are half-empty, although numbers of those infected are rising.
"The situation today and in April is completely different, and it's mainly due to the number of hospital admissions," confirms Health Minister Adam Vojtěch.
It is worth remembering that on 11 April, when the first wave of the epidemic reached its peak, everyone wore masks, sampling was carried out by the army, the Republic was closed and the Czechs used up disinfectant for a year in advance.
Yet ten people a day were dying.
Now, daily increases in the number of infections are higher, but a maximum of two people die each day with covide-19.
Carvinia still has the highest number of infections per population, with similar numbers already in Southern due to an outbreak at the local Alzheimer's Centre, where there are already 57 infected - 40 clients and 17 employees.
Another home for the elderly was closed by sanitation workers in Chernobyl, Queensland.
The illness was confirmed by tests on one of the nurses.
"We traverse, we have restricted movement, we have all the sanitary measures," says Martin Scháněl, director of the nursing home.
According to him, none of the clients of the home have symptoms of the disease yet.
The blanket testing will begin tomorrow and then the health inspectors will decide on further action.
Hospitals are also responding to the increased number of infections.
An oncology institute in Brno today launched an automatic camera system at the entrance that can tell if people are wearing a mask when they enter.
The record is reported by South Bohemia health officials, who have recorded twenty-five cases of coronavirus - most of them foreign employees of a dust company.
Overall, there were 131 infections on Saturday - half the number on Friday - but fewer tests on the weekend.
Debutant champion!
Van den Bergh finished his story, Anderson was swept away
The big surprise of the tournament, named Dimitri van den Bergh, produced an outstanding performance even in a match against the player who won the second most prestigious event in the PDC in 2018.
The opening match was a two-way tie, the break coming at 8-7 to the Belgian dart.
Van den Bergh took a four with a 13-dart lego and has had the upper hand ever since.
He was literally crushing his opponent with his game, and the vastly more experienced "Flying Scotsman" was having a hard time getting to the doubles.
The way "Dream Maker" had it in his grasp was evidenced by the fact that a distraught Anderson didn't play his first high until the 24th Lego.
Plus, the young Belgian handled the high checkouts brilliantly.
The last time he lost was in the eleventh Lego, in bad shape but he "caught a big fish" and closed 170.
By the end of the match, Anderson was showing tremendous frustration.
Rather, he threw his darts away, and his triumphant striding opponent was utterly masterful.
Van den Bergh converted the first of three match darts and lived up to his name - writing his great dream.
The prize of a trophy named after Phil Taylor is all the more precious to the Belgian dart-maker because it is his first major win.
It remains the case that the last player to beat van den Bergh is Karel Sedláček.
Charges dropped in Nantes over cathedral fire, man pleads guilty
St Peter and Paul's Cathedral in the heart of Nantes caught fire last Saturday and the fire severely damaged the original 16th century stained glass windows and destroyed the organ.
Arson suspects were being investigated by investigators because the fire was moving through the temple from three different locations.
At the same time, police found no evidence of forced entry into the cathedral.
The accused is a volunteer with a local diocese, a 39-year-old Rwandan refugee.
Police arrested him shortly after the fire, but then released him without prosecution.
Now the prosecution has reported that based on new evidence, the man was arrested again on Saturday, pleaded guilty and faces arson charges.
If found guilty, he faces up to ten years in prison and a heavy fine.
According to his lawyer, the man regrets the crime and has decided to cooperate fully with the investigators, Le Monde wrote.
Vojtěch: On Monday we will introduce a "traffic light" for epidemiological measures
The new system is intended to fulfil the role of a pandemic plan, the absence of which has left the government and the Ministry of Health facing criticism.
"The grades will be according to the power of community propagation," the minister explained.
He added that at present, for example, the Moravskoslezský kraj or Prague would reach the middle, orange level.
The system is designed as regional because the situation varies significantly from one county to another, it added.
On the system, the Ministry worked with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (IHIS).
Specific measures will be linked to each level, according to the minister, whether it be the obligation to wear masks or the organisation of special departments in hospitals.
The Prima Partie television programme called for an epidemiological plan by Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD), according to which people should have clear information about what measures they can expect if the epidemiological situation worsens.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has grown in recent days, although the number of hospitalized remains low.
Vojtěch commented that there was nothing major going on and there was no need to talk about declaring an emergency or reconvening the emergency staff.
The government has reintroduced the obligation to wear masks at internal events of over 100 people, in view of the increasing number of infections since Saturday throughout the Czech Republic.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be limited to 500 people, now 1,000 people.
The government's actions, when it was unclear until the last minute what measures and when they would take effect or when they would be announced, received criticism.
"I think that in a situation that is quite tense, the chief executives should be creating a sense of security and straightening out the confusion," Senator Mark Hilsher said in Questions.
Measures can already vary by region, such as the obligation to wear masks in non-residential health facilities in Prague from Sunday, such as pharmacies or doctor's waiting rooms.
They also introduced the obligation to wear masks when visiting health and social facilities or pharmacies in Liberec and Ústí Region from Friday.
In the Highlands of Southern, masks must be worn in indoor public spaces, public transport and health facilities from 14 July.
In contrast, anti-epidemic measures have been relaxed in the Moravian-Silesian region, as in the Central Bohemian region of Kutnohorsk.
In early June, the Czech government also approved the so-called semaphore for Europe, which differentiates in color the level of risk of infection in individual European countries and accordingly regulates the rules applicable to entry into the Czech Republic from those countries.
For low- and medium-risk countries, as of June 15, the authorities have not required Czech citizens to test negative for the coronavirus or order quarantine instead.
These are mandatory when Czechs return from high-risk countries.
At the moment, all EU members are now in the low-risk category.
Technoparty on Benešovsk continues.
She's playing at one-third capacity, due to finish at noon
Hlavackova's Lhota (Benešovsko) Technoparty at Hlavackova Lhota on Benešovsk continues on Sunday evening.
A third of the original 12 musical systems are still playing.
According to evening police estimates, about 500 people remain after 8 p.m., initial rough estimates were three hundred, up from 900 this morning, said Lucie Novak, a police spokeswoman.
Originally, the techno-party was supposed to end at noon on Sunday, at which point part of the music systems actually went silent.
"Some have already left and others are preparing to leave.
The musical production is partly still ongoing.
We expect to see a gradual disconnection and dismantling of music systems," Nováková said.
'Officers still rigorously check departing visitors to prevent drivers from driving under the influence of alcohol or addictive substances.
Drivers have the option to undergo a precautionary breath test before departure," she added.
Dozens of riot police are supervising the event, foreigner police, traffic and riot police are on the scene, and dog handlers with service dogs are also on standby.
"During the day, officers have checked 470 people moving in the venue and 485 vehicles, 270 drivers have been breath tested, of which six have been behind the wheel while under the influence of alcohol," Novak said.
A total of 95 drivers were tested for narcotics and psychotropic substances, of which one tested positive.
Officers also dealt with 14 traffic offences.
At the request of technoparty participants, police officers conducted 300 preventive breath tests and four preventive tests for the presence of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.
About 2,000 people were at the event Saturday morning.
If the number of participants did not decrease, the police would intervene.
Minister of the Interior Jan Hamacek (ČSSD) said on Prima Partie TV.
But the number of attendees fell below 1,000, so the police assessed that there was no need for intervention, nor did the sanitation station or the Ministry of Health request it.
Czech Television (TIME) reported on Sunday that the techno-party had extended to the surrounding land, whose owners disapproved of the use for the techno-party.
It is possible that the owners of the surrounding land will seek damages.
Supporters of the techno came to the meadow at Hlavackova Lhota on Friday night.
Police were originally on Friday guarding a meadow in Blažimi, Benešovsk, where a techno party was held last year.
Blažim is located roughly 30 kilometers from Hlavacek's Lhota, where the technocrats eventually actually went.
According to Novak, no one came to Blažimi.
Viper bite: Little girl wound up in hospital!
"The first case this year was recorded at Ironbornorn.
The viper bit the leg of a girl there, 2010, whom the parents themselves brought to the rescue service base there," regional emergency medical services spokesperson Mária Svobodová told the Daily News, noting that the child was then taken to a hospital in Klatovy.
Viper is the only venomous snake in the Czech Republic and it is on Šumava that these animals are found in higher numbers, so it is good to be careful when walking.
But there is no great danger from these animals.
The chances of being bitten by a viper are not very high, they are afraid of themselves in normal contact.
And if she has the space, she likes to crawl away with a loud hiss.
It will only attack if it feels badly threatened - for example, if you accidentally step on it.
Even her bite isn't a tragedy, though her venom is very effective against small mammals, but it doesn't kill people.
This can only happen if a person has a particularly weakened organism, or suffers from an allergy.
The risk is therefore primarily for children, the elderly and allergists.
"A person often feels nauseous after a bite, sweats, has a high temperature, thirst, abdominal pain and diarrhoea, and can go into anaphylactic shock in weakened individuals and especially allergists," Miriam Greda of Klatovy Hospital described to the Journal.
The man threatened to throw the infant out the window.
He poured wine and threw dishes at the policewoman
After 11 p.m., a SWAT team entered the apartment and detained the man.
The infants were immediately taken into care by medics, county police spokeswoman Margarita Janovská said in a press release.
The man didn't want to cooperate with the cops, throwing crockery, knives or pouring wine over the police negotiator.
He amplified his threats several times during the negotiations by leaning out the window with the baby in his arms.
Once, he even climbed alone on the windowsill, where he staggered.
Police are continuing to investigate the man.
He doesn't want to release any more information yet.
Stosur prefers daughter to tennis season
Australian tennis player Samantha Stosur will no longer be involved in the coronavirus-affected season this year.
The 36-year-old 2011 US Open champion, who became a mother in June but does not want to finish her career just yet.
He plans to return to the courts next year and believes he will enjoy tennis even more than before thanks to his family and daughter.
Stosur announced on social media two weeks ago that her partner, Liz Astling, had given birth to a daughter, Genevieve, in mid-June.
"I'm going to stay home, spend time with my family, be there for all the little milestones our Evie is going to have in the next six months and just enjoy it," the former world number one doubles player posted on the Australian union website.
The WTA Tour will resume its suspended season on August 3 with the Anzac Tournament in Palermo.
Sapa market: The raid revealed meat, fish and eggs of unknown origin
'One of the vehicles entering the compound was carrying 1320 quail eggs of unknown origin, in unsuitable conditions.
Also these eggs will be disposed of in the rendering plant," the State Veterinary Administration said.
A check of a live fish stall then revealed that the seller did not have proof of origin and was not registered to sell live fish.
The market is considered troublesome from a veterinary perspective in the long term.
For example, last fall, vets uncovered an illegal food outlet in it, containing nearly half a ton of unmarked, undocumented food.
For most, there was no expiration date, some of the products had expired and were spoiled.
For five kilograms of cuttlefish, the shelf-life was exceeded by three years.
Last May, veterinarians and police officers intercepted 80 kilograms of food on the market grounds without proof of origin, including dried fish, squid or frozen duck, some of it mouldy.
Putin phoned Zelensky ahead of Donbass ceasefire, Kremlin criticizes planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke by phone with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky about the situation in Donbass, where a new ceasefire is due to take effect from midnight.
Among other things, Putin criticized the Ukrainian parliament's decision to hold local elections, according to a statement from the Kremlin; Kiev reported that Zelensky had called for the release of the detained Ukrainians.
A new ceasefire was agreed on Wednesday evening by the negotiators of Ukraine and Russia, supported by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
The ceasefire is to begin after midnight on Monday, to be "comprehensive and universal" and to open the way for the fulfilment of other provisions of the peace accords.
In an interview, Putin told Zelensky that the Ukrainian parliament's decision to hold local elections contravened the Minsk peace agreement and threatened the prospects for a settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
Last week, Ukraine's parliament ruled that the forthcoming elections for local councils will not take place in territory controlled by pro-Russian rebels.
The Minsk agreement envisages that Kiev will regain control of the Ukrainian territories of the occupied separatists with Russia, after giving these regions wide autonomy and holding local elections there.
According to Unian, Zelensky's office said that the two statesmen agreed on the benefits of the upcoming ceasefire in Donbas as well as on the need to implement other measures to promote peace in the region, such as de-mining the fighting areas or withdrawing part of the troops from the front.
Zelensky also called on Putin to release Ukrainians detained in eastern Ukraine, the occupied peninsula of Crimea, and Russia itself.
The Minsk agreement helped stop the fighting, but people continue to die on both sides of the front in occasional firefights and artillery attacks.
The conflict in Donbass has resulted in over 14,000 deaths since the spring of 2014.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of military support for the separatists, which Moscow denies.
Zelensky has made ending the war in Donbass his priority, but a more fundamental breakthrough in negotiations has not yet occurred.
Unexpected decathlon champion is Rykl, seven-fight champion Novotná
The defending champion of the last two titles, Dolezal, did not reach the end of Saturday's 400 program; Kopecky did not jump the pole on Sunday.
The decathlon has long been ruled by Latvian representative Reinis Kregers, who is preparing in coach Josef Karas' group, but resigned after the discus.
Rykl had two bronze medals from the outside CR so far, this time he was the only 10-year-old to make it past the 7,000 mark.
William Page and Petr Urbánek won other medals behind him.
After the competition, Rykl recalled the absence of Adam Sebastian Helcelet and George Cheese.
"It's a shame the boys weren't here and Kope didn't start, because that would have made the results look very different.
But the title tastes very good, and I especially appreciate the fact that I've had a person 30 centimeters away.
Then I was pleased with the stick and most disappointed about the disc, I was below average there," he acknowledged in a Union Facebook post.
Catherine Cach won the first day of the sevens with a more than 100-point advantage, despite suffering from an injured ankle on her rebound leg.
In the distance sector, however, she then logged only 570 cm, did not throw a javelin 40 metres, and did not enter the final eight hundred.
Novotna collected 5878 points and won by 241 points from Katerina Dvorak.
It came out mainly from a distance, 631 cm is the best Czech performance of the year.
"I really wanted it to be around the 630.
My calf started pulling yesterday, but I'm so glad I didn't feel it at all and that it didn't make me feel any different," Novotná said on the union Facebook page.
Bio LPG arrives in Czech Republic, promises eco-operation
Liquefied Petroleum Gas, an acronym for LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas), is a very well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
It is particularly popular for its fundamentally lower price than petrol or diesel, given the significantly lower consumption tax, but it also benefits from lower CO2 emissions per kilometre travelled.
Like petrol and diesel, it has its eco-friendly variant - "bio LPG."
But it is fairly new - it first appeared on the European market the year before last and arrived in the Czech Republic a few days ago, according to a press release from the Czech LPG Association.
"These days we have received the first fifteen tonnes of bio LPG, which will be distributed to our gas stations in a mixture with classic fossil LPG," Jiří Karlík of Primagas is quoted as saying.
Bio LPG, however, cannot be taken as bioethanol or biodiesel.
According to the association, it is chemically identical to the classic petroleum LPG that many motorists are refueling in their cars now.
Therefore, it is also possible to mix the two versions at will.
"The only difference with conventional LPG is the production method," Ivan Indrakek, chairman of the association, says of organic LPG.
This also says one of the great advantages of bio LPG over other alternative fuels.
It can be easily transported and stored, and the distribution infrastructure is also relatively good, e.g. compared to hydrogen or electricity.
Currently, this gas is obtained as a by-product in the production of bioethanol from food scraps and sugar cane.
In future, it should also be manufactured in a targeted way, e.g. from cellulosic biomass, i.e. wood waste.
In contrast, conventional petroleum LPG is produced partly as a by-product in oil refining, partly by separation in natural gas extraction.
As a result, depending on production technology and source, running a car on bio LPG is 40-70% more environmentally friendly in terms of carbon footprint than running on petroleum LPG and up to 90% compared to diesel.
But it is not the CO2 emissions from the car exhaust, but the ecology of fuel production, the so-called "well-to-tank" part (in English "from source to tank").
Some of the largest producers of organic LPG currently include the petrochemical firms Eni, Total and Neste.
According to a recent update of the National Clean Mobility Action Plan (NAP QM), Unipetrol is also exploring the possibility of production in its Lithuanian refinery.
According to the association's estimates, about 170,000 vehicles run on LPG in the Czech Republic; the Ministry of the Environment reports a slightly higher figure in NAP QM, roughly 200,000.
According to Department of Transport statistics, almost 6,000 LPG-powered car conversions were carried out last year alone.
LPG refuelling is possible at some 950 stations of different operators in the Czech Republic.
Vojtěch revised the numbers of infected, the number dropped by 1775 cases
Health Minister Adam Vojtěch (for YES) ordered the ministry to revise the numbers infected with the coronavirus virus virus.
The new statistics were published on Sunday by the Ministry of Health on its website.
The figure on Sunday afternoon dropped from Saturday's 5254 to 3479 cases, 1775 fewer infections.
So there are currently 3422 sick people in the Czech Republic.
"Behind the jump in the number of cures is a review of data that has not been kept up to date by hygienists recently," said health statistics chief Jaroslav Dušek.
By Sunday afternoon, 15,212 people in the Czech Republic had contracted the coronavirus, 11,419 had recovered and 371 had unfortunately succumbed to Covid-19.
Mobile voting units or correspondence voting.
Political scientist and sociologist looked for variations for pandemic times
A change in the law is needed to allow quarantined people to vote in October's regional and Senate elections because of the coronavirus, according to Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD).
Parliament could debate it in August or September under an accelerated regime.
He made the announcement on Sunday at the Prime Television Partii.
He wants to discuss possible solutions with parliamentary party representatives at the Ministry on Tuesday.
"Whatever we do, it will have to mean a change in the electoral law," said Hamacek.
The Senate on Wednesday called on the government to find a solution within the legal rules in force.
But the minister said that the law's provision, under which people quarantined due to a medical condition cannot vote, would need to be modified.
The ban on voting should remain in place, for example, for patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop said on OVM that the possibility of a correspondence election has been postponed since 2004.
Even the current bill, which is in the House, then envisages introducing it for voting abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
At the same time, Prokop considers the concerns of YES or CSL (as this would be more likely to benefit other types of parties in foreign experience) about the correspondence choice to be overestimated.
He is then personally opposed to the possibility of electronic voting, where there is considerable potential for abuse.
Michal Klíma said that there was now an ad hoc need to devise mechanisms (elections) that could be carried out as early as this year and with as little health risk as possible.
It also considers it essential to be ready for 2021, when parliamentary elections are due to take place in the Czech Republic.
He considers correspondence choices (whether only abroad or also in the Czech Republic) to be one of the functional methods.
Others see the electoral units already mentioned, or perhaps the possibility of a proxy vote within the family.
He added that there was a chance to learn how similar situations -⁠ elections at the time of the coronavirus -⁠ were handled in Croatia, Poland or France.
Various types of elections in 67 countries around the world have already been postponed this year due to the spread of coronaviral infection.
Protests in Buharsk: Pig ears thrown by protesters at government building
Participants in a demonstration against Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov and his cabinet threw pig ears at the government building.
This was another in a series of protests against the "mafia style of governance" that has been taking place in Sofia and other cities for almost three weeks.
Organizers are planning a nationwide blockade for Wednesday, DPA reported.
Today's protest, which took place for the 18th consecutive day, had a weaker turnout than the previous one, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.
As of 8 p.m., some 300 people had gathered, with some streets closed to traffic.
Demonstrators outside the government building staged a theatrical stunt in which they symbolically locked Prime Minister Borisov and Prosecutor General Ivan Geshev in the prison cell in connection with the arrest of two aides to President Rumen Radev, who is a strong political opponent of the Prime Minister.
The resignations of both are among the basic demands of the protesters.
They also demanded the repeal of announced health care reform and the end of corruption in construction on the Black Sea coast.
The organizer of the protests, Nikolai Hadjigenov, said on public radio today that the "height of escalation" is set for Wednesday in the form of a "national rally in Sofia and blockades throughout the country."
He reiterated the demand for the resignation of Borisov and his government, as well as the call for early elections.
The regular ones should take place in March 2021.
Borisov said earlier that he did not intend to resign.
He justified this, among other things, by the need to carry out Bulgaria with the covide-19 pandemic and the resulting economic crisis.
But on Friday, he replaced five members of his government team, though the concession did not appease the protesters.
Earlier this week, Borisov's government weathered a vote of confidence in parliament in parliament.
Coach Boloni Mihajlovic no longer wants games without spectators
Bologna's coach Sinisha Mihajlovic has had enough of Italian league games without spectators.
The Serbian coach hopes that from the new season fans will return to the stadiums.
"What we're running here at the moment is not football.
I'm sick and tired of fights with no spectators.
It's genderless football, it brings me no emotion, no joy.
Those games are worse than training.
Playing like this is terrible and I don't think I'm the only one who thinks it," said Mihajlovic ahead of tonight's match against Lecce.
The coronavir break is followed by rapid-fire Series A matches, and although they are played in the evening, their players are exposed to the heat.
"We play every three days in terrible heat.
In those conditions, you can't even tell how the teams are.
I wish this season was over.
Those measures had to be taken to finish the competition, but I hope that by September the fans will be back," said the coach, who has also led Fiorentina or AC Milan in the past.
For Mihajlovic, this season is also special because he missed four months on the bench for leukaemia treatment.
"Despite my illness, breaking up the league and everything else, our team has managed to move up a level.
We want to keep growing and to do that we need the players to be mentally stronger," he said.
We've been targeted by cyber-attacks by foreign states, Iran says
Since the end of June, fires and explosions have been reported from a number of Iranian military, industrial and nuclear facilities, as well as oil refineries, power plants, factories and businesses.
Some Iranian officials have said that cyber sabotage may have caused the fire that broke out at the underground nuclear facility at Natanz earlier this month.
The cause of a number of other incidents has not yet been explained.
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi told reporters, according to Iranian media, that the Islamic Republic's infrastructure faces "thousands of cyber attacks every day."
He added that this was not a new phenomenon and that most of them would be repelled.
In recent months, Mousavi said, there have been several wider cyber attacks, with "certain governments and groups" behind them, according to analyses.
However, he did not give further details about the possible perpetrators, according to Reuters.
Mousavi also added that fires in forests, refineries and other places are frequent in the summer.
An article by Iran's state-run IRNA agency this month discussed the fact that Iran's enemies, such as Israel and the US, may have been behind the recent incidents.
But neither country was directly accused of specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States broke off diplomatic relations shortly after the 1979 revolution when Iranian militant students attacked the American Embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
Long-term strained relations between the two countries spiked in 2018 after Washington pulled out of the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers and imposed sanctions on Iran that have a severe impact on its economy.
Another significant escalation came this year after the US military killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani and Iraqi militia leadership member Abu Mahdi Muhandis on January 3.
Then, on January 8, Iran fired a number of missiles at bases in Iraq, where the Americans operate.
The US admitted only with hindsight that dozens of American soldiers had been wounded.
Israel regards Iran as its mortal enemy, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is the main opponent of the 2015 international nuclear agreement with Iran.
According to the Israeli prime minister, Iran is trying to develop an atomic bomb, which Iran denies.
TPCA has extended the production stoppage, now until May 25
Cologne's Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile (TPCA) has again extended its production stoppage due to a coronavirus.
Production lines should restart on Monday, May 25 morning.
Dozens of sanitary measures will accompany the run, said Tomáš Paroubek, a spokesman for the automaker.
Production has been on hold due to the coronavirus pandemic since the evening of March 18.
The company originally intended to renew it on Monday, May 18.
The reason for the extension of the shutdown, according to Paroubek, is closed borders and closed dealerships, so there is no one to sell cars.
According to Paroubek, the company will produce 100 percent from the start, or two shifts.
Coronavirus is affecting key markets of the firm, such as Italy, the UK or Spain.
Mayor Michael Kaspar (Change for Cologne) said that the production shutdown at TPCA does not sign on to life in the city.
"You could tell at first, the town was empty.
But gradually, the streets are filling up, especially now since Monday, when things got very loose.
So the city is full,' said Kaspar.
According to him, there are no complications even with the foreign workers left in the dormitories.
'We've had almost no problem to solve in the last two months,' said Kaspar.
For example, Škoda Auto, which also discontinued production due to the coronaviral crisis, resumed production on Monday, April 27, at all three of its production plants in the Czech Republic.
Neither plant is operating at 100 percent capacity.
More than 80 sanitary measures accompanied the resumption of production at Skoda.
On the night of Monday to Tuesday, the third, a night shift, was held in Mladá Boleslav and Kvasiny for the first time after production resumed.
Some 2,500 people currently work at TPCA and the company represents one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic as well as an employer in Cologne.
Cancer killed bride shortly after wedding: Left note for family
For more than two years Gemma Sisson had been battling an insidious cancer, and when she seemed to have beaten the cancer, the disease came back.
A 39-year-old woman who loved bodybuilding eventually ended up in a hospice bed, where she still had time to marry the love of her life.
Unfortunately, she succumbed to the disease.
A few hours after her death, a shocking message appeared on her Facebook social media account for those closest to her.
Gemma Sisson, from Leeds, England, loved bodybuilding.
She and her boyfriend, Ricky Moore, with whom she had lived for more than 16 years, traveled to competitions held around the world.
The 39-year-old was athletic and healthy, yet she was diagnosed with cancer in April 2018.
Gemma began exhaustive treatment, radiotherapy, in the hope of recovering.
Indeed, after months of treatment, Gemma seemed to have conquered the cancer, but in August of 2019, the cancer returned and this time attacked her spine.
The bodybuilder and personal trainer, according to the UK Daily Mirror, underwent a 10-hour spinal surgery and eventually resumed drastic treatment.
But all was in vain.
Earlier this year, on her thirty-ninth birthday, doctors told her she had a few months to live.
Finally, in April, the handsome blonde decided to join a hospice in Leeds, where her family visited her every so often, even arranging her wedding to her love Ricky.
The marriage lasted two months.
Ricky took Gemma to a restaurant one last time for their two-month anniversary.
Four days later, Gemma died in his arms.
Just hours after her death, a post Gema had written for her family appeared on her social media account.
"If this has been made public, it means I have finally died after weeks of fighting too long.
Though I will be heartbroken to leave my loved ones behind, I will be so glad to be rid of what this terrible disease has caused me.
I can't thank Ricky enough, who has been by my side all along and given me a tremendous amount of love and support during this terrible time," she wrote on the social networking site, noting that the pain and suffering had finally stopped and she had found peace.
"I'm also grateful for all the support I've received from all my social media followers," she wrote, saying that everyone should value their lives and live them to the fullest.
Art dispensers sell sweat dating, mushroom amulet and pexeso
For a hundred kroner, a passerby gets a pocket-sized work mostly by aspiring Czech artists.
Images and other creations are created directly for the artmat, so they know in advance that they must fit into a size 8.5 by 5.5 centimeters.
Each piece is numbered and signed.
"There's always a curatorial text about the artist in the package and then the work itself," said Petra Widzova, the project's curator.
Artmat works with the principle of chance.
Thus, the buyer may be surprised by the work of art he acquires.
He may now be the new owner of fanciful illustrations by Alexandra Štoplová or mini-views by Tereza Bonaventura that can even be sent.
The artist Punx 23, in collaboration with Dora Dutkova, prepared a pexeso associated with a walk through Prague.
Flashcards need to be paired with house signs.
Ilona Polanski created a collection of tattoos for Artmat.
Marie Ladro and Juliána Chom sell pocket-sized packs of spirituality: the first of the artists offers a protective amulet of tinder and fortune-teller cards, the second a series of illustrations based on her comic book Spiritists.
Health-care salaries will rise by a maximum of five percent next year.
A bigger increase is unrealistic according to Vojtech
Salaries in the health sector could rise by no more than five percent next year, Health Minister Adam Vojtěch (for YES) said at Václav Moravc's Questions in Czech Television.
He considers union officials' demand for increases of up to 15 percent unrealistic.
He also said the state should try to be self-sufficient in providing protective equipment.
Hospitals, he says, now have their supplies.
"I think the increase (in salaries) could be somewhere up to five percent," said the minister.
According to him, it is necessary to reflect the current situation in which she has intervened since March in the selection of the coronavir insurance pandemic and a government order against its spread.
Insurance companies' revenues fell at the time.
"I find a 15 percent increase unrealistic at the moment," Vojtěch said.
The average monthly earnings of a doctor in acute in-patient care according to data from the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (IHIS) are likely to reach 88,312 crowns this year, nurses 47,498 crowns.
The difference between the salary of nurses in state hospitals and that of other providers will be up to seven thousand crowns.
FDI data also show that the decline of nurses in hospitals has stopped.
The average wage in the Czech Republic was 34,125 crowns in 2019, according to data from the Czech Statistical Office.
Union officials said in June that they would require a minimum increase of ten percent, ideally 15 percent, for 2021.
They criticise the long-standing significant difference between the earnings of doctors and nurses in state hospitals, which must follow pay scales, and contract wages in city, county or private hospitals.
They therefore also call for uniform pay scales for health professionals.
For nurses this year, the gap will be as high as 7,000 kroner per month.
But for doctors, for example, wages grew faster than salaries last year.
According to the president of the Czech Dental Chamber, Roman Smucker, trade unionists should perceive the state's current state of affairs.
The House recently approved an increase in this year's government budget deficit to a record 500 billion crowns due to the effects of the covide epidemic, of which 1.75 billion is to go towards the remuneration of health workers in hospitals and social services.
The Board of Health Care Providers, according to Smucker, disagrees with the across-the-board salary increases next year.
According to him, the remuneration should be decided by the hospitals and health establishments themselves, and the extra money should go to them via a reimbursement decree.
Vojtěch also said that hospitals currently have enough protective equipment.
The chairman of the State Material Reserves Administration (SSHR), Pavel Švagr, said this week that the administration does not currently have any protective health equipment in the property.
Waiting for tenders to be completed.
According to Vojtěch, suppliers in the world are now better able to deliver goods than in March when they were bought out.
But the state, he said, should try to be as self-sufficient as possible and buy from Czech companies as well.
Scrubbing clever quarantine could be taken over by soldiers.
We're ready, they say
"Smart quarantine works, there's room for improvement, of course.
We're going to discuss it with the military tonight.
The military is working perfectly and there's a question of whether they should run the whole thing again," the Prime Minister said in his Facebook show Hi People on Sunday.
According to him, IT systems and sanitation stations are not sufficiently connected, which are gradually having to switch to more modern methods of operation.
The problems, according to the Prime Minister, were in the Moravian-Silesian region, where some of the current outbreaks are present.
Defense Ministry spokesman Jan Pejšek told ČTK that he did not have information about Sunday's meeting and that the government should discuss the matter on Monday.
The army, he says, is prepared for this move.
The smart quarantine project was taken over by the Ministry of Health on May 25.
Until then, the clever quarantine had been led by a 90-member central management team set up under the military as an advisory body to the government, led by former deputy minister Roman Prymula.
The scrubbing project was criticized by Interior Minister Jan Hamacek (ČSSD) on Sunday.
He, too, suggested that the army might take him again.
The government's IT and digitisation commissioner, Vladimir Dzurilla, who is in charge of the project, has also previously admitted shortcomings in the project.
"The system is working, but it's still being worked on.
For 20 years it was self-generated and non-systemic, now we're trying to unify it in a few months.
It doesn't gallop.
People on the march, poor people in the sanitation department on the march are adapting those new systems and picking up the mistakes," he said.
Ostrava Mayor Macura won't run again, he doesn't want to "fool around with politics"
Current Ostrava Mayor Tomas Macura (YES) will not stand in the next municipal elections.
The reason is to try not to "fool around with politics," he told Respekt.cz.
Macura, who is also a member of the YES Bureau, has been Mayor of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the 2018 municipal elections, the candidate led by him won almost a third of the voter vote in Ostrava.
Macura initially wanted to serve only four years.
"I figured I'd last one term, and with that business experience, I could turn things around and get things back on their feet in that time," Respect said.
He added that he had been persuaded to some extent for a second term.
"But it's the maximum for me.
I don't want to fool around in politics," added Macura, who in an interview described himself as a heavy-handed introvert who was not comfortable with frequent human contact.
According to Respect, there has been speculation for a long time about Macur's possible end in the Yes movement.
The site recalls that Macura has criticized the Yes movement several times, such as for alliances with the SPD movement or for supporting Milos Zeman in the presidential election.
One of the few ANO figures to support the country's opponent, Jiří Drahoš, in the election.
Macura has no plans to leave the yes movement he joined in 2017.
"As long as I feel that I can make a difference in the movement, that it's not a completely futile fight, and that I'm not being bullied, I have no immediate motive to quit," he told Respect.
Macura, 56, graduated from the University of Economics in Prague.
Before becoming Ostrava's mayor in 2014, Macura served, among other things, as a director of the pharmaceutical company Walmark.
He also sat on the boards of other firms.
Uber will return to Brno offering transportation services
Uber, which offers transportation services, will return to Brno at the end of July.
This is the result of a change in the law, Brno Transport Councillor Petr Kratochvíl (ODS) said in a press statement on Thursday.
Taxi drivers protested against Uber in Brno, pointing out that Uber did not meet conditions such as a designation like a taxi or a meter.
However, a change in the law has changed the conditions for operating both ordinary and alternative taxis since July.
Kratochvíl has had several meetings with Uber representatives in recent weeks.
"As a result, this company decided to return its services to Brno at the end of July this year.
The move is due to a change in the law which allows the company to operate legally.
The city has been made aware of this change and we believe that the company will operate its services within the given limits," said Kratochvíl.
Uber has operated in Brno in the past.
He was protested by taxi drivers for not identifying vehicles as a taxi or missing a meter.
The court issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting Uber from driving in the city.
Brno originally supported taxi drivers, but last year at the end of the year Mayor Margaret Vaňková (ODS) said that the city would like to take steps to make Uber work in Brno.
According to later court rulings, Uber was able to drive in Brno, but the company did not take advantage.
He will now return on the basis of a change in the law.
Since July, in addition to classic taxis with a flashlight and meter, it has been easier to run a transport service ordered and paid for exclusively via mobile apps.
An overly exuberant celebration in Brno: a flying chair fell three feet from a man on the pavement
An office chair flew off the fourth floor of an apartment building Saturday night in Brno and landed about a meter from the sidewalk.
After him at that moment was a pedestrian who immediately called the officers.
The patrol spotted an open window as soon as they arrived at the address listed in the west side of the city, with a chair still under it and several cans and cigarette butts beside it.
"The noise coming from the room on the fourth floor suggested that there was a rather noisy celebration going on inside.
Officers went up the hallway to the apartment and asked three young men in attendance, aged between 26 and 29, for an explanation," said Constable Jakub Ghanem, a spokesman.
Request for Rafaj's recall will be discussed by Babiš with CSL
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (YES) plans to discuss with the coalition Social Democrats on Monday the demand to propose the dismissal of the head of the anti-trust authority (OHS), Petr Rafaj.
Non-profit organizations have called for the removal of Rafaj at meetings of the government's anti-corruption council, as well as the Ústí Region.
The Social Democrats argue that a replacement at the head of office is in order.
According to ČTK, Rafaj was not invited to the Cabinet Office on Monday.
His second mandate ends in the middle of next year, and by law he cannot be appointed a third time.
His removal is within the purview of President Milos Zeman.
Alongside a call from non-profit organisations, the prime minister received a letter with a similar request from the Ústí Region.
This is to be due, among other things, to Rafael's recent cases.
Over the past week, the prime minister has refused to comment on the request, saying he would see the material and the governing parties would take "some sort of position" on it.
He also said that he had not yet discussed the challenges with the President, and he did not have a meeting with him anytime soon.
According to the DOJ, there is no reason to appeal, because Rafaj has not been charged with anything.
IHNED.cz and Aktuálně.cz have written in the last week that the police are interested in Rafajo's meetings with General Jiří Čunk.
The meetings related, among other things, to deciding on a competition for the controversial new $8 billion Zulu hospital project, which Chunk is pushing hard.
Chunk admitted to the meetings, according to him, they worked together on his "Senate activities."
Rafaj speaks similarly.
The trustees of the Ústí Region called on the government to dismiss Rafaj at the end of June.
It also calls for reform of the Office's decision-making mechanisms.
The DOC's decision-making on public procurement, according to Deputy Minister of Transport Jaroslav Komínek, is not transparent and has the hallmarks of arbitrariness.
Last March, police intervened at the antitrust office over a myth-selection tender.
In June this year, Aktuálně.cz pointed out that Rafaj was using flats written on the company of influential backstage ČSSD player Alexander Čuby.
An advance of 3.5 million on an apartment in Brno was paid from Rafajov's account.
Rafaj has been chairman of the Office for the Protection of Competition since 9 July 2009, appointed for a second term by the president of the former Social Democrat MP in June 2015.
In less than a year, Rafai's second six-year mandate will thus expire.
The Antitrust Act states that the President may remove the President of the Office on a proposal from the Government.
He may be dismissed only if he has not held office for more than six months or seriously undermines the dignity of his office or the independence and impartiality of the Office.
Employees were collapsing in the blanen library in the heat.
Air conditioning will help
The new technology will cost 740,000 and will be operational in the second half of August.
"It's good news for me.
Three children and I go to the library in downtown Blansko regularly.
In the warm months, however, it was almost impossible to stay there.
It was very hot and the air was very bad.
Ventilation didn't help.
That's why I'm glad about the air-conditioning," said one of blanco's readers, Petr Novotný.
According to the director of the library, Lukáš Dlapa, temperatures in the building often rose to over 30 degrees.
The south face of the building is glassed in and acts as a greenhouse on sunny days.
"In addition, the sun leans into it for a large part of the day, thanks to the curvature of the building.
At the same time, it is a big problem to ventilate individual departments because they have to be closed overnight for safety reasons.
We often have 30-degree days in the library," said Dlapa.
The study and reading room on the third floor were the worst.
And upstairs, the showroom and the principal's office.
The climate was also uncomfortable in the children's ward, which is located under the roof of the building.
"There have been several times when librarians have collapsed at work and ended up incapacitated.
The problem has also been a regular occurrence in the cultural room at lectures attended by dozens of people.
After a few minutes, there was no breathing," Raggedy observed.
Originally, city officials wanted to do air conditioning in all areas of the library this year.
In the end, there will be only three circuits out of five.
"Due to limited funding, only the most troubled areas will have air conditioning.
Study and reading room on the third floor.
Then there is the cultural room and the children's department on the floor above," Jiří Svoboda from the blanc investment department informed.
He added that, in the first phase, the workers had already installed airconditioning and wiring in the areas in question last autumn.
Approximately £360,000.
The Blansko Municipal Library has nearly three thousand registered readers.
Of that, there are about nine hundred to fifteen years.
Chicago's backer banished the coronavirus.
Crawford comes back into the game
Not every infected athlete comes out with the truth.
Especially when it comes to NHL players who are as silent as the grave about the health of players and publish nothing at all.
One of the few to step out of line was Crawford.
The 35-year-old from Montreal was only present for the first practice session, having been absent from the lineup since.
"I want to let you all know that I tested positive for Covid-19 and have spent the last fortnight locked up in my home because of it," he said, revealing the reason for his absence.
Fans no longer have to worry about his health.
Crawford is ready to throw himself back into full ballast.
"It's amazing to be back.
I'll do everything I can to get in shape as soon as possible," he said.
The veteran goaltender won two Stanley Cups with Chicago, a solid part of the goaltending for the 10th season in a row.
The Blackhawks will first face St. Louis, then face Edmonton in the preseason.
Thousands protest in Israel against PM
Thousands of Israelis have protested in several parts of the country against unemployment, corruption and the way Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is handling the coronavirus crisis.
The manifestations took place outside Netanyahu's private villa in the city of Caesarea, near his official residence, or in a park in Tel Aviv.
Protests have been held regularly in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv for several weeks.
Their participants are demanding the resignation of Netanyahu over a trial in which he is accused of corruption and fraud, as well as the government's handling of the next wave of the coronavirus epidemic.
"Bibi, go home," one demonstrator wrote on his banner, referring to Netanyahu's commonly known nickname, according to the AP.
"Everyone can see that the emperor has lost his clothes," another read.
The 70-year-old Netanyahu is the first prime minister of Israel to be tried in office.
He's been indicted on three counts of corruption, fraud and abuse of trust.
He rejects all allegations, calling them a witch hunt.
According to local media, the trial can take up to three years, with over 300 witnesses called.
The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has been confirmed in nearly 60,500 people in Israel, which has a population of about nine million.
A total of 455 people died in connection with the outbreak.
In March, the Israeli government introduced quarantine measures that helped reduce daily increases in infections.
But after a gradual easing of restrictions since the end of April, in particular, the numbers of those infected started to grow significantly again in late June.
Netanyahu's critics argue that the government has failed to adequately help businesses affected by quarantine measures, for example.
Protesters are also concerned that the government is issuing contradictory guidelines in places as part of the fight against the coronavirus.
The driver smashed his car into a tree and was killed.
The body had to be cut out of the wreckage by firefighters
The tragic accident occurred around 2300 hours at Neveklov on a narrow district leading from the Slapska Dam.
The driver apparently flew down into the woods at no small speed, smashing the car into a tree.
He died at the scene.
The body had to be recovered from the wreckage by firefighters, including cutting off the roof.
Officers are examining the circumstances surrounding the crash.
They ordered a forensic autopsy to determine, among other things, whether the man was driving under the influence of alcohol or any other addictive substance.
No more wasting and churning out one collection after another.
Pietro Filipi cancels discounts and bets on sustainability
Czech clothing brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and is embarking on a major change in strategy.
It cancels discounts and no longer wants to churn out one collection after another.
The fact that the fashion industry is among the biggest polluters of the environment is not news.
Billions of items of clothing end up in incinerators and landfills every year.
But the view of slow fashion, the often despised approach to dressing, has changed quite rapidly over the past few years.
About half of Pietro Filipi's goods were sold at full price.
The other half, which was sold at discounts, simply won't be bought.
The company doesn't want to churn out one collection after another and cheapen products below their cost of production at the end of each season.
Moreover, according to owner Michal Mičky, the days of new and old collections and the blind following of fast-changing fashion trends are gone.
"Most discount retailers are counting on the purchase of goods, so the full price includes a much higher margin.
So it's actually a bit of a scam," says Pietro Filipi owner Michal Mička.
Moreover, with its approach, the company also wants to boost local business.
"Each of our products is made of carefully selected quality fabrics and designed by local designers.
We emphasise that much of our collection is made up of so-called basic pieces - i.e. clothes that are timeless and timeless.
Globally, the segment of premium brands is typical in the absence of any discounts, the price of the product simply matches its quality and the discount is therefore not needed," Mička adds.
Giant graffiti features RAF airman Kurt Taussig
"The assignment was to create something for the anniversary of the end of the war.
And I thought of our fighter pilot who had fought in the ranks of the British Royal Air Force in the Second World War.
The city management liked the design," said Vacek, who finished his work after a fortnight of intensive production.
It consumed roughly 300 liters of paint and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplice-Shan.
He left town when he was 15 years old.
During the war, because of his Jewish ancestry, the Nazis dragged him to an internment camp where they held him for several weeks.
But he and his brother managed to avoid the concentration camp thanks to Nicholas Winton's organization.
In 1939, Taussig made it to Great Britain, where he volunteered to join the Royal Air Force (RAF), and eventually received pilot training in South Rhodesia and Palestine, Africa.
He became involved in combat operations in early 1945.
After the Velvet Revolution, he visited the Czech Republic and his native Teplice several times, which granted him honorary citizenship.
Forty-six-year-old Kamil Vacek, known by people in the street art business as Camo, has been working with spray cans in the Teplice streets for over 20 years.
The graffiti began on areas set aside for this purpose by then Mayor Jaroslav Kubera (ODS).
Storm Hanna has reached the coast of Texas
Hurricane Hanna reached the southwestern coast of the US state of Texas on Saturday afternoon, local time (before midnight GMT last night).
It hit the Texas island of Padre Island, roughly 24 kilometers north of the town of Port Mansfield, and weakened to a tropical storm as it moved over land.
However, according to meteorologists, it still poses a great danger to coastal residents.
It has brought with it strong winds and intense rainfall; along with localized flooding, the AP reports power outages and various material damage, including damaged ships.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott had already declared a state of natural disaster for 32 counties in southwest Texas on Saturday and advised people to evacuate voluntarily.
The strongest warnings were given to the people of the coastal strip between Port Mansfield and Mesquite Bay, but in all, the element is expected to hit an area of nearly 500 kilometers before gradually moving over northeastern Mexico.
"Although Hanna is now a tropical storm, heavy rain and wind, rising levels, dangerous surf and isolated tornadoes may pose a threat," the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) warned.
This morning, local time (mid-afternoon AEST), the storm was moving in the US-Mexico border area, accompanied by winds of 85 kilometres per hour.
Hanna on Saturday became the first hurricane of the season in the Atlantic region.
Winds of up to 145 kilometers per hour accompanied it over the Gulf of Mexico, but it gradually weakened to 112 kilometers per hour as it made landfall, releasing Hanna from the hurricane category again.
Authorities have urged local residents to wait out the storm at home, not forgetting sanitary precautions against the spread of the coronavirus.
Texas is one of the U.S. states most affected by the covide-19 pandemic.
In view of existing security measures and the need to maintain spacing, possible evacuations are also a major challenge.
Temporary shelters were opened in hotels, schools and gyms.
In Hidalgo County, Texas, one of the buildings was also adapted as a shelter for evacuees who tested positive for the coronavirus or were otherwise exposed to the disease.
Local authorities have urged all evacuees to take masks and disinfectant gels with them to the shelter if possible.
"It's not even close.
We expect catastrophic flooding," the AP quoted Chris Birchfield, who works for the National Weather Service (NWS) in Brownsville, as saying.
Forecasters say there could be up to 300 millimetres of rainfall in some places within a few hours, in some cases close to 500 millimetres, which, together with sea level rise, could inundate a number of coastal settlements.
Squire to lend general rank to Colonel Lipka
President Milos Zeman will bestow the rank of general on Colonel Pavel Lipka on Wednesday.
This is apparent from the Defense Department's review of expected events.
The reason for bestowing the rank of brigadier general is the August appointment of Lipka as deputy commander of the Alliance Multinational Division of the Northeast in Poland.
Lipka still acts as deputy commander of the Czech army's ground forces.
The promotion was proposed to Zeman at the end of June by the government.
From the beginning of August, Lipka will replace Brigadier General Karl Řehka as deputy commander of the multinational division of the northeast in Elblag, Poland, commanding Allied forward presence units in the territory of Poland and the Baltics.
In March, Rihka became director of the National Office for Cyber and Information Security (NÚKIB).
The government has suggested to the president that he lend Lipka the rank of brigadier general.
Under the Occupational Soldiers Act, a superior rank may be bestowed on a soldier for the duration of elected office or for the duration of a duty assignment which requires the bestowing of a superior rank.
The post of Deputy Commander of the Alliance Division is matched by the rank of general.
The soldier to whom the rank has been bestowed has the same rights and duties as if he had been appointed to that rank.
But he does not qualify for the salary adjustment that would correspond to the rank.
The conferral of rank lasts until the reason for which it was granted is extinguished.
"Colonel Lipka demonstrates high professional readiness and is a role model for subordinates.
He is significantly involved in carrying out the tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic, including cooperation with foreign partners and securing the military's participation in foreign operations," the Ministry of Defence said in June on the promotion proposal.
Wednesday's promotion will take place at 12:30 p.m. at Prague Castle, attended by Defence Minister Lubomír Metnar or Chief of Staff Aleš Opata.
EU countries have coronaviral standards for aviation
European Union countries have agreed common hygiene standards for air travel to help limit the spread of the new coronavirus.
German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer made the announcement.
Among the agreed standards is keeping a distance or wearing a veil on the aircraft and at the airport, but middle seats on planes will not have to remain unoccupied.
Reuters reported on this.
"I am pleased that my colleagues have accepted the German proposal for Europe and that we have been able to agree on these uniform standards," said Scheuer at the European Aviation Conference.
The German Transport Ministry then added that the agreement had been concluded by officials and that it had yet to be formally approved by ministers.
The agreed measures include a requirement to cover the mouth and nose of passengers from the age of six, to follow the recommended interval during security checks and check-in at the airport.
There must also be sufficient fresh air on aircraft and all information must be available in several languages.
The airline will also be able to occupy the middle seats.
The common rules agreed by the officials meet at least some of the requirements of the airlines.
Different standards caused confusion.
Arctic Spitsbergen set a temperature record, with a reading of almost 22 degrees
"A 41-year-old record has fallen in Longyearbyen," the Norwegian Meteorological Institute said on Twitter.
By early evening, the temperature there had risen to 21.7 degrees Celsius, breaking the 1979 record by 0.4 degrees, he added.
The roughly 2,000-square-mile Longyearbyen is the largest city on Sept., located about 1,300 kilometers from the North Pole.
Sepulchre heats up faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This highlights the dangers of warming other parts of the Arctic -⁠ from Alaska to Siberia, according to a report last year by the Norwegian Center for Climate Studies.
The average temperature in Spitsbergen has risen by three to five degrees since the 1970s, he says.
By 2100, it may have risen by as much as ten degrees, as long as the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere is not reduced.
Temperature rises can result in the melting of perpetually frozen ground on Sept., threatening the stability of many buildings, roads or airports and potentially causing more avalanches and landslides.
Climate warming is also threatening Arctic fauna, such as polar bears or seals, which depend on the ocean ice sheet.
Britons returning from Spain face mandatory two-week quarantine
The British Cabinet also urged citizens to avoid all unnecessary travel to mainland Spain due to the risk of covide-19 disease spreading.
The Canary and Balearic Islands are therefore not mentioned, however, even after returning from them, people still have to be isolated for two weeks.
The new rules come into force at midnight.
"Protecting public health is our absolute priority.
We have taken this decision to prevent the possible spread of the virus in Britain," British diplomacy said in its statement.
"We've always made it clear that if we needed to, we'd remove a country from the list of safe ones immediately," she added.
As the UK's Metro has noted, the latest announcement will hit thousands of Britons' travel plans.
In fact, Spain is one of the most popular holiday destinations.
Among other things, Britons are concerned about whether they will be paid sick leave if they have to end up in isolation for 14 days when they return from the holidays.
Neil Hunter of Sittingbourne, for example, had booked a ten-day holiday to Lanzarote, scheduled to leave on Tuesday.
They've booked the trip since December.
"We were supposed to go the whole family, my wife Amanda and daughter Bethany, but to be honest, after this announcement, I don't know what's going to happen.
I work as an engineer, and I don't think my employer will agree to quarantine me for two weeks when I return from vacation," Metro quoted Hunter as saying.
In the context of Spain, there are fears that the country is at the start of a second wave epidemic.
Over the past two days, there have been over 900 new infections every 24 hours.
Authorities in some areas are already tightening coronaviral measures, such as Catalonia trying to limit all nightlife and prevent people from gathering in large numbers.
The Czech Foreign Ministry has newly drawn attention to the increased risk of disease in Catalonia, Aragon, the Basque Country and the region of Madrid.
Dukovan power purchase model to be discussed by government
The government will discuss on Monday the model for the purchase of electricity from the planned new Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant block.
The bill foresees that if the feed-in tariff is higher than the price of power on the market, the difference will be paid by all consumers through tariffs.
In the latter case, where the feed-in tariff is lower than the market price, the impact on consumers will be the opposite.
Power is an unregulated part of the final price of electricity to customers.
Both Deputy Prime Minister and Industry Minister Karel Havlíček (for YES) and energy company ČEZ have previously said that a more likely option is that people will save money by building for electricity.
Analysts, on the other hand, point out that the long-term outlook for electricity prices on the markets is always uncertain, which has been demonstrated several times in the past.
The intention has been criticised by environmental organisations before.
"The purchase price may be both below and above the market price of power.
Thus, the final impact at the time of application of the rule can be both negative and positive.
The impact will be distributed among customers according to the size of the circuit breaker - at lower consumption or according to electricity consumption - at higher electricity consumption," the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MPO) said in a background paper on the material.
In May, Havlicek said he anticipated that the wholesale price of electricity would rise and the people on the Dukovan site would make a profit.
Otherwise, the impact will be in the tens of crowns a year per family, which he says is far less than people pay in electricity bills each year to support so-called supported resources.
He has previously estimated that the purchase price could be between 50 and 60 euros (about 1320 to 1600 CZK) per megawatt hour (MWh).
The material submitted contains no proposal for the amount, to be included in the purchase contract.
The price of electricity on the Prague Energy Exchange for 2021, which traders will now stock up on, is currently around €45 (about $1190) per MWh.
"With the difference between the feed-in price and the market price of power of ten euros, the supplement of an average household consuming 3.3 MWh per year - it may correspond to a household of four, equipped by default with electrical appliances including an electric hob and an oven, but which does not use electricity for heating and heating hot water - less than 100 CZK/year," the MPO wrote in submissions to the government.
"We live in extremely turbulent times.
The coronavirus pandemic has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term prediction of market prices to be a downright speculative matter," Tomáš Voltr, managing director of the Energy financial group, previously told TIME.
The proposed law envisages that the buyout would be carried out by the MPO, or by a legal entity entrusted by it, owned by the State at a predetermined price.
The investor-to-state contract, guaranteeing the terms of the power purchase, would be for a minimum of 30 years, with a possible extension of 10 years, even repeated, but the longest until the end of the low-carbon generation operation.
It defines a low-carbon generation plant as a nuclear reactor power plant connected to an electricity system with installed capacity of a minimum electric power output of 100 megawatts (MW) after 2030.
Havlicek previously stated that the new Dukovan block should have a power output of 1200 MW and produce nine terawatt-hours of electricity per year, which would correspond to a tenth of the expected Czech consumption.
The block should be operational in 2036.
The funding model for the new Dukat bloc was approved by the government on Monday.
The facility should be financed by the state at the time of construction without interest, with a 2 per cent interest on the operation.
The opposition disagrees with the funding model, and is also concerned about the possibility of Dukovany being built by Russian or Chinese companies.
The state should contribute 70 percent of the construction.
The remainder should be paid by CEZ, which will also cover any additional costs.
CEZ CEO Daniel Beneš told ČTK in May that the expected sum for building the block in current prices is roughly €6 billion (approximately $162 billion).
Contracts between the state and CEZ for the construction of the new Dukovan block will be signed on Tuesday.
The Ministry of Regional Development has withdrawn a $2 billion piece on support for tourism in the media
The material, according to which the Ministry of Regional Development (MMR) planned to spend CZK 2 billion on advertising holidays in the Czech Republic in the media, on the Internet and on billboards, was withdrawn from the comment procedure by the Office.
Minister Klára Dostálová (for YES) told SeznamZprávy.cz that the material was still being worked on.
The document in eKlep (the electronic library of the legislative process) was highlighted on Friday by Zdopravy.cz.
The Ministry justified the plan by the drop in tourism due to the coronavirus.
During the coronaviral crisis, both income and media plummeted.
The proposal has drawn criticism from the opposition and from tourism representatives.
According to the proposal, which is now available to view on the website hlidacstatu.cz, MMR planned to give money through the state tourism promotion agency CzechTourism to advertise on television, radio, the press, the internet, billboards or areas in railway stations.
The biggest share of the money, CZK 700 million, would be given to television.
Most would go to private broadcasters Nova and Prima.
Printed newspapers and weeklies would get 400 million, and equal shares would give MMR for PR articles, advertising banners, and videos on websites.
Radio stations would receive $350 million for the media campaign, most of it again private stations.
The other 150 million would be used for outdoor advertising on billboards, LED screens and areas at stations or on the subway.
The campaign to promote tourism in the Czech Republic was due to start in mid-August and last for a year.
"The material is still being worked on, certainly not yet in the form that should be presented," Dostálová told the ListReports website without further details.
The material has been criticised by the opposition, according to TOP 09 leader Margarita Pekarová Adama, advertising would benefit the media from the trust funds of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO).
"I firmly believe that this spectacular disdain will take a blow in the fall election," she wrote in a Twitter post.
Dostálová denies that this is really about helping the crisis-hit media.
"It could also be a coincidence, I don't know anything about media support," she told Daily N on Friday.
According to it, the budget of two billion is indicative.
"Of course, we're still counting, it could be less or more.
It's work material," she added.
The Save Tourism initiative makes no sense for a media campaign to promote indigenous tourism.
"We want two billion for tourism companies, not a useless advertising campaign," said Tomáš Barčík, the initiative's chairman, on Sunday.
If the two billion crowns are in the state budget, they should go to companies, not the media, the initiative says in an open letter to the government.
The broth of life, the cock of beer and death like a blade of grass
Also posthumous is the third album called A Death is a blade of grass by the Brno poet, tireless organizer of cultural activities and publisher Jaroslav Erik Frič, who also left a year ago, on May 24.
In Fritsch's discography he is the fifth entry, and, as with previous titles, the main emphasis is on Fritsch's poetry, of which he is himself an excellent performer.
Fritz, class of 1949, was understandably influenced by American beat generation, but he shepherded that inspiration through his own, personally delivered experiences, as well as very visceral expressions of faith.
Of course, he was a far cry from any agitation when he spoke or wrote about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, unaggressive, completely tolerant.
I can think of Bohuslav Reynek in that context (as opposed to Jan Zahradnicek, for example), masters forgive.
Frich's album offers recordings of author readings from 2006, but also performances with musicians who have always accompanied it with great sensitivity, whether it was the violonist Josef Key or Honza Bartoň and Vítězslav Holata.
I will help myself - gladly - in the words of the Ostrava poet Petr Hruška about Fritsch's long poetic compositions.
"There was a proud and unending bitterness," writes Pear, "about the state of our world threatened with extinction.
As the world sinks more and more into numbed consuming futility and avarice, it recedes further and further from what its soul was made of - the secrets of faith, humility, and human closeness.
There was a stirring of who knew that the values for which he was made were of little interest, but who also knew that they could not be renounced simply because of a general lack of interest.
The poems were a reminder that you might have to lose everything expensive, but it's not immaterial how you lose it.
If he sells himself to general decline, resigns skeptically, shuts up fearfully, or stays to the last in a calm and proud insistence on what he believes and loves."
Paroubek is not my advisor, Hamacek said
Former Prime Minister and Tory leader Jiří Paroubek is not a paid adviser to social democracy.
The party's chairman and interior minister, Jan Hamacek, only communicates with him and reads his opinions and articles.
Hamacek said on the Prime Partie TV show today.
That Paroubek should be Hamáček's advisor was reported on Friday by SeznamZprávy.cz.
"We text from time to time, he sends me material from time to time, and I read it," Hamacek said today.
He added that it was not, however, an official and paid cooperation.
The Social Democratic Party does not have the resources to waste it on similar purposes.
"Reading his opinion from time to time, there's a lot of people like that," he said.
In a subsequent discussion with ODS member Jana Černochová, the minister said that many members of the ODS still "openly listen to the views of Václav Klaus."
It is all right, he says, because he is an experienced politician and a former party chairman, which is also the case with Paroubek.
He called the fact that the media was making an issue of it a sign of this year's cucumber season.
On Friday, SeznamZprávy.cz wrote that Paroubek performed the role of Hamáčkov's unofficial consultant.
He also wrote that the former head of his cell, Petr Benda, who is affiliated with Paroubek and served as vice-chairman of his party, LEV 21, was headed for the party's fourth place in the oyster region.
Hamacek said today that he would not comment on the composition of the ticket until it was ready and approved.
Duplantis has a mile lead, it's a kick in the ass, the Swede's challenger laments
The 22-year-old American pole-vaulter has the ambition and potential to be one of the new ruler's most serious competitors.
He already knows what it's like to beat Duplantis, two years younger, last year at an NCAA University Association meeting.
"We had a battle the year before, then he won and I was second, then we switched.
It was a very good fight on both counts," Nilsen says, having secured victory with 5.95 meters.
But Duplantis has since shot up steeply, and is currently alone in the highest tightrope spheres.
He became a world record holder at just 20 years old, breaking the 6.17-metre barrier at Toruni on 8 February this year, adding an inch in Glasgow a week later.
"He was jumping 20 feet when he was 18, when he graduated from high school," his peer Nilsen recalls to the World Athletics website.
"It was clear that once he grew from a boy into a man, all his potential and talent would increase tenfold.
Twenty years is a pretty good age to jump a world record," he believes.
Though Nilsen's list of accomplishments is considerably thinner than the one Duplantis boasts, the American sets similar goals.
He has hinted at his options so far at NCAA races, which he has won regularly, improving his indoor personal record to 5.93 m at one this past February. He won a gold medal at the Pan-American Games in Lima last August, having already fought his way into the American quest for the world championship in 2017, where he finished 13th.
The closest milestone for him is his first taste of the Diamond League.
"It's definitely my priority to get to the professional circuit and race as much as possible in the Diamond League, because that's where you can make a name for yourself," he realizes.
"If you can succeed at this level, no doubt you can do the same at events like the Olympic Games, World Championships or Pan-American Games."
But because of the pandemic, those high holidays are being postponed, giving Nilsen and the other pole-sitters time to improve.
But will it be enough to catch up with Duplantis, who can easily turn the race under five rings into a mere contest for silver?
"Everybody's trying to catch up with him, but I don't think that's going to be possible anytime soon," Nilsen muses.
"The kid's been jumping for 16 years and he's got a mile on everyone else in training."
And by the time Tokyo 2021 starts, he'll want to increase it.
A woman has spent hundreds of thousands of her disabled son's disability pension.
She is awaiting trial
The money a 33-year-old man receives from the state as an invalidity pension is intended primarily to improve his quality of life.
The embezzlement charge carries a sentence of up to eight years in prison.
Because of ill health, the court deprived the sick man of his liberty, and appointed his mother a guardian to manage his son's money, among other things.
"The woman used part of her son's disability pension funds for her needs between mid-November 2013 and this January, depriving him of 440,000 kroner," said police spokeswoman Dana Ladman, making it worse for the accused woman that she had a special duty as a guardian to defend the interests of the injured party.
The woman, as instructed by the court, had set up an account for her son, but had his pension sent to her account.
"After paying the costs of her son's stay in a medical facility and paying for necessary medication, she used the remaining funds to purchase a vehicle, electrical appliances and to run the household," according to the indictment.
That she could not use her son's money for her own use, the woman admitted.
But she defended herself by helping out with the family expenses.
"We've had trouble with our income to tighten up the household.
We've never bought anything over the top.
It was always for things that my son would approve of buying.
I thought of it as family money.
I had no idea I was committing a crime," the woman explained to the cops.
She promised to return the money to her son.
North America has been settled for 30,000 years, scientists say after finding tools
Findings from the Chiquihuite cave in the Mexican state of Zacatecas include 1930 limestone tools, including fine blades that may have been used to slice meat, and pointed objects that may have served as spear points or spears.
Scientists have discovered that the oldest of the tools dates from 33,000 to 31,000 years ago.
"There are only a few products of this age.
But they are here," said archaeologist Ciprian Ardelean of the University of Zacatecas and lead author of one of two studies published on the subject in the journal Nature.
The youngest instruments reach 12,500 years old.
According to experts, the Chiquihuite cave, located at high altitude, has been inhabited by humans for a long 20,000 years.
Until now, a widely accepted theory was that the first Homo sapiens crossed a land bridge from what is now Russia to Alaska some 13,500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including unique spear points used to kill mammoths and other prehistoric animals, has shown that this Clovis culture subsequently spread throughout much of North America.
But this model has been torn in recent decades by the discovery of several ancient settlements that were two to three thousand years older.
In a second study published in the journal Nature, 42 different sites across North America are reported to demonstrate human presence on the continent as early as 26,000 to 19,000 years ago.
Scientists believe a small number of people may have arrived on the North American mainland earlier than previously believed.
Some could have made it to America by boat.
"Clearly, humans were in America long before the development of the so-called clovis culture," said anthropologist Ruth Gruhn of the University of Alberta, Canada, regarding the new findings.
Interest in airline tickets has so far fulfilled an optimistic scenario, retailers say.
Prices are also gradually being lowered
Ticket sales in the Czech Republic are growing every week.
While interest is still about half what it was last summer, demand is growing by up to 20 per cent every week.
Post-crisis developments are thus fulfilling the most optimistic scenarios, according to vendors.
Air fares are also gradually coming down.
The most sought-after destinations, according to the vendors, are mainly southern European countries.
According to Kiwi.com, Spain, Italy and Greece are leading.
Flights to Croatia's Split are the biggest sellers at Letuška.cz.
Among other countries, the UK is the most sought-after, but it has always been one of the busiest destinations.
The average ticket price is also decreasing.
At the portal Letuška.cz, it was around 6250 crowns around the middle of the month, 3,000 crowns less year-on-year.
This is mainly due to an increase in demand for European destinations, which now account for about 85 per cent of sales.
But prices to some European places, such as Spain or Italy, have also fallen by about a fifth in recent weeks.
The crisis has also affected the behaviour of customers, who are now buying tickets much less early than before because they are concerned about the further development of the coronaviral situation.
According to Kiwi.com's earlier information, the time to buy a ticket before departure has decreased by around ten days year-on-year.
"This confirms a future trend where people will order tickets much less ahead of time, will require more flexibility, take less risk," said Michael Shiner, Kiwi.com's Vice President of Products.
Currently, the average booking time before departure is 21 days.
As sales increase, the number of renewed flights from the Czech Republic also increases.
There are currently scheduled flights to more than 60 destinations at Prague Airport.
About half the destinations compared to last summer's season.
The grand finale tonight!
Watch the darts battle live on Nova Sport
The second most prestigious tournament in the PDC has reached the grand final.
It features the experienced 46-year-old Scottish dart player Gary Anderson and the surprise of the tournament, 26-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh.
Gary Anderson knocked out Justin Pip in the first round, then ran into his next-door neighbor on the chart.
But he handled James Wade, too, and in the quarterfinals, he had a fitting fight with Simon Whitlock, who had previously sent home the world's No.
"The Flying Scotsman" had a close call in the semifinals, facing Michael Smith.
But he escaped the gravedigger at the last minute, dominated in overtime and, after an 18-16 result, earned a place in the final of a tournament he had already mastered in 2018 when he defeated Mensur Suljovic 21-19 in a stunning battle.
World Matchplay's biggest surprise is Dimitri van den Bergh.
The Belgian talent is enjoying the tournament and it is perhaps the knowledge that he has nothing to lose that has helped him to play on an absolutely fantastic wave.
The 26-year-old darts champion first surprisingly knocked out world number six Nathan Aspinall, outfought Joe Cullen in a dramatic battle, and took on Adrian Lewis in the quarter-finals after a rocky start.
The big check was the semifinals.
Glen Durrant showed his strength at the outset, but the calmly playing Belgian then took an excellent series lead, which he then more or less kept to the end.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in high scoring, which produced the occasional uncertainty on doubles.
Coronavirus cases have increased since at least the beginning of the week, reducing the number of tests
Since early March, when the new coronavirus was first discovered in the Czech Republic, 15,212 people have been shown to have contracted it.
Nearly 9,600 of them have been cured, 368 patients have died.
At present, 5,254 people are sick.
This is apparent from data on the Ministry of Health website.
The daily number of newly confirmed cases this week has exceeded two hundred four times in a row.
The peak was Friday's 281 cases.
On Thursday, 235 tested positive, 246 the day before, and 206 on Tuesday.
In the first working day of this week, there were 169 infections.
In the Czech Republic, 9,590 people have been cured of covide-19, or 63 percent of all those infected so far.
For most, the disease had a mild course.
There are 151 people with the coronavirus in the hospital, according to the latest Health Ministry data, 19 of whom are rated as serious by doctors.
There are several outbreaks of covid-19 disease in the Czech Republic.
Karvinsko still has the most infections in the last seven days, per 100,000 people, at almost 59.
It is followed by the district of Jihlava with 56 and Frýdecko-Místecko with 36 infections per 100,000 inhabitants in the last week.
Due to the increased number of infections, new measures against the spread of the coronavirus have been in place in the Czech Republic since Saturday.
People have to wear masks at internal mass events of over 100 people, these are cultural and sporting events, but also weddings and funerals inside buildings.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be halved from the current 1,000 people.
In the world, the number of people proven to have contracted the new coronavirus has already passed the 16 million mark.
This was reported by Johns Hopkins University of America, which monitors the development of the pandemic globally.
The record of victims who died with covid-19 is close to 645,000, according to this source.
The latest million infected were added to the statistics in just three days; the 15 million mark fell on July 22.
In recent days, the United States, which already registers over 4.1 million infected, Brazil, with 2.4 million, and India, where authorities say nearly 1.4 million people have been infected, accounted for the largest share of the rapid increase in the number of cases.
The infected are now increasing at a record rate.
The World Health Organization reported this week that more than 284,000 new cases worldwide had been added between Thursday and Friday, the highest daily record since the pandemic began.
These developments can be attributed to the peak of the spread of the disease in populous states such as the US, Brazil or India, according to Reuters, but the number of new cases has grown in nearly 40 countries around the world over the past week.
This applies, for example, to Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium or Israel.
The contagion has occurred in nearly every country in the world, with the DPRK officially announcing the first case today.
Household air is up to five times worse than outdoor air.
Air fresheners and deodorants are bad for health
Health is threatened not only by poor air quality in outdoor spaces, but also at home.
Israeli human health expert Carol Abraham pointed this out, as quoted by The Jerusalem Post.
According to Abraham, who helped create Israel's Ministry of Environmental Protection, household pollutants need to be targeted now, when many people spend more time working from home.
Abraham referred to research by the US Environmental Agency (EPA) which found that the quality of domestic air is up to five times worse than outdoor air.
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 3.8 million people die prematurely each year because of poor air quality in their homes.
"Because of the coronavirus outbreak, which has forced many to work from home, people are having to spend more hours in homes than before, so it's time to focus on household air quality," Abraham said.
In Israel, she says, the quality of "home air" is hardly ever addressed.
The things that a person normally comes into contact with - paints, air fresheners, disinfectants, deodorants or pesticides - can be dangerous.
"Clothing we regularly wear to the cleaners also gives off poison gas," Abraham said.
Children, elderly members of the household and people with respiratory problems are most at risk, she says.
Other healthy individuals may also experience problems such as headaches, fainting, nasal irritation, nosebleeds, vomiting or skin allergies.
Long-term exposure to unhealthy substances can damage internal organs and the central nervous system.
Not all the pollutants come from objects inside homes, but the material from which houses are built may also be a source.
Quiz on Vaclav Havel: How long he spent in prison and what made him write Charter 77
Fuenlabrada lost its chance to make the top Spanish football league because of a coronaviral outbreak in the team.
The competition had cancelled the previously postponed duel of the final round of the second leg, in which the team could have secured a place in the play-offs.
Fuenlabrada reported 12 more infected people on Saturday, bringing the total number of positive tests for covide-19 at the club to 28.
Because of the contagion in the team, Monday's contest against La Coruni was postponed, in which a point was enough for Fuenlabrada to reach the playoffs.
The competition officials said today that they have definitively called off the duel against La Coruni due to force majeure due to the fact that it was never played again.
Fuenlabrada accepted the decision.
La Coruña, on the other hand, is rebelling against not playing the match.
In the end, even a victory over Fuenlabrada would not have been enough to save her, given the results of their rivals, but he considers it unfair that the final round did not, by custom, take place complete in a unified term.
The management of what was once an elite Spanish club is facing a trial over their fall to the third tier.
The first two teams in the table, Huesca and Cadiz, are assured of advancement among the elite.
Zaragoza, Almería, Girona and Elche will meet in the play-off for the remaining third successive place.
Karel Gott didn't like Vaclav Havel?!
Daughter Dominic revealed it
"Dad didn't have to do it for many years," Gott Dominic's eldest daughter revealed to Aha! that the Master couldn't come up with Havel's name, and whenever it came up Karl was always annoyed.
It's hard to say what they did to each other, but according to Dominica, the feud began sometime in the mid-1990s.
"My dad said in a post-revolution article that he had it easier than he did.
That Havel might have been writing in a drawer in the Dark Ages, but if he had somehow resisted, then his career was over," Gott says.
But then he adds that, in the end, the Czech greats did find their way to each other.
"I know he couldn't have heard the word Havel until his 60th birthday.
But then the president congratulated him with a birthday letter, and suddenly Dad's relationship with him began to change," Dominika recalls.
Indeed, ten years later, Gott invited the then former president to celebrate his 70th birthday at the Ambassador Hotel in Wenceslas Square.
"And that's where the new era of their relationship began, because Dad would then regularly invite Mr Havel home to his place on Bertram," said the blonde, whose father had died last October.
Nightingale was also said to be annoyed that he had never received a state medal from Václav Havel.
But he did get it in 2009, though it was already at the hands of his successor as Václav Klaus (79).
He will receive further honours in memoriam, as current President Milos Zeman (75) is to award him the Order of the White Lion in honour of his memory.
Heat threatens in Czech Republic from Tuesday, meteorologists warn of fires
Weather warnings for high temperatures are in place for Tuesday afternoon for the whole of Bohemia, except for the Karlovy Vary region, as well as for southern and central Moravia.
"Exceptionally, temperatures can exceed 34 degrees Celsius, especially in central Bohemia," they state.
People are advised to follow a drinking regimen in the heat and to reduce exercise in the midday and afternoon hours.
Due to the warm weather with minimal rainfall, there will be a risk of fires starting Tuesday morning.
Windy weather could contribute to their rapid spread.
Meteorologists' fire risk warnings cover central Bohemia, including Prague, Liberec, Ústí, Karlovy Vary and Plzeň regions.
Fire warnings will be in effect until further notice.
"We do not expect more significant rainfall, which would mitigate the danger, in the northwest and west of Bohemia until at least the end of the week," says ČHMÚ.
The Prague Municipality responded to the warnings of meteorologists by banning the lighting of fires at risk sites, which is due to apply from Tuesday.
People in the capital will not be allowed to start open fires in parks, gardens or forests, for example, up to 50 metres from the edge of the forest floor.
Smoking and the use of pyrotechnics are also prohibited in these areas.
The measure will be valid until further notice, Prague Municipality spokesman Vít Hofman informed.
